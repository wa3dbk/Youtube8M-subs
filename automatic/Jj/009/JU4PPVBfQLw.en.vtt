00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.940
 hello everyone with you crazy ted and welcome 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.350
 to the new part of Mine Craft 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.049
 mechanisms today i'll show you 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.670
 automatic farm watermelons and so and so 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.680
 by pressing the button we 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.710
 accordingly all the watermelons pumpkin 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.349
 get off and get here in this little chest 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.289
 let me show you this mechanism right away 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.689
 and tell a little bit as you can see here 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.640
 stupid we have or beads because 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.730
 opened specifically to show you 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.030
 let's take a look at the pros 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.860
 plus 1 is one part of that 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.640
 mechanism that is, it takes only 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.110
 only 7 blocks and two blocks ie 7 by 2 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.120
 but for another 2 blocks the height is another plus 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.690
 is that from the back 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.030
 the mechanism looks absolutely say so 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.400
 clean then there are no traces of mechanisms 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.650
 nowhere piston nor piece of redstone nor 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.290
 one red torch a la absolutely not 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.080
 it is evident that it can even be somehow under 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.430
 wall so to speak do at home for example 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.430
 and no one will know what we have here 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.070
 the farm is another most important thing on plus it 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.720
 what can it really do 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.040
 infinite height that is, he can at least 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.040
 how many 1000 blocks 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.230
 height and also at least how many blocks length 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.820
 that is, you can go there even though I don't know 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.850
 how much do you need in general 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.460
 put it and as you can see it is wide 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.820
 can also be made even wider and wider and 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.950
 wider in general, that's actually all 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.140
 the mechanism you all see it perfectly you 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 everyone can make it even closer 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.830
 put also all of you fine 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.010
 worked but 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.190
 what else can I say in general here with 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.280
 such a small section of this 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.600
 mechanism falls literally mark or 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.060
 maybe a little more 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.920
 so basically that is pieces from 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.350
 this mechanism does not take off at all lead 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.040
 not all fall funnels and fall 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.690
 Naturally in the trunk in general, I 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.550
 I think that's all you can for a long time 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.990
 To tell about this mechanism so much 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.050
 what let's move on to his 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.460
 building so guys built it just 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.470
 elementary very simple very quickly in 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.959
 Generally put so in the red torch gave 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.050
 this unit is another red torch 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.620
 block and another red torch will do 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.380
 probably even 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.890
 2 blocks high so he will immediately show 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.160
 like a bud 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.959
 even higher rises throughout the system then 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.110
 there is such a way put a pillar of 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.740
 of these torches further here is the usual piston 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.160
 also here is the usual piston respectively 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.570
 here we put the blocks in the same way 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.360
 need to put a block here and 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.090
 here we should be standing 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.110
 land we need to be that there's 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.830
 from this part we put the earth 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.160
 here they put me a block like this 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.820
 already water is also and if we will 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.540
 raise the stage will be visible 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.570
 equally here already stand above the water 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.660
 the light tube is now plowing our 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.870
 land sprout can be done immediately 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.440
 big so that ours grow faster 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.930
 watermelons 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.230
 Well, in principle, all that is there already 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.410
 is a wall here and put 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.320
 funnel let's take funnel 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.970
 so here we put it there 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.060
 there will be such a number 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.310
 funnels one to another and respectively 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:43.330
 they will already enter the funnel with which 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.100
 watermelon will fall all so 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.820
 and he has all these but somewhere here already 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.970
 will be stuck and so I you 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.230
 telling let's build further 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.180
 Now we put here the usual also piston 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.000
 that is, as you see nothing at all 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.710
 absolutely no complicated will be again 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.810
 We put our here these two pieces of land 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.730
 a piece of land 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.760
 also still a light-stone here with turns 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.820
 it's not let's better block first on 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.630
 portosa because with signs 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:24.490
 so that we have nothing complicated here 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:27.690
 now again we roll the ground abrasions 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.690
 watermelons and 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.600
 we do the wall case accordingly 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.729
 so here is the whole mechanism with reverse 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.340
 sides of course you can close it 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.080
 as blocks so that in the first place we have nothing 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.139
 did not fall well, and secondly, as I have 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.229
 said that you are all very beautiful 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.830
 It looked like this 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.300
 and all 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.580
 accordingly if there will be 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.120
 be a watermelon let's take an example 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.350
 you just take a couple here and so 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.430
 let's put the system down very simply 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:08.440
 take it done now just for example 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.870
 I'll show you so take redstone 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.259
 take a button that is not necessarily 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.539
 use the lever can be just from the button 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:20.740
 it's all done here and so we spend 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:23.410
 signal we press watermelon stray 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.930
 fall into the funnel and it turns out all in 1 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.180
 thousand in one place well, just one 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.520
 funnel to another so that's why you can 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.940
 put here one funnel a tear and 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.740
 all the watermelon slices fall exactly at her 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.840
 in general, that's the whole mechanism guys 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.110
 thank you so much for watching with you 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.060
 there was a crisis and tv subscribe to my 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.909
 channel put comments comment call me 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.130
 your friends and just wait for the new part 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.130
 all good bye see you all
