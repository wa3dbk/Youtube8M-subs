00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
film you're gonna see that there's a lot

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.149 
film you're gonna see that there's a lot
of<00:02:30.379> things<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.620> we're<00:02:30.709> gonna<00:02:30.799> deal<00:02:31.010> with

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
of things that we're gonna deal with

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.850 
of things that we're gonna deal with
that<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.400> had<00:02:31.549> no<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.720> know<00:02:32.840> no<00:02:33.079> idea<00:02:33.290> and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
that we had no you know no idea and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.319 
that we had no you know no idea and
we're<00:02:34.099> in<00:02:34.250> over<00:02:34.400> our<00:02:34.549> heads<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.120> that's<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
we're in over our heads so that's the

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.309 
we're in over our heads so that's the
thing<00:02:35.450> about<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.659> you<00:02:35.780> want<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.019> people<00:02:36.230> in

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
thing about it you want to see people in

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.380 
thing about it you want to see people in
a<00:02:36.379> vulnerable<00:02:36.739> situation<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.519> I<00:02:37.940> guess

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
a vulnerable situation and I guess

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.210 
a vulnerable situation and I guess
ultimately<00:02:39.290> that's<00:02:39.739> what<00:02:39.980> makes<00:02:40.129> it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
ultimately that's what makes it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.429 
ultimately that's what makes it
appealing<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.879> drama<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.840> all<00:02:42.019> we're

locations the characters if you talk
about<00:05:18.979> suspending<00:05:19.370> disbelief<00:05:19.400> but<00:05:19.909> it's<00:05:20.029> an

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
about suspending disbelief but it's an

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.179 
about suspending disbelief but it's an
audience<00:05:20.360> we<00:05:20.870> -<00:05:21.050> as<00:05:21.199> actors<00:05:21.529> it's<00:05:21.919> a<00:05:21.979> little

in<00:05:25.219> the<00:05:25.580> future<00:05:25.909> everything's<00:05:26.690> different

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
in the future everything's different

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.330 
in the future everything's different
there's<00:05:27.379> nothing<00:05:27.650> I<00:05:27.710> have<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:27.949> common<00:05:28.099> with

there's nothing I have in common with
this<00:05:28.400> guy<00:05:28.490> so<00:05:29.090> we<00:05:29.240> will<00:05:29.389> have<00:05:29.479> to<00:05:29.569> submit<00:05:29.690> not

this guy so we will have to submit not

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.089 
this guy so we will have to submit not
just<00:05:30.020> believing<00:05:30.259> we<00:05:30.319> have<00:05:30.409> to<00:05:30.469> get<00:05:30.590> our<00:05:30.710> minds

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
just believing we have to get our minds

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.709 
just believing we have to get our minds
wrapped<00:05:31.219> around<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.669> POV<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.210> what's<00:05:32.599> at

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
wrapped around the POV and what's at

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.360 
wrapped around the POV and what's at
stake<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.110> human<00:05:33.469> the<00:05:33.650> human<00:05:33.949> you<00:05:34.219> know

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
stake the human the human you know

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.369 
stake the human the human you know
emotion<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.240> what<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.659> what<00:05:35.690> what's

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
emotion and what and what what's

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.959 
emotion and what and what what's
important<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:36.949> so<00:05:37.310> I<00:05:37.339> think<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.669> think<00:05:37.729> when

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
important and so I think I think when

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.790 
important and so I think I think when
you<00:05:38.029> see<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.330> film<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.990> think<00:05:39.110> you'll<00:05:39.469> see<00:05:39.650> that

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
you see the film I think you'll see that

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.439 
you see the film I think you'll see that
ultimately<00:05:40.490> you're<00:05:40.639> born<00:05:40.789> it<00:05:40.909> when<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:41.240> boil

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
ultimately you're born it when you boil

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.059 
ultimately you're born it when you boil
it<00:05:41.509> down<00:05:41.569> and<00:05:41.990> I<00:05:42.169> think<00:05:42.379> over<00:05:42.589> the<00:05:42.680> film<00:05:42.889> the

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
it down and I think over the film the

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.529 
it down and I think over the film the
process<00:05:43.400> of<00:05:43.520> film<00:05:43.699> you<00:05:43.849> will<00:05:44.029> see<00:05:44.180> us<00:05:44.240> boiled

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
process of film you will see us boiled

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.089 
process of film you will see us boiled
down<00:05:44.659> you'll<00:05:45.080> see<00:05:45.199> just<00:05:45.319> ripped<00:05:45.529> away<00:05:45.650> and

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
down you'll see just ripped away and

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.369 
down you'll see just ripped away and
you'll<00:05:46.190> see<00:05:46.370> us<00:05:46.460> at<00:05:46.639> our<00:05:46.699> most<00:05:47.690> vulnerable<00:05:47.960> and

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
you'll see us at our most vulnerable and

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:49.329 
you'll see us at our most vulnerable and
I<00:05:48.500> think<00:05:48.680> also<00:05:48.860> believe<00:05:49.069> the<00:05:49.129> human

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:49.339 
I think also believe the human

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:50.409 
I think also believe the human
connections<00:05:49.639> what's<00:05:49.789> gonna<00:05:49.879> bring<00:05:50.089> the<00:05:50.210> fans

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
connections what's gonna bring the fans

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:51.760 
connections what's gonna bring the fans
in<00:05:50.629> and<00:05:50.750> ultimately<00:05:51.020> once<00:05:51.500> they<00:05:51.620> get

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
in and ultimately once they get

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.769 
in and ultimately once they get
connected<00:05:52.250> again<00:05:52.339> we'll<00:05:53.060> release<00:05:53.509> them<00:05:53.690> back

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
connected again we'll release them back

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.629 
connected again we'll release them back
into<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.169> gaming<00:05:54.620> world<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:55.099> we'll<00:05:55.370> see<00:05:55.520> the

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
into the gaming world and we'll see the

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.680 
into the gaming world and we'll see the
emotional<00:05:55.909> connection<00:05:56.270> that's<00:05:56.419> gonna<00:05:56.539> be<00:05:56.659> a

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
emotional connection that's gonna be a

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.260 
emotional connection that's gonna be a
payoff<00:05:56.870> for<00:05:57.139> us<00:05:57.289> you<00:05:57.800> know<00:06:00.310> very<00:06:01.310> cool<00:06:01.580> so

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
payoff for us you know very cool so

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.459 
payoff for us you know very cool so
that's<00:06:02.539> and<00:06:02.839> that's<00:06:02.900> one<00:06:03.110> of<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.229> things<00:06:03.379> that

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
that's and that's one of the things that

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.800 
that's and that's one of the things that
I<00:06:03.529> think<00:06:03.589> Halo<00:06:04.039> 4<00:06:04.370> did<00:06:04.669> very<00:06:04.879> well<00:06:04.940> was<00:06:05.240> sort<00:06:05.750> of

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
I think Halo 4 did very well was sort of

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.510 
I think Halo 4 did very well was sort of
created<00:06:06.139> that<00:06:06.229> emotional<00:06:06.680> connection<00:06:06.710> you

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
created that emotional connection you

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.430 
created that emotional connection you
know<00:06:07.639> in<00:06:07.729> the<00:06:07.819> past<00:06:08.029> you're<00:06:08.240> this<00:06:08.389> tall<00:06:08.659> super

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
know in the past you're this tall super

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.589 
know in the past you're this tall super
soldier<00:06:09.979> and<00:06:10.129> that's<00:06:10.250> fun<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:11.300> play<00:06:11.449> in<00:06:11.479> a

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
soldier and that's fun to play in a

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.119 
soldier and that's fun to play in a
videogame<00:06:11.870> it's<00:06:12.139> a<00:06:12.199> little<00:06:12.379> alienating<00:06:12.979> you

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:13.129 
videogame it's a little alienating you

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:15.369 
videogame it's a little alienating you
know<00:06:13.219> so<00:06:13.490> I<00:06:13.520> think<00:06:13.779> 343<00:06:14.779> industries<00:06:15.169> and<00:06:15.319> the

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:16.869 
know so I think 343 industries and the
creative<00:06:15.680> teams<00:06:15.889> behind<00:06:16.250> this<00:06:16.339> had<00:06:16.490> done<00:06:16.849> a

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:16.879 
creative teams behind this had done a

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.070 
creative teams behind this had done a
great<00:06:17.029> job<00:06:17.120> so<00:06:17.449> far<00:06:17.479> and<00:06:17.779> certainly

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
great job so far and certainly

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.159 
great job so far and certainly
