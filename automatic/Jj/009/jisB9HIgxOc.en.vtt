software<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:17.070> first<00:00:17.310> thing<00:00:17.490> we're<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.820> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
software the first thing we're going to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.359 
software the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.210> go<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> file<00:00:18.930> open<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.560> go<00:00:20.100> out<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
do is go to file open and go out and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.810 
do is go to file open and go out and
browse<00:00:20.640> for<00:00:21.090> an<00:00:21.240> STL<00:00:21.720> file<00:00:22.430> when<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> part

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
browse for an STL file when this part

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
browse for an STL file when this part
comes<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.390> may<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.260> default

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
comes in we may not like the default

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.009 
comes in we may not like the default
orientation<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.730> we're<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> look<00:00:27.390> at

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
orientation so we're going to look at

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.529 
orientation so we're going to look at
ways<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> change<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.460> orientation<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.390> our

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
ways to change the orientation of our

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.049 
ways to change the orientation of our
part<00:00:30.869> my<00:00:31.650> favorite<00:00:32.189> way<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.700> come<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
part my favorite way is to come in and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.690 
part my favorite way is to come in and
use<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.660> drop<00:00:34.410> down<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> orient<00:00:35.460> tool

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
use this drop down for the orient tool

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.479 
use this drop down for the orient tool
we<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.540> come<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.079> maybe<00:00:37.170> choose<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.920> top

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
we can come in and maybe choose the top

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.090 
we can come in and maybe choose the top
option<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.379> come<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.890> pick<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
option and then come down and pick a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.569 
option and then come down and pick a
facet<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.210> part<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.010> point<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
facet on the part that will point that

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.139 
facet on the part that will point that
facet<00:00:45.510> towards<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> top<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> build

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
facet towards the top of the build

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
facet towards the top of the build
envelope<00:00:48.260> another<00:00:49.260> way<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
envelope another way that we can do that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
envelope another way that we can do that
is<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.090> come<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> rotate

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
is to come in and just use the rotate

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.340 
is to come in and just use the rotate
tool<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.070> by<00:00:54.059> default<00:00:54.270> we've<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> 90

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
tool and by default we've got a 90

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
tool and by default we've got a 90
degree<00:00:55.680> increment<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.850> come<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> maybe

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
degree increment and come in maybe

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.200 
degree increment and come in maybe
rotate<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.530> z<00:00:58.559> axis<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> x<00:00:59.699> axis<00:01:00.090> or

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
rotate about the z axis or the x axis or

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
rotate about the z axis or the x axis or
the<00:01:00.300> y<00:01:00.329> axis<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.129> we're<00:01:02.250> happy<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the y axis so if we're happy with this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969 
the y axis so if we're happy with this
orientation<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.619> hit<00:01:04.769> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
orientation and come back and hit this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
orientation and come back and hit this
icon<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.880> us<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> main

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
icon and back us back up to the main

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
icon and back us back up to the main
screen<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.590> let's<00:01:08.100> take<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> look<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:08.790> this

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
screen and let's take a look at how this

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
screen and let's take a look at how this
modeler<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.659> set<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:10.890> we're<00:01:11.159> set<00:01:11.310> up

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
modeler is set up right now we're set up

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.899 
modeler is set up right now we're set up
for<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> Fortis<00:01:12.090> 250<00:01:12.780> MC<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> 10,000<00:01:14.640> slice

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
for a Fortis 250 MC with a 10,000 slice

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.969 
for a Fortis 250 MC with a 10,000 slice
and<00:01:15.900> we're<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> maybe<00:01:16.439> come<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and we're going to maybe come in and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.240 
and we're going to maybe come in and
start<00:01:17.220> off<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.970> solid<00:01:18.810> build<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:20.070> we're

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
start off with a solid build if we're

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
start off with a solid build if we're
happy<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> orientation<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.780> just

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
happy with the orientation we can just

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.499 
happy with the orientation we can just
come<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.259> hit<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> green<00:01:22.770> flag<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
come in hit the green flag to go in and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.960 
come in hit the green flag to go in and
slice<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> part<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.549> figures<00:01:26.820> out

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
slice up the part it also figures out

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
slice up the part it also figures out
where<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> needs<00:01:27.540> support<00:01:27.900> material<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
where it needs support material and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
where it needs support material and
basically<00:01:29.400> builds<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> NC<00:01:30.270> file<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.810> send<00:01:31.079> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
basically builds the NC file to send to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.010 
basically builds the NC file to send to
the<00:01:31.650> machine<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.430> control<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.090> head<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.900> it

the machine to control the head as it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
the machine to control the head as it
lays<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.380> material<00:01:35.090> we<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.150> come<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.540> look

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
lays down material we can come in look

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
up button we can see the layers of the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
up button we can see the layers of the
model<00:01:51.930> material<00:01:52.280> alternating<00:01:53.280> back<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
model material alternating back and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.319 
model material alternating back and
forth<00:01:53.810> as<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.990> walk<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.409> through<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> part<00:01:56.329> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
forth as we walk up through the part and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.580 
forth as we walk up through the part and
there's<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> little<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.930> support<00:01:58.049> material

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
there's a little bit of support material

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.969 
there's a little bit of support material
for<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> opening<00:02:00.110> if<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.259> come<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.860> look

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
for the opening if we come in and look

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
for the opening if we come in and look
at<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> bottom<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.939> hand<00:02:03.090> corner<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
at the bottom right hand corner of the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.780 
at the bottom right hand corner of the
screen<00:02:03.780> we've<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> log<00:02:04.680> button<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
screen we've got the log button this

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.819 
screen we've got the log button this
will<00:02:06.000> give<00:02:06.210> us<00:02:06.240> another<00:02:06.869> way<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> find<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.619> how

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
will give us another way to find out how

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.949 
will give us another way to find out how
much<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.459> build<00:02:08.729> time<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.869> gonna

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
much the build time is so this is gonna

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.890 
much the build time is so this is gonna
be<00:02:10.050> 2<00:02:10.349> hours<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.860> 4<00:02:11.099> minutes

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
be 2 hours and 4 minutes

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.680 
be 2 hours and 4 minutes
and<00:02:12.019> use<00:02:12.459> 1.04<00:02:13.459> cubic<00:02:13.879> inches<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.209> model

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and use 1.04 cubic inches of model

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.720 
and use 1.04 cubic inches of model
material<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.260> point<00:02:15.590> three<00:02:15.830> cubic<00:02:16.220> inches<00:02:16.519> of

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
material and point three cubic inches of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.690 
material and point three cubic inches of
support<00:02:17.120> material<00:02:17.650> maybe<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:19.010> want<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.370> take<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
support material maybe we want to take a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.460 
support material maybe we want to take a
look<00:02:19.970> at<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.299> couple<00:02:20.659> different<00:02:20.690> options<00:02:21.080> we

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
look at a couple different options we

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.100 
look at a couple different options we
can<00:02:21.620> change<00:02:21.920> instead<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.849> using<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.599> solid

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
can change instead of using a solid

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.410 
can change instead of using a solid
build<00:02:24.470> for<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.890> interior<00:02:25.370> we<00:02:25.909> can<00:02:26.030> use<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.390> of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
build for the interior we can use one of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.839 
build for the interior we can use one of
the<00:02:26.599> sparse<00:02:27.049> builds<00:02:27.640> high-density<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.730> going

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
the sparse builds high-density is going

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.000 
the sparse builds high-density is going
to<00:02:28.909> be<00:02:29.000> closer<00:02:29.420> packed<00:02:29.870> together<00:02:30.049> and<00:02:30.440> low

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
to be closer packed together and low

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.559 
to be closer packed together and low
density<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.489> going<00:02:31.579> to<00:02:31.700> be<00:02:31.819> spread<00:02:32.120> out<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.420> it

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
density is going to be spread out of it

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.530 
density is going to be spread out of it
so<00:02:33.230> if<00:02:33.290> we<00:02:33.409> change<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.980> over<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.489> read<00:02:35.150> green

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
so if we change that over and read green

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.809 
so if we change that over and read green
flag<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.959> part<00:02:36.409> and<00:02:36.860> override<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.670> existing

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
flag the part and override the existing

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.009 
flag the part and override the existing
toolpaths

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
toolpaths

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.720 
toolpaths
it's<00:02:39.620> going<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.829> go<00:02:39.950> through<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.280> Reese<00:02:40.489> lice

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
it's going to go through and Reese lice

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.180 
it's going to go through and Reese lice
things<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.379> come<00:02:42.560> up<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.860> look<00:02:43.489> at<00:02:43.670> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
things we can come up and look at the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.970 
things we can come up and look at the
sparse<00:02:46.190> nature<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.720> part<00:02:48.019> where<00:02:48.799> it's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
sparse nature of the part where it's

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.670 
sparse nature of the part where it's
actually<00:02:49.280> coming<00:02:49.579> in<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.970> putting<00:02:50.239> down

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
actually coming in and putting down

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.979 
actually coming in and putting down
spread<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.859> grid<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.340> material<00:02:52.910> inside<00:02:53.180> the

spread out grid of material inside the

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.860 
spread out grid of material inside the
part<00:02:54.819> come<00:02:55.819> over<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.090> look<00:02:56.180> at<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.390> log<00:02:56.569> file

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
part come over and look at the log file

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.410 
part come over and look at the log file
again<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.829> only<00:02:57.980> not<00:02:58.370> got<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.640> couple<00:02:59.060> minutes

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
again we only not got a couple minutes

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.830 
again we only not got a couple minutes
on<00:02:59.659> the<00:02:59.810> build<00:03:00.049> time<00:03:00.290> but<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.099> took<00:03:01.299> 0.2<00:03:02.299> cubic

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
on the build time but we took 0.2 cubic

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.399 
on the build time but we took 0.2 cubic
inches<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.470> model<00:03:04.400> material<00:03:04.549> away<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:06.260> we're

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
inches of model material away if we're

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.259 
inches of model material away if we're
happy<00:03:06.590> with<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:07.040> we<00:03:07.190> can<00:03:07.310> come<00:03:07.430> over<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.700> hit

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
happy with that we can come over and hit

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.819 
happy with that we can come over and hit
the<00:03:08.569> build<00:03:10.720> option<00:03:11.720> let's<00:03:12.200> send<00:03:12.379> this<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
the build option let's send this to the

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.500 
the build option let's send this to the
machine<00:03:14.319> houston<00:03:15.319> 250<00:03:15.919> that's<00:03:16.880> gonna<00:03:17.000> fire<00:03:17.329> up

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
machine houston 250 that's gonna fire up

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.379 
machine houston 250 that's gonna fire up
control<00:03:18.019> center<00:03:18.609> when<00:03:19.609> we<00:03:19.730> get<00:03:19.849> into<00:03:20.060> control

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
control center when we get into control

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.960 
control center when we get into control
center<00:03:20.750> we've<00:03:20.900> got<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.230> ability<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.790> move<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
center we've got the ability to move the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.270 
center we've got the ability to move the
part<00:03:23.239> around<00:03:23.389> in<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> build<00:03:24.139> platform<00:03:24.380> we've

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
part around in the build platform we've

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.449 
part around in the build platform we've
also<00:03:25.489> got<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:25.970> ability<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.859> maybe<00:03:27.859> come<00:03:28.190> in

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
also got the ability to maybe come in

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.849 
also got the ability to maybe come in
and<00:03:28.840> let's<00:03:29.840> make<00:03:29.989> three<00:03:30.349> or<00:03:30.379> four<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.739> these

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
and let's make three or four of these

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.740 
and let's make three or four of these
guys<00:03:32.139> so<00:03:33.139> we<00:03:33.230> can<00:03:33.379> move<00:03:33.530> them<00:03:33.739> around<00:03:34.750> however

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
guys so we can move them around however

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.379 
guys so we can move them around however
we<00:03:35.930> like<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:37.069> if<00:03:37.669> we're<00:03:37.819> connected<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.269> the

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
we like and if we're connected to the

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.720 
we like and if we're connected to the
machine<00:03:38.780> we<00:03:38.810> can<00:03:39.109> say<00:03:39.349> build<00:03:39.769> job<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:40.400> this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
machine we can say build job and this

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.050 
machine we can say build job and this
will<00:03:41.030> send<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.629> part<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.829> printer<00:03:43.190> just

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
will send the part to the printer just

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.349 
will send the part to the printer just
like<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.389> would<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.780> regular<00:03:45.019> network<00:03:45.590> printer

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
like it would a regular network printer
