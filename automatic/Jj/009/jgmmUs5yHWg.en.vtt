00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
got a metal upper receiver here pretty

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.289 
got a metal upper receiver here pretty
nice<00:03:17.470> metal<00:03:17.860> kind<00:03:18.579> of<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:18.970> seen<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.239> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
nice metal kind of like you seen on the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.569 
nice metal kind of like you seen on the
pro<00:03:19.480> lied<00:03:20.760> again<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:21.910> probably<00:03:22.150> pop<00:03:22.480> metal

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
pro lied again it's probably pop metal

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:30.840 
pro lied again it's probably pop metal
but<00:03:24.579> it's<00:03:24.730> still<00:03:24.940> metal<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:30.310> looks<00:03:30.459> like<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
but it's still metal so it looks like a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.080 
but it's still metal so it looks like a
mag<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.750> there<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:33.400> like<00:03:33.519> that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
mag in there just like that

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.880 
mag in there just like that
you<00:03:34.420> don't<00:03:34.570> have<00:03:34.690> any<00:03:34.870> wobbles<00:03:35.320> nice<00:03:35.680> and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
you don't have any wobbles nice and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.060 
you don't have any wobbles nice and
solid<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:37.510> go<00:03:37.600> ahead<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.810> pull<00:03:38.079> that<00:03:38.200> up

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.430 

unlike<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.340> proline<00:03:42.730> model<00:03:43.510> when<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.140> talk

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440

or<00:03:54.040> jg<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:55.390> know<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:56.260> right<00:03:56.470> here<00:03:56.739> however

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
or jg you know it's right here however

or jg you know it's right here however
on<00:03:57.549> this<00:03:57.820> particular<00:03:58.269> model<00:03:59.140> it's<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.829> lot

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
on this particular model it's a lot

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.100 
on this particular model it's a lot
harder<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.489> get<00:04:00.760> to

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
harder to get to

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.060 
harder to get to
then<00:04:02.110> those<00:04:03.750> which<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.989> unfortunate<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.010> you

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
then those which is unfortunate so you

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.190 
then those which is unfortunate so you
have<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.459> take<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:06.880> off<00:04:07.180> pretty<00:04:07.540> much<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.989> get

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
have to take this off pretty much to get

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.860 
have to take this off pretty much to get
to<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.620> unless<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.160> have<00:04:09.340> really<00:04:09.609> no<00:04:10.510> small

the<00:04:13.700> white<00:04:13.880> foregrip<00:04:14.270> here<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:16.090> kind<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.150> a

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
the white foregrip here is kind of a

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.320 
the white foregrip here is kind of a
cheaper<00:04:17.959> ABS<00:04:18.770> plastic<00:04:19.340> but<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.640> feels<00:04:19.850> fun

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
cheaper ABS plastic but it feels fun

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.060 
cheaper ABS plastic but it feels fun
solve<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:21.200> know<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.380> shouldn't<00:04:21.620> break

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.590 

this<00:04:25.070> tube<00:04:25.760> right<00:04:25.790> here<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:27.080> plastic

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
this tube right here it's plastic

more<00:04:44.900> realism<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:46.300> got<00:04:47.300> serial<00:04:47.720> numbers

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
more realism to it got serial numbers

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.030 
more realism to it got serial numbers
here<00:04:48.170> on<00:04:48.230> the<00:04:48.350> top<00:04:50.380> yeah<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.590> front<00:04:51.800> sights

here on the top yeah that front sights
also<00:04:52.340> metal<00:04:53.080> um<00:04:56.230> this<00:04:57.230> stock<00:04:57.560> is<00:04:57.920> definitely

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
also metal um this stock is definitely

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.370 
also metal um this stock is definitely
not<00:04:58.940> like<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.390> normally<00:04:59.810> see<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.050> any

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
not like you normally see on any

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.070 
not like you normally see on any
emphasize<00:05:00.920> it's<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.730> little<00:05:02.000> more<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.390> g3

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
emphasize it's a little more of a g3

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.730 
emphasize it's a little more of a g3
style<00:05:04.040> stock<00:05:04.430> kind<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.240> bit<00:05:05.450> smaller<00:05:05.810> kind

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
style stock kind of a bit smaller kind

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.030 
style stock kind of a bit smaller kind
of<00:05:06.830> curves<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.310> with<00:05:07.610> some<00:05:07.820> dripping<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.950> you

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
of curves in with some dripping so you

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.290 
of curves in with some dripping so you
guess<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:10.310> can<00:05:10.430> get<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> nice<00:05:10.700> good<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.180> your

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
guess you can get a nice good to your

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.000 
guess you can get a nice good to your
shoulders<00:05:12.400> like<00:05:13.400> that<00:05:14.740> yeah

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
shoulders like that yeah

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.940 
shoulders like that yeah
so<00:05:16.490> let's<00:05:17.000> do<00:05:17.150> she<00:05:17.330> detested<00:05:17.750> say<00:05:18.620> I'm

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
so let's do she detested say I'm
