also<00:03:14.190> works<00:03:14.640> as<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> hand<00:03:15.090> protector<00:03:16.280> it's<00:03:17.280> very

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
also works as a hand protector it's very

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.110 
also works as a hand protector it's very
wide<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> reason<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.490> see<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.000> it
