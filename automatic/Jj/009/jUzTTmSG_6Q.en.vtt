00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.580 
foal today and she's only a 45 pound
fall<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.790> with<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> she's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.630> got<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

strength to actually stand on her own

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600 
strength to actually stand on her own
and<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.080> when<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.409> assist<00:01:10.950> her<00:01:11.130> she<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.520> only

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and so when we assist her she can only

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
and so when we assist her she can only
stand<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.270> five<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:12.990> six<00:01:13.260> seconds<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
stand for about five or six seconds and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.010 
stand for about five or six seconds and
then<00:01:14.369> she<00:01:14.580> gets<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> week<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> she<00:01:15.720> needs<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
then she gets a week and she needs to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560 
then she gets a week and she needs to
lay<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.200> again<00:01:16.580> she<00:01:17.580> also<00:01:17.729> has<00:01:18.060> flexor

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
lay down again she also has flexor

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
lay down again she also has flexor
tendon<00:01:18.960> laxity<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> mean<00:01:20.040> by<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
tendon laxity and what I mean by that is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.300 
tendon laxity and what I mean by that is
that<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:21.240> she's<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.990> her<00:01:22.170> her<00:01:22.650> hooves<00:01:22.920> her

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that when she's up on her her hooves her

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.499 
that when she's up on her her hooves her
pasterns<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.150> touching<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
pasterns are actually touching the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
pasterns are actually touching the
ground<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.650> she<00:01:25.799> can't<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.580> hold

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
ground and so she can't really hold

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.569 
ground and so she can't really hold
herself<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.540> she<00:01:27.720> should<00:01:28.490> we're<00:01:29.490> gonna

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
herself up like she should we're gonna

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.679 
herself up like she should we're gonna
go<00:01:29.759> over<00:01:29.880> some<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> things<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.509> we're

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
go over some of the things that we're

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
go over some of the things that we're
doing<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.990> try<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> help<00:01:31.290> her<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.579> her

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
doing to try to help her and to get her

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.830 
doing to try to help her and to get her
where<00:01:32.880> she<00:01:33.060> needs<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> other

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.670 
where she needs to be with the other

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
foals when we talk about a foal having a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.590 
foals when we talk about a foal having a
poor<00:01:37.890> suckle<00:01:38.310> reflex<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:39.329> we're<00:01:39.450> really

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
poor suckle reflex what we're really

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.270 
poor suckle reflex what we're really
talking<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> their<00:01:40.470> ability<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> ingest

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
talking about is their ability to ingest

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
talking about is their ability to ingest
the<00:01:41.460> milk<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.970> normal<00:01:42.689> foal<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the milk a normal foal would have a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980 
the milk a normal foal would have a
suckle<00:01:43.920> reflex<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.880> 30<00:01:45.390> minutes<00:01:45.780> after

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
suckle reflex at about 30 minutes after

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.560 
suckle reflex at about 30 minutes after
they're<00:01:46.380> born<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.310> foal<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.729> two<00:01:47.970> days<00:01:48.149> old

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
they're born this foal is two days old

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.060 
they're born this foal is two days old
and<00:01:48.720> she<00:01:48.990> still<00:01:49.200> doesn't<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> suckle

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and she still doesn't have a suckle

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.969 
and she still doesn't have a suckle
reflex<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.299> she<00:01:51.899> drips<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.799> milk

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
reflex so she drips a lot of the milk

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.770 
reflex so she drips a lot of the milk
out<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.250> her<00:01:53.310> mouth<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.790> she<00:01:54.090> tries<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
out of her mouth and she tries to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.929 
out of her mouth and she tries to
swallow<00:01:55.110> she's<00:01:55.770> very<00:01:55.920> eager<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.670> some

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
swallow she's very eager to have some

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.990 
swallow she's very eager to have some
milk<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.420> she's<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.469> very<00:01:58.530> good<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.670> getting

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
milk but she's not very good at getting

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
milk but she's not very good at getting
the<00:02:00.119> quantity<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.869> she<00:02:01.079> needs<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.530> normal

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the quantity that she needs a normal

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
the quantity that she needs a normal
phone<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.280> ingest<00:02:02.880> about<00:02:03.180> 20<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.780> 25%<00:02:04.200> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
phone would ingest about 20 to 25% of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.370 
phone would ingest about 20 to 25% of
their<00:02:04.710> body<00:02:04.890> weight<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.670> foal<00:02:06.020> with<00:02:07.020> oral

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
their body weight this foal with oral

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.889 
their body weight this foal with oral
feeding<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.860> probably<00:02:08.160> only<00:02:08.610> ingesting

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
feeding is probably only ingesting

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.360 
feeding is probably only ingesting
two<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> half<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.500> five<00:02:10.739> percent<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.280> her

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
two and a half to five percent of her

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.580 
two and a half to five percent of her
body<00:02:11.549> weight<00:02:11.760> at<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.180> point<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.510> time<00:02:12.659> so<00:02:13.470> we

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
body weight at this point in time so we

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
body weight at this point in time so we
have<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.860> help<00:02:14.040> her<00:02:14.159> a<00:02:14.220> little<00:02:14.400> bit<00:02:14.629> we<00:02:15.629> do<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
the food in the tube that goes to her

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.649 
the food in the tube that goes to her
stomach<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:20.069> try<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.610> supplement<00:02:20.819> part<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.599> the

we're going to talk about the treatment

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.199 
we're going to talk about the treatment
options<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.489> fall<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.970> how<00:02:27.060> we're

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
options for this fall and how we're

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.369 
options for this fall and how we're
gonna<00:02:27.269> get<00:02:27.480> her<00:02:27.689> back<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:28.109> being<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.349> healthy

foam<00:02:28.829> first<00:02:29.790> thing<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:30.390> her

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
foam first thing is is that her

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.089 
foam first thing is is that her
respiratory<00:02:30.750> system<00:02:31.290> isn't<00:02:31.530> very<00:02:31.650> developed

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
respiratory system isn't very developed

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.339 
respiratory system isn't very developed
and<00:02:32.519> because<00:02:33.359> of<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.540> she<00:02:33.930> needs<00:02:34.109> to<00:02:34.230> have

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
and because of that she needs to have

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.289 
and because of that she needs to have
supplemental<00:02:34.890> oxygen<00:02:35.010> therapy<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.030> see

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
supplemental oxygen therapy you can see

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.089 
supplemental oxygen therapy you can see
the<00:02:36.420> nebulizer<00:02:36.810> here<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.470> goes<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.890> two

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
the nebulizer here that goes to a two

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.339 
the nebulizer here that goes to a two
that<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.849> her<00:02:39.000> nostril<00:02:39.480> supplies<00:02:40.049> her<00:02:40.200> with

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
that is in her nostril supplies her with

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.140 
that is in her nostril supplies her with
oxygen<00:02:40.859> that<00:02:41.010> she<00:02:41.159> needs<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.879> meet<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
oxygen that she needs to meet the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.580 
oxygen that she needs to meet the
requirements<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.720> her<00:02:42.840> tissues<00:02:43.200> require

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
requirements that her tissues require

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.649 
requirements that her tissues require
the<00:02:44.549> second<00:02:44.909> thing<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.540> her

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
the second thing is is that her

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.300 
the second thing is is that her
digestive<00:02:46.139> system<00:02:46.440> isn't<00:02:46.590> developed<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.190> so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
digestive system isn't developed and so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.280 
digestive system isn't developed and so
she<00:02:47.370> can't<00:02:47.700> actually<00:02:47.909> handle<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.720> milk

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
she can't actually handle the milk

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.619 
she can't actually handle the milk
quantity<00:02:49.889> that<00:02:50.099> she<00:02:50.280> would<00:02:50.430> need<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.790> ingest

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
quantity that she would need to ingest

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.379 
quantity that she would need to ingest
to<00:02:52.019> meet<00:02:52.230> her<00:02:52.349> systemic<00:02:52.799> requirements<00:02:53.459> so

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
to meet her systemic requirements so

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.000 
to meet her systemic requirements so
what<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.629> do<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.170> her<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.409> pump

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
what we do is we have her on a pump

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.729 
what we do is we have her on a pump
we<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.489> additives<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.299> fluids<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.709> help

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
we have additives in the fluids to help

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.770 
we have additives in the fluids to help
meet<00:02:59.099> some<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.310> those<00:02:59.489> requirements<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.299> we

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
meet some of those requirements and we

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.140 
meet some of those requirements and we
have<00:03:01.049> her<00:03:01.139> on<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> rate<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.980> delivers<00:03:02.639> them<00:03:02.879> at

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
have her on a rate that delivers them at

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.069 
have her on a rate that delivers them at
a<00:03:03.299> specified<00:03:03.599> amount<00:03:04.260> per<00:03:05.129> hour<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.870> last

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
a specified amount per hour the last

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.839 
a specified amount per hour the last
thing<00:03:07.379> is<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.920> her<00:03:08.069> immune<00:03:08.340> system<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.790> not

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
thing is that her immune system is not

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.670 
thing is that her immune system is not
very<00:03:09.000> developed<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.689> because<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.230> she

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
very developed and because of that she

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.909 
very developed and because of that she
needs<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.189> broad-spectrum<00:03:11.879> antibiotics

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
needs to have broad-spectrum antibiotics
