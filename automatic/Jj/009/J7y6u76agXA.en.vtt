these and all the Me's are exactly what

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.050 
these and all the Me's are exactly what
they<00:06:49.340> are<00:06:49.840> so<00:06:50.840> in<00:06:50.990> bobsleigh<00:06:51.650> is<00:06:52.010> mainly<00:06:52.730> the

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:59.210 
they are so in bobsleigh is mainly the
same<00:06:53.330> thing<00:06:53.690> like<00:06:54.110> 20<00:06:54.620> more<00:06:54.770> coins

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.279 

my<00:06:59.520> god

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.920 

perfect

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.930 

I<00:07:07.990> think<00:07:08.770> it's<00:07:08.889> ways<00:07:09.130> you<00:07:09.430> to<00:07:09.550> collect<00:07:09.850> the

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.330 
I think it's ways you to collect the
coins<00:07:10.150> and<00:07:10.449> bobsled<00:07:10.930> I<00:07:11.350> can<00:07:11.620> do<00:07:11.680> a<00:07:11.710> much<00:07:12.039> faster

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
coins and bobsled I can do a much faster

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
coins and bobsled I can do a much faster
than<00:07:12.669> the<00:07:12.850> others

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.670
