00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
again and as you can see it's going to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.950 
again and as you can see it's going to
be<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.690> fairly<00:00:13.170> large<00:00:13.320> watch<00:00:14.059> on<00:00:15.059> my<00:00:15.509> arm

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
be a fairly large watch on my arm

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.720 
be a fairly large watch on my arm
now<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> reason<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.130> has<00:00:17.160> three<00:00:17.609> different

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
now the reason is it has three different

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.730 
now the reason is it has three different
displays<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.900> set<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> watch<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.710> just

can be set using I guess a couple

buttons<00:00:43.730> buttons<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.000> watch<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> may<00:00:45.360> get

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
buttons buttons on this watch I may get

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090 
buttons buttons on this watch I may get
into<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.590> watch<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:46.950> kind<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
into that but on this watch are kind of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
into that but on this watch are kind of
odd<00:00:47.250> there's<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.640> labels<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.840> you're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
odd there's not labels it's just you're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.569 
odd there's not labels it's just you're
going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> hear<00:00:49.710> his<00:00:49.890> buttons<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:51.379> B<00:00:52.379> C<00:00:53.010> D

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
going to hear his buttons are a B C D

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910 
going to hear his buttons are a B C D
and<00:00:53.820> E<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.530> look<00:00:55.649> closely

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and E I think this if you look closely

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.439 
and E I think this if you look closely
it<00:00:56.250> says<00:00:56.489> light<00:00:57.120> light<00:00:58.079> mode<00:00:58.820> start<00:00:59.820> stop<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it says light light mode start stop and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869 
it says light light mode start stop and
start<00:01:00.750> stop<00:01:01.109> timer<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.100> stopwatch<00:01:02.309> I'm<00:01:02.730> going

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
start stop timer and stopwatch I'm going

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.539 
start stop timer and stopwatch I'm going
to<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> second<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.290> alarm<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.400> can

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
to that in a second so you alarm you can

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.859 
to that in a second so you alarm you can
set<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> second<00:01:06.240> mode<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.750> only

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.330 
set on the second mode I'm not only
gonna<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.140> end<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.040> comes

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it's on the see this instruction manual

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's on the see this instruction manual
comes<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.330> gives<00:01:12.540> you

mean it's gonna tell you that so I'm
like<00:01:18.689> always<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:19.080> time<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.220> I'm<00:01:21.030> gonna<00:01:21.180> watch<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
like always my time so I'm gonna watch I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
like always my time so I'm gonna watch I
mean<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> set<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> alarm<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.880> main

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
mean see you set the alarm the main

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.280 
mean see you set the alarm the main
function<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.540> watches<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> soccer

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
function of this watches the soccer

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
function of this watches the soccer
timer<00:01:25.710> mode<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.460> find<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> most<00:01:26.970> useful

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
timer mode which I find the most useful

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640 
timer mode which I find the most useful
I<00:01:27.509> guess<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> soccer<00:01:28.470> referee

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
I guess because it's a soccer referee

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.080 
I guess because it's a soccer referee
watch<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:31.310> you're<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.549> time

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
watch so you're gonna have the time

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.590 
watch so you're gonna have the time
which<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.500> 737<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.579> date<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.450> also

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
which is right now 737 the date is also

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
which is right now 737 the date is also
I<00:01:36.750> didn't<00:01:36.960> mention<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> eleven<00:01:37.829> eight

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I didn't mention this is eleven eight

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.069 
I didn't mention this is eleven eight

back of theory SS or like that but it's

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.580 
back of theory SS or like that but it's
not<00:02:43.700> much<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:44.000> problem<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.570> then<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.410> top
