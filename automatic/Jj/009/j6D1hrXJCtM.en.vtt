00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 nice Sunday evening and for the little Stefan Studtrucker a huge 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.500
 If he is in this situation just a bit cooler 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.009
 remained 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.009
 if then also a header like that of Martin Kollenberg not equal in 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.130
 Goal lands and all this happens towards the end of the game 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.929
 to quarrel with fate 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.899
 then it is always dangerous and that's how you often have to be 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.489
 after all agree that elsewhere administration committee nonsensical the 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.859
 uneducated points he saw two chances clear odds 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.189
 anyway 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.330
 that would be in turn 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.620
 but before the victory dreams, the guests still had some nightmares 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.770
 survive the first 20 minutes 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.629
 belonged to the Münsteranern first dance shows 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.690
 She has long been keen on Tor Torben 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.350
 A little later Andreas Rehder becomes the last man of the last man 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.550
 In the game forward Bielefeld initially developed little ideas 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.550
 Misconceptions like this were commonplace 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.680
 However, with the following powerful start by Christian Geyer is first taken 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.039
 Chance after 30 minutes, the tide turned 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.039
 to the delight of the traveling fans 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.259
 Bielefeld increasingly took over the initiative Münster 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.340
 by now only with some standards like this free kick 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.770
 in the partly very broken game were allowed after the break on the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.840
 Arminen show each free kick qualities as after this foul on the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.270
 altogether let Markus Ruppel 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.340
 even if Werder free kick still further chances to death led their faces 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.930
 after the goalless game they were able to claim a better team this time 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.170
 celebrate right 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.840
 Fortunately, the windows with such a big stadium did not climb over 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.270
 and the players did not stumble on the Münster would also stumble 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.610
 Since one may expect optimistic times 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.540
 Chairman two heavy play that in Europe and the US by 0 4% 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.430
