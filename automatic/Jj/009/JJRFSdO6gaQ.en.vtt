 good morning my name is lissavetzky is the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.260
 responsible for fish and shellfish 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.380
 I'm going to talk about the sardine theme today 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.170
 we have fresh sardine this one has 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.150
 Omega 3 is ideal for cholesterol and 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.010
 then we have the sardine herring now 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.789
 with the dates that are approaching is the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.860
 Burial of the Sardine 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.840
 the output in which is typical for the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.149
 burial comes salty is they eat such 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.890
 which and then we have the flour the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.200
 fresh sardine 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.500
 we can see its freshness by the brightness of 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.829
 eyes and white has to 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.989
 to be 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.970
 reds now with the 'burial of the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.290
 sardine ' the carnival arrives I go to 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.680
 talk a little bit about the history of 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.750
 sardine with the iron started all the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.620
 mid-19th century a group of nobles 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.320
 they asked for sardines to a coastal town 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.699
 from the north of Spain then came this 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.740
 sardines arrived in poor condition and then 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.930
 taking advantage of that they were the holidays of 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.060
 carnival what they did was a funeral 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.009
 from there comes the hell of the sardine 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.450
 I tell you how we can prepare 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.000
 cook in various ways 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.820
 you can cook it on the grill after 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.800
 you can cook frit is pickled 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.810
 they can be good many times not 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.780
 we buy for the gold that they give off but 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.580
 I'm going to give a little advice 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.920
 that it's always good to do them at 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.080
 Oven clogs are left as is 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.480
 come out they are covered with silver paper then 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.850
 we can make them on the grill 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.530
 we'll take a little bit of salt to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.810
 the paella pan so they do not come off so much 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.660
 what and then we can also cook them 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.340
 fries that customers say they 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.170
 they cut the tail the tail of the tail do not 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.550
 they smell so much is a trick that I give you 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.550
 I invite you to try it 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.049
