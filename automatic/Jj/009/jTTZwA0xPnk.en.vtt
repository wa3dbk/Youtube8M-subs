I<00:00:45.120> recommend<00:00:45.660> saving<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> JPEG<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
I recommend saving as a JPEG but for

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.720 
I recommend saving as a JPEG but for
images<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.120> have<00:00:51.800> solid<00:00:52.800> colors<00:00:53.160> such<00:00:53.460> as

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
images that have solid colors such as

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.560 
images that have solid colors such as
logos<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:55.980> pretty<00:00:56.160> basic<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:57.149> well

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
logos and that are pretty basic as well

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.099 
logos and that are pretty basic as well
as<00:00:58.070> elements<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.430> website<00:01:00.329> template<00:01:00.780> or

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
as elements of your website template or

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
as elements of your website template or
something<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.039> would<00:01:02.489> save<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:02.969> as

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
something like that I would save them as

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.870 
something like that I would save them as
a<00:01:03.149> PNG<00:01:03.600> 8<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.790> 24<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.900> ping<00:01:07.170> G's<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
a PNG 8 or 24 and with ping G's you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.969 
a PNG 8 or 24 and with ping G's you can
have<00:01:10.189> transparency<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.490> well<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:12.000> gifts<00:01:12.979> so

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
have transparency as well as gifts so

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
have transparency as well as gifts so
I'm<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> save<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.450> JPEG<00:01:15.689> as

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I'm just going to save this as a JPEG as

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.120 
I'm just going to save this as a JPEG as
it<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> photo<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.710> select<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it is a photo and we can select the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.380 
it is a photo and we can select the
quality<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.869> keep<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.320> down<00:01:22.500> into

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
quality I will just keep going down into

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.710 
quality I will just keep going down into
you've<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:25.080> started<00:01:25.500> noticing<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
you've really started noticing the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.240 
you've really started noticing the
quality<00:01:27.720> being<00:01:27.960> changed<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:29.040> stop

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
quality being changed so I would stop

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.030 
quality being changed so I would stop
about<00:01:29.520> 12<00:01:30.110> or<00:01:31.110> maybe<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.799> higher

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
about 12 or maybe a little bit higher

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.880 
about 12 or maybe a little bit higher
about<00:01:32.610> 20<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> bottom<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.680> bit

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
about 20 and at the bottom we have a bit

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.929 
about 20 and at the bottom we have a bit
of<00:01:34.920> information<00:01:35.570> we<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:37.520> what<00:01:38.520> format<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of information we can see what format it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.410 
of information we can see what format it
is<00:01:39.530> how<00:01:40.530> many<00:01:40.680> kilobytes<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.790> tell

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
is how many kilobytes it is and tell

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.289 
is how many kilobytes it is and tell
them<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.630> will<00:01:42.720> take<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> load<00:01:44.149> depending<00:01:45.149> on

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
natural size of the image so I can just

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.350
