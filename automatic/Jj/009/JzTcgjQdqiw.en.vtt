product for us very excited about it
especially<00:00:22.070> about<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.820> tuning<00:00:23.210> system

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
especially about the tuning system

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.590 
especially about the tuning system
that's<00:00:24.140> on<00:00:24.320> this<00:00:24.590> bass<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.939> headless<00:00:26.330> bass

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
that's on this bass it's a headless bass

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.490 
that's on this bass it's a headless bass
that<00:00:26.900> can<00:00:27.140> take<00:00:27.350> any<00:00:28.039> kind<00:00:28.430> of<00:00:28.640> string<00:00:29.500> single

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
that can take any kind of string single

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.229 
that can take any kind of string single
ball<00:00:30.680> strings<00:00:31.099> of<00:00:31.250> any<00:00:31.369> kind<00:00:31.699> as<00:00:31.970> long<00:00:32.119> as

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
ball strings of any kind as long as

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.759 
ball strings of any kind as long as
they're<00:00:32.359> designed<00:00:32.689> for<00:00:32.839> a<00:00:32.899> long<00:00:33.109> scale<00:00:33.469> based

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
they're designed for a long scale based

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.099 
they're designed for a long scale based
they'll<00:00:34.460> work<00:00:34.670> on<00:00:34.879> this<00:00:35.059> space<00:00:35.359> it's<00:00:35.899> really

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
they'll work on this space it's really

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.989 
they'll work on this space it's really
very<00:00:36.229> easy<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:36.889> change<00:00:37.159> the<00:00:37.339> strings<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.909> I'll

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:37.999 
very easy to change the strings and I'll

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:39.789 
very easy to change the strings and I'll
just<00:00:38.210> go<00:00:38.389> through<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.719> process<00:00:38.839> right<00:00:39.440> now<00:00:39.620> so

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:39.799 
just go through the process right now so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.279 
just go through the process right now so
you<00:00:39.889> can<00:00:40.039> see<00:00:40.190> how<00:00:40.309> it's<00:00:40.519> done<00:00:40.609> first<00:00:41.539> what

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
you can see how it's done first what

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.930 
you can see how it's done first what
we'll<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.559> is<00:00:42.710> we'll<00:00:42.799> change<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:43.309> a<00:00:43.549> string

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
we'll do is we'll change this a string

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.059 
we'll do is we'll change this a string
and<00:00:44.149> we'll<00:00:44.780> -<00:00:45.019> tune<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.859> string<00:00:47.679> which<00:00:48.679> just

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.069 
and we'll - tune the string which just

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.549 
and we'll - tune the string which just
by<00:00:49.219> turning<00:00:49.639> a<00:00:49.850> knob<00:00:49.999> counterclockwise<00:00:50.559> until

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
by turning a knob counterclockwise until

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.340 
by turning a knob counterclockwise until
it<00:00:52.159> comes<00:00:53.119> free<00:00:53.479> you'll<00:00:53.719> see<00:00:53.899> that<00:00:54.049> it

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
it comes free you'll see that it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.109 
it comes free you'll see that it
actually<00:00:54.379> slides<00:00:55.280> right<00:00:55.489> out<00:00:55.549> of<00:00:55.699> there<00:00:55.940> now<00:00:56.089> I

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
actually slides right out of there now I

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.029 
actually slides right out of there now I
didn't<00:00:56.510> use<00:00:56.659> any<00:00:56.809> tools<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.319> loosen<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:57.829> it's

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
didn't use any tools to loosen it it's

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.029 
didn't use any tools to loosen it it's
because<00:00:58.429> it's<00:00:58.729> self<00:00:59.389> clamping<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.170> uses<00:01:00.920> the

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
because it's self clamping it uses the

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.579 
because it's self clamping it uses the
tension<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.639> the<00:01:01.760> string<00:01:02.059> itself<00:01:02.479> to<00:01:03.170> clamp<00:01:03.469> it

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
tension of the string itself to clamp it

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.219 
tension of the string itself to clamp it
so<00:01:03.859> the<00:01:04.759> more<00:01:04.969> tension<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.659> string<00:01:05.960> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
so the more tension on the string the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.730 
so the more tension on the string the
harder<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.740> clamps<00:01:07.219> so<00:01:08.079> here's<00:01:09.079> a<00:01:09.140> new<00:01:09.380> string

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
harder it clamps so here's a new string

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.580 
harder it clamps so here's a new string
first<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:11.180> put<00:01:11.359> it<00:01:11.479> through<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.810> slot<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.229> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
first we put it through the slot and the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.130 
first we put it through the slot and the
head<00:01:12.859> piece<00:01:13.159> it's<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:13.939> good<00:01:14.119> idea<00:01:14.420> not<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.750> trim

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
head piece it's a good idea not to trim

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.599 
head piece it's a good idea not to trim
the<00:01:15.289> string<00:01:15.560> before<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:16.009> put<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:16.340> in<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:16.579> a

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
the string before you put it in it's a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.999 
the string before you put it in it's a
good<00:01:16.729> idea<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.179> pull<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:17.509> right<00:01:17.689> through<00:01:18.009> that

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
good idea to pull it right through that

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.289 
good idea to pull it right through that
way<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:19.250> can<00:01:19.549> get<00:01:20.000> it

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
way you can get it

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.380 
way you can get it
snugged<00:01:20.719> up<00:01:20.929> a<00:01:21.049> little<00:01:21.229> bit<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:21.619> then<00:01:22.390> just

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
snugged up a little bit and then just

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.510 
snugged up a little bit and then just
begin<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.170> tune<00:01:24.380> as<00:01:24.679> soon<00:01:24.859> as<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.100> start<00:01:25.369> to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
begin to tune as soon as you start to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.469 
begin to tune as soon as you start to
tune<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.509> tension<00:01:26.899> of<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.049> string<00:01:27.999> it<00:01:28.999> clamps

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
tune the tension of the string it clamps

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.599 
tune the tension of the string it clamps
itself<00:01:29.840> with<00:01:29.960> its<00:01:30.079> own<00:01:30.229> tension<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.520> you

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
itself with its own tension and so you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.029 
itself with its own tension and so you
can<00:01:31.820> see<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:32.619> it's<00:01:33.619> really<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> very

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
can see it's it's really a very

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.319 
can see it's it's really a very
straightforward<00:01:35.320> operation<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:38.060> get<00:01:38.210> it

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
straightforward operation to to get it

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.819 
straightforward operation to to get it
in<00:01:38.450> tune<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.899> one<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.439> things<00:01:39.590> that's<00:01:39.679> a

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
in tune and one of the things that's a

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.289 
in tune and one of the things that's a
really<00:01:40.159> good<00:01:40.280> idea<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:40.789> give<00:01:41.090> these

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
really good idea is to give these

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.940 
really good idea is to give these
strings<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.689> good<00:01:41.929> tug<00:01:42.200> once<00:01:42.469> you<00:01:42.560> get<00:01:42.710> them<00:01:42.829> up

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
strings a good tug once you get them up

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.340 
strings a good tug once you get them up
to<00:01:42.979> pitch<00:01:43.280> because<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.240> sets<00:01:44.569> them<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.079> so

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
to pitch because that sets them and so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.520 
to pitch because that sets them and so
now<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.679> string<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.189> set<00:01:46.399> pretty<00:01:46.670> solidly<00:01:47.119> and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
now the string is set pretty solidly and

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.410 
now the string is set pretty solidly and
this<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.799> tuner<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.249> is<00:01:49.429> very<00:01:49.640> stable<00:01:50.090> as

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
this this tuner is is very stable as

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.690 
this this tuner is is very stable as
well<00:01:50.600> as<00:01:50.749> being<00:01:51.020> quick<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:52.249> change<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
well as being quick to to change the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.120 
well as being quick to to change the
strings<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:53.569> then<00:01:53.780> once<00:01:54.439> we've<00:01:54.619> done<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.799> we

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
strings so then once we've done that we

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.330 
strings so then once we've done that we
just<00:01:55.310> cut<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.670> string<00:01:56.030> off<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.240> there<00:01:56.539> and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
just cut that string off of there and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.330 
just cut that string off of there and
this<00:01:58.340> instrument<00:01:58.810> now<00:01:59.810> has<00:02:00.049> a<00:02:00.079> new<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.560> string

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
this instrument now has a new a string
