00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good essential condition that we are 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.839
 in minecraft 1.7 point 2 we are going to see a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.240
 mod a mod that is curious makes you do 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.940
 little we saw a mod that was for kraft 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.370
 and carlos web because of the bugs and so 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.010
 can have or have for example wola 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.039
 code kripper and make your own eye for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 example but good this mod is the is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.860
 similar but the concept quite 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.020
 different a fair gripper 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.480
 it's about the same thing of getting the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.460
 hue banks but the concept I like 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.930
 very much more than did my perfect today 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.150
 the question we have to do the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.000
 wand the egg boar or the wand 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.110
 egg or something like that comes out with a stick 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.160
 an egg and a gold night of these and this 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.250
 It has ten uses only 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.110
 that's a little bit, I do not like that, but 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.820
 well the question is that apart from that 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.040
 It only has ten uses the castle is very 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.620
 easy that yes but we also need 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.510
 the gaps to capture also me 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.550
 I feel like a mini pokemon trainer 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.160
 the question is that this huelva that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.309
 does with an egg in the middle eye pen 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.870
 spider flesh of zombie leather and four of 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.300
 thread 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.730
 It's a little messy but good and they give us 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.950
 four and with this we will be testing 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.260
 because not all bugs can be like this 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.540
 let's try with some for example 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.100
 with sheep yes I have tried 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.690
 question is that we have to click on it 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.690
 left 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.840
 Spanish and we transform it into a huelva 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.840
 co 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.880
 let's try with the cows that with the 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.590
 cows I have not tried because if Spain 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.270
 still works for you going 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.080
 also with squid for example and the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.090
 squid two do not transform 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.090
 Kaka 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.990
 go running 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.550
 this is very cool especially is like 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.590
 in the other mode so that this one is 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.270
 rather cooler because you make them 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 explode like this a bit beastly 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.960
 and you get the hole but this serves 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.510
 especially so if we want to make ourselves 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.729
 a farm or something a farm I say a 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.860
 zoo or something like that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.860
 it's pretty cool to see lenderman 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.120
 it has not worked and it has not been stamped 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.420
 good yes for the brother works kakÃ¡ 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.890
 spider spider so we get something tail 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.550
 we're going to take this away to see the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.440
 holes 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.990
 I want to try on all zombie skeleton 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.230
 kripper is the coolest thing really 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.060
 because yes really because the cows and 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.860
 all that you can take it with you with 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.050
 wheat or whatever it looks 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.050
 perfect tommy 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.150
 it's cool a lot in this 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.760
 move them gave him wins river 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.239
 perfect ok let's stop a few 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.380
 the slide that I see that is not there 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.840
 many that can not be given 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.490
 this can not be done either 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.200
 first because that party of estella 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.110
 I peeked and saw badly still can is 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.930
 perfect serves face 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.819
 also the place is not cool, you can not 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.639
 in place the web 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.650
 so it's possible that the horse is not the 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.310
 horse you can not you lost the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.950
 horse 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.270
 the horse we are going to see 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.270
 let's see how this 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.400
 I gave it three clicks at a time 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.470
 poor rich but yes yes that works with 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.170
 the eyes the deserts because it jumps 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.460
 stuck pulled but it's worth and I wanted to try 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.560
 Valeron these bugs I believe it snow 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.180
 to minecraft 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.650
 the iron is worth not put them 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.020
 also grace so do not do it with 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.000
 the boleros and villares what is there 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.280
 do not tell me this if the wiki can be 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.480
 when burning could shine the perfect 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.460
 uncle, how bad, because I'm angry 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.310
 but well this is the way you see a 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.690
 curious 7 to get the eggs is 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.470
 than that of making them explode 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.300
 Bugs cool a lot of time and bath but 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.440
