00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.330 
this point because you want that powder
to<00:02:31.420> adhere<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.230> primer<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:32.680> we<00:02:32.980> applied

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
to adhere to the primer that we applied

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.059 
to adhere to the primer that we applied
and<00:02:33.640> as<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.209> can<00:02:34.390> see<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> side<00:02:35.049> by<00:02:35.260> side<00:02:35.290> it

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
and as you can see a side by side it

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.270 
and as you can see a side by side it
looks<00:02:36.310> really<00:02:36.670> great<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.959> always<00:02:38.380> match<00:02:39.010> my

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
see from the beginning of the video my

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.250 
see from the beginning of the video my
face<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.890> darker<00:02:45.370> than<00:02:45.670> my<00:02:45.819> chest<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:46.930> match

it<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.739> my<00:02:48.040> chest<00:02:48.310> because<00:02:48.760> otherwise<00:02:49.269> my

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
foundation is going to be darker than my

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:35.220 
foundation is going to be darker than my
body<00:02:52.150> which<00:02:52.450> looks<00:02:52.720> weird
