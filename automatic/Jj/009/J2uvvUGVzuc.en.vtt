00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:25.999 
and then this is a little progression up

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:37.889 
and then this is a little progression up
here<00:05:26.479> on<00:05:26.749> the<00:05:27.049> 17th<00:05:27.679> fret<00:05:32.589> which<00:05:33.589> is<00:05:34.839> 17<00:05:35.839> spread

you can improvise that a little bit and

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.699 
you can improvise that a little bit and
then<00:05:53.479> here's<00:05:54.110> one<00:05:54.319> of<00:05:54.469> those<00:05:54.559> little

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.709 
runs just on the E string and that's
pretty<00:06:03.739> much<00:06:03.889> the<00:06:04.099> solo<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.909> fades<00:06:05.179> out<00:06:05.329> after
