that pump with a little bit of
Kristalina<00:00:26.029> shake<00:00:26.720> it<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:26.960> if<00:00:27.080> Kristalina<00:00:27.590> is

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
Kristalina shake it so if Kristalina is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.639 
Kristalina shake it so if Kristalina is
really<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.640> face<00:00:29.000> that<00:00:29.390> has<00:00:29.470> different<00:00:30.470> color

glitter flakes suspended

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.349 
glitter flakes suspended
whether<00:00:33.410> we're<00:00:33.710> using<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:34.280> silver<00:00:34.879> glitter<00:00:35.000> or

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:35.359 
whether we're using a silver glitter or

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.229 
whether we're using a silver glitter or
pink<00:00:35.660> glitter

views<00:00:37.899> I<00:00:38.200> would<00:00:38.379> suspend<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.520> fluid

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
views I would suspend that in a fluid

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.660 
views I would suspend that in a fluid
much<00:00:40.570> like<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.809> Kristalina<00:00:41.440> firstly<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.399> great

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
much like a Kristalina firstly is great

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.610 
much like a Kristalina firstly is great
because<00:00:42.850> it's<00:00:43.030> right<00:00:43.210> out<00:00:43.360> of<00:00:43.390> box<00:00:43.690> right<00:00:44.530> out

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
because it's right out of box right out

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.310 
because it's right out of box right out
of<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.800> bucket<00:00:45.190> so<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.399> speak<00:00:45.699> and<00:00:46.390> because

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
of the bucket so to speak and because

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.410 
of the bucket so to speak and because
there's<00:00:47.620> enough<00:00:47.860> clear<00:00:48.280> base<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:48.969> it<00:00:49.090> you<00:00:49.269> can

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
there's enough clear base in it you can

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.880 
there's enough clear base in it you can
see<00:00:49.660> through<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:50.110> so<00:00:50.140> it'll<00:00:50.410> take<00:00:50.559> all<00:00:50.769> the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
see through it so it'll take all the

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.860 
see through it so it'll take all the
color<00:00:51.129> underneath<00:00:51.390> since<00:00:52.390> we're<00:00:52.510> using<00:00:52.570> this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
color underneath since we're using this

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.049 
color underneath since we're using this
light<00:00:53.140> blue<00:00:53.489> crystalline<00:00:54.489> is<00:00:54.610> really<00:00:54.909> going

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
light blue crystalline is really going

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.729 
light blue crystalline is really going
to<00:00:55.150> add<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.570> little<00:00:55.750> bit<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:55.960> sparkle<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.589> that

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
to add a little bit of sparkle to that

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.250 
to add a little bit of sparkle to that
light<00:00:56.949> blue<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:58.690> here

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
light blue over here

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.459 
light blue over here
drop<00:01:00.250> down<00:01:00.489> my<00:01:00.699> screen

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.000 

here's<00:01:04.100> where<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.400> trick<00:01:04.640> is<00:01:05.380> to<00:01:06.380> run<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.650> big

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
here's where the trick is to run a big

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.830 
here's where the trick is to run a big
flake<00:01:07.369> like<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.670> crystalline<00:01:08.240> are<00:01:08.450> some<00:01:08.720> of

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
flake like a crystalline are some of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.550 
flake like a crystalline are some of
these<00:01:08.930> large<00:01:09.710> litters<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.390> weight<00:01:11.390> no<00:01:11.720> litter

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
these large litters of weight no litter

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.789 
these large litters of weight no litter
we<00:01:13.220> need<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.490> use<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> real<00:01:14.270> wide<00:01:14.570> open<00:01:14.930> mesh<00:01:15.170> we

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
we need to use a real wide open mesh we

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.350 
we need to use a real wide open mesh we
choose<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.250> use<00:01:16.280> they<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.409> 43<00:01:19.180> threads<00:01:20.180> per

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
choose to use they the 43 threads per

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.749 
choose to use they the 43 threads per
inch<00:01:20.390> because<00:01:21.320> it's<00:01:21.500> really<00:01:21.799> got<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.100> wide<00:01:22.399> open

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
inch because it's really got a wide open

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.280 
inch because it's really got a wide open
area<00:01:22.850> allows<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.420> big<00:01:23.630> place<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.200> go<00:01:24.320> through

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.160 

you<00:01:28.290> try<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.620> see<00:01:28.890> how<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> turns<00:01:29.430> gold<00:01:29.990> as<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you try to see how it turns gold as you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.870 
you try to see how it turns gold as you
smear<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:31.980> you<00:01:32.070> look<00:01:32.310> real<00:01:32.550> close

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
smear it but if you look real close

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.150 
smear it but if you look real close
we'll<00:01:33.330> get<00:01:33.480> some<00:01:33.660> close-ups<00:01:33.870> of<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:35.010> can

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
we'll get some close-ups of this you can

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.770 
we'll get some close-ups of this you can
see<00:01:35.190> other<00:01:35.490> colored<00:01:35.910> place<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.360> there<00:01:36.510> as<00:01:36.600> well

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
see other colored place in there as well

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170 
see other colored place in there as well
let's<00:01:37.650> go<00:01:37.830> ahead<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.160> have<00:01:38.310> Jason<00:01:38.760> loaded<00:01:39.090> up

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
let's go ahead and have Jason loaded up

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
let's go ahead and have Jason loaded up
a<00:01:39.360> white<00:01:39.960> shirt<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.130> exactly<00:01:41.370> what

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
a white shirt here and do exactly what

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.280 
a white shirt here and do exactly what
he's<00:01:41.820> done<00:01:41.970> before<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.510> then<00:01:42.600> set<00:01:42.900> that<00:01:43.110> right

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
he's done before and then set that right

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:54.530 
he's done before and then set that right
on<00:01:43.350> top

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.200 

there's<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> same<00:01:55.800> application<00:01:56.580> here<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
there's a same application here with the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.000 
there's a same application here with the
one<00:01:57.990> stroke<00:01:58.020> no<00:01:58.590> fly<00:01:58.890> real<00:01:59.700> thin<00:02:00.030> stencil<00:02:01.010> soft

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
one stroke no fly real thin stencil soft

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.370 
one stroke no fly real thin stencil soft
hand<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.550> background<00:02:03.090> soft<00:02:03.870> color<00:02:04.170> as

well

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.070 

so<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.600> hard<00:02:07.780> like<00:02:07.960> black<00:02:08.259> line

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.230 

still<00:02:12.470> keep<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.770> nice<00:02:13.070> bit<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.460> stroke<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.090> it's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
still keep a nice bit of stroke so it's

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.420 
still keep a nice bit of stroke so it's
real<00:02:14.450> clean

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.360 

no<00:02:18.670> washing<00:02:19.030> necessary<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.109> point

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.369 

now<00:02:26.910> because<00:02:27.090> we're<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.690> stack<00:02:28.050> this

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
now because we're going to stack this

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.860 
now because we're going to stack this
other<00:02:28.769> ink<00:02:29.129> right<00:02:29.489> on<00:02:29.640> top<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.239> puff<00:02:30.510> we'll

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
other ink right on top of the puff we'll

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470 
other ink right on top of the puff we'll
have<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.290> flash<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.890> ordinarily<00:02:32.790> will

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
have the flash here ordinarily will

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.600 
have the flash here ordinarily will
flash<00:02:33.900> colors<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.800> less<00:02:34.920> work<00:02:35.160> instead<00:02:35.489> of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
flash colors and less work instead of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:53.940 
flash colors and less work instead of
color

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.220 

so<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.310> puffs<00:02:54.520> just<00:02:54.910> gelled<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.959> little

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
so with the puffs just gelled a little

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.290 
so with the puffs just gelled a little
bit<00:02:56.349> this<00:02:57.130> takes<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.490> little<00:02:57.610> bit<00:02:57.880> more<00:02:58.060> tricky

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
bit this takes a little bit more tricky

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.540 
bit this takes a little bit more tricky
a<00:02:58.480> filler<00:02:58.870> stencil<00:02:59.410> here

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.040 

he's<00:03:02.880> going<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.180> set<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.540> right<00:03:03.780> over<00:03:03.960> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
he's going to set that right over the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.979 
he's going to set that right over the
top<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.560> pump

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.780 

it's<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:10.439> hard<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.829> see<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.129> first<00:03:11.430> because

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
it's really hard to see it first because

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.640 
it's really hard to see it first because
it's<00:03:11.939> very<00:03:12.150> milky<00:03:12.719> so<00:03:13.230> we're<00:03:13.349> going<00:03:13.469> to<00:03:13.560> go

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it's very milky so we're going to go

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.610 
it's very milky so we're going to go
ahead<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.980> simulate<00:03:14.189> the<00:03:14.579> tire<00:03:14.879> here<00:03:15.269> by<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
ahead and simulate the tire here by the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.819 
ahead and simulate the tire here by the
flash<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.659> clear<00:03:18.659> base<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.319> sits<00:03:19.590> in

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
flash with clear base that it sits in

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.280 
flash with clear base that it sits in
kind<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.640> gel<00:03:20.969> out<00:03:21.000> or<00:03:21.390> clear<00:03:21.689> out<00:03:21.719> so<00:03:22.049> we<00:03:22.140> can

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
kind of gel out or clear out so we can

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:37.730 
kind of gel out or clear out so we can
see<00:03:22.469> the<00:03:22.560> flakes

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.610 

just<00:03:38.100> adds<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.520> little

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
just adds a little

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.500 
just adds a little
a<00:03:39.650> little<00:03:40.099> shimmer<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.580> little<00:03:40.909> glitter<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.480> it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
a little shimmer a little glitter to it

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.839 
a little shimmer a little glitter to it
you<00:03:42.049> get<00:03:42.230> closer<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.709> that

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.789 

so<00:03:46.359> that's<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.689> couple<00:03:46.870> three<00:03:47.349> different

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
so that's a couple three different

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.220 
so that's a couple three different
applications<00:03:48.060> all-in-one<00:03:49.060> all<00:03:49.659> very<00:03:49.930> simple

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
applications all-in-one all very simple

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.039 
applications all-in-one all very simple
is<00:03:50.499> pretty<00:03:50.739> great<00:03:51.159> base<00:03:51.400> with<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:52.049> you'd

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
is pretty great base with you you'd

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.929 
is pretty great base with you you'd
obviously<00:03:53.230> have<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.859> get<00:03:54.069> we<00:03:54.340> roughing<00:03:54.790> the

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
obviously have to get we roughing the

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.239 
obviously have to get we roughing the
cost<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.569> our<00:03:55.749> product<00:03:56.049> line<00:03:56.439> we're<00:03:57.129> also

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:57.249 
cost of our product line we're also

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.759 
cost of our product line we're also
helping<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.819> value<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.540> idea<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.109> say

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
helping the value so the idea is say

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.069 
helping the value so the idea is say
we've<00:03:59.980> add<00:04:00.159> a<00:04:00.189> buck<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.849> our<00:04:00.969> claws<00:04:01.269> when<00:04:01.959> we

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
we've add a buck to our claws when we

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.470 
we've add a buck to our claws when we
get<00:04:02.260> three<00:04:02.560> bucks<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:03.069> lot<00:04:03.219> of<00:04:03.400> line<00:04:03.609> on<00:04:03.879> it<00:04:04.060> it's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
get three bucks a lot of line on it it's

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:13.620 
get three bucks a lot of line on it it's
worth<00:04:04.689> everything

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.690
