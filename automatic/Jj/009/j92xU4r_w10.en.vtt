00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
while had to actually go and jump it but

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
while had to actually go and jump it but
it<00:00:41.340> started<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.940> after<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.719> bit<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.740 
fight because it has been sitting out
here<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.809> quite<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> long<00:00:46.590> time<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> reason<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
here for quite a long time the reason I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
here for quite a long time the reason I
wanted<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.309> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
wanted to do this one is because it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.260 
wanted to do this one is because it's
actually<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:52.160> 5-speed<00:00:53.160> manual<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.879> cool<00:00:54.120> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
actually a 5-speed manual how cool is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.420 
actually a 5-speed manual how cool is
that<00:00:54.300> never<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:55.680> things<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.129> sticks

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that never see these things with sticks

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.889 
that never see these things with sticks
so<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> wanted<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> little

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
so that's what I wanted to do a little

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
so that's what I wanted to do a little

of course auto down driver's side window

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.580 
of course auto down driver's side window
here<00:01:16.400> not<00:01:16.610> auto<00:01:16.790> up<00:01:17.060> stool<00:01:17.450> for<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.900> really

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
here not auto up stool for that really

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.440 
here not auto up stool for that really
nice<00:01:18.800> materials<00:01:19.460> throughout<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.880> Rav<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.300> mean

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
nice materials throughout the Rav I mean

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.940 
nice materials throughout the Rav I mean
the<00:01:20.510> door<00:01:20.690> panels<00:01:21.020> are<00:01:21.110> hard<00:01:21.350> but<00:01:21.620> it's<00:01:21.800> got

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
the door panels are hard but it's got

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.160 
the door panels are hard but it's got
this<00:01:22.100> carpet<00:01:22.520> here<00:01:22.760> nice<00:01:23.390> door<00:01:23.660> pull<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.020> is

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
this carpet here nice door pull this is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.990 
this carpet here nice door pull this is
really<00:01:24.440> convenient<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.070> falls<00:01:25.220> really<00:01:25.640> close

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
really convenient and falls really close

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.810 
really convenient and falls really close
to<00:01:26.180> hand<00:01:26.360> car<00:01:27.229> windows<00:01:27.680> all<00:01:27.800> around<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.640> clock

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
to hand car windows all around the clock

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.640 
to hand car windows all around the clock
isn't<00:01:29.090> working<00:01:29.510> for<00:01:29.540> some<00:01:29.870> odd<00:01:29.990> reason<00:01:30.020> but

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
isn't working for some odd reason but

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.860 
isn't working for some odd reason but
probably<00:01:31.040> easily<00:01:31.460> fixable<00:01:31.760> air<00:01:32.270> conditioning

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
probably easily fixable air conditioning

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.450 
probably easily fixable air conditioning
is<00:01:33.250> blowing<00:01:34.250> cold<00:01:35.920> of<00:01:36.920> course<00:01:36.979> have<00:01:37.280> diff

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
is blowing cold of course have diff

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.060 
is blowing cold of course have diff
controls<00:01:37.850> here<00:01:38.300> or<00:01:38.990> well<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.260> think<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.680> locks

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
controls here or well I think that locks

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.510 
controls here or well I think that locks
the<00:01:40.220> all-wheel<00:01:40.550> drive<00:01:41.770> yeah<00:01:42.770> dip<00:01:43.009> Center<00:01:43.340> diff

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the all-wheel drive yeah dip Center diff

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.540 
the all-wheel drive yeah dip Center diff
lock<00:01:43.729> actually<00:01:44.150> so<00:01:44.420> that's<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:45.310> for<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.369> rear

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
lock actually so that's the for the rear

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.280 
lock actually so that's the for the rear
well<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.240> don't<00:01:47.570> know<00:01:47.630> if<00:01:47.690> we<00:01:47.780> really

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
well I don't know if we really

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.840 
well I don't know if we really
considered<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.860> rear<00:01:49.040> differential<00:01:49.520> because

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
considered the rear differential because

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.340 
considered the rear differential because
this<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.150> front-wheel<00:01:50.420> drive<00:01:50.540> base<00:01:51.020> but

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
this is front-wheel drive base but

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.190 
this is front-wheel drive base but
whatever<00:01:51.710> anyway<00:01:52.130> hazard<00:01:53.119> lights<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:54.110> of

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
whatever anyway hazard lights and of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.560 
whatever anyway hazard lights and of

at here it's considering for a while you
can<00:03:47.230> tell<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.890> cool<00:03:48.130> thing<00:03:48.340> about<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.670> rav4

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
can tell the cool thing about the rav4

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.449 
can tell the cool thing about the rav4
is<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.780> has<00:03:49.930> such<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.200> low<00:03:50.650> load<00:03:51.070> floor<00:03:51.430> I

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
is that it has such a low load floor I

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.260 
is that it has such a low load floor I
mean<00:03:51.670> look<00:03:51.790> at<00:03:51.880> that

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
mean look at that

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.600 
mean look at that
that's<00:03:52.510> paper-thin<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.470> it's<00:03:53.680> super<00:03:54.250> low<00:03:54.400> so

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
that's paper-thin and it's super low so

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.310 
that's paper-thin and it's super low so
there's<00:03:54.760> nothing<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.120> your<00:03:55.240> way<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.200> could

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
there's nothing in your way so you could

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.930 
there's nothing in your way so you could
literally<00:03:56.590> just<00:03:56.890> slide<00:03:57.040> something<00:03:57.640> in<00:03:57.730> here

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
literally just slide something in here

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.240 
literally just slide something in here
seats<00:03:58.870> don't<00:03:59.020> fold<00:03:59.140> flat<00:03:59.560> but<00:03:59.800> I<00:03:59.860> do<00:03:59.920> believe

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
seats don't fold flat but I do believe

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.050 
seats don't fold flat but I do believe
they<00:04:00.400> come<00:04:00.610> out<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.000> that's<00:04:01.810> also<00:04:02.080> an<00:04:02.320> option

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
they come out so that's also an option

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.750 
they come out so that's also an option
here<00:04:04.060> we<00:04:04.209> have<00:04:04.420> your<00:04:04.870> first<00:04:05.470> aid<00:04:05.680> kit
