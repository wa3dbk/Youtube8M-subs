00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hey everyone just wanted to do an update

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.960 
hey everyone just wanted to do an update
video<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.990> made<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> previous<00:00:04.830> video<00:00:05.190> on<00:00:05.549> how<00:00:05.940> to

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
video I made a previous video on how to

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.930 
video I made a previous video on how to
make<00:00:06.180> some<00:00:06.390> cheap<00:00:06.629> steel<00:00:07.049> targets<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.069> since

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
make some cheap steel targets and since

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.730 
make some cheap steel targets and since
then<00:00:09.120> I've<00:00:09.240> kind<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.450> upgraded<00:00:09.960> how<00:00:10.290> I've<00:00:10.469> done

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
then I've kind of upgraded how I've done

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.129 
then I've kind of upgraded how I've done
it<00:00:10.920> mainly<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.870> way<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.049> was

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it mainly because the way I was

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.780 
it mainly because the way I was
connecting<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.830> Shepherd's<00:00:14.280> hook<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
connecting the Shepherd's hook to the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.060 
connecting the Shepherd's hook to the
steel<00:00:15.089> plate<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> rope<00:00:15.929> was<00:00:16.619> allowing

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
steel plate with the rope was allowing

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
steel plate with the rope was allowing
too<00:00:17.250> much<00:00:17.570> playback<00:00:18.570> from<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> left<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
too much playback from the left to the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.300 
too much playback from the left to the
right

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
right

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.150 
right
throwing<00:00:21.029> those<00:00:21.199> you<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.800> bullet

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
throwing those you know the the bullet

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
throwing those you know the the bullet
itself<00:00:23.840> possibly<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> left<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.289> right

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
itself possibly in the left or right

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.019 
itself possibly in the left or right
direction<00:00:25.830> which<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.430> you're<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> woods

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
direction which if you're in the woods

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359 
direction which if you're in the woods
or<00:00:27.240> something<00:00:27.359> isn't<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> huge<00:00:28.080> deal<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.560> when

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
or something isn't a huge deal but when

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.009 
or something isn't a huge deal but when
you're<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> gun<00:00:30.240> range<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.630> obviously<00:00:30.960> just

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
you're at a gun range you obviously just

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.010 
you're at a gun range you obviously just
want<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> bullets<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> go<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:33.570> much<00:00:33.870> as

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
want the bullets to go down as much as

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.580 
want the bullets to go down as much as
possible<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> did<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.329> went<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
possible so what I did is I went to the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.310 
possible so what I did is I went to the
same<00:00:37.770> place<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.160> bought<00:00:38.370> these<00:00:38.899> steel<00:00:39.899> targets

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
same place I bought these steel targets

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680 
same place I bought these steel targets
just<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> local<00:00:40.770> salvage<00:00:41.129> yard<00:00:41.690> metal

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
just a local salvage yard metal

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.619 
just a local salvage yard metal
repository<00:00:43.379> type<00:00:43.620> place<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.309> padam<00:00:45.120> open<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
repository type place and padam open the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.360 
repository type place and padam open the
hole<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> little<00:00:46.559> bit<00:00:46.680> bigger<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.010> me

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
hole up just a little bit bigger for me

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.190 
hole up just a little bit bigger for me
so<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.760> able<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> Shepherd's<00:00:49.020> hook

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so I was able to get the Shepherd's hook

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.459 
so I was able to get the Shepherd's hook
through<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> hole<00:00:49.950> itself<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.850> hang<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
through the hole itself and hang the the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
through the hole itself and hang the the
plate<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> Shepherd's<00:00:53.520> hook<00:00:53.719> directly

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
plate on the Shepherd's hook directly

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
plate on the Shepherd's hook directly
without<00:00:55.170> having<00:00:55.559> any<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> roll<00:00:56.190> between

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
without having any kind of roll between

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.959 
without having any kind of roll between
the<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
the two and as you can see that

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
the two and as you can see that
definitely<00:00:59.969> helps<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.230> play<00:01:01.469> back

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
definitely helps with the the play back

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.439 
definitely helps with the the play back
and<00:01:01.980> forth<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> left<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.239> as

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and forth to the left you don't have as

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.000 
and forth to the left you don't have as
much<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.870> with<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> roll<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.769> can't

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
much of that with the roll you can't

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.450 
much of that with the roll you can't
spin<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> around<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.290> goes<00:01:07.500> back

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
spin it around it just really goes back

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
spin it around it just really goes back
and<00:01:08.729> forth<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.320> especially<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and forth like that especially with the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
and forth like that especially with the
bigger<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.010> when<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:13.100> wider<00:01:14.810> steel

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
bigger one when you have a wider steel

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
bigger one when you have a wider steel
plate<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.320> definitely<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> lot<00:01:17.369> less

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
plate it definitely will have a lot less

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
plate it definitely will have a lot less
play<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.020> left<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.470> just

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
play to the the left and right just

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
play to the the left and right just
really<00:01:20.150> swinging<00:01:21.150> back<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.330> forth<00:01:21.570> which<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
really swinging back and forth which is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
really swinging back and forth which is
ultimately<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.299> round

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ultimately what you want so that round

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.070 
ultimately what you want so that round
is<00:01:24.659> deflected<00:01:25.229> downward<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> altogether<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
is deflected downward so altogether you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.359 
is deflected downward so altogether you
know<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> Shepherd's<00:01:28.920> hook<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.250> was

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
know with the Shepherd's hook which was

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
know with the Shepherd's hook which was
about<00:01:29.579> $15<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.659> steel<00:01:30.930> plates

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
about $15 the steel plates

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
about $15 the steel plates
depending<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> size<00:01:32.880> those<00:01:33.270> were<00:01:33.479> about

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
depending on the size those were about

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.620 
depending on the size those were about
$15<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> piece<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> know<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> paint<00:01:36.420> and
