00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.510
 nieheim attitude of exotic animals in 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.610
 Terraria is becoming increasingly popular 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.950
 who before the decision is committed 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.140
 Terrarium I already have to buy 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.119
 to consider the entry of the animal 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.310
 which terrarium it should be 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.489
 The choice is big and your own 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.009
 Wishes are barely set 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.899
 in the choice of the driver or the 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.939
 terrorist did business man centrally 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.809
 and want to buy as a finished terrarium 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.640
 of course has the whole big choice 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.980
 you get all- glass terraria already for 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.560
 a few hundred euros 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.830
 just as well as usb terrarien the one 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.250
 as a kit can buy up to 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.010
 terrain of the luxury class we are looking forward to 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.380
 then have specialized 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.450
 few variants of usb you only with 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.329
 the most necessary technology 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.489
 already from 500 to 600 euro to have 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.380
 disadvantage is that you have the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.229
 landscape in own construction must make 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.630
 what new at terraria especially 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.700
 can not lead to the final result 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.010
 according to your own ideas 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.350
 who, however, high demands on his 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.750
 terrarium has and is ready for it 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.700
 Investing a little more can be different 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.870
 a specialized terrarium farmer 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.630
 seek advice 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.229
 a normal terrarium summer for one 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.720
 bartagame 1 60 80 120 so what 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.940
 sometimes cupboard in the high quality 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.430
 exhibition with foundation on it is therefore 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.670
 to 200,000 euros in a construction like 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.080
 So it makes 90 mm chipboard with 2 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.450
 mm on laimer rounded edges really 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.729
 top really processed the one 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.060
 terrarium not only to containers intended 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.130
 a piece of furniture will be considered future 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.320
 So you should already keep in mind 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.689
 the purchase exactly over the needs of the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.740
 inform animal that later once 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.080
 to move in 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.330
 not only does this play a sufficient role 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.310
 size of the terrarium 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.030
 other factors contribute to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.049
 well-being of the later resident 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.380
 the light has to fit 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.330
 the feeling must be right 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.450
 according to the respective well-kept 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.610
 animal the insulation must fit 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 the size must above all hire cash 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.940
 many tend to look closer 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.310
 far too small to build 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.320
 I see my task in it in 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 Talk to customers so advise him 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.100
 that he is the right size the right one 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.230
 implementation creates terraria for animals 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.330
 are built mainly under 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.000
 Living warm conditions is one 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.460
 intact ventilation and ventilation essential 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.250
 If this is not the case it can be for the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.020
 animal quickly become dangerous all 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.390
 terrariums need a way and 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.700
 venting due to the temperature rise 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.400
 the cold air from the room rises 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.170
 is drawn down up up I have 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.240
 top out again otherwise there is this 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.280
 is not just a blanket but with 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.050
 our trap also in the light box so 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.620
 Both things need a sensible one 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.620
 ventilation 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.440
 this must be so generous 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.640
 depending on the species that these cities 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.200
 air exchange is absolutely guaranteed 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.390
 One should also be clear 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.400
 be about what other costs with 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.570
 the terrarium and its inhabitants in 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.640
 connection 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.710
 because as with any pet it is with 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.900
 the pure purchase not done 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.200
 in addition to the acquisition costs must 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.300
 Of course, consider the follow-up costs 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.150
 from the mother animal quite quite 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.310
 nice in the cost can beat 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.690
 Of course, the electricity costs too 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.240
 I'm in such a way 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.340
 all gloomy burn about four times 70 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.590
 watt and that about twelve hours a day 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.690
 then you can extrapolate what you 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.360
 approximately with electricity costs in addition 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.190
 but if you have a dog 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.810
 one also knows that everyone 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.960
 Day eats when you compare that 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.430
 it is not that much anymore 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.680
 overall there are many factors that can 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.500
 have to consider if you have a terrarium in 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.300
 Above all, one would like to build one-on-one 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.000
 good advice and a rough calculation 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.550
 the costs decide on success and costs 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.660
 Failure especially for newcomers 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.660
 in the field of terraristics
