00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
for super zoo this year we thought we'd

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
for super zoo this year we thought we'd
try<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> find<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.080> we<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.410> fit<00:00:43.650> in<00:00:43.800> with

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
try to find out how we can fit in with

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.750 
try to find out how we can fit in with
the<00:00:44.840> far<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:45.930> pets<00:00:46.260> pet<00:00:46.800> owners<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.520> while<00:00:47.640> how

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the far as pets pet owners and while how

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.400 
the far as pets pet owners and while how
we<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.059> help<00:00:48.180> them<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.510> monitor<00:00:48.960> their<00:00:49.170> pets

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
we can help them all monitor their pets

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.720 
we can help them all monitor their pets
because<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.040> all<00:00:50.190> about<00:00:50.400> the<00:00:50.550> pet

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because it's all about the pet

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.820 
because it's all about the pet
environment<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> products<00:00:52.770> that

area<00:01:50.729> where<00:01:50.969> they<00:01:51.179> have<00:01:51.359> Sun<00:01:51.659> heat<00:01:52.289> so<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
area where they have Sun heat so you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
area where they have Sun heat so you
want<00:01:52.859> to<00:01:52.920> monitor<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> temperature<00:01:54.000> again

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
want to monitor that temperature again

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.169 
want to monitor that temperature again
you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.109> have<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.579> readout<00:01:56.579> your<00:01:56.789> receiver

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
you can have your readout your receiver

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.020 
you can have your readout your receiver
up<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> 330<00:01:58.140> way<00:01:58.409> feet<00:01:58.890> away<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.640> pick<00:01:59.850> up<00:02:00.000> that
