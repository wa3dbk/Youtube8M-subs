video is going to be discussing

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:09.830 
video is going to be discussing
tensioning<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.760> upper<00:00:09.059> belt<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.540> your

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
tensioning the upper belt on your

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.129 
tensioning the upper belt on your
Shopsmith<00:00:10.620> mark<00:00:10.889> 5<00:00:11.389> this<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> upper<00:00:12.900> belt

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
Shopsmith mark 5 this is the upper belt

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.980 
Shopsmith mark 5 this is the upper belt
here<00:00:13.380> we're<00:00:13.559> talking<00:00:13.740> about

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
here we're talking about

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.800 
here we're talking about
Pallavi<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.470> case<00:00:17.330> they<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.539> stretch

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
Pallavi in this case they can stretch

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.150 
Pallavi in this case they can stretch
over<00:00:19.109> time<00:00:19.490> so<00:00:20.490> occasionally<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.480> to

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
over time so occasionally I have to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
over time so occasionally I have to
tension<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.400> belt<00:00:23.720> you<00:00:24.720> don't<00:00:24.900> want<00:00:25.019> too<00:00:25.199> much

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
tension the belt you don't want too much

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
tension the belt you don't want too much
tension<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.250> create

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
tension in there it can create

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.939 
tension in there it can create
overheating<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> drive<00:00:28.529> sleeve

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
overheating up here in the drive sleeve

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.040 
overheating up here in the drive sleeve
but<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.000> don't<00:00:30.179> want<00:00:30.300> too<00:00:30.480> little<00:00:30.510> tension

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
but you don't want too little tension

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.569 
but you don't want too little tension
either<00:00:31.320> because<00:00:31.590> they<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.830> slip<00:00:32.130> across<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
either because they can slip across the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.660 
either because they can slip across the
drive<00:00:33.149> sleeve<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.710> start<00:00:35.100> shredding<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
drive sleeve and start shredding the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270 
drive sleeve and start shredding the
belts<00:00:36.030> wearing<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> belt<00:00:36.780> prematurely<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
belts wearing the belt prematurely and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.330 
belts wearing the belt prematurely and
again<00:00:38.579> causing<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.180> heat<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:40.350> also<00:00:40.379> losing

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
again causing more heat but also losing

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.209 
again causing more heat but also losing
power<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.300> shafts<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.860> belt<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
power to your shafts if the belt is

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
power to your shafts if the belt is
slipping<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> maintain<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
slipping so you want to maintain a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.459 
slipping so you want to maintain a
little<00:00:47.010> bit<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.340> tension<00:00:47.899> there's<00:00:48.899> two<00:00:49.170> belts

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
little bit of tension there's two belts

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.700 
little bit of tension there's two belts
involved<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.969> Pallavi<00:00:51.510> belt<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.469> have

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
involved the Pallavi belt like we have

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.950 
involved the Pallavi belt like we have
on<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.460> unit<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:56.370> grooves<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.940> parallel<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
on this unit the grooves are parallel to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.680 
on this unit the grooves are parallel to
the<00:00:58.079> side<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> belt<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.480> then<00:01:00.480> there's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the side of the belt and then there's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.900 
the side of the belt and then there's
the<00:01:00.960> Gilmer<00:01:01.559> style<00:01:01.949> which<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.399> call<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the Gilmer style which I call it like a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.899 
the Gilmer style which I call it like a
tank<00:01:03.270> tread<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.870> got<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.260> grooves<00:01:05.100> going

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
tank tread it's got the grooves going

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
tank tread it's got the grooves going
across<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.760> belt<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.409> applies<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
across the belt so this applies to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.200 
across the belt so this applies to
either<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> them<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> first<00:01:14.820> off<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.030> have

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
either one of them so first off you have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
either one of them so first off you have
to<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:16.020> belt<00:01:16.320> cover<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> way

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to take your belt cover out of the way

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
to take your belt cover out of the way
you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:17.970> easily<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
you can do this very easily with the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.399 
you can do this very easily with the
mark-5<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.979> bench<00:01:20.869> get<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.049> cover<00:01:22.320> out

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
mark-5 on your bench get the cover out

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
mark-5 on your bench get the cover out
of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.710> way<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.390> you're<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> be

of the way and you're going to be

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.359 
of the way and you're going to be
working<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.619> area<00:01:26.009> right<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:28.040> on<00:01:29.040> most

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
working in this area right here on most

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.850 
working in this area right here on most
mark<00:01:29.640> five<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.869> an<00:01:31.049> allen<00:01:31.409> bolt<00:01:31.619> right

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
mark five there's an allen bolt right

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.149 
mark five there's an allen bolt right
here<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.310> loosen<00:01:34.340> don't<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.729> touch<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
here you loosen don't have to touch this

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.620 
here you loosen don't have to touch this
then<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> use<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.909> screwdriver<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
right place to simply tighten that back

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.910 
right place to simply tighten that back
down<00:01:53.800> but<00:01:54.100> not<00:01:54.310> over<00:01:54.670> tightening<00:01:55.150> I<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:56.740> to

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
down but not over tightening I like to

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.610 
down but not over tightening I like to
push<00:01:57.160> in<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:58.300> just<00:01:58.510> feel<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.750> very<00:01:59.020> slight<00:01:59.260> give

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
push in and just feel a very slight give

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.120 
push in and just feel a very slight give
in<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.950> belt<00:02:00.190> not<00:02:01.090> even<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.450> quarter-inch<00:02:01.810> push

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:14.100 

just<00:02:06.130> fine<00:02:06.400> also<00:02:10.830> pallavi<00:02:11.830> belt<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.840> end<00:02:13.959> up

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
just fine also pallavi belt you end up

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.340 
just fine also pallavi belt you end up
needing<00:02:14.290> more<00:02:14.590> tension<00:02:15.190> than<00:02:16.080> getting<00:02:17.080> up<00:02:17.200> to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
needing more tension than getting up to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.740 
needing more tension than getting up to
this<00:02:17.560> 90-degree<00:02:18.130> place<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.209> consider<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
this 90-degree place then I consider the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.199 
this 90-degree place then I consider the
belt<00:02:19.930> stretched<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.950> don't<00:02:21.730> really<00:02:21.880> want<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
belt stretched I don't really want to

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.260 
belt stretched I don't really want to
see<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.720> notch<00:02:22.959> get<00:02:23.290> way<00:02:23.440> up<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.270> it's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
see this notch get way up in here it's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.170 
see this notch get way up in here it's
really<00:02:25.600> maxed<00:02:25.959> out<00:02:26.110> when<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:26.470> straight<00:02:26.830> up

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
really maxed out when it's straight up

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.940 
really maxed out when it's straight up
so<00:02:28.180> anyway<00:02:28.450> once<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.870> gets<00:02:29.050> past<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.530> point<00:02:29.770> I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
so anyway once it gets past this point I

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.020 
so anyway once it gets past this point I
consider<00:02:30.340> develop<00:02:30.730> kind<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.840> over<00:02:32.110> stretched

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
consider develop kind of over stretched

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.890 
consider develop kind of over stretched
but<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.300> Gilmer<00:02:34.720> style<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:36.070> one<00:02:36.340> here

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
but on the Gilmer style this one here

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.300 
but on the Gilmer style this one here
you<00:02:37.900> really<00:02:38.230> end<00:02:38.380> up<00:02:38.500> starting<00:02:39.160> off<00:02:39.280> here

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
you really end up starting off here

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.210 
you really end up starting off here
there<00:02:39.730> just<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.060> slightly<00:02:40.360> longer<00:02:40.690> belt<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:42.190> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
there just a slightly longer belt so the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.790 
there just a slightly longer belt so the
Gilmer's<00:02:42.820> quite<00:02:43.360> often<00:02:43.570> do<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.200> be<00:02:44.350> if

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
Gilmer's quite often do have to be if

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.250 
Gilmer's quite often do have to be if
they're<00:02:44.950> not<00:02:45.070> jumping<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:45.610> range<00:02:45.910> here<00:02:46.360> if

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
they're not jumping this range here if

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.740 
they're not jumping this range here if
you're<00:02:47.470> down<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:48.010> with<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.190> Gilmer<00:02:48.750> it's

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
you're down in here with a Gilmer it's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.050 
you're down in here with a Gilmer it's
too<00:02:50.590> slack<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.459> can<00:02:51.640> start<00:02:52.030> jumping<00:02:54.060> while

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
too slack and it can start jumping while

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.430 
too slack and it can start jumping while
you're<00:02:55.239> at<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.360> make<00:02:55.660> sure<00:02:55.840> there's<00:02:56.019> no<00:02:56.110> cracks

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
you're at it make sure there's no cracks

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.009 
you're at it make sure there's no cracks
no<00:02:56.709> broken<00:02:57.239> points<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.390> here<00:02:58.600> because<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.870> is

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
no broken points in here because this is

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.900 
no broken points in here because this is
kind<00:02:59.049> of<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.500> fragile<00:02:59.970> part<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.180> casting

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
kind of a fragile part of the casting

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.979 
kind of a fragile part of the casting
don't<00:03:03.910> over<00:03:04.180> tighten<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:04.810> basically

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
don't over tighten it you just basically

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.380 
don't over tighten it you just basically
want<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:06.100> not<00:03:06.250> vibrating<00:03:06.940> out<00:03:07.209> of

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
want this it's not vibrating out of

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.820 
want this it's not vibrating out of
position<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:10.750> snug<00:03:11.049> enough<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.680> know<00:03:11.769> to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
position just snug enough you know to

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.520 
position just snug enough you know to
prevent<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.340> movement<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:14.110> some<00:03:14.440> people

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
prevent that movement so some people

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.500 
prevent that movement so some people
crank<00:03:15.100> them<00:03:15.220> down<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.640> end<00:03:15.820> up<00:03:15.940> breaking<00:03:16.239> this

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
crank them down and end up breaking this

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.960 
crank them down and end up breaking this
right<00:03:16.750> here<00:03:17.049> so<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.380> don't<00:03:17.470> want<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.910> now<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
right here so you don't want that now a
