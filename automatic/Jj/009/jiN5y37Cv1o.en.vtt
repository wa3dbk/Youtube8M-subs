00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:06.140
 but the honest color explosives 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.609
 but its technically good you have to 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.230
 confuse the explosion was alfredo and 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.110
 equivalent that was me since I was the 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.110
 that I had the detonator and I when 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.849
 calculated that you are not being able 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.890
 general please excuse my partner 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.249
 he has a big problem of 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.369
 temperament 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:33.770
 and it's also partly the reason why 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.070
 that he talks so he's talking his 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.500
 Wolf 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.239
 I mean, let's say that alfredo had a 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.760
 some disagreement with the committee of 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.410
 behavior is not true I told them that 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.750
 they were miserable like me so 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.670
 they could go to the truth 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.519
 basically that and as a positive measure 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.000
 they decided to install a device 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.000
 censorship 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.019

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.670
 I go out a go lose is a look 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.479

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.720
 permission 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.630

 if you have any problems 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.740

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.600
 particle accelerator sir our 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.060

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.560

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.120

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.890
 monitor agreement and all calls 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.510
 incoming I had to disconnect the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:25.519
 phone was getting down to me non-stop 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.930
 I'm burning I'm stuck in a 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.069
 hole without ventilation and I only have left 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.910
 four minutes until the end of the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.900

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.450

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.830
 control panel door not even 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.700
 I saw that the door was locked and I did not 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.700
 like strength in things 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.420
 as perfect boeing without problems the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.420
 reason to sue anyone

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.840

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.370
 be difficult just to lend all 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.370

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.840
