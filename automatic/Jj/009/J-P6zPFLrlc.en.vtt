know I can I tomatoes and also we see

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.349 
know I can I tomatoes and also we see
the<00:00:58.469> trend<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.949> architecture<00:00:59.910> is<00:00:59.940> turning

the trend that architecture is turning

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.590 
the trend that architecture is turning
to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.899> more<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.680> business<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:03.210> should

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
to be more like a business and we should

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960 
to be more like a business and we should
not<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> thinking<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.790> should

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
not have that way of thinking we should

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.960 
not have that way of thinking we should
keep<00:01:06.119> architecture<00:01:06.840> independent<00:01:07.729> which<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
keep architecture independent which is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.570 
keep architecture independent which is
