00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
I guess I got a percent completion

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.650 
I guess I got a percent completion
that's<00:03:33.680> probably<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.670> only<00:03:34.790> use<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.390> and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
that's probably the only use in this and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.259 
that's probably the only use in this and
other<00:03:36.110> than<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.220> they<00:03:37.400> use<00:03:37.610> this<00:03:37.850> just

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
other than that they use this just

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.990 
other than that they use this just
because<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:38.870> fun<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.200> do<00:03:39.700> because<00:03:40.700> they<00:03:40.910> are

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
because it's fun to do because they are

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.759 
because it's fun to do because they are
kind<00:03:41.209> of<00:03:41.269> fun<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.480> mean<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.200> kind<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.560> break

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
kind of fun I mean it's kind of a break

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.900 
kind of fun I mean it's kind of a break
from<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.070> seriousness<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.820> game<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.000> guess

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
from the seriousness of the game I guess

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.759 
from the seriousness of the game I guess
but<00:03:46.910> other<00:03:47.180> than<00:03:47.360> that<00:03:47.420> just<00:03:47.600> go<00:03:48.200> around<00:03:48.320> get

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
but other than that just go around get

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.759
