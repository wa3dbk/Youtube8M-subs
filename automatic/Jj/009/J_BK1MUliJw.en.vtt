use 207 887 1378 that should get you the
same<00:00:26.730> map<00:00:26.910> as<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:28.349> fail-proof<00:00:28.619> version

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
same map as this more fail-proof version

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.849 
same map as this more fail-proof version
of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.090> seed<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.320> couple<00:00:31.470> spawn

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
of the seed so there's a couple spawn

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.590 
of the seed so there's a couple spawn
points<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.399> every<00:00:32.669> world<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
points like every world but the one that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.049 
points like every world but the one that
I<00:00:33.750> came<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.920> pretty<00:00:35.190> epic<00:00:35.370> sort<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
I came by was a pretty epic sort of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.819 
I came by was a pretty epic sort of
overhang<00:00:36.570> area<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.440> there's<00:00:37.590> grass

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
overhang area where there's grass

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.380 
overhang area where there's grass
growing<00:00:38.250> under<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.610> overhangs<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.270> it's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
growing under the overhangs but it's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
growing under the overhangs but it's
pretty<00:00:39.510> dark<00:00:39.840> down<00:00:39.899> there<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.100> see

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
pretty dark down there as you can see

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
pretty dark down there as you can see
that<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:42.000> part<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> cliff<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:43.050> looked

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that one part in the cliff there looked

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990 
that one part in the cliff there looked
like<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> heart<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> thought<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.820> was

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
like a heart so I thought that that was

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.229 
like a heart so I thought that that was
pretty<00:00:45.510> cool<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> start<00:00:46.430> start<00:00:47.430> off<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.820> also

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
pretty cool to start start off with also

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
pretty cool to start start off with also
here's<00:00:48.420> sort<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> secret<00:00:49.200> valley<00:00:49.559> type

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
here's sort of like a secret valley type

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
here's sort of like a secret valley type
pretty<00:00:51.030> crazy<00:00:51.360> place<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.960> didn't<00:00:52.140> even<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
pretty crazy place I didn't even get to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
pretty crazy place I didn't even get to
explore<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.820> pretty<00:00:54.090> awesome

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
explore at all but it's pretty awesome

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
explore at all but it's pretty awesome
just<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> area<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
just the area that's right there and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250 
just the area that's right there and
it's<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.270> big<00:00:57.510> though<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.020> doesn't

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it's not that big though so it doesn't

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
it's not that big though so it doesn't
take<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> map<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> map<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.359> kind

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
take up all the map so the map can kind

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.439 
take up all the map so the map can kind
of<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> realistic<00:01:01.760> also<00:01:02.760> there's<00:01:03.000> some<00:01:03.300> pretty

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
of be realistic also there's some pretty

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.119 
of be realistic also there's some pretty
cool<00:01:03.660> cave<00:01:03.899> systems<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.920> access

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
cool cave systems you can just access

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
cool cave systems you can just access
from<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> surface<00:01:06.000> instead<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.229> being<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
from the surface instead of just being a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230 
from the surface instead of just being a
hole<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> side<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> cliff<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.820> sort<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
hole in the side of the cliff to sort of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.600 
hole in the side of the cliff to sort of
like<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> drop-down<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.200> sand<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:11.490> are

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
like a drop-down up sand and there are

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
like a drop-down up sand and there are
also<00:01:11.760> some<00:01:12.180> floating<00:01:12.780> bricks<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> sand<00:01:13.530> not

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
also some floating bricks of sand not

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.859 
also some floating bricks of sand not
even<00:01:14.100> sandstone<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.270> normal<00:01:15.450> sand

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
even sandstone but just like normal sand

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.679 
even sandstone but just like normal sand
and<00:01:16.220> yeah<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.520> desert<00:01:17.850> area<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.210> pretty<00:01:18.479> epic

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and yeah the desert area is pretty epic

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
and yeah the desert area is pretty epic
too<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:19.770> massive<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> doesn't

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
too it's pretty massive but it doesn't

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.929 
too it's pretty massive but it doesn't
take<00:01:20.970> away<00:01:21.119> from<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.530> forests<00:01:23.130> um<00:01:23.340> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
take away from the forests um it's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
take away from the forests um it's
definitely<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> decent<00:01:24.720> desert<00:01:25.200> sighs<00:01:25.470> um

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
definitely a decent desert sighs um

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
definitely a decent desert sighs um
perfect<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.090> would<00:01:27.330> say<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
perfect for what i would say for to be a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.289 
perfect for what i would say for to be a
desert<00:01:28.740> biome<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:29.490> world<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.689> by<00:01:30.930> far<00:01:31.170> my

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
desert biome on any world but by far my

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.640 
desert biome on any world but by far my
basically<00:01:33.299> favorite<00:01:33.659> thing<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.020> i<00:01:34.049> found<00:01:34.320> is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
basically favorite thing that i found is

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
basically favorite thing that i found is
this<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:35.159> tiny<00:01:35.579> cave<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.270> really<00:01:36.509> easy

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
this very tiny cave that's really easy

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.530 
this very tiny cave that's really easy
to<00:01:36.930> miss<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.799> access<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> side

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to miss that you access through the side

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.469
