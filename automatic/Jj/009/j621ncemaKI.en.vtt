was<00:03:39.639> slightly<00:03:39.959> misjudged<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.470> despite<00:03:41.979> the

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
was slightly misjudged and I despite the

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.649 
was slightly misjudged and I despite the
whole<00:03:42.310> thing<00:03:42.519> didn't<00:03:42.909> I<00:03:43.060> connect<00:03:43.419> emotionally

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
whole thing didn't I connect emotionally

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.270 
whole thing didn't I connect emotionally
the<00:03:43.959> way<00:03:44.079> that<00:03:44.259> they<00:03:44.349> wanted<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.769> well<00:03:45.099> it<00:03:45.189> was

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
the way that they wanted it well it was

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.800 
the way that they wanted it well it was
there<00:03:45.519> are<00:03:45.759> so<00:03:45.879> many<00:03:46.030> different<00:03:46.150> things<00:03:46.479> they

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
there are so many different things they

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.780 
there are so many different things they
are<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.989> libretto<00:03:47.349> I<00:03:47.500> think<00:03:47.859> of<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.370> page<00:03:48.579> is

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
are the libretto I think of the page is

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.179 
are the libretto I think of the page is
what<00:03:48.939> incredibly<00:03:49.750> moving<00:03:49.989> about<00:03:50.349> about<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
what incredibly moving about about the

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.129 
what incredibly moving about about the
plague<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.669> you<00:03:51.849> you<00:03:52.299> get<00:03:52.449> all<00:03:52.569> sorts<00:03:52.780> ends<00:03:53.049> a

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
plague and you you get all sorts ends a

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.869 
plague and you you get all sorts ends a
different<00:03:53.470> place<00:03:53.650> including<00:03:53.919> aids<00:03:54.430> as<00:03:54.639> well

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
different place including aids as well

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.759 
different place including aids as well
and<00:03:55.419> there's<00:03:55.900> all<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.109> thing<00:03:56.290> about<00:03:56.409> survivor

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
and there's all the thing about survivor

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.770 
and there's all the thing about survivor
guilt<00:03:57.069> too<00:03:57.459> did<00:03:57.759> you<00:03:57.790> feel<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.150> he<00:03:58.449> invested

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
guilt too did you feel that he invested

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.999 
guilt too did you feel that he invested
enough<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.500> himself<00:04:00.400> in<00:04:00.819> that<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.599> really<00:04:02.560> did<00:04:02.769> I

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
enough of himself in that I really did I

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.740 
enough of himself in that I really did I
have<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.310> be<00:04:03.519> honest<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:03.970> completely

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
have to be honest I completely

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.330 
have to be honest I completely
acknowledge<00:04:05.199> that<00:04:05.379> an<00:04:05.439> opera<00:04:05.650> singer<00:04:05.680> would

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
acknowledge that an opera singer would

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.429 
acknowledge that an opera singer would
probably<00:04:06.759> sing<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.180> objectively<00:04:07.750> better<00:04:08.019> I

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
probably sing it objectively better I

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.229 
probably sing it objectively better I
just<00:04:08.979> think<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.250> show<00:04:09.400> would<00:04:09.549> be<00:04:09.579> worse<00:04:09.879> if<00:04:10.120> it

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
just think the show would be worse if it

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.759 
just think the show would be worse if it
didn't<00:04:10.449> have<00:04:10.509> my<00:04:10.689> comment<00:04:11.049> in<00:04:11.139> it<00:04:11.229> his<00:04:11.560> voice

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
didn't have my comment in it his voice

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.129 
didn't have my comment in it his voice
maybe<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.220> little<00:04:12.400> rattled<00:04:12.729> by<00:04:13.659> the<00:04:13.720> end<00:04:13.989> of

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
maybe a little rattled by the end of

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.780 
maybe a little rattled by the end of
this<00:04:14.290> run<00:04:14.530> its<00:04:14.919> realness<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.400> doesn't<00:04:15.639> sound

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
this run its realness that doesn't sound

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.490 
this run its realness that doesn't sound
super<00:04:16.180> strong<00:04:16.449> even<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.079> day<00:04:17.199> that<00:04:17.349> we<00:04:17.469> went

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
very important in the atmosphere of this

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.230 
very important in the atmosphere of this
but<00:05:52.650> on<00:05:52.889> the<00:05:53.039> state<00:05:53.219> I<00:05:53.250> mean<00:05:53.430> what<00:05:53.849> do<00:05:53.940> you<00:05:54.000> feel

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
but on the state I mean what do you feel

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.490 
but on the state I mean what do you feel
about<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.479> way<00:05:54.569> he<00:05:54.719> inhabited<00:05:54.960> that<00:05:55.289> seat

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
about the way he inhabited that seat

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.899 
about the way he inhabited that seat
because<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:55.889> fact<00:05:56.039> it's<00:05:56.340> difficult<00:05:56.669> when<00:05:56.819> you

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
because in fact it's difficult when you

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.309 
because in fact it's difficult when you
haven't<00:05:57.090> actually<00:05:57.330> got<00:05:57.599> furniture<00:05:57.810> so<00:05:58.229> the

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
haven't actually got furniture so the

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.749 
haven't actually got furniture so the
set<00:05:58.469> of<00:05:58.590> furniture<00:05:59.009> what<00:05:59.159> there<00:05:59.310> was<00:05:59.340> lots<00:05:59.610> of

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
set of furniture what there was lots of

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.850 
set of furniture what there was lots of
music<00:05:59.969> stands<00:06:00.569> and<00:06:01.409> then<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.650> others

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
music stands and then the others

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.589 
music stands and then the others
wonderful<00:06:02.430> projection<00:06:02.969> that<00:06:03.090> was<00:06:03.270> actually

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
wonderful projection that was actually

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.390 
wonderful projection that was actually
very<00:06:03.659> quickly<00:06:04.020> but<00:06:04.560> how<00:06:04.919> do<00:06:04.979> you<00:06:05.129> feel<00:06:05.370> about

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
very quickly but how do you feel about

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.129 
very quickly but how do you feel about
these<00:06:05.729> music<00:06:06.270> stands<00:06:06.509> than<00:06:06.659> having<00:06:06.840> to<00:06:06.930> weave

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
these music stands than having to weave

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.689 
these music stands than having to weave
his<00:06:07.349> way<00:06:07.409> around<00:06:07.650> them<00:06:08.039> I<00:06:08.250> think<00:06:08.520> they<00:06:08.580> just

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
his way around them I think they just

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:09.740 
his way around them I think they just
needed<00:06:08.940> something<00:06:09.210> for<00:06:09.419> him<00:06:09.509> to<00:06:09.599> do

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
needed something for him to do

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.909 
needed something for him to do
physically<00:06:10.199> because<00:06:10.440> probably<00:06:10.680> just

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
physically because probably just

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.320 
physically because probably just
probably<00:06:11.099> so<00:06:11.340> he<00:06:11.430> can<00:06:11.580> move<00:06:11.699> around<00:06:11.879> a<00:06:12.150> bit<00:06:12.180> and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
probably so he can move around a bit and

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.640 
probably so he can move around a bit and
so<00:06:12.599> you've<00:06:12.750> got<00:06:12.930> something<00:06:13.139> to<00:06:13.229> look<00:06:13.469> at<00:06:13.620> and

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
so you've got something to look at and

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.529 
so you've got something to look at and
you<00:06:14.219> know<00:06:14.340> it's<00:06:14.520> very<00:06:14.669> start<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.300> set

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
you know it's very start the set

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.659 
you know it's very start the set
beautiful<00:06:16.259> and<00:06:16.469> I<00:06:17.009> do<00:06:17.069> think<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.460> use<00:06:17.639> of

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
beautiful and I do think the use of

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.249 
beautiful and I do think the use of
projection<00:06:18.419> is<00:06:18.539> very<00:06:18.719> clever<00:06:18.960> and<00:06:19.110> very

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
projection is very clever and very

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.930 
projection is very clever and very
elegant<00:06:19.560> it<00:06:19.860> gives<00:06:20.009> him<00:06:20.129> someone<00:06:20.460> to<00:06:20.580> interact

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
elegant it gives him someone to interact

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.580 
elegant it gives him someone to interact
with<00:06:21.000> although<00:06:21.210> it<00:06:21.389> was

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
with although it was

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.720 
with although it was
another<00:06:21.830> person<00:06:22.220> you<00:06:22.310> know<00:06:22.430> and<00:06:22.580> that's

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
another person you know and that's

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.520 
another person you know and that's
that's<00:06:22.970> really<00:06:23.330> lovely<00:06:23.510> but<00:06:24.080> I'm<00:06:24.170> interested

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
that's really lovely but I'm interested

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.900 
that's really lovely but I'm interested
in<00:06:24.620> you<00:06:24.800> know<00:06:25.130> whether<00:06:25.340> you<00:06:25.490> felt<00:06:25.700> that<00:06:25.850> you

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
in you know whether you felt that you

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.190 
in you know whether you felt that you
connected<00:06:26.390> with<00:06:26.450> the<00:06:26.600> character<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.050> lot

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
connected with the character a lot

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.150 
connected with the character a lot
because<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.410> felt<00:06:27.620> like<00:06:27.680> I<00:06:27.770> didn't<00:06:27.980> know<00:06:28.040> who

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
because I felt like I didn't know who

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.010 
because I felt like I didn't know who
this<00:06:28.250> person<00:06:28.310> was<00:06:28.730> at<00:06:28.910> all<00:06:29.120> but<00:06:29.840> there<00:06:29.990> was

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
this person was at all but there was

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.050 
this person was at all but there was
this<00:06:30.110> of<00:06:30.440> he<00:06:30.770> was<00:06:30.890> a<00:06:30.920> bit<00:06:31.070> of<00:06:31.130> a<00:06:31.220> void<00:06:31.400> to<00:06:31.700> me<00:06:31.820> um

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
this of he was a bit of a void to me um

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.800 
this of he was a bit of a void to me um
I<00:06:32.600> felt<00:06:33.200> he<00:06:33.380> was<00:06:33.560> mark<00:06:34.090> basically<00:06:35.090> I<00:06:35.390> mean<00:06:35.540> you

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
that stage and performing in the same

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.570 
that stage and performing in the same
way<00:06:54.020> would<00:06:54.380> have<00:06:54.500> felt<00:06:54.740> extremely<00:06:55.130> flag

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580

another<00:06:56.240> thing<00:06:56.660> I<00:06:56.780> got<00:06:56.990> on<00:06:57.080> that<00:06:57.110> wasn't<00:06:57.650> so

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
another thing I got on that wasn't so

another thing I got on that wasn't so
well<00:06:57.920> known<00:06:58.190> they'd<00:06:58.490> have<00:06:58.640> had<00:06:58.760> two<00:06:58.970> batteries

lot<00:07:10.880> doing<00:07:11.450> that<00:07:11.600> but<00:07:11.750> is<00:07:11.900> there<00:07:12.410> is<00:07:12.530> a<00:07:12.560> kind<00:07:12.680> of

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
lot doing that but is there is a kind of

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.350 
lot doing that but is there is a kind of
aesthetic<00:07:12.950> of<00:07:13.190> failure<00:07:13.550> in<00:07:13.730> this<00:07:13.910> I<00:07:14.060> mean<00:07:14.210> it's

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
imperfection as part of this it makes it

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.130 
imperfection as part of this it makes it
very<00:07:19.100> human<00:07:19.670> and<00:07:19.790> that's<00:07:20.030> true<00:07:20.210> this<00:07:20.360> is<00:07:20.630> his
