00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the only exception I don't plan on

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.540 
the only exception I don't plan on
cutting<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.319> too<00:01:40.649> short<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.099> I<00:01:41.340> cut

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
cutting this one too short because I cut

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.359 
cutting this one too short because I cut
the<00:01:41.580> one<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.420> other<00:01:42.539> one<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> lot<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.770> tame<00:01:44.160> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the one the other one a lot so tame it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.669 
the one the other one a lot so tame it
down<00:01:44.580> or<00:01:44.970> maybe<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.509> may<00:01:45.899> end<00:01:46.080> up<00:01:46.140> cutting<00:01:46.410> it

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
down or maybe I may end up cutting it

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.219 
down or maybe I may end up cutting it
because<00:01:47.099> it<00:01:47.729> gets<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.330> wild<00:01:48.599> as<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.050> gets

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
because it gets really wild as it gets

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.960 
because it gets really wild as it gets
older<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.830> anyway<00:01:50.489> this<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.509> picture

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970

just has two too strong I'm sorry to tab

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.300 
just has two too strong I'm sorry to tab
they<00:03:54.750> are<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> tabs<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.530> back<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.980> connect

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
they are the tabs in the back to connect

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.009 
they are the tabs in the back to connect
it<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.700> adjust<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.180> two<00:03:57.329> adjustable

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
it to adjust the two adjustable

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.990 
it to adjust the two adjustable
adjustable<00:03:58.170> tabs<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.100> back<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.459> that's

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
adjustable tabs in the back and that's

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.850 
adjustable tabs in the back and that's
all<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.360> has<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.780> doesn't<00:04:00.930> come<00:04:01.320> with<00:04:01.590> any

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
all it has it doesn't come with any

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.280 
all it has it doesn't come with any
combs<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.180> kind<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> like<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.840> because<00:04:04.260> of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
combs and I kind of like that because of

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.660 
combs and I kind of like that because of
the<00:04:04.590> fact<00:04:04.829> that<00:04:04.890> because<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.340> doesn't<00:04:05.459> have

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
the fact that because it doesn't have

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.400 
the fact that because it doesn't have
any<00:04:05.700> columns<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.329> can<00:04:06.360> kind<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.810> pin<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.170> all<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
any columns I can kind of pin it all the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.340 
any columns I can kind of pin it all the
way<00:04:07.590> back<00:04:07.829> if<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.130> want<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.930> has<00:04:09.959> some

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
way back if I want to and it has some

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.870 
way back if I want to and it has some
ear<00:04:10.560> tabs<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.130> guess<00:04:11.310> that's<00:04:11.489> supposed<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.820> be

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
ear tabs I guess that's supposed to be

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.460 
ear tabs I guess that's supposed to be
like<00:04:12.090> right<00:04:12.299> here<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.750> pushed<00:04:12.959> those<00:04:13.170> back

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
like right here but I pushed those back

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.380 
like right here but I pushed those back
so<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.130> could<00:04:14.250> make<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.820> look<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.090> little<00:04:15.209> bit

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
so I could make it look a little bit

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.930 
so I could make it look a little bit
more<00:04:15.510> realistic<00:04:16.169> with<00:04:16.260> my<00:04:16.440> hair<00:04:16.829> this<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:17.790> a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
more realistic with my hair this is a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.880 
more realistic with my hair this is a
number<00:04:18.269> four<00:04:18.510> however<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:19.229> think<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.739> should

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
number four however I think I should

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.219 
number four however I think I should
have<00:04:19.979> gotten<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.400> number<00:04:20.729> one<00:04:21.000> B<00:04:21.239> or<00:04:21.540> number<00:04:21.930> two

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
have gotten a number one B or number two

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.920 
have gotten a number one B or number two
because<00:04:22.919> my<00:04:23.100> hair<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:24.000> little<00:04:24.330> bit<00:04:24.479> darker

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
because my hair it's a little bit darker

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.690 
because my hair it's a little bit darker
than<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.380> just<00:04:25.830> washed<00:04:26.070> my<00:04:26.190> hair<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:26.610> I

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
than it I just washed my hair so I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.719 
than it I just washed my hair so I
didn't<00:04:26.940> add<00:04:27.090> no<00:04:28.020> gel<00:04:28.349> to<00:04:28.710> my<00:04:28.919> hair<00:04:29.250> or<00:04:29.490> another

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
didn't add no gel to my hair or another

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.189 
didn't add no gel to my hair or another
Jo<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.240> usually<00:04:30.390> use

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
Jo that I usually use

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.100 
Jo that I usually use
so<00:04:31.740> that's<00:04:32.069> why<00:04:32.279> my<00:04:32.520> hair<00:04:32.789> is<00:04:32.849> not<00:04:33.150> laying<00:04:33.539> down

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
so that's why my hair is not laying down

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.200 
so that's why my hair is not laying down
the<00:04:34.889> way<00:04:35.039> it<00:04:35.069> should<00:04:35.219> but<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.639> don't<00:04:35.669> want<00:04:36.090> to

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
the way it should but I don't want to

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.939 
the way it should but I don't want to
put<00:04:36.360> any<00:04:36.539> gel<00:04:36.779> in<00:04:36.930> my<00:04:36.960> hair<00:04:37.080> because<00:04:37.469> I<00:04:37.680> just

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
put any gel in my hair because I just

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.170 
put any gel in my hair because I just
washed<00:04:38.249> it<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.729> usually<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:39.870> only<00:04:40.229> gel<00:04:40.680> my<00:04:40.889> hair

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
washed it and usually I only gel my hair

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.059 
washed it and usually I only gel my hair
closer<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.419> wash<00:04:42.629> day<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.770> way<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:43.949> don't

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
closer to wash day so that way I don't

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.679 
closer to wash day so that way I don't
have<00:04:44.249> to<00:04:44.460> keep<00:04:44.669> having<00:04:44.819> to<00:04:44.999> wash<00:04:45.300> my<00:04:45.479> hair

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
have to keep having to wash my hair

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.959 
have to keep having to wash my hair
because<00:04:45.990> gel<00:04:46.650> tend<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.099> leave<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.669> lot<00:04:47.849> of

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
because gel tend to leave a lot of

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.989 
because gel tend to leave a lot of
residue<00:04:48.389> in<00:04:48.539> my<00:04:48.719> hair<00:04:49.050> but<00:04:49.919> this<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.669> I<00:04:50.849> will
