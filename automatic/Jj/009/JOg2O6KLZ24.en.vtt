00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
was detailed in the first video again if

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.900 
was detailed in the first video again if
you<00:00:09.630> go<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.840> real<00:00:10.290> view<00:00:10.679> guitar<00:00:11.040> com<00:00:11.580> there's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
you go to real view guitar com there's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.530 
you go to real view guitar com there's
some<00:00:12.090> tab<00:00:12.389> available<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.590> there<00:00:14.540> so

exercise<00:00:19.920> left<00:00:20.730> hand<00:00:21.000> positioning<00:00:21.480> is

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
exercise left hand positioning is

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.570 
exercise left hand positioning is
important<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.320> his<00:00:22.500> thumb<00:00:22.830> being<00:00:23.310> behind

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
the neck like that your right hand last
time<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.320> did<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:28.949> index<00:00:29.880> finger

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
time we did it it was just index finger

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.709 
time we did it it was just index finger
now<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> incorporate<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.619> other

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
now we're going to incorporate the other

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.290 
now we're going to incorporate the other
fingers<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:34.260> well<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> go

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
fingers as well so it's going to go

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.360 
fingers as well so it's going to go
we're<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> alternate<00:00:37.170> index<00:00:37.860> middle

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
we're going to alternate index middle

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.700 
we're going to alternate index middle
index<00:00:39.079> middle<00:00:40.079> index<00:00:40.760> middle<00:00:41.760> index<00:00:42.710> little

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
index middle index middle index little

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
index middle index middle index little
in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.700> right<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.870> hand

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
in the right in the in the right hand

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
in the right in the in the right hand
there<00:00:46.430> all<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.670> let's<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> mention<00:00:48.390> on

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
there all right let's get the mention on

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.889 
there all right let's get the mention on
going<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.930> follow<00:00:49.230> along<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:50.870> account<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
going and follow along on account of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:22.460 
going and follow along on account of
four<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:52.860> three<00:00:53.660> four

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.530 

okay<00:01:23.470> now<00:01:23.950> let's<00:01:24.370> switch<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.850> up<00:01:24.970> let's<00:01:25.300> do

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
okay now let's switch it up let's do

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.090 
okay now let's switch it up let's do
middle<00:01:26.260> finger<00:01:26.770> index<00:01:27.159> middle<00:01:28.120> index<00:01:29.100> middle

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
middle finger index middle index middle

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.390 
middle finger index middle index middle
index<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:32.110> phoenix<00:01:32.830> on<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:32.979> whole<00:01:33.220> time

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
index little phoenix on the whole time

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.010 
index little phoenix on the whole time
again<00:01:33.700> we're<00:01:33.850> going<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.090> do<00:01:34.210> rest<00:01:34.540> strokes

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
again we're going to do rest strokes

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.140 
again we're going to do rest strokes
right<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:35.530> your<00:01:35.680> finger<00:01:36.010> plucks<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.850> string

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
right so your finger plucks the string

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.830 
right so your finger plucks the string
and<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.950> rests<00:01:39.190> on<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.790> string<00:01:40.119> above<00:01:40.300> it<00:01:40.720> so

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
and it rests on the string above it so

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.180 
and it rests on the string above it so
we're<00:01:41.080> just<00:01:41.110> switching<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.650> right<00:01:41.800> hand<00:01:42.070> the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
we're just switching the right hand the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.109 
we're just switching the right hand the
left<00:01:42.220> hand<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:43.950> fretting<00:01:44.950> hand<00:01:44.979> is<00:01:45.430> identical

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
left hand the fretting hand is identical

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.420 
left hand the fretting hand is identical
the<00:01:46.659> picking<00:01:47.110> hand<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.740> picking<00:01:48.040> finger

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
the picking hand the picking finger

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.180 
the picking hand the picking finger
pattern<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.030> now<00:01:49.210> backwards<00:01:49.479> middle<00:01:50.200> index

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
pattern is now backwards middle index

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.389 
pattern is now backwards middle index
middle<00:01:51.729> index<00:01:52.740> let's<00:01:53.740> do<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.039> nice<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.190> slow

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
middle index let's do it nice and slow

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:24.740 
middle index let's do it nice and slow
on<00:01:54.729> account<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.060> four<00:01:55.330> one<00:01:56.050> two<00:01:56.380> three<00:01:56.880> four

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.210 

okay<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.140> might<00:02:26.320> want<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.530> rewind<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.130> a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
okay so you might want to rewind it a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.190 
okay so you might want to rewind it a
few<00:02:27.370> times<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.910> get<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.330> perfect<00:02:28.660> because

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
few times and get that perfect because

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.180 
few times and get that perfect because
as<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.950> may<00:02:30.220> or<00:02:30.460> may<00:02:30.610> not<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.910> noticed<00:02:32.190> it's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
as you may or may not have noticed it's

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.770 
as you may or may not have noticed it's
a<00:02:33.310> little<00:02:33.550> bit<00:02:33.640> tricky<00:02:34.000> doing<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.360> backward

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
a little bit tricky doing it backward

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.470 
a little bit tricky doing it backward
middle<00:02:35.110> index<00:02:35.590> middle<00:02:36.160> index<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.180> reason

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
middle index middle index and the reason

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.180 
middle index middle index and the reason
that<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.840> because<00:02:38.050> when<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.800> thing<00:02:39.070> that

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
that is is because when this thing that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.740 
that is is because when this thing that
moves<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.580> right<00:02:39.640> hand<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.360> finger

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
moves in the right hand this finger

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.480 
moves in the right hand this finger
wants<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.080> play<00:02:41.260> when<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:41.890> finger<00:02:42.160> plays

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
wants to play when this finger plays

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.670 
wants to play when this finger plays
there<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.450> finger<00:02:43.840> middle<00:02:44.050> finger<00:02:44.170> wants<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
there this finger middle finger wants to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.370 
there this finger middle finger wants to
go<00:02:44.830> because<00:02:45.160> these<00:02:45.370> fingers<00:02:45.820> are<00:02:46.170> hard<00:02:47.170> wired

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
go because these fingers are hard wired

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.880 
go because these fingers are hard wired
together<00:02:48.130> in<00:02:48.700> our<00:02:49.360> brains<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.770> to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
together in our brains so you have to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.370 
together in our brains so you have to
spend<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.160> little<00:02:51.340> bit<00:02:51.460> of<00:02:51.550> time<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.510> build<00:02:53.170> up

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
spend a little bit of time to build up

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.340 
spend a little bit of time to build up
that<00:02:53.410> coordination<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:55.750> right<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.050> next<00:02:56.080> one

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
that coordination all right the next one

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.430 
that coordination all right the next one
we're<00:02:56.470> going<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.620> do<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.040> index<00:02:57.640> ring<00:02:58.440> index

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
we're going to do is index ring index

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.210 
we're going to do is index ring index
ring<00:03:00.400> okay<00:03:01.270> on<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.450> count<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.870> four<00:03:02.200> one<00:03:02.890> two

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
ring okay on the count of four one two

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:32.580 
ring okay on the count of four one two
three<00:03:03.959> four

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
strings happening at the 5th fret go

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.300 
strings happening at the 5th fret go

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
same thing with new mention ohmstead

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.730 
same thing with new mention ohmstead
nice<00:06:13.780> and<00:06:14.020> slow<00:06:14.340> starting<00:06:15.340> at<00:06:15.580> 60<00:06:16.120> they're<00:06:16.740> all

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.300 

the<00:06:34.810> reason<00:06:35.200> being<00:06:35.230> you<00:06:35.740> don't<00:06:35.920> want<00:06:36.070> to<00:06:36.160> start

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
the reason being you don't want to start

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.580 
the reason being you don't want to start
on<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:36.730> first<00:06:36.910> fret<00:06:37.210> because<00:06:37.420> that<00:06:37.930> is<00:06:38.290> the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
on the first fret because that is the

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.880 
on the first fret because that is the
widest<00:06:39.270> area<00:06:40.270> that<00:06:40.960> light<00:06:41.170> a<00:06:41.200> span<00:06:41.620> you<00:06:41.800> would

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
widest area that light a span you would

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.500 
widest area that light a span you would
have<00:06:42.040> to<00:06:42.160> play<00:06:42.340> on<00:06:42.430> the<00:06:42.520> guitar<00:06:42.640> the<00:06:43.000> frets<00:06:43.300> are

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
have to play on the guitar the frets are

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.140 
have to play on the guitar the frets are
the<00:06:43.600> widest<00:06:44.080> at<00:06:44.260> the<00:06:44.470> end<00:06:44.650> of<00:06:44.890> the<00:06:45.490> fretboard

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
the widest at the end of the fretboard

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.420 
the widest at the end of the fretboard
of<00:06:46.510> the<00:06:46.600> neck<00:06:46.810> they<00:06:47.380> get<00:06:47.590> narrower<00:06:47.860> as<00:06:48.160> you<00:06:48.280> can

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
of the neck they get narrower as you can

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.250 
of the neck they get narrower as you can
see<00:06:48.580> as<00:06:48.700> you<00:06:48.850> go<00:06:48.970> up<00:06:49.150> so<00:06:49.390> starting<00:06:49.750> up<00:06:49.870> here<00:06:50.170> is

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
see as you go up so starting up here is

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.460 
see as you go up so starting up here is
a<00:06:50.290> little<00:06:50.470> bit<00:06:50.680> easier<00:06:51.660> do<00:06:52.660> it<00:06:52.750> across<00:06:52.960> all<00:06:53.230> six

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
a little bit easier do it across all six

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.980 
a little bit easier do it across all six
strings<00:06:53.710> and<00:06:54.040> as<00:06:54.460> you<00:06:54.730> go<00:06:54.850> down<00:06:55.030> step<00:06:55.420> by<00:06:55.450> step

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
strings and as you go down step by step

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.020 
strings and as you go down step by step
you're<00:06:56.500> gradually<00:06:56.980> going<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.460> stretch<00:06:57.820> your

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
you're gradually going to stretch your

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.270 
you're gradually going to stretch your
fingers<00:06:58.450> out<00:06:58.630> a<00:06:58.690> little<00:06:59.080> bit<00:06:59.290> and<00:06:59.560> if<00:07:00.040> you<00:07:00.130> can

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
fingers out a little bit and if you can

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.540 
fingers out a little bit and if you can
do<00:07:00.430> it<00:07:01.170> at<00:07:02.170> the<00:07:02.590> first<00:07:02.890> French<00:07:04.620> across<00:07:05.620> all<00:07:05.950> six

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
do it at the first French across all six

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.860 
do it at the first French across all six
strings<00:07:07.320> you<00:07:08.320> are<00:07:09.040> doing<00:07:09.340> good<00:07:09.970> that's<00:07:10.630> good

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
strings you are doing good that's good

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.030 
strings you are doing good that's good
because<00:07:10.900> that's<00:07:11.110> a<00:07:11.260> wide<00:07:11.470> little<00:07:11.770> stretch

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
because that's a wide little stretch

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.920 
because that's a wide little stretch
right<00:07:12.250> there<00:07:12.280> all<00:07:13.150> right<00:07:13.330> and<00:07:13.570> it's

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
right there all right and it's

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.870 
right there all right and it's
absolutely<00:07:14.110> crucial<00:07:14.980> that<00:07:15.250> you<00:07:15.400> have<00:07:15.670> your

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
absolutely crucial that you have your

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.060 
absolutely crucial that you have your
thumb<00:07:16.150> down<00:07:16.690> there<00:07:17.080> you'll<00:07:17.350> never<00:07:17.710> reach<00:07:18.040> that

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070
