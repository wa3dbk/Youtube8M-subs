are on this level a lot easier on to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
are on this level a lot easier on to
player<00:00:29.880> simply<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.869> stop<00:00:31.080> everything<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
player simply can stop everything you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
player simply can stop everything you
move<00:00:31.800> around<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> challenging

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
move around but it is a challenging

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.850 
move around but it is a challenging
level<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.110> quite<00:00:34.260> early<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> game

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
level that is quite early in the game

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030 
level that is quite early in the game
for<00:00:35.100> ya<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.850> world<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.360> first<00:00:36.840> cut<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
for ya it world one first cut so this is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459 
for ya it world one first cut so this is
quite<00:00:38.160> challenging<00:00:38.270> Abbott's<00:00:39.270> three<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
quite challenging Abbott's three you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.160 
quite challenging Abbott's three you
know<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> new<00:00:40.860> way<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.719> gameplay<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.989> guess

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
know it's a new way of gameplay I guess

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.580 
know it's a new way of gameplay I guess
so<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.789> number<00:00:45.000> four<00:00:45.329> number<00:00:45.930> four<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so now on to number four number four is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.979 
so now on to number four number four is

mainly<00:01:41.130> rainbow<00:01:41.850> road<00:01:42.180> yes<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.079> uses

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
mainly rainbow road yes this one uses

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.800 
mainly rainbow road yes this one uses
the<00:01:43.560> ball<00:01:43.799> lead<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.850> ball<00:01:45.180> thing<00:01:45.210> yeah

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the ball lead a little ball thing yeah

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
the ball lead a little ball thing yeah
actually<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:48.350> pretty<00:01:49.350> cool<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:50.159> quite

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
actually one pretty cool it's quite

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
actually one pretty cool it's quite
challenging<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.570> once<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> hang<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
challenging but once you get the hang of

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.859 
challenging but once you get the hang of
it<00:01:52.920> snowing<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.340> hard<00:01:53.490> yeah<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> just

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it snowing that hard yeah but I just

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.319 
it snowing that hard yeah but I just
like<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> overall<00:01:55.680> feels<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.759> nothing<00:01:57.090> yeah

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
like the overall feels it's nothing yeah

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:06.220 
like the overall feels it's nothing yeah
it's<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> fork<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> road<00:01:58.409> go<00:01:58.920> left

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.930 

or<00:02:07.230> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.380> go<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> expert<00:02:08.160> way<00:02:08.340> which<00:02:08.820> is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
or you can go the expert way which is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.840 
or you can go the expert way which is
right

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.720 

but<00:02:17.850> she<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.060> quicker<00:02:18.830> harder<00:02:19.830> clearly<00:02:20.520> you're

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
but she is quicker harder clearly you're

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.400 
but she is quicker harder clearly you're
about<00:02:20.940> variable<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.480> go<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> expert<00:02:22.200> way

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
about variable to go in the expert way

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.730 
about variable to go in the expert way
and<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.190> course<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.610> totally<00:02:24.090> chi<00:02:24.420> 1<00:02:24.720> from<00:02:25.440> this

that door for a lot of the music from
Super<00:02:53.580> Mario<00:02:55.100> yeah<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.220> not<00:02:56.310> really

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
Super Mario yeah it's not really

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.150 
Super Mario yeah it's not really
challenging<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.440> can<00:02:58.680> be<00:02:58.800> hired<00:02:58.950> as<00:02:59.070> you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
challenging but it can be hired as you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.470 
challenging but it can be hired as you
keep<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.370> bumping<00:02:59.580> into<00:02:59.910> things<00:03:00.000> while<00:03:00.360> she

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
keep on bumping into things while she

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.030 
keep on bumping into things while she
going<00:03:00.660> with<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> walls<00:03:01.110> yeah<00:03:01.650> when<00:03:01.950> you'll

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
going with the walls yeah when you'll

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.310 
going with the walls yeah when you'll
get<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.220> hang<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.790> River<00:03:03.360> overall<00:03:04.290> I

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.540 
get the hang of that River overall I
just<00:03:04.680> think<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.070> good<00:03:05.160> way<00:03:05.490> to
