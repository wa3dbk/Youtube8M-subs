because<00:01:04.320> look<00:01:04.650> how<00:01:04.680> thin<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
because look how thin it is here and I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.359 
because look how thin it is here and I
guess<00:01:06.479> thick<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.799> part<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
guess thick here so this part here is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
guess thick here so this part here is
going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:09.000> 10<00:01:09.659> could<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.170> possibly

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
going to be 10 could be possibly

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
going to be 10 could be possibly
undercooked<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> want

and this can be overcooked and caused

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
and this can be overcooked and caused
because<00:01:14.280> we're<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> deep<00:01:15.180> fry<00:01:15.210> it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.010 
describing and shred it gently gently
touchdown<00:03:28.990> so<00:03:29.990> just<00:03:30.230> kind<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.680> slide

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
touchdown so just kind of on the slide

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.440 
touchdown so just kind of on the slide
see<00:03:33.020> perfect<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.370> know<00:03:34.550> this<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.880> what

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.830 

its<00:03:38.450> exact<00:03:39.010> exactly<00:03:40.010> because<00:03:40.190> it'll<00:03:41.090> absorb<00:03:41.240> a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
its exact exactly because it'll absorb a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.960 
its exact exactly because it'll absorb a
lot<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.710> oil<00:03:42.920> right<00:03:43.190> therefore<00:03:43.460> make<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.910> a

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
lot of the oil right therefore make it a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.370 
lot of the oil right therefore make it a
little<00:03:44.120> bit<00:03:44.300> more<00:03:44.450> healthy<00:03:44.690> don't<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.200> think

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
little bit more healthy don't you think

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.010 
little bit more healthy don't you think
right<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.060> how<00:03:47.240> do<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:47.450> know<00:03:47.480> when<00:03:48.050> it<00:03:50.020> you

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
right so how do you know when it you

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.300 
right so how do you know when it you
know<00:03:51.140> what<00:03:51.320> how<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.500> know<00:03:51.710> it's<00:03:51.860> how<00:03:52.130> it's

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
know what how you know it's how it's
