00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.799 

okay<00:00:30.880> here<00:00:31.390> is<00:00:31.660> how<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.110> igniter<00:00:33.100> works<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
okay here is how the igniter works the

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.049 
okay here is how the igniter works the
igniter<00:00:35.230> itself<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.040> part<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.550> lights<00:00:36.910> the

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
igniter itself the part that lights the

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.130 
igniter itself the part that lights the
match<00:00:37.330> is<00:00:38.100> well<00:00:39.100> actually<00:00:39.820> wire<00:00:40.450> wrapped

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
match is well actually wire wrapped

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.360 
match is well actually wire wrapped
around<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.680> match<00:00:42.809> when<00:00:43.809> when<00:00:44.769> I<00:00:44.800> activate

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
around the match when when I activate

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.180 
around the match when when I activate
the<00:00:45.760> igniter<00:00:46.290> current<00:00:47.290> is<00:00:47.500> passed<00:00:47.949> through

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
the igniter current is passed through

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.810 
the igniter current is passed through
the<00:00:48.790> wire<00:00:49.239> it<00:00:49.629> heats<00:00:50.140> up<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.670> match

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
the wire it heats up and the match

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.090 
the wire it heats up and the match
ignites<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:53.559> let's<00:00:53.890> focus<00:00:54.070> on<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:56.559> the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
ignites now let's focus on the on the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.940 
ignites now let's focus on the on the
igniter<00:00:57.460> itself<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:59.170> are<00:00:59.260> two<00:00:59.440> batteries

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
igniter itself there are two batteries

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.840 
igniter itself there are two batteries
one<00:01:00.309> is<00:01:00.520> for<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:01.030> igniter<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.600> other<00:01:01.780> is<00:01:02.020> for

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
one is for the igniter the other is for

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.719 
one is for the igniter the other is for
for<00:01:03.850> powering<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:05.070> Arduino<00:01:06.070> board<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.670> the

now<00:01:42.849> off<00:01:43.209> you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:45.759> hear<00:01:46.300> that<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:46.869> used<00:01:47.729> mmm

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
now off you can hear that I used mmm

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.020 
now off you can hear that I used mmm
that<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.840> designed<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.410> app<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.950> vibrate<00:01:51.550> when

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
that it designed the app to vibrate when

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.330 
that it designed the app to vibrate when
the<00:01:52.330> safety<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.050> off

part<00:02:26.890> when<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:30.030> switches<00:02:31.030> an<00:02:31.480> LED<00:02:32.080> on

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.920 

sorry<00:02:35.680> not<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.040> LED<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:37.090> switches<00:02:37.480> its

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
sorry not an LED it switches its

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.600 
sorry not an LED it switches its
switches<00:02:38.800> at<00:02:38.980> Darlington<00:02:39.400> driver<00:02:39.940> on

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
switches at Darlington driver on

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.580 
switches at Darlington driver on
that's<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.820> part<00:02:43.060> right<00:02:43.480> here<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:45.810> well<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that's the part right here and well it

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.010 
that's the part right here and well it
in<00:02:47.920> turn<00:02:49.170> switches<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.320> relay<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:52.450> passes

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
in turn switches a relay on it passes

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.449 
in turn switches a relay on it passes
current<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.130> igniter<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:55.410> basically

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
current to the igniter and basically

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.880 
current to the igniter and basically
that's<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.000> now<00:02:58.300> I<00:02:58.510> will<00:02:58.900> press<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.500> fire

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
that's it so now I will press the fire

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.250 
that's it so now I will press the fire
button<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:01.380> yes<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.890> works
