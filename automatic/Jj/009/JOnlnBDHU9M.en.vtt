00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.420
 materials list of materials 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:18.150
 materials cut paper figures

 gun and sticks of silicone stick 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.789
 long and thin wood and a good 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.859
 amount of the story may already seem 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.130
 I have all my materials I just need 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.250
 the good amount of the ribbon and I'm 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.079
 almost certainly will be exercises and we are going to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.079
 do check the check 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.050
 is that you have is that I always come 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.750
 well let's start 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 you have to start painting the stick of the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.510
 list first now you will be forced to pass 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.380
 here blue is like this if it's blue 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.380
 the kid 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.290
 it's already broken, sorry, too 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.770
 Well, if you have to take it clear 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.770
 open it 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.299
 at this point the ribbon is unraveled 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.590
 okay 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 and I got very very creative resource and that 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.850
 I did not like the nails of my everyday 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.010
 I do not know how creative I am not why 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.000
 Such a pretty supply sandal I called 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.360
 to paint this to finish fast 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.920
 first you tell me the ribbon then 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.920
 the woman stick had to be 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.760
 we finish like this please 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.209
 and always always says if we're going to 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.870
 use the sponge this or that and 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.870
 finished 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.810
 I was careful with my dream 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.250
 once 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.760
 that everything is the blue stick and then you 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.760
 is going to throw the other 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.100
 of Africa a second with one 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.500
 as not as not 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.890
 what the client asks for is that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.880
 puts you in a little bit of Haitian note that you see 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.880
 It does not matter 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.600
 because you just flown no more than 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.420
 put them in a glass of water because if 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.040
 they do not dry up and they go bad then 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.350
 you had the doubt 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.410
 I do not know I did not question it 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.960
 is that then we have here to 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.080
 our our bits of paper no 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.320
 let's do a course not be a 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.320
 sample 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.150
 hey but these beautiful papers are 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.980
 from our house and banks memories that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.720
 I like it 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.660
 it's more I'll take you away you'll love me 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:16.980
 nor my blood of life and the diversity of 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.980
 our super pencil 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.970
 but there is nothing else there too that such 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.010
 that I do not have close and banking where 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.900
 command to get well in any 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.520
 haberdashery stationery but preferably 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.640
 with my bank because he sees nothing but 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.280
 nice papers but if not any 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.860
 of the magazine of the is double sight a 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.330
 law here and how good and what's not 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.370
 You can leave your house who goes to 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.020
 make this decorative curtain 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.530
 he grabbed a sheet of paper a piece of 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.450
 cardboard nobody talks to 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.120
 of the asia material and I'm going there or 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.460
 with magazines you can also know that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.960
 I'm going to pay with photos with you from the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.420
 romantics that still print 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.780
 clear pictures and paste your pictures 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.380
 and that's it 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.590
 you say is a massive picture frame 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.290
 photos of where they send and how they loved 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.169
 click and it would be probabilistic two 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:18.210
 kids that you 're fine and the audios 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.780
 which the truth is already throwing me 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.780
 heap 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:34.819
 and then we cut in this way 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:34.819
 but why it happened but you're a dirty 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.749
 but you do not know anything you talk to me 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.350
 from the quarry 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.350
 Let's see 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.910
 in the beautiful heart double sight me 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.910
 loved that it be double sight 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.090
 hearty because we like it I like it 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.669
 the band of the loving kindness of the 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.870
 hearts while we're not going to the 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.120
 next step with you and I continue 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.250
 remembering why the next step 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.240
 what is the next step is no longer the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.979
 next step is the exit of the ribbon 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.099
 medel to more or less like the position 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:21.650
 short that they remain the same for example to 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.650
 the hearts ok 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.010
 in fact scissors 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:36.660
 but if it's good it 's good I'll 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.720
 put is for a curtain that is there 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:45.660
 in my room and then when I invite the 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:49.160
 girl so that to get 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.160
 living calves 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:58.770
 it's a very tricky thing that's good 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.910
 then this paper no longer matters if you 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.460
 the bar is already cut 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.640
 more human as well said target lower 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:11.169
 the distance of what they want me to go 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.780
 to the account 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.270
 how nice 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.230
 good while you do that because I do not 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.230
 let's see step by step 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:29.780
 Misses back as two - step 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.780
 Y
