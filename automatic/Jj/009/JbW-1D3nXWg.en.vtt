00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:14.960
 I don't know what to really tell me 3 minutes at 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.359
 our most difficult professional challenge 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.900
 everything is decided today we can scale them 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.930
 walls of the hell a centimeter to the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.930
 time 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.060
 I can't do it for him though 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.700
 I'm too old 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.680
 and look around sees our young people 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.480
 many certainly lost what I committed 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.470
 all the mistakes that a middle - aged man 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.470
 can do 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.720
 you know many things with age with time 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.860
 they are removed but this is part of the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.530
 life 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.680
 but you only learn it when those 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.400
 things start open and you discover that the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.050
 life is a game of centimeters and so it is 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.320
 the future because in both these 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.600
 play life in football the margin of 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.549
 Captain's very small mistake 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 half step done a little early or in 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.890
 delay and you ca n't make it but the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.290
 second too fast or too slow e 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 miss the grip but in centimeters there 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.729
 they only serve everywhere are around 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.220
 we are in every break of the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.930
 game every minute with every second 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.450
 this team fights for the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.490
 kind this team we massacre of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.799
 fatigue ourselves to everyone 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.080
 around us for a centimeter 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.310
 we defend with nails and teeth for 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.560
 an inch and I know if I can have it 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.990
 a paying existence will be because they are 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.759
 still willing to fight and die for 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.649
 that centimeter those ten centimeters 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.840
 in front of my face but I can't 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.610
 force you to fight you have to look at the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.750
 companion you have next to watch it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.429
 in the eyes 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 I bet you will see a man there 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:08.270
 determined to gain ground from us 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.270
 this is a gentlemen my team 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.290
 it 's football guys it's all here
