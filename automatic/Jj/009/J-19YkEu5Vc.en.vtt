00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
collections we are always try to work

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.430 
collections we are always try to work
with<00:00:46.800> those<00:00:46.980> artists<00:00:47.640> who<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:47.850> themselves

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
with those artists who are themselves

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
with those artists who are themselves
pushing<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:50.070> forward<00:00:50.420> not

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
pushing all the time forward not

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.350 
pushing all the time forward not
standing<00:00:51.930> still<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.739> taking<00:00:53.550> new<00:00:53.670> challenges

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
standing still but taking new challenges

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.400 
standing still but taking new challenges
and<00:00:54.680> taking<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.860> risk<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:57.020> showing<00:00:58.020> new

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and taking your risk in showing new

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.689 
and taking your risk in showing new
works<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> reason<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.340> mean

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
works and so that's the reason I mean

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
works and so that's the reason I mean
they<00:01:03.090> are<00:01:03.270> fantastic<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.379> great

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
they are fantastic they are great

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.120 
they are fantastic they are great
artists<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:05.880> fantastic<00:01:06.619> strategy<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
artists they have fantastic strategy and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.359 
artists they have fantastic strategy and
they<00:01:08.400> never<00:01:08.820> stand<00:01:09.060> still<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.689> those<00:01:10.280> artists

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
they never stand still so those artists

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.020 
they never stand still so those artists

on one hand but on the other hand he's
one<00:01:51.640> of<00:01:51.670> these<00:01:51.910> persons<00:01:52.390> who<00:01:52.540> has<00:01:52.720> really

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
one of these persons who has really

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.880 
one of these persons who has really
pushed<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:55.270> idea<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:57.690> media<00:01:58.690> media<00:01:59.530> as<00:01:59.710> an

pushed the idea of of media media as an

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.310 
pushed the idea of of media media as an
ID<00:02:00.040> itself<00:02:00.520> within<00:02:01.360> contemporary<00:02:01.690> art<00:02:02.170> and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
ID itself within contemporary art and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.350 
ID itself within contemporary art and
how<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.590> changes<00:02:03.010> us<00:02:03.190> how<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.760> has<00:02:03.910> an<00:02:04.030> impact

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
how it changes us how it has an impact

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.600 
how it changes us how it has an impact
on<00:02:04.600> our<00:02:04.810> own<00:02:05.229> perceptions<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.490> way

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
on our own perceptions and on the way

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:27.380 
on our own perceptions and on the way
that<00:02:06.850> basically<00:02:07.509> our<00:02:07.660> brain<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.170> working

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.780 

so<00:02:27.990> these<00:02:28.650> new<00:02:29.070> works<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:31.290> my<00:02:31.770> exhibition<00:02:32.160> here

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
so these new works in my exhibition here

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.210 
so these new works in my exhibition here
basically<00:02:35.000> come<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.560> kind<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.710> look<00:02:37.980> at

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
basically come out of kind of look at

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.630 
basically come out of kind of look at
ontological<00:02:39.620> processes<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.070> some<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
ontological processes and some of the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.020 
ontological processes and some of the
new<00:02:41.820> technology<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.340> research<00:02:44.340> into<00:02:44.850> that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
new technology and research into that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.780 
new technology and research into that
kind<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.930> way<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.380> thought<00:02:47.250> patterns

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
kind of the way that thought patterns

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.590 
kind of the way that thought patterns
can<00:02:48.150> be<00:02:48.230> isolated<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:50.090> thoughts<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.450> almost

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
can be isolated and thoughts can almost

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.800 
can be isolated and thoughts can almost
be<00:02:51.930> read<00:02:52.230> by<00:02:52.550> functional<00:02:53.550> MRIs<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.600> things

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
be read by functional MRIs and things

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.600 
be read by functional MRIs and things
like<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:57.660> example<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.440> ice<00:02:58.740> it's

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
like that so for example with ice it's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.650 
like that so for example with ice it's
meant<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.209> sort<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.930> memory<00:03:01.650> palace

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
meant to be sort of a memory palace

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.080 
meant to be sort of a memory palace
which<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:04.590> based<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:06.260> two<00:03:08.090> psychological

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
which is based on two psychological

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.260 
which is based on two psychological
traits<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:09.930> being<00:03:10.230> narcissism<00:03:11.100> which<00:03:12.000> has<00:03:12.239> a

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
traits one being narcissism which has a

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.690 
traits one being narcissism which has a
kind<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.810> more<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.830> an<00:03:13.950> art<00:03:14.160> historical

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
kind of more of an art historical

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.790 
kind of more of an art historical
reference<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.750> then<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.080> other<00:03:16.260> being<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
reference and then the other being the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.870 
reference and then the other being the
phenomenon<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.270> femme<00:03:19.200> fatale<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.880> ice

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
phenomenon of the femme fatale the ice

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.550 
phenomenon of the femme fatale the ice
queen<00:03:21.500> which<00:03:22.880> sort<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.000> interfaces<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:25.140> and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
queen which sort of interfaces there and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.170 
queen which sort of interfaces there and
so<00:03:25.800> that's<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.190> way<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.430> was<00:03:26.550> kind<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.880> built

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
so that's the way it was kind of built

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.770 
so that's the way it was kind of built
around<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.800> sort<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.600> personification<00:03:30.600> of

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
around this sort of personification of

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.229 
around this sort of personification of
weather<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:32.040> know<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.810> expansion<00:03:34.410> of

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
weather you know and the expansion of

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.990 
weather you know and the expansion of
psychological<00:03:36.239> state<00:03:36.630> into<00:03:37.880> into<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
psychological state into into the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.630 
psychological state into into the
landscape<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> kind<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:43.530> way<00:03:44.489> of

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
landscape so you have a kind of a way of

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.990 
landscape so you have a kind of a way of
reading<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.330> work<00:03:45.540> which<00:03:46.670> operates<00:03:47.670> and

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
reading the work which operates and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.539 
reading the work which operates and
rhythms<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> performances<00:03:49.769> overlapping

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
rhythms of the performances overlapping

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.070 
rhythms of the performances overlapping
and<00:03:51.769> one<00:03:52.769> sort<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.700> train<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.330> thought<00:03:54.570> leading

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
and one sort of train of thought leading

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.280 
and one sort of train of thought leading
into<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.500> next

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.630 

I<00:04:05.750> worked<00:04:06.750> several<00:04:07.200> time<00:04:07.469> with<00:04:07.709> him<00:04:07.890> first<00:04:08.370> in

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
I worked several time with him first in

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.539 
I worked several time with him first in
Hannover<00:04:09.150> 1998<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.290> then<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.890> pencil<00:04:11.340> spray

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
Hannover 1998 and then in pencil spray

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.690 
Hannover 1998 and then in pencil spray
against<00:04:11.790> 2009<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:12.870> now<00:04:13.680> he<00:04:13.739> again<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.519> I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
against 2009 and now he again and I

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.990 
against 2009 and now he again and I
think<00:04:14.969> he<00:04:15.209> developed<00:04:15.900> his<00:04:16.109> work<00:04:17.039> incredible

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
think he developed his work incredible

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.110 
think he developed his work incredible
in<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.150> good<00:04:18.269> way<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:19.470> think<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.120> really

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
in a good way and I think this is really

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.420 
in a good way and I think this is really
the<00:04:21.329> best<00:04:21.479> exhibition<00:04:22.019> we<00:04:22.860> ever<00:04:23.070> did<00:04:23.280> together

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the best exhibition we ever did together

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.129 
the best exhibition we ever did together
and<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:26.610> introspection<00:04:27.240> of<00:04:28.580> our

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
and the introspection of our

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.469 
and the introspection of our
psychological<00:04:31.139> background<00:04:31.970> how<00:04:32.970> he<00:04:33.030> deals

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
psychological background how he deals

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.580 
psychological background how he deals
with<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.050> in<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:35.130> very<00:04:35.160> fluent<00:04:36.120> way<00:04:36.539> in<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.410> very

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
with this in a very fluent way in a very
