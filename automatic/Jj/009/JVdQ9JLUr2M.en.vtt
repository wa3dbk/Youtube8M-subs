00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
they keep doing this well instead of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.679 
they keep doing this well instead of
doing<00:00:27.140> that<00:00:27.439> just<00:00:27.800> stand<00:00:28.130> up<00:00:28.340> lean<00:00:29.150> forward

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
doing that just stand up lean forward

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.259 
doing that just stand up lean forward
and<00:00:29.960> go<00:00:30.439> like<00:00:30.650> this<00:00:30.859> tucking<00:00:31.550> those<00:00:31.699> elbows<00:00:32.090> to

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
and go like this tucking those elbows to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.150 
and go like this tucking those elbows to
get<00:00:32.419> those<00:00:32.570> really<00:00:32.930> good<00:00:33.080> shots<00:00:33.410> nice<00:00:33.890> and

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
get those really good shots nice and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.040 
get those really good shots nice and
stable<00:00:34.580> now<00:00:34.910> you're<00:00:35.090> leaning<00:00:35.390> forward<00:00:35.420> you're

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
stable now you're leaning forward you're

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.810 
stable now you're leaning forward you're
still<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.559> same<00:00:36.710> angle<00:00:37.129> to<00:00:37.190> get<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.519> shot

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
still on the same angle to get that shot

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.400 
still on the same angle to get that shot
but<00:00:38.239> then<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:38.540> see<00:00:38.719> people<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:39.170> try<00:00:39.350> to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
but then you see people that try to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.680 
but then you see people that try to
shoot<00:00:39.649> vertically<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.460> they<00:00:40.730> do<00:00:40.790> this<00:00:41.210> they

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
shoot vertically and they do this they

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
shoot vertically and they do this they
sit<00:00:41.930> there<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:42.170> they<00:00:42.260> turn<00:00:42.500> their<00:00:42.680> head

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
sit there and they turn their head

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.799 
sit there and they turn their head
sideways<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.550> they<00:00:43.670> look<00:00:43.850> like<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:44.239> it<00:00:44.450> is

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
sideways and they look like this it is

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.260 
sideways and they look like this it is
almost<00:00:45.110> impossible<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:46.250> get<00:00:46.579> a<00:00:46.640> straight<00:00:47.030> line

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
almost impossible to get a straight line

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.270 
almost impossible to get a straight line
dim<00:00:47.570> egde<00:00:47.690> doing<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.200> I<00:00:48.410> have<00:00:48.739> trouble<00:00:49.129> doing

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
dim egde doing that I have trouble doing

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.790 
dim egde doing that I have trouble doing
that<00:00:49.520> that's<00:00:49.700> why<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:49.879> don't<00:00:50.000> do<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:50.960> don't

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
that that's why I don't do it so don't

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.979 
that that's why I don't do it so don't
do<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.129> don't<00:00:52.430> turn<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.820> side<00:00:53.059> go

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
do this don't turn to the side go

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.299 
do this don't turn to the side go
vertical<00:00:54.500> even<00:00:54.710> if<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:54.860> don't<00:00:55.010> have<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.160> grip

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
vertical even if you don't have a grip

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.580 
vertical even if you don't have a grip
go<00:00:55.730> like<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.180> now<00:00:56.690> you're<00:00:56.930> looking<00:00:57.230> like

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
go like this now you're looking like

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.860 
go like this now you're looking like
this<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.100> it's<00:00:58.730> just<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.180> much<00:00:59.239> easier<00:00:59.840> and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
this and it's just so much easier and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.930 
this and it's just so much easier and
more<00:01:00.230> stable<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.829> then<00:01:01.070> other<00:01:01.340> things<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.789> see

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
more stable and then other things I see

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.430 
more stable and then other things I see
people<00:01:02.300> they<00:01:02.390> want<00:01:02.539> to<00:01:02.600> get<00:01:02.690> down<00:01:02.899> on<00:01:02.930> an<00:01:03.170> angle

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
people they want to get down on an angle

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.229 
people they want to get down on an angle
so<00:01:03.590> they<00:01:03.860> get<00:01:03.949> down<00:01:04.160> here<00:01:04.520> and<00:01:04.699> they<00:01:04.940> start

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
so they get down here and they start

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.300 
so they get down here and they start
doing<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:05.690> type<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.140> thing<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.649> then

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
doing this type of thing and then

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.730 
doing this type of thing and then
they're<00:01:07.460> laying<00:01:07.670> all<00:01:07.940> around<00:01:08.330> that's<00:01:09.110> awkward

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
they're laying all around that's awkward

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.620 
they're laying all around that's awkward
I<00:01:10.009> think<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.399> is<00:01:10.520> it's<00:01:10.790> like<00:01:10.970> I'm<00:01:11.299> gonna<00:01:11.450> put

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
I think this is it's like I'm gonna put

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.149 
I think this is it's like I'm gonna put
my<00:01:11.720> leg<00:01:11.900> on<00:01:11.930> here<00:01:12.170> I'm<00:01:12.320> gonna<00:01:12.500> shoot<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:12.950> way

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
my leg on here I'm gonna shoot this way

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.590 
my leg on here I'm gonna shoot this way
am<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:13.340> gonna<00:01:13.430> get<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:13.640> straight<00:01:13.850> line<00:01:14.000> no<00:01:14.299> I

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
am I gonna get a straight line no I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.469 
am I gonna get a straight line no I
think<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:15.799> still<00:01:16.100> works<00:01:16.340> better<00:01:16.640> get

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
think that this still works better get

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.420 
think that this still works better get
down<00:01:17.689> like<00:01:17.900> this<00:01:18.170> you're<00:01:18.650> on<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.860> good<00:01:19.159> level

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
down like this you're on a good level

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.010 
down like this you're on a good level
you<00:01:20.000> can<00:01:20.150> go<00:01:20.330> like<00:01:20.479> this<00:01:20.510> you're<00:01:20.840> nice<00:01:20.990> and

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
you can go like this you're nice and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.289 
you can go like this you're nice and
stable<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:21.890> need<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.159> get<00:01:22.310> lower<00:01:22.520> now<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.060> can

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
stable you need to get lower now you can
