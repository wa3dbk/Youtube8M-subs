adding the sugar this is going to be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
adding the sugar this is going to be
looking<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.559> sand<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.280> something<00:01:03.030> like

down<00:01:59.159> sides<00:01:59.579> kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.299> every<00:02:00.630> time<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.079> add

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
down sides kind of every time you add

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.679 
down sides kind of every time you add
something<00:02:01.259> new<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.460> things<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.360> stuck

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
measurements are going to be on my block

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.820 
measurements are going to be on my block
you're<00:03:26.660> going<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.989> start<00:03:27.200> by<00:03:27.290> creaming<00:03:27.590> your

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
you're going to start by creaming your

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.570 
you're going to start by creaming your
cream<00:03:28.610> cheese<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.900> just<00:03:30.320> don't<00:03:30.709> over<00:03:31.160> mix<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
cream cheese but just don't over mix it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.330 
cream cheese but just don't over mix it
because<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:32.090> did<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.100> you're<00:03:34.100> going<00:03:34.250> to

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
because I did that and you're going to

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.340 
because I did that and you're going to
be<00:03:34.580> seeing<00:03:34.970> at<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.420> end<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> mixture<00:03:36.260> is

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
be seeing at the end that the mixture is

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.650 
be seeing at the end that the mixture is
kind<00:03:36.800> of<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.250> lose<00:03:37.489> my<00:03:37.730> frostings<00:03:38.150> tulips<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:38.600> I

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
kind of to lose my frostings tulips so I

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.540 
kind of to lose my frostings tulips so I
had<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.959> put<00:03:39.110> it<00:03:39.200> on<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.530> freezer<00:03:39.980> for<00:03:40.220> like

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
had to put it on the freezer for like

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.000 
had to put it on the freezer for like
ten<00:03:40.820> minutes<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.390> just<00:03:41.630> make<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.019> harden<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.980> I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
ten minutes to just make it harden so I

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.160 
ten minutes to just make it harden so I
guess<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.489> key<00:03:43.700> was<00:03:43.940> up<00:03:44.120> my<00:03:44.299> cream<00:03:44.930> cheese

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
guess and the key was up my cream cheese

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.229 
guess and the key was up my cream cheese
was<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.440> bit<00:03:45.709> too<00:03:46.040> self<00:03:46.370> at<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.610> beginning<00:03:47.060> I

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
was a bit too self at the beginning I

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.300 
was a bit too self at the beginning I
just<00:03:47.269> let<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.870> too<00:03:48.049> long<00:03:48.230> at<00:03:48.470> room<00:03:48.860> temperature

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
just let it too long at room temperature

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.759 
just let it too long at room temperature
and<00:03:49.489> then<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.850> over<00:03:50.090> beat<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.510> that's<00:03:51.350> not<00:03:51.590> ideal

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
and then I over beat it that's not ideal

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.070 
and then I over beat it that's not ideal
for<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.430> best<00:03:52.700> frosting<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.600> is<00:03:53.690> going<00:03:53.930> to

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
for the best frosting that is going to

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.170 
for the best frosting that is going to
be<00:03:54.200> working<00:03:54.500> well<00:03:54.830> with<00:03:55.100> piping<00:03:55.700> bags<00:03:55.940> and

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
just a bit it until everything is just

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.839

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
when it's just loose that a Tupperware

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.710 
when it's just loose that a Tupperware
goes<00:04:37.740> into<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.220> fridge<00:04:38.520> for<00:04:38.880> as<00:04:39.120> long<00:04:39.419> as<00:04:39.480> it

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
goes into a fridge for as long as it

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.750 
goes into a fridge for as long as it
takes<00:04:39.990> for<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.470> be<00:04:40.800> firm<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.280> once<00:04:41.580> your

takes for it to be firm it once your

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.180 
takes for it to be firm it once your
cupcakes<00:04:41.970> are<00:04:42.419> baked<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.260> cooled<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.740> make

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.320 
cupcakes are baked and cooled and make
sure<00:04:44.340> they're<00:04:44.520> cool<00:04:44.760> because<00:04:44.940> if<00:04:45.210> not

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
sure they're cool because if not
