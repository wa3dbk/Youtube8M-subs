00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
was because I didn't film yet so I

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.460 
was because I didn't film yet so I
wanted<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.820> show<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:14.080> looks<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.350> little

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.230 
wanted to show you this looks a little
different<00:01:14.710> than<00:01:15.130> on<00:01:15.370> our<00:01:15.550> site<00:01:15.760> because<00:01:16.090> I

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
different than on our site because I

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.700 
different than on our site because I
didn't<00:01:16.540> realize<00:01:16.900> there<00:01:17.050> were<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.229> holes<00:01:17.410> but

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
didn't realize there were the holes but

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.700 
didn't realize there were the holes but
it's<00:01:18.040> like<00:01:18.970> totally<00:01:19.180> fine<00:01:19.420> because<00:01:19.690> when<00:01:20.619> you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
it's like totally fine because when you

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.900 
it's like totally fine because when you
pop<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:20.979> out<00:01:21.040> you're<00:01:21.220> not<00:01:21.310> even<00:01:21.550> gonna<00:01:21.640> fill
