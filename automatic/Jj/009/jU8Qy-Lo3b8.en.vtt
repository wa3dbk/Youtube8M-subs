00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.649
 and down it goes up to rock more or 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.470

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.280
 more training over a year I've done more 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.319
 to succeed but let's try barrels 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.319
 creative is uncle to see the test for example 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.780

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.140

 When you do it, I play you. 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.609
 his residence is that he already had that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.560
 that this new client tried to record this 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.829
 here is one time there are no people that I 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.659

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.299
 excrement and will already have your network and 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.609

 in his house in case he could 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.739
 build since when he was here 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.849
 because he adm and let's suppose that people 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.829
 does not have the p 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.829
 I would have to write and write 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.620
 written this command and then he will be able to 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.760
 build here and that's it personal is the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.699
 same basic tutorial on how to use networks 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.319
 Hi guys, I was very doubtful every time 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.769
 that we played personal factor by the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.169
 what is the body of the car that is very 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.180
 simple guy is just think three 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.609
 so three commands if you 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.430
 have a friend right if you play 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.260
 alone and two commands only and is 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.560
 very easy guy very very good 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.750
 answer that just avoiding italicize 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.000
 in her, and the next staff is like 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.460
 We told the active galley to send 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.470
 a print of the griffing character you have 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.420
 a house but if it does not compete I think 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.700
 that he is right to have broken because 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.010
 it's not right 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.620
 it's true I think he is right is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.110
 breaking then it's you have to take 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.920
 I always care when I started one 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.140

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.630
