00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
and then we'll learn some exceptions i

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.050 
and then we'll learn some exceptions i
started<00:00:38.800> off<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.190> i<00:00:39.250> went<00:00:40.890> d<00:00:41.890> minor<00:00:42.130> to<00:00:43.030> G

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
started off and i went d minor to G

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.020 
started off and i went d minor to G
minor<00:00:43.510> what<00:00:44.230> key<00:00:44.470> are<00:00:44.500> we<00:00:44.680> in<00:00:44.770> well<00:00:45.580> let's<00:00:45.880> do

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
minor what key are we in well let's do

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.640 
minor what key are we in well let's do
our<00:00:46.180> analysis<00:00:46.630> we<00:00:46.660> know<00:00:46.900> that<00:00:47.140> d<00:00:47.290> minor<00:00:47.470> could

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
our analysis we know that d minor could

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.650 
our analysis we know that d minor could
be<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.740> 2<00:00:47.950> 3<00:00:47.980> or<00:00:48.220> 6<00:00:48.490> but<00:00:48.790> since<00:00:49.000> we're<00:00:49.150> parking<00:00:49.540> on

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
be a 2 3 or 6 but since we're parking on

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.270 
be a 2 3 or 6 but since we're parking on
it<00:00:49.780> for<00:00:49.900> quite<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:50.110> while<00:00:50.290> we<00:00:50.620> can<00:00:50.770> take<00:00:50.950> three

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
it for quite a while we can take three

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.360 
it for quite a while we can take three
off<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.510> table<00:00:52.840> so<00:00:53.050> it's<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.260> two<00:00:53.440> or<00:00:53.470> six<00:00:53.950> right

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
off the table so it's a two or six right

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.280 
off the table so it's a two or six right
well<00:00:54.700> if<00:00:54.820> I'm<00:00:55.000> playing<00:00:55.180> this<00:00:55.510> D<00:00:55.750> minor<00:00:56.020> and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
well if I'm playing this D minor and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.440 
well if I'm playing this D minor and
it's<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.470> two<00:00:56.650> chord<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.850> puts<00:00:58.030> me<00:00:58.150> in<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.239> key

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
it's a two chord it puts me in the key

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.420 
it's a two chord it puts me in the key
of<00:00:58.480> C<00:00:58.600> this<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.260> all<00:00:59.470> I'm<00:00:59.620> chart<00:00:59.920> number<00:01:00.070> four

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
of C this is all I'm chart number four

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.580 
of C this is all I'm chart number four
or<00:01:00.640> it's<00:01:00.790> in<00:01:00.880> your<00:01:01.000> head<00:01:01.180> then<00:01:01.989> I<00:01:02.110> go<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.380> G

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
or it's in your head then I go to a G

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.380 
or it's in your head then I go to a G
minor<00:01:02.829> well<00:01:03.340> I<00:01:03.399> got<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.579> problem<00:01:03.820> i<00:01:04.000> can't<00:01:04.210> be<00:01:04.299> in

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
minor well I got a problem i can't be in

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.080 
minor well I got a problem i can't be in
the<00:01:04.479> key<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.659> C<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:05.019> have<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.140> G<00:01:05.379> minor<00:01:05.649> G<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:06.820> in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
the key of C and have a G minor G is in

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.270 
the key of C and have a G minor G is in
the<00:01:07.210> key<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.420> C<00:01:07.509> but<00:01:07.689> it's<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.110> major<00:01:08.350> chord<00:01:08.710> so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
the key of C but it's a major chord so

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.130 
the key of C but it's a major chord so
that<00:01:09.430> takes<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.909> key<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.180> C<00:01:10.210> off<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.659> table<00:01:10.990> I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
that takes the key of C off the table I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.760 
that takes the key of C off the table I
am<00:01:11.620> left<00:01:11.920> with<00:01:12.159> this<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.940> D<00:01:13.180> minor<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
am left with this that the D minor is

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.310 
am left with this that the D minor is
going<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.159> be<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.250> six<00:01:15.580> chord<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:17.229> you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
going to be a six chord and then you

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.840 
going to be a six chord and then you
guessed<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.770> Chi<00:01:18.040> mine<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.580> court

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
guessed it the Chi mine is a to court

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.280 
guessed it the Chi mine is a to court
because<00:01:18.970> that's<00:01:19.210> how<00:01:19.330> this<00:01:19.450> lesson<00:01:19.810> is<00:01:19.870> titled

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
because that's how this lesson is titled

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.440 
because that's how this lesson is titled

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
going to dig a little deeper here so if

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.570 
going to dig a little deeper here so if
you<00:01:24.940> did<00:01:25.150> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you did that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.320 
you did that
I<00:01:30.110> know<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.440> I<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.650> d<00:01:31.950> minor<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
I know that I have a d minor and if I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.960 
I know that I have a d minor and if I

d minor theoretical key is the key of F

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.740 
d minor theoretical key is the key of F
right<00:01:52.620> now<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.220> lunch<00:01:53.370> no<00:01:54.150> can't
