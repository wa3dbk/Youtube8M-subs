little<00:01:44.070> bit<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.490> looking<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> graph

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
little bit I was looking at the graph

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.609 
little bit I was looking at the graph
throughout<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> day<00:01:45.750> before<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.290> did<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
throughout the day before I did the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.649 
throughout the day before I did the
Power<00:01:46.799> Save<00:01:47.130> mode<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.450> like

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
Power Save mode it was kind of like

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.109 
Power Save mode it was kind of like
going<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:49.110> pretty<00:01:49.350> steep<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.979> after<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
going down pretty steep and after it it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.700 
going down pretty steep and after it it
leveled<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.840> bit<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.409> couldn't

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
leveled out a little bit so you couldn't

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.149 
leveled out a little bit so you couldn't
tell<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.009> was<00:01:53.220> doing<00:01:53.520> something

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
tell that was doing something

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.399 
tell that was doing something
I<00:01:55.189> also<00:01:55.579> downloaded<00:01:56.030> an<00:01:56.539> app<00:01:56.659> called<00:01:56.929> greenify

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
I also downloaded an app called greenify

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.380 
I also downloaded an app called greenify
where<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.429> puts<00:01:58.700> apps<00:01:58.969> into<00:01:59.749> hibernation

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
where it puts apps into hibernation

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.969 
where it puts apps into hibernation
right<00:02:02.390> now<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.869> says<00:02:03.109> you<00:02:03.500> know<00:02:03.619> that's<00:02:03.799> I'm

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
right now it says you know that's I'm

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.199 
right now it says you know that's I'm
app<00:02:04.130> sure<00:02:04.340> hibernating<00:02:04.909> some<00:02:05.090> are<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.880> we'll

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
app sure hibernating some are so we'll

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.809 
app sure hibernating some are so we'll
see<00:02:08.450> how<00:02:09.019> that<00:02:09.080> works<00:02:09.379> out<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:11.019> made<00:02:12.019> do<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> video

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
see how that works out I made do a video

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
that's not much of a problem there I was

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.119 
that's not much of a problem there I was
expecting<00:02:55.940> more<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:57.379> have<00:02:57.620> heard<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.040> know

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
lollipop is kind of weird how it manages

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.920 
lollipop is kind of weird how it manages
programs<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.549> greenify<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.510> program<00:03:02.840> you

want to use if you want to help maximize
battery<00:03:05.090> life<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:06.200> said<00:03:06.440> I'm<00:03:06.560> using

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
battery life and like I said I'm using

active which has very effective behavior
performance<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.739> think<00:03:15.919> it<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.069> helping<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
performance and I think it is helping a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.569 
performance and I think it is helping a
little<00:03:16.700> bit<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.169> also<00:03:18.169> changed<00:03:19.069> screen<00:03:19.370> timeout

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
little bit I also changed screen timeout

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.940 
little bit I also changed screen timeout
from<00:03:19.819> 30<00:03:20.180> seconds<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.690> 15<00:03:21.169> because<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.709> never

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
from 30 seconds to 15 because I never

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.740 
from 30 seconds to 15 because I never
really<00:03:22.190> turned<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.459> screen<00:03:22.669> off<00:03:22.849> with<00:03:23.599> the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
really turned the screen off with the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.589 
really turned the screen off with the
button<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.970> I'm<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.150> gonna<00:03:26.269> play<00:03:26.480> around

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
button and I'm just gonna play around

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.129 
button and I'm just gonna play around
things<00:03:26.959> like<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.829> said<00:03:28.930> subscribe<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.049> my

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
they do how much battery they'll used

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.370 
they do how much battery they'll used
and<00:03:40.910> then<00:03:41.359> from<00:03:41.540> there<00:03:41.690> I'll<00:03:41.900> go<00:03:42.049> more<00:03:42.260> in
