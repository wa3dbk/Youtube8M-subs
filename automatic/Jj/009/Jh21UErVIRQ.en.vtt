00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.109
 well this video will be the ombÃº that singh 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.690
 at first sight of the new go pro 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.480
 4 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.699
 just a couple of weeks ago go pro 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 he renewed some of his incredible cameras 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.740
 and among them he presented his new 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 top range models you are seeing 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.989
 on the screen is the go project hero 4 in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.119
 its silver version and this is the first 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.939
 go pro camera that has a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.590
 touch screen on its backside fits 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 note that the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.690
 back version of this same camera and the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.210
 The main difference between the two is that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.120
 the black version can record video at 30 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.100
 frames per second in 4k regarding the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 packing as always with this kind of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.929
 cameras we can appreciate the device 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 at the top and below we have 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.039
 a box that shows us all its 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.829
 technical specifications and some 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.140
 recommendations for use these cameras go 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.179
 directed to find an adventure and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.789
 be able to save the moment in a way 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.920
 unique and ironically the first adventure 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.350
 who will have with her will be the power 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.420
 remove it from the packaging but once it 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.310
 we managed to come across this elegant 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 box which contains the following 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 Manual articles guarantees and some 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 go pro stickers 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.120
 the camera battery a couple of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.280
 mounts for the camera a couple of covers 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.920
 backs for the protective housing of 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.950
 the camera the usb cable to charge the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 battery and finally a curved base and 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.229
 another flat to be able to attach your camera 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.119
 to any type of surface going to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.850
 the star of the show we must first 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.860
 remove it from its protective casing which 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.410
 certainly will allow us to submerge it in 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.090
 water and be able to record and take pictures without 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.649
 no problem the go pro 4 silver is 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.590
 incredibly choose and small her 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.210
 weight is only 83 grams and while 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 they appreciate the outside of this tiny 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 device I will mention the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.410
 Main modalities of photo and video 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.039
 that this tiny camera offers us is 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.429
 able to record video in 4k like that in 4k 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.780
 just like its black version but 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.420
 unfortunately he only does it at 15 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.550
 frames per second and honestly that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.860
 it's not very useful but where really 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.190
 shines this camera is at the time of 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.160
 record videos in 2.7 k to 30 frames per 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.980
 second or videos at 1080p 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.080
 up to 60 frames per second to be able 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.720
 make incredible slow motion effects 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.380
 the camera can also record videos in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.560
 720 up to 120 frames per second and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.230
 take photos up to 12 megapixels 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.240
 added to all the above the go pro yo 4 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.240
 silver has a wide repertoire 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.640
 of functions like creating time lapses 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.890
 continuous photos and a way that we 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.290
 allows recording at night or in low light 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.450
 without the quality of the video pictures being 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.670
 see affected and as I mentioned to 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.590
 beginning of the video this is the only 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.720
 go pro camera that has a 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.790
 integrated touch screen so neither 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.790
 even its black version has a 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.490
 and that that version costs $ 100 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.910
 more than this the price of this camera is 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.010
 of $ 399 and I'll be playing with it 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.170
 for a few weeks to later 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.660
 bring some examples of their quality 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.210
 of photo and video and it's likely that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.850
 those videos are uploaded to my personal channel 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.770
 so if they are not yet subscribed the 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.320
 I invite you to do so since very soon 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.030
 they return the videos to this channel with a 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.340
 totally format 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.470
 the link to that channel is appearing in 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.600
 screen and I also leave them in the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.060
 description of this video and for 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.830
 finish with this video let me know in 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.110
 the comments what do you think of this 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.390
 camera and what are the functions that 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.440
 more would like to see in the full 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.440
 he lived the same
