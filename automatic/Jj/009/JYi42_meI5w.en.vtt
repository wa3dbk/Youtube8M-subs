speech<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.719> now<00:00:15.719> i'm<00:00:15.900> not<00:00:15.929> sure<00:00:16.260> if

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
speech this time now i'm not sure if

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.830 
speech this time now i'm not sure if
they<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.800> actually<00:00:17.160> fire<00:00:18.150> over<00:00:18.510> each<00:00:18.600> other

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
they can actually fire over each other

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.099 
they can actually fire over each other
so<00:00:19.199> i<00:00:19.500> guess<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.820> long<00:00:21.300> line<00:00:22.490> actually

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109
