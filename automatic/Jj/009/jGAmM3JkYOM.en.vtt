00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.719
 what people today from review to pixel tc 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.420
 252 this is a timer for canon or 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.830
 nikon reflex cameras and what to look for 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.540
 can do with it and so on 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 Show like everything in this video here 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.170
 Today, first of all , let's take a look 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 the timer on here below, we have one 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 trigger button so we come first 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.630
 So everything from possible run 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.010
 then almost or simply the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.019
 make individual pictures of the has two 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.790
 pressure points then we have that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.380
 Steering wheel can be here in the middle 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.329
 we pick different presets 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.790
 how that works will show you then 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 we have a lamp up here so the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 Button on the lamp for the display 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.590
 So you can activate during the day 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 one is not so good at the moment 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.160
 night is really bright and then 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.300
 we still have a reproduction here and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.440
 stop button for example for the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.660
 interval recording 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.250
 So let's take a look at what you have 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.800
 there so everything can select as have only 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 we the preset here receptive frame by frame 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 We just come in and we'll come in 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.539
 Isolated image making in the background 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.610
 By the way, a canon eos 350 de and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.220
 then let's go on we have 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.780
 here series pictures dakar marica make 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.700
 several pictures are not so fast 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.860
 but who is here with newer cameras 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.250
 faster and then we have the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 bulls function as the says bolt 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.860
 function as well as I already have 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.630
 explains another video as long as 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 you press here or measure the camera 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.640
 unite from then shows anja the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.229
 bull function works straight and as long 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.700
 the shutter of the camera is open 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.500
 as long as the camera exposed and thus 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 you can do super long exposure 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.180
 the video how to do the whole thing too 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.920
 below in the description 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.210
 then one will bypass a stop 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.659
 preset further we can do that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 probably finish first 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.820
 the shorthand now just here 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.880
 that's exactly how we can stop 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.780
 So here we have a self-timer 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.579
 Self-timer can the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.670
 set different times and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.980
 then depending on how you want the then 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.010
 trigger camera 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.120
 open so then let's go on 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.950
 we already have our interval 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.000
 function because we can delay 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.580
 between each shot 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.760
 then adjust the length how long we are 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.340
 can record the interval and how 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.570
 said how long the delay is 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.210
 we can set again but 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.400
 before how long will record and 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.650
 before or or before that just the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.180
 I think then pictures and adjust 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.530
 just press start and it shows 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.300
 We stop at how many pictures already 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.730
 were recorded and every few 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.230
 seconds , the camera should now any 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.950
 turn an image on it when we now 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.540
 Press just so we see are 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.160
 again and again and that millions 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.450
 this player all this cable that 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.500
 can we take off so we just have to 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.150
 buy a timer and then we have 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.070
 one already taken care of and if we are 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.290
 then we can have several buddies 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.120
 still need to buy several of cables there 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.800
 The ten of the submarket buy finds 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.880
 also a very cool thing when 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.700
 also batteries and so on everything 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.720
 Included costs 25 euros the thing and 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.550
 can really recommend to anyone 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.890
 because it is really right 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.420
 great thing and you can but right 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.430
 do a lot and I can do it easily 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.130
 really recommend all of you only 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.520
 link to the topic in the description and 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.520
 ciao
