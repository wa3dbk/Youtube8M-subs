with<00:03:40.630> him<00:03:40.959> he<00:03:41.830> plays<00:03:42.040> coverage<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.459> lot<00:03:42.579> better

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
with him he plays coverage a lot better

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.819 
with him he plays coverage a lot better
than<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.000> expected<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.840> his<00:03:44.170> past<00:03:44.410> four<00:03:44.590> teams

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
than I expected and his past four teams

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.319 
than I expected and his past four teams
were<00:03:44.950> outstanding

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
were outstanding

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.970 
were outstanding
middle<00:03:47.079> linebacker<00:03:47.200> we<00:03:47.560> didn't<00:03:47.769> get<00:03:47.829> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
middle linebacker we didn't get the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.160 
middle linebacker we didn't get the
Willis<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.579> don't<00:03:49.299> really<00:03:49.420> know<00:03:49.690> how<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:49.900> feel

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
Willis I don't really know how I feel

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.630 
Willis I don't really know how I feel
about<00:03:50.230> him<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.709> be<00:03:50.799> honest<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.579> don't

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
about him to be honest with you I don't

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.310 
about him to be honest with you I don't
really<00:03:51.850> see<00:03:52.180> him<00:03:52.269> doing<00:03:52.570> much<00:03:52.750> on<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.019> field

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
really see him doing much on the field

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.660 
really see him doing much on the field
but<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.620> don't<00:03:53.829> see<00:03:53.950> him<00:03:54.040> doing<00:03:54.190> anything<00:03:54.400> bad

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
but I don't see him doing anything bad

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.170 
but I don't see him doing anything bad
either

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
either

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.979 
either
so<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.810> mean<00:03:56.079> as<00:03:56.170> far<00:03:56.350> as<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.650> goes<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.989> guess

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
so I mean as far as that goes I guess

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.990 
so I mean as far as that goes I guess
we'll<00:03:59.560> roll<00:04:00.100> out<00:04:00.130> with<00:04:00.459> him<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:00.640> know<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.880> me

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
we'll roll out with him you know to me

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000 
we'll roll out with him you know to me

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
he can stay on the team we did pick up

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.900 
he can stay on the team we did pick up
the<00:04:03.160> Joe<00:04:03.370> Haden

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
I did try starting him early when I

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.539 
I did try starting him early when I
first<00:04:06.760> got<00:04:06.970> him<00:04:07.180> ultimately<00:04:08.049> though<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.980> wasn't

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
first got him ultimately though I wasn't

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.039 
first got him ultimately though I wasn't
super<00:04:09.700> impressed<00:04:10.209> he<00:04:10.390> drops<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.810> lot<00:04:10.959> of

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
super impressed he drops a lot of

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.740 
super impressed he drops a lot of
interceptions<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:11.680> me<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:13.420> know<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.540> mean

his<00:04:13.840> man<00:04:14.019> covered<00:04:14.320> his<00:04:14.440> coverage<00:04:14.680> is

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
his man covered his coverage is

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.620 
his man covered his coverage is
outstanding<00:04:15.549> it's<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:15.880> he<00:04:16.000> dropped<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:16.570> many

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
outstanding it's just he dropped so many

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.780 
outstanding it's just he dropped so many
picks<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.290> I'd<00:04:17.890> rather<00:04:18.130> almost<00:04:18.549> have<00:04:18.760> a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
picks that I'd rather almost have a

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.180 
picks that I'd rather almost have a
little<00:04:19.299> worse<00:04:19.450> coverage<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.260> catch<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:21.010> pick

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
little worse coverage and catch the pick

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.529 
little worse coverage and catch the pick
when<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.430> do<00:04:21.519> have<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.729> chance<00:04:21.910> for<00:04:22.060> it<00:04:22.360> and

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
when you do have the chance for it and

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.870 
when you do have the chance for it and
then<00:04:23.200> we<00:04:23.349> have<00:04:23.560> Brian<00:04:23.800> Dawkins<00:04:24.130> which<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.669> my

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
then we have Brian Dawkins which in my

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.520 
then we have Brian Dawkins which in my
opinion<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.390> biggest<00:04:25.810> letdown<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.289> this

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
opinion is the biggest letdown of this

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.010 
opinion is the biggest letdown of this
entire

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
he's an absolute waste of time

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
rookies though and maybe I should start

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.920 
rookies though and maybe I should start
selling<00:06:04.279> them<00:06:04.550> because<00:06:05.210> it's<00:06:05.360> seeming<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.779> me

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.550 
that's like those players end up being
cheaper<00:06:08.120> than<00:06:08.300> what<00:06:08.449> you<00:06:08.569> can<00:06:08.719> sell<00:06:08.930> a<00:06:09.199> set<00:06:09.469> of

cheaper than what you can sell a set of
the<00:06:09.650> collection<00:06:10.039> for<00:06:10.330> so<00:06:11.330> maybe<00:06:11.990> that's<00:06:12.229> what

like 40k and ridiculous prices like that

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.629 
like 40k and ridiculous prices like that
and<00:06:26.750> you<00:06:26.990> know<00:06:27.080> when<00:06:27.199> you<00:06:27.259> start<00:06:27.500> selling<00:06:27.860> 18

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
and you know when you start selling 18

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.969 
and you know when you start selling 18
cards<00:06:29.120> that<00:06:29.270> are<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.719> know<00:06:29.840> averaging<00:06:30.469> let's

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
cards that are you know averaging let's

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.610 
cards that are you know averaging let's
say<00:06:31.130> they<00:06:31.219> average<00:06:31.580> 20k<00:06:32.090> a<00:06:32.120> piece<00:06:32.389> that<00:06:32.690> gets

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
say they average 20k a piece that gets

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.159 
say they average 20k a piece that gets
to<00:06:33.800> be<00:06:33.830> pretty<00:06:34.159> pricey<00:06:34.370> so<00:06:35.300> you<00:06:35.899> know<00:06:35.990> maybe

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
to be pretty pricey so you know maybe

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.020 
to be pretty pricey so you know maybe
that<00:06:36.320> would<00:06:36.800> be<00:06:36.830> the<00:06:37.039> best<00:06:37.370> bet

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
that would be the best bet

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.580 
that would be the best bet
unfortunately<00:06:40.030> like<00:06:40.389> you<00:06:40.780> know<00:06:40.900> we're<00:06:41.560> just

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.770 
do to change that you know would be nice
if<00:06:49.540> we<00:06:49.750> could<00:06:50.080> but<00:06:51.040> not<00:06:51.520> so<00:06:51.760> much<00:06:51.940> right<00:06:52.750> now

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
if we could but not so much right now

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.090 
if we could but not so much right now
you<00:06:52.930> can<00:06:53.110> see<00:06:53.260> I'm<00:06:53.350> kind<00:06:53.380> of<00:06:53.590> keeping<00:06:53.889> all<00:06:53.949> the

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
you can see I'm kind of keeping all the

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.909 
you can see I'm kind of keeping all the
golds<00:06:54.580> and<00:06:55.199> normally<00:06:56.199> I<00:06:56.260> don't<00:06:56.320> even<00:06:56.740> do<00:06:56.860> that

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
golds and normally I don't even do that

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.260 
golds and normally I don't even do that
but<00:06:57.220> the<00:06:57.310> reason<00:06:57.580> that<00:06:57.610> I<00:06:57.760> was<00:06:57.880> keeping<00:06:58.030> them

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
but the reason that I was keeping them

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.990 
but the reason that I was keeping them
was<00:06:58.540> because<00:06:59.020> of<00:06:59.139> the<00:06:59.199> fact<00:06:59.440> that<00:06:59.699> you<00:07:00.699> know<00:07:00.820> we

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
was because of the fact that you know we

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.090 
was because of the fact that you know we
do<00:07:01.210> have<00:07:01.240> the<00:07:02.139> positional<00:07:02.710> collections

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100 
do have the positional collections

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.409 
do have the positional collections
coming<00:07:03.310> up<00:07:03.520> and<00:07:04.229> you<00:07:05.229> know<00:07:05.320> this<00:07:05.500> was<00:07:05.740> the<00:07:06.419> the

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419 
coming up and you know this was the the

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.510 
coming up and you know this was the the
legend<00:07:07.720> pack<00:07:07.900> opening<00:07:08.380> just<00:07:08.680> prior<00:07:09.040> to<00:07:09.310> that<00:07:09.490> I

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
legend pack opening just prior to that I

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.810 
legend pack opening just prior to that I
think<00:07:10.080> and<00:07:11.080> we<00:07:11.979> you<00:07:12.160> know<00:07:12.190> we<00:07:12.280> just<00:07:12.520> wanted<00:07:12.700> to

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
think and we you know we just wanted to

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.000 
think and we you know we just wanted to
keep<00:07:12.940> as<00:07:13.150> much<00:07:13.270> as<00:07:13.450> we<00:07:13.570> could<00:07:13.780> I<00:07:14.139> think<00:07:14.710> I<00:07:14.800> kept

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
keep as much as we could I think I kept

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.409 
keep as much as we could I think I kept
them<00:07:15.130> anyway<00:07:15.370> maybe<00:07:15.669> I<00:07:15.790> didn't<00:07:16.030> keep<00:07:16.150> them<00:07:16.300> I

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
them anyway maybe I didn't keep them I

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.170 
them anyway maybe I didn't keep them I
don't<00:07:16.479> know<00:07:17.400> pretty<00:07:18.400> sure<00:07:18.580> I<00:07:18.610> did<00:07:18.880> sometimes

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
don't know pretty sure I did sometimes

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.550 
don't know pretty sure I did sometimes
like<00:07:19.479> sometimes<00:07:19.990> I<00:07:20.080> quick<00:07:20.260> sell<00:07:20.470> them

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
like sometimes I quick sell them

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.390 
like sometimes I quick sell them
sometimes<00:07:20.860> I<00:07:20.979> keep<00:07:21.160> them

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
sometimes I keep them

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.370 
sometimes I keep them
right<00:07:22.270> now<00:07:22.389> my<00:07:22.540> reserves<00:07:22.870> are<00:07:22.990> looking<00:07:23.229> kind

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
right now my reserves are looking kind

right now my reserves are looking kind
of<00:07:23.440> low<00:07:23.620> so<00:07:23.860> I'm<00:07:23.950> assuming<00:07:24.160> I<00:07:24.400> kept<00:07:24.669> them<00:07:24.790> all

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470

of low so I'm assuming I kept them all
if<00:07:26.470> my<00:07:26.620> reserves<00:07:26.889> are<00:07:27.070> full<00:07:27.310> it<00:07:27.460> usually<00:07:27.729> just
