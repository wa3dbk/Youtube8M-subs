00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
California then that is a huge

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.920 
California then that is a huge
agricultural<00:01:29.400> area<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.720> probably

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
agricultural area so I was probably

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
agricultural area so I was probably
spoiled<00:01:31.470> growing<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> the

produce I was eating could have just

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.080 
produce I was eating could have just
been<00:01:34.530> picked<00:01:34.799> off<00:01:34.920> someone's<00:01:35.310> farm<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.909> you
