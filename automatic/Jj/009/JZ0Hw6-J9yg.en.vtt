00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.849
 [Music] 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:12.750
 the wow puzzle 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.420
 this is a crane now i put together 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.590
 puzzle pieces I take this piece e 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.130
 I put it here at the center so now 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.550
 I put this piece up high 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.560
 here this piece right 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.680
 no there is something wrong 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.089
 the strange image I remove this piece e 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.289
 I'll take another one that's right 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:44.940
 the next one down below now 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:48.229
 this is so but something is wrong 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.969
 you have to put it in another place 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.710
 quite right 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.010
 this piece is the corner 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.519
 the piece with the empty black design 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.749
 this goes to the left the next with the 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:08.790
 cloud to the left here is another cloud 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:11.970
 now it's simple and the last one I have 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.380
 now the crane is ready for 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.380
 work in the construction site 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.290
 let's look at the next step with the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.880
 The digger has a large digger 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.400
 shovel and the individual 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.159
 instead of wheels 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.549
 [Applause] 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.420
 I take this piece to start the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.149
 put this here in the middle right now 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.750
 this piece there are the tracks then it 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.569
 I put this down at the top 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.740
 almost ready digger this is fine 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:02.609
 here this one is fine here but there is 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.530
 something strange there is an empty space 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:09.970
 move this piece 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.390
 yes it does not go here so it is much better than it is 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 the next 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.470
 this is all blue I put it 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.740
 in the top corner 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.880
 this is brown the piece goes down 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.170
 with the empty tracks another piece 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.170
 brown in the left corner 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.900
 this important piece 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.840
 this goes here now I did it 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.310
 here is the digger now we can 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.150
 dig a big hole 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.430
 [Music] 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.329
 the blue tractor is my favorite 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.860
 let's put the pieces together then let's get started 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:03.260
 from here now there is something that 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.079
 does not go that strange tractor 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.870
 let's put this piece aside but maybe 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.390
 we just have to turn the pieces must 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.340
 coincide in form and design 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.920
 this is not good 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.590
 a moment let's put that aside it 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.780
 let's put it right here 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.389
 this is a part of the cabin la 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.319
 empty cloud of the sky 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.879
 now this vacuous piece right 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.359
 this is the back of the 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:36.769
 tractor the brown goes down 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:39.200
 now this is the piece 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.349
 the piece is blue with the sky empty 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.250
 all brown, this is the engine 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.220
 of the tractor 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.930
 just a piece of wheel another piece 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.310
 brown at the bottom 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.329
 the last piece now I did here is the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.870
 tractor 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.870
 what will you do
