 We'll make suggestions 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.480
 posted on youtube 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.980
 little maria mole 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 the ingredients that we are going to use to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.190
 Our recipe is a box with 50 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.310
 grams of powder for soft maria that we 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.600
 Let's settle on 8 tablespoons of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.519
 boiling water 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.939
 we'll heat this water has to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.599
 be a hot gelatin watch 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.469
 colorless and tasteless than 12 grams one 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 carton of condensed milk the same measure 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.710
 in china zhang full of milk itself 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.719
 a box of cream and 100 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.629
 grams of cocaine side 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.980
 here we using dehydrated dry body 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.780
 that gets better 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.059
 but if you do not have this grated coconut 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 and can use that man of the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.539
 even to make the syrup of our 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.930
 little dot 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.210
 We'll use six spoons of sugar and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 3 tablespoons of water 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 these are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.320
 use for our today's recipe 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.060
 first we will hydrate the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 ingredients you need 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 we will put the 5 tablespoons in the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.640
 gelatin and column and no flavor 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.640
 now we're leaving here with five 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.230
 minutes is now we throw in the water 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.890
 boiling powder for soft maria 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.370
 It is very important to hydrate these 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 two colorless gelatin ingredients which 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.140
 the powder for soft maria for the alloy a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.930
 our revenue 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.870
 We have to mix well even there. 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 well- dissolved gelatin without color and without 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.670
 taste we left her here for some 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 minutes in five tablespoons of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.290
 cold water 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.080
 now we're going to dissolve it it can be in the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.980
 microwave if you have or as 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.390
 We 're going to make the stove even in a 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.220
 panela we'll put this gelatin 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 but let's put the time here in the pan 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.990
 sufficient to dissolve the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.960
 can not let it boil not that if she 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.010
 only reveal its properties to your 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.630
 function in revenue that is from the league is in 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.560
 low fire 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.220
 Aida broke erase the lining we 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.250
 pour blender or regular milk and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.770
 gelatin we hear now in the liner 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.300
 we give a light beat 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.610
 now we're going to put the body here 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.180
 for the soft maria 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.920
 we see a light beat a hint of that 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.930
 recipe that milk has to be in the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.050
 room temperature can not be 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.020
 ice cream and even if it's now we go 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:56.210
 mix the remaining ingredients 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.970
 the condensed milk the cream and the 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.980
 grated coconut 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.200
 now we're going to hit with five minutes 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.100
 to be a very fine mixture and 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100
 homogeneous 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.580
 in a pot on low heat we go 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.080
 put the sugar 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.140
 We're going to make the caramel sauce here. 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.030
 People I think it's in there we 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.709
 we're messing around so we do not burn 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.200
 get burned 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.470
 the bitter tail but everything is gone 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.200
 solved now we put water from the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.830
 sea down 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.000
 we continue to stir until it rains 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.620
 subject matter 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.349
 We can not stop stirring or burning. 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.980
 It's very important this tip is to do 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.739
 this cause always on the low fire is there 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.629
 people are in this consistency that 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.700
 we can make very thick markings not 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.840
 why do you want it to cool down 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:02.090
 she gets very hard we put out the fire 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.440
 now we put the cause that way 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:10.530
 that we do so by spreading it well 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:14.359
 as if he had a tango in the form with 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.359
 careful that cause is hot 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.930
 now we dump the cream that we 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.500
 we hit the blender 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.740
 now we cover with plastic and let's 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.900
 to refrigerate for 12 hours 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.110
 we do not like to take in the freezer 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.389
 We do not take in the refrigerator have passed 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.280
 12 hours that our foreign revenue has already 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.020
 on the tile 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.020
 we passed the spatula like that 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.460
 informed 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.150
 Look how nice, people, if they win a little 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.610
 calm in the background is a partner and 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.620
 lead to fire 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:05.230

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.180
