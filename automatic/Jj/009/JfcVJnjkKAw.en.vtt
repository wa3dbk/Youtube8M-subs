00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.270 
in the film well we don't know per se
but<00:00:33.809> apparently<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> same<00:00:35.100> reference

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

battleships<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.690> fair<00:00:39.899> because

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
battleships but that's not fair because

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.369 
battleships but that's not fair because
