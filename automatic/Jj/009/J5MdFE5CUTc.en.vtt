00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.350
 good to all united still did not live good 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:06.690
 block videos pretty interesting and that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.030
 I had a really rethink a whole 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.340
 little what is the video game and such and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.309
 how are they posed as man 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.789
 you know is an exclusive game of xbox 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.190
 guayas to have remedied developed by 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 remedy studies remedy 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.640
 developed by remedy studies good 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.980
 you know they are the creators of alan 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 wake and such and good with quantum break 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.480
 they hope to give it a 360 degree turn 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.180
 what are video games in general like 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 we know them and how it is developed 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.969
 everything in general, not how it is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.860
 interpreted the argument and this kind of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.329
 things in a recent interview like 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.790
 I say they have clarified a bit how 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.079
 It was all this and it seems that not only 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.050
 with we will bring the main character 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
 but also the antagonist to the bad guy 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.410
 game and it seems that we will do it from a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.280
 pretty masterful way and pretty 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.030
 good 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 It seems that the game is full of 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.810
 decisions decisions that always seems 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.580
 be that 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.770
 that they will make a change within the 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.530
 I do not know the truth, I'm fed up 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.120
 listen to the same thing you should always have 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.400
 decisions that will affect the game and 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.920
 then you see your affects a cock no 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.050
 affects affects a pizza at the end and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.630
 until you have 20 thousand finals that are all 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.160
 a mess and barely affects anything is 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.280
 one character or another dies but good 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.290
 it hardly affects we have to in this case 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.880
 affect quite and really cool 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 it seems that at the end of each chapter 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.470
 we will have the ability to choose 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.450
 what future do we want to choose because 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.240
 you know this will be an action game in 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.250
 third person in which in which 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.010
 we will have powers like that to see the future 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.740
 of the past and different things more and 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.970
 really, I hope you have these 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.590
 decisions having a repercursiÃ³n 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 good and seems to be not so 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 At the end of each chapter we can see 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.680
 a different future and the one that we choose 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.960
 Well, at the beginning, the chapter 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.630
 will have a considerable and good change 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.690
 I guess I really aim 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.580
 always that our decisions take 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.380
 one way or the other I always want it 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.539
 carry or I want it or I do not want it to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.159
 carry it in the way that if I return it to 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.289
 play be 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.640
 or is totally different from what I have 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.160
 played I do not want a super change no 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.750
 I want to suddenly play it and make it a 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.489
 car game I do not mean that I 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 I mean that in the history of a 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.360
 I do not want important change 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.830
 so we expect it to be so off bounds 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.150
 family have put my long teeth 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.650
 and I'm pretty excited about the game 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.269
 let's hope it's good to make this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.080
 game well if it works well it can be a 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:36.739
 sell consoles directly still we 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.140
 has shown nothing of confirmed gameplay 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.640
 a digital came out of about 3 or 4 seconds 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.400
 but hey, you can barely see anything with a 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.709
 shit quality and we can not say 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.450
 as how it is and such but really 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.459
 go up gx that is celebrated in 7 of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.650
 December if I 'm not mistaken not to 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.470
 say that it may show something of 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.690
 quantum break gameplay and nothing 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.099
 kids, I'll leave you all the details 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 of the description if you want to spend 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.120
 to read them and such because it's an interview 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.739
 pretty pretty the group but good 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.379
 I believe that the concept left a 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.329
 little clear and the truth the game see 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.220
 I'm waiting for that to handle the bad guy and 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.109
 the good and the bad can take 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.520
 decisions that affect the good that 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.030
 quite like it is something that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.290
 I had never thought and that I think that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.610
 never seen at least not if you have 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.290
 done or not at least they will carry a good 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.880
 I remember that the truth has been 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.100
 I find it quite innovative and quite 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.810
 good so good nothing more kids 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.810
 come on in the next next extra video
