00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.770
 or the doll is come back with a new 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.800
 video and this week I decide to do the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.940
 sad or crazy clown and is the first of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.920
 the videos that I'm going to do for 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.240
 halloween for this year I hope that you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430
 like 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.220
 I start by applying a foundation 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.439
 white if you do not have white try that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.029
 be much clearer than all the time 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.269
 what do you want to get a face 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269
 pale 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:38.560
 once you've finished we start with 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:42.370
 the eyes apply a test be a first 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.280
 or in this case I am applying a 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.070
 color in the over the eye because thus to the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.400
 apply from the makeup does not leave no 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.400
 is falling 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 this is going to be like the basis for the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.190
 makeup for the rest of the makeup 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.190
 Of the eye 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.170
 like you 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.170
 once you have the base take a 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.360
 intense black color matte and applied 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.120
 especially the upper eyelid 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.130
 inside you do not have to be very careful 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.570
 in order to apply it over all 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.700
 eyelid and up 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.409
 and once you have applied it to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.780
 get that blur effect what 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.320
 you have to do is pick up a brush 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.150
 clean and just go mixing the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.040
 colors of white and black and you're going to 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 get that smoked effect that effect 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.310
 ghost 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.050
 once you have finished, take an eyeliner 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:51.260
 or a gel eyeliner and redefining 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.260
 your eyes or contiguous for another time 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.630
 to not leave finger marks on the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:09.060
 foundation is good that I 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.060
 help with a paper 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.400
 so you do not have the marks of the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.400
 fingers over the whole face 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 and of course how we want the clown to be 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.760
 sad we have to redefine the eyebrows 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.760
 make them seemingly sad 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.960
 to define the eyebrows as we are 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.970
 drawing with black on white and for 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.860
 not having to send everything and go back to 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.860
 start from scratch start with 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.049
 Make up little by little and add 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.049
 black more and more 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.540
 you 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.510
 for vertical stripes simply 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.430
 Mass from the center of the eye was going 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.799
 drawing little by little if you have a 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.930
 liquid eyeliner because it will be much 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.390
 easier that if you have to have a 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.349
 very good pulse and if you do not see drawing 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.349
 slowly 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.690
 for the lips the only thing that you have to 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.720
 to do is redefine the lips 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.790
 drawing that conduit and you want 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.610
 lengthen it if you want to do those that 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.250
 they seem longer than they are and more 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.510
 chemicals but that depends on each 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.230
 how do you think your lips are left 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.230
 well, three things 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.459
 that is already for each soul 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.870
 Y 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.409
 once the outline is drawn 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.180
 black simply with catching a 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.790
 Red lipstick 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.840
 they paint my lips as normal and 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.400
 to create that transcendence that effect 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.100
 blurred the only thing you have to do 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.540
 is to open your mouth shut a few 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.970
 times and you're done 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.940
 then we want to define the face a bit 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.150
 if you want to make yourself in the circuits 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.520
 in the loops afterwards it looks very good and 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.370
 if you can not give this triangle shape 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.910
 to redefine the interest that stops 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.949
 thin scales to the face that already 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.949
 it depends on each one how you want to put yourself 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.439
 to give more glamor to makeup in 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:57.080
 draw a creampie what you can do 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:05:00.690
 is to pick up a pebble of these 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.620
 bright and stick with glue 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.800
 tabs from the middle 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.840
 and makeup is already all you 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.419
 remains to be done is to put on the wig or 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.600
 make hair as you want it exists and 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.420
 is on the list to scare 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.230
 I hope you liked this first
