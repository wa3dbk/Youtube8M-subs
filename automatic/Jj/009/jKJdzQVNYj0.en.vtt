00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:18.529
 o must exist from the river 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.710
 already begins with a Greek groan 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.980
 teaser teaser again I lived the sky 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 is something that if you talk a lot but little if you understood is the research 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.100
 on embryonic stem cells on the one hand 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.550
 say it's an open door 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.160
 opening for the healing of hundreds of thousands without cure 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.820
 on the other hand 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.180
 is an open door for the manufacture of healthy supermen for 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.450
 always and certainly white and blue-eyed 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.060
 the Nazi dream 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.620
 the person has to talk about it, he's a postdoctoral scientist on the subject 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.730
 but still 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.150
 is internationally-and much more so than it is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.850
 she was funny 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.280
 O 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.020
 this arc of possibilities that the scientist doubted 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.060
 he is such a radical seer as 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.430
 with the first crop explains roque in question by the border in the area by 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.840
 what 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.620
 reverse the facts 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.030
 inter, that lost both of us, we do not have the capacity to see all that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.210
 imagine 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.310
 that's what the cards indicate 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.210
 are screens that one can take from embryos shortly after Khadafi with 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.370
 nation 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.870
 and if in the morning being they would normally 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.400
 only goal in fertilization clinics the couple 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.260
 go look for the psf assisted by got all the movies I wanted 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.060
 Ahhhhhh 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.710
 can get the site from assisted capture 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.270
 We're going to hold meetings. 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 these embryos 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.890
 ended up staying 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.230
 discarded 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.910
 that concord sides and if I do in life are discarded like you 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.400
 explain it 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.639
 to a select literate audience 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.229
 What are the research on embryonic stem cells? 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.989
 and what people will gain from it 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.989
 from there that the meeting the issue the confrontation of 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.630
 50 cent them 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.849
 in 5 days after presentation 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 because you can remove this from this screen 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.859
 you can have 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.049
 generations have been 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.549
 theoretically this time screen that turns any pc 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.909
 in the body we have hope 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.249
 from that cell 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.109
 can form the future muscle training will get voting a screen 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:46.779
 knocking 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.879
 and who can not regenerate and seven wounded 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.909
 given a person who has a problem with the specific aeg 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.789
 understand that he occupied all 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.179
 of transplants 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.539
 Give it to me, give me a concrete example of God and talk nonsense. 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.029
 I broke my arm whatever you want for the group in the arm 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.819
 the little face 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.689
 I have already been working with this already the approved text 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.650
 in this test as correctly as each one has for the other the councilman 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.349
 hand because people 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.870
 there are still some risks 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.099
 that we can get around the ect certainty 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.899
 that of kido that this screen will do 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:24.769
 but animals are doing 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.349
 in Brazil and in the world 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.819
 in the world is also not kill a follow-up captured in the rest of the world 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.550
 do not attack 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.590
 after the good is that we are not working with your ballast with the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.379
 cu of embryos 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.689
 at the time of the adult stem cell exchange explains this 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:47.439
 so the cartel that avoid a motorcycle wanted to adult tetanus to the hotel 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.480
 current cup 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.109
 in the bone marrow 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.269
 in adipose tissue 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.279
 in the dental pulp 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.569
 in the umbilical cord 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.069
 then the one that also has the potential in any way preferred 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.399
 not all with an embryonic splint but some 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.799
 and we are working with this tool so they are showing by 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:07.849
 example to have 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.099
 rapporteur 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.519
 adipose tissue strip 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.620
 she has the potential of muscle shape 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.650
 of shape bear cartilage 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.880
 and injecting nathan she has animal models in showing that this is 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.829
 possible 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.680
 then skip that childbirth 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.970
 but the mullet in favor of humans suffer some satisfactory conclusion 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.740
 about 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.529
 Why do you do? 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.529
 or what you do or you never called and for this 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.430
 because I work with him outside 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.860
 I always had a passion 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.099
 by health science 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.590
 and when I was in high school I fell in love with genetics 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.940
 I was always fascinated by this thing, said 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.919
 they gave it all because we are not 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.220
 herbert motta features how it works 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.479
 how does our body work 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.400
 ah he's the whole history of apec that is dealing with the genome 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.580
 and more recently the word genome 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.720
 you can explain in an easy way for television viewers 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:12.650
 the genome that all genetic material that we were from the pasusp there 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.069
 what do you have dna 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.720
 this DNA molecule when j 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.460
 the Koran with sperms the new funorte 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.719
 information here shock we will have 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.599
 It's in the genome. 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.039
 half benÃ© metal mothers wanting to appear 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.050
 and it seems that this consensus in brasilia with bonfim eyebrow hair 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.590
 Anything is discovered if I'm your daughter's father. 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.410
 the school intends not to well the hair strand has something as a whole 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.120
 fiuk if you have a live screen 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.150
 but we can because the mayor 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.029
 I'm not even 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.139
 with a good moment in the saliva 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.389
 so what you 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.490
 handmade coffee 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.069
 and leave the ticket for coffee 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.139
 There's rest of dna in the little girl. We have a lot less tried all this for everything. 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.879
 The person next to the piece is drawing blood but it is not 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:09.550
 Since then, everyone has been exporting and they have noticed the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.940
 In fact, it is a very interesting ethical question because he 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.110
 we have it because I asked that the morning 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.370
 the health insurance companies to decide 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.620
 we take our well-being that discovers we have risk and even some diseases 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.849
 high cost for example 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:28.919
 one can tell 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.919
 you can realize every time even more why not do 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.970
 A borrowed material was then presented with an ethical question to 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.689
 belongs to 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.550
 our christmas is the dna that is discarded is our 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.719
 once criticizing the player ll love 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.210
 public it may have 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.270
 reality has given me either 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.270
 Do you think that's why it does not repeat itself? 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.599
 that belongs 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.189
 the person 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.900
 because it is but it is a very important ethical question 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.960
 and in the time that bathes the punishment 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.059
 Paulo 

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:04.879
 and it's mine 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.879
 can not you 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:12.520
 he is an electrical part in the country 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.949
 can not 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:17.949
 I gave it good 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.729
 although legal iml 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:24.460
 fb 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.240
 he is just like that 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.889
 the box 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:29.830
 Paulo 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.520
 for that it is necessary the bea 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.349
 every time it has a nathan coffee screen it is already totally in her type 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:43.849
 O
