00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.309
 as if to say it every time 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.200
 the meaning of this magnificent word is lost 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.199
 I’ll just say that today we ’ll talk about 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.830
 another successful project and under the project 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.929
 I mean, of course, the comics on this 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.090
 it came to my hands amazingly 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.130
 kind and beautiful line with pictures 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.020
 which will surely return any 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.200
 an adult in times when he 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.710

 and not childhood and may not remember but 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.280
 we will remember 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 perhaps we will begin 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.840
 from afar publishing house or rather 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.660
 art studio that gave us this miracle 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.450
 called han comics which is on the market 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.290

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.930
 world they heard September 2011 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.600
 then the walls of the academy of arts named 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.480
 Zhurgenova was an exhibition dedicated 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.300
 comics where the first was first shown 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.330
 their comics when comics and then how 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.690
 says rushed over the next year 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.750

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.210
 there was a photo with the first 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.360
 printed edition of the first issue 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.000
 fairy tales and so fairy tales 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.940
 comic over which everything worked whole 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.310
 Artyom Gorchakov as there is a screenwriter 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.380
 and format artist 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 this is a little picture book 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.900
 less than the usual character that like me 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.940
 it only seems to give him charm himself 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.550
 the cone itself is about three 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.400
 modern teen tannin url they and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.019
 nastya which is almost random 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.110
 way throw in parallels 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.890
 fairytale world where they will meet with 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.650
 movies giants and dragons and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.450
 other schoolboy creatures 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.880
 will have to figure out how to get home 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.530
 and help them in this quest will be three 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.380
 sisters 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.330
 meruert dariga and aria as well 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.700
 mysteriously golden-haired boy by 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.040
 named this tomboy which 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.180
 part-time also the character of the people 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.140
 Kazakh fairy tales 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.420
 well, just in case in other words 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.180
 the plot is very much like the real 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.100
 a good children's fairy tale can be in it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.040
 notice a lot of references like 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.380
 children's work for example blue cat 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.350
 like a rabbit frock coat and a hat is 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.470
 the main reference to the unforgettable 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.819
 product of lewis carroll drawing in 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.819
 this comic speaks for itself 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.920
 the author managed to convey the atmosphere 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.680
 good and good travel color 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.510
 very bright and saturated places 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.650
 reminds soviet cartoon with 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.959
 eastern slope 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.680
 but often they just want to 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.219
 admire the plot of us comics too everything 's 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.980
 okay 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.530
 character behave as befits 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.349
 with pages and dialogs are not overloaded 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.159
 conversations are not overloaded with text like 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.439
 it is said that it is simple and tasteful 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.900
 summing up I want to say that before 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:53.349
 me worthy work industry 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.139
 comics she really like a child but 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.379
 and an adult will also find him 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.010
 interesting but if not then he has 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.010
 just no soul 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:13.460
 if at the moment there are already two 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.900
 rooms of four impression compiled 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.400
 especially from the first two 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.390
 and may change the end of the story 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.430
 but at the moment everything is good wants 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.500
