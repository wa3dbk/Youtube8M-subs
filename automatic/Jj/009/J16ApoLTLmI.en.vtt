00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that right now this is a I recorded this

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.240 
that right now this is a I recorded this
earlier<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.270> before<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.799> him<00:01:53.009> walk

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
up and knife lunge and that would be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
up and knife lunge and that would be
yeah<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.810> perfect<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
yeah that's that's perfect but this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.719 
yeah that's that's perfect but this
isn't<00:01:58.649> only<00:01:58.799> play<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.640> I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
isn't only play you can get up and I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459 
isn't only play you can get up and I
don't<00:01:59.820> even<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> did<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.350> this

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
don't even like this but I did like this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.749 
don't even like this but I did like this
plot<00:02:01.710> before<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.070> knew<00:02:02.189> how<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.549> up<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
plot before I knew how to get it up the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.020 
plot before I knew how to get it up the
other<00:02:02.820> way<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:04.280> basically<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
other way but basically you just you

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.340 
other way but basically you just you
just<00:02:06.060> knife<00:02:06.390> lunch<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.840> don't<00:02:06.960> even<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.170> I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
just knife lunch I don't even think I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.600 
just knife lunch I don't even think I
get<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> knife<00:02:08.069> land<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.429> here

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
get it when I knife land on here

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.190 
get it when I knife land on here
probably<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.840> used<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.080> do

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
probably just because I'm so used to do

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.589 
probably just because I'm so used to do
it<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.500> other<00:02:10.530> way<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.430> basically<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.300> up<00:02:12.390> on

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it the other way but basically get up on

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.120 
it the other way but basically get up on
that<00:02:12.780> wall

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
that wall

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.840 
that wall
that<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.580> barely<00:02:14.360> missed<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:16.340> once<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.670> get

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that I barely missed but once you get

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.730 
that I barely missed but once you get
over<00:02:17.000> there<00:02:17.210> or<00:02:17.900> once<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.230> up<00:02:18.290> here<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.680> you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.790 
extra docks they just make sure you hold
out<00:03:01.760> your<00:03:01.970> tack<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.840> walk<00:03:03.050> where<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> walk<00:03:03.650> you

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
out your tack and walk where I walk you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.110 
out your tack and walk where I walk you
can<00:03:03.950> tell<00:03:04.190> where<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> death<00:03:04.580> barriers<00:03:04.910> aren't

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
can tell where the death barriers aren't

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.470 
can tell where the death barriers aren't
even<00:03:05.450> see<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:06.160> detection<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.310> rocks<00:03:07.580> but

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
even see the detection of the rocks but

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.180 
even see the detection of the rocks but
right<00:03:08.630> here<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.990> probably<00:03:09.200> where<00:03:09.650> most<00:03:09.980> you

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
right here is probably where most you

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.860 
right here is probably where most you
guys<00:03:10.340> will<00:03:10.550> probably<00:03:10.760> die<00:03:11.120> out<00:03:11.300> if<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.690> don't

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
guys will probably die out if you don't

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.560 
guys will probably die out if you don't
have<00:03:11.990> your<00:03:12.080> attack<00:03:13.000> but<00:03:14.000> make<00:03:14.120> sure<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:14.360> walk

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
have your attack but make sure you walk

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.940 
have your attack but make sure you walk
along<00:03:14.840> here<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.500> one's<00:03:15.680> pretty<00:03:15.890> cool

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
along here and this one's pretty cool

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.940 
along here and this one's pretty cool
because<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.370> can<00:03:16.520> go<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.180> way<00:03:17.210> over<00:03:17.300> here

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
because you can go all the way over here

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.530 
because you can go all the way over here
and<00:03:18.950> don't<00:03:19.430> don't<00:03:19.730> worry<00:03:19.850> too<00:03:20.120> much<00:03:20.150> because

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
and don't don't worry too much because

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.540 
and don't don't worry too much because
falling<00:03:21.020> to<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.290> right<00:03:21.470> isn't<00:03:21.740> that<00:03:22.070> big<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.310> a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
falling to the right isn't that big of a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.310 
falling to the right isn't that big of a
problem<00:03:22.850> because<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.420> can<00:03:23.540> always<00:03:23.720> jump<00:03:24.050> back

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
problem because you can always jump back

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.010 
problem because you can always jump back
up<00:03:24.530> there<00:03:24.920> if<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.820> take<00:03:26.000> an<00:03:26.120> alternate<00:03:26.810> route

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
up there if you take an alternate route

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.320 
up there if you take an alternate route
back<00:03:27.440> but<00:03:28.310> just<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.670> hold<00:03:28.880> your<00:03:28.940> attack<00:03:29.150> out

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
back but just just hold your attack out

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.550 
back but just just hold your attack out
right<00:03:29.450> here<00:03:29.630> if<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.810> don't<00:03:29.960> want<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.170> drop<00:03:30.350> and

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
right here if you don't want to drop and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.680 
right here if you don't want to drop and
have<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.800> go<00:03:30.890> back<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.400> there's<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.390> couple<00:03:32.540> of

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
have to go back so there's a couple of

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.780 
have to go back so there's a couple of
barriers<00:03:33.080> right<00:03:33.560> here<00:03:33.950> like<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.310> fall<00:03:34.550> right

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
barriers right here like I fall right

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.480 
barriers right here like I fall right
there<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.440> whole<00:03:36.650> spot<00:03:36.890> no<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.160> can<00:03:37.310> see

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
there in this whole spot no one can see

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.700 
there in this whole spot no one can see
you<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.660> predator<00:03:38.990> missiles<00:03:39.230> can't<00:03:39.410> get<00:03:39.560> you

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
you the predator missiles can't get you

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.960 
you the predator missiles can't get you
so<00:03:39.860> that's<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.070> perfect<00:03:40.460> spot<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:40.820> you're<00:03:40.880> a

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
so that's a perfect spot if you're a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.449 
so that's a perfect spot if you're a
try-hard<00:03:41.270> or<00:03:41.720> or<00:03:42.530> whatever<00:03:42.800> but<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.310> is

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
try-hard or or whatever but this is

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.130 
try-hard or or whatever but this is
mainly<00:03:43.670> for<00:03:43.880> trick<00:03:44.120> charters<00:03:44.420> if<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.930> want<00:03:45.080> to

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
mainly for trick charters if you want to

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.240 
mainly for trick charters if you want to
get<00:03:45.230> back<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.590> couldn't<00:03:45.830> go<00:03:45.950> where<00:03:46.100> I<00:03:46.160> just

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
get back you couldn't go where I just

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.250 
get back you couldn't go where I just
was<00:03:46.550> going<00:03:46.820> over<00:03:47.060> there<00:03:47.300> but<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:47.930> like<00:03:48.140> to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
was going over there but I like to

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.140 
was going over there but I like to
trickshot<00:03:48.650> right<00:03:48.950> here<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.610> go<00:03:49.880> ahead<00:03:49.940> and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
trickshot right here and go ahead and

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.990 
trickshot right here and go ahead and
just<00:03:50.270> jump<00:03:50.540> down<00:03:50.690> right<00:03:50.959> there<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.940> is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
just jump down right there and this is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.880 
just jump down right there and this is
the<00:03:53.180> by<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.720> waterfalls<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.770> can

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
the by the waterfalls and you can

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.830 
the by the waterfalls and you can
trickshot<00:03:55.250> basically<00:03:55.610> anywhere<00:03:56.030> over<00:03:56.360> here<00:03:56.600> I

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
trickshot basically anywhere over here I

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800 
trickshot basically anywhere over here I
like<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.740> trickshot<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.000> left<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.780> the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
like to trickshot to the left and to the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
like to trickshot to the left and to the
right<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.020> this<00:04:00.230> thing<00:04:00.410> because<00:04:00.680> there's

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
right of this thing because there's

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.500 
right of this thing because there's
barriers<00:04:01.220> everywhere<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.300> can<00:04:02.390> actually

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
barriers everywhere and you can actually

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.199 
barriers everywhere and you can actually
go<00:04:02.750> around<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.020> whole<00:04:03.140> map<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:04.459> might<00:04:05.000> add

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
go around the whole map and I might add

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.810 
go around the whole map and I might add
that<00:04:05.240> in<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.810> end<00:04:06.250> but<00:04:07.250> I'm<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.550> can<00:04:07.670> go

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
that in the end but I'm you can go

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.910 
that in the end but I'm you can go
around<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.570> whole<00:04:08.720> map<00:04:08.990> on<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:09.500> thing<00:04:09.740> so

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
around the whole map on this thing so

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.500 
around the whole map on this thing so
that's<00:04:10.040> probably<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.580> coolest<00:04:10.730> thing<00:04:11.000> about

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
that's probably the coolest thing about

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.840 
that's probably the coolest thing about
this<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:12.260> can<00:04:12.470> go<00:04:12.590> around<00:04:12.800> everywhere

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
this you can go around everywhere

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.420 
this you can go around everywhere
so<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:15.350> can<00:04:15.470> jump<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.709> these<00:04:15.860> buildings<00:04:16.220> too

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
so you can jump on these buildings too

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.710 
so you can jump on these buildings too
right<00:04:16.609> here<00:04:16.820> there's<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.120> good<00:04:17.239> trick<00:04:17.420> sharing

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
right here there's a good trick sharing

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.750 
right here there's a good trick sharing
spots<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.650> see<00:04:18.799> further<00:04:19.430> across

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
spots just so you can see further across

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.880 
spots just so you can see further across
the<00:04:20.000> map<00:04:20.209> even<00:04:20.989> though<00:04:21.290> you<00:04:21.380> can<00:04:21.500> custody

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
the map even though you can custody

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.070 
the map even though you can custody
basically<00:04:22.280> anywhere<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.419> it's<00:04:23.570> good<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.930> can

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
basically anywhere but it's good you can

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.290 
basically anywhere but it's good you can
kind<00:04:24.500> of<00:04:24.590> bury<00:04:25.070> your<00:04:25.280> jump<00:04:25.550> everywhere<00:04:26.060> you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
kind of bury your jump everywhere you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.800 
kind of bury your jump everywhere you
can<00:04:26.419> get<00:04:26.510> on<00:04:26.570> that

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
can get on that

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.080 
can get on that
bridge<00:04:26.960> in<00:04:27.139> front<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.470> me<00:04:27.580> we<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.700> get<00:04:28.790> on<00:04:28.910> top

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
bridge in front of me we can get on top

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.930 
bridge in front of me we can get on top
of<00:04:29.150> them<00:04:30.370> basically<00:04:31.370> anywhere<00:04:31.700> that<00:04:31.820> has<00:04:31.880> a

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
of them basically anywhere that has a
