I'll link it down below but I'll do that

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.470 
I'll link it down below but I'll do that
test<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.250> see<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.670> hair<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:18.970> merging<00:02:19.209> and

part<00:02:40.329> that<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:40.659> keep<00:02:41.170> noticing<00:02:41.879> right<00:02:42.879> here<00:02:43.829> I'm

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
part that I keep noticing right here I'm

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.069 
part that I keep noticing right here I'm
hoping<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.640> not<00:02:45.790> gonna<00:02:45.909> be<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> problem<00:02:46.329> but

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
hoping that's not gonna be a problem but

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.740 
hoping that's not gonna be a problem but
I<00:02:47.140> mean<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.440> did<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.010> middle<00:02:48.220> part<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.359> I

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
I mean I did get the middle part so I

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.599 
I mean I did get the middle part so I
shouldn't<00:02:50.200> be<00:02:50.379> much<00:02:50.590> along<00:02:50.889> that<00:02:51.099> positioning

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
shouldn't be much along that positioning

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.099 
shouldn't be much along that positioning
right<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:53.200> random<00:02:53.799> part<00:02:55.230> okay<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:57.310> I

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
pretty durable since I'm very

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.949 
pretty durable since I'm very
heavy-handed<00:03:23.489> when<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.519> deal<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.000> hair<00:03:25.629> and

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
heavy-handed when I deal with hair and

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.500 
heavy-handed when I deal with hair and
other<00:03:26.849> products<00:03:27.849> I'm<00:03:27.970> very<00:03:28.209> very

heavy-handed<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.699> think<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.299> won't<00:03:31.629> last

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
heavy-handed so I think this won't last

heavy-handed so I think this won't last
and<00:03:32.169> I'm<00:03:32.319> kind<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.620> worried<00:03:33.430> about<00:03:33.549> this

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269
