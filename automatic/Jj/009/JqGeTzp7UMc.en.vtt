00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.410 
ones are versus mr. krill will do one of
those<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.809> everything's<00:00:52.739> lubed<00:00:53.390> what<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
those so everything's lubed what I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.479 
those so everything's lubed what I
typically<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.140> before<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.949> do

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
typically do also before I go and do

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
typically do also before I go and do
this<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> patient<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.530> tell<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.710> get

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this with the patient I tell you get

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.830 
this with the patient I tell you get
them<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> try<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> tray<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.420> them<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> bike

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
them a try in the tray get them the bike

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
them a try in the tray get them the bike
down<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> case<00:01:01.739> i'm<00:01:01.890> using<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.219> triple

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
down in this case i'm using a triple

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.929 
down in this case i'm using a triple
tree<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.439> i<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.710> confirm<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.580> also

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
tree and that way i can confirm and also

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.460 
tree and that way i can confirm and also
what<00:01:06.240> i'll<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.600> i'll<00:01:06.720> probably<00:01:07.080> take<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
what i'll do is i'll probably take a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.240 
what i'll do is i'll probably take a
mark<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.990> sort<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.049> draw<00:01:10.320> some<00:01:10.830> sort<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.070> point

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
mark and sort of draw some sort of point

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
mark and sort of draw some sort of point
whether<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.640> their<00:01:11.790> nose<00:01:12.000> or

whether it be their nose or

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
whether it be their nose or
on<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.910> case<00:01:15.180> we'll<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.710> right<00:01:16.710> here

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it's classic and I'm just going to mix

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's classic and I'm just going to mix
some<00:01:50.370> in<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> powder<00:01:51.660> or<00:01:51.960> liquid<00:01:53.390> as

some in here to a powder or liquid as

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:07.010 
some in here to a powder or liquid as
you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.660> see<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:54.930> backwards

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.290 

this<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.829> found<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> lab<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.819> honor<00:02:09.000> all

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
this is I found in the lab to honor all

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:25.690 
this is I found in the lab to honor all
those<00:02:09.330> before

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.700 

it<00:02:26.000> was<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.330> mix<00:02:26.629> it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:37.790 

I<00:02:29.800> think<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.310> shade<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.910> d5

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:57.080 

so<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.550> little<00:02:38.730> circle<00:02:39.150> at<00:02:39.270> only<00:02:39.540> one

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:21.900 

all<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.599> stuff<00:02:58.019> right<00:02:58.379> into

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.150 

so<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.720> thing<00:03:23.020> with

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.470 

this<00:03:28.160> material<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.000> has<00:03:29.210> a<00:03:29.240> high

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
this material is that it has a high

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.980 
this material is that it has a high
experiment<00:03:32.350> he<00:03:33.350> production

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.500 

let's<00:03:38.620> go

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
let's go

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.179 
let's go
so<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.110> got<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.290> go<00:03:40.379> in<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.709> out<00:03:40.799> in<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.010> out

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
so you got to go in and out in and out

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.740 
so you got to go in and out in and out
in<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.489> out<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.879> patients<00:03:42.330> around<00:03:42.480> so

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
in and out of the patients around so

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.830 
in and out of the patients around so
here<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:42.989> go

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.960 

see<00:03:48.620> according<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.310> those<00:03:49.430> lines

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.670 

good<00:03:52.270> patient<00:03:52.720> lay<00:03:52.840> down<00:03:53.080> make<00:03:53.350> sure<00:03:53.380> it's

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
good patient lay down make sure it's

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.040 
good patient lay down make sure it's
completed
