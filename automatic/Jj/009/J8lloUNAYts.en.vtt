00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Our nutritionist Ana Beltrán is going 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.299
 to tell those secrets to see what 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.910
 way we can get a hair 10 like 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.040
 yours heart forward ana hello good 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.559
 days asín is betting on food 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.199
 when we have a hair problem is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.170
 a safe bet since the hair 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 is a cutaneous structure that is 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.230
 made from a protein that is the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 keratin and this protein needs that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.119
 we want it properly is a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 protein that are continuously re 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 changing and that's why we need the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.870
 nutrition is healthy balanced and rich 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.050
 in mineral vitamins and certain 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 trace elements and the hair is one of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.360
 those of the physical forms that we have in 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.620
 the body that most demonstrates the lack of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 vitamins when it comes back 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.120
 brittle is broken or we start to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.500
 drop hair in these cases what 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.239
 first what to do before 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.280
 start taking a supplementation that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.010
 we do not really know what it takes is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.289
 go to the doctor and see what cause 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.129
 be the one that caused us this fall 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.049
 of hair fundamentally we have to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 see what kind of food that 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.880
 person a person who has a hair 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.710
 brittle and that has a tendency to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.460
 fall has to have a feeding 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.530
 rich in fruits vegetables rich in calcium 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.750
 We can find calcium in a 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.299
 seed that is called sesame and that the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.970
 we have to introduce into our life 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.429
 daily because it has a very absorption 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.990
 very very very favorable for our 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.030
 organism the legumes are 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.399
 very important also for the hair 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.840
 grow in a healthy way and as not 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.729
 see if there is any kind of lack of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.520
 iron the closure is one of the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.549
 main minerals that produce a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.920
 iron deficiency anemia and its main 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.929
 symptom apart from weakness tiredness and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.610
 other hair loss is the 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.179
 supplements with iron can be 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.289
 prescribe without any problem and 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.599
 normally when the cause of the fall 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.610
 of hair is for lack of iron in 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.649
 how much have we taken iron a month or 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.780
 a month and a half normally the hair 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.659
 returns to recover that brightness that does not 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.989
 I had previously remind you that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.630
 whenever we do a medical consultation 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.850
 for a hair 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.950
 also apart from starting to feed 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.110
 better we have to start taking care of it 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.330
 sun fundamentally and drink lots of water 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.420
 since it is a structure that also 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.000
 needs hydration 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.959
 very well thank you very much daughters thanks 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.959
 really good we go
