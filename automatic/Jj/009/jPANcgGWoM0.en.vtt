00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.510
 I'll tell you what to do if the games slow down 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.809
 namely, none is 2 and not 3 all games and 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.210
 so doing everything that I have nothing else but for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.210
 full explanation of the word to the creator 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:44.520
 connectedness and hard to brake and so 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 ways and by the way they are all workers will 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.399
 applications but you do the process like 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.090
 I would start to show here now 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 launched bandicam here now Vladik know 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.219
 right click priority higher 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.420
 average will stand average put 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.609
 above the average 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.860
 but I can not put a cat each 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.070
 programs well that's what was required 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.680
 prove so close no only 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.189
 look when you like 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.170
 change priority do not close 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.680
 play and only when you are finished 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.990
 you can literally close and what I want 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.960
 say on minecraft it doesn't work then 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:31.110
 the same with the date why there is no dota 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.270
 works but the fairy tale doesn't work you don't 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.490
 works as it says to me that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.180
 I can't find my program Nina 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.479
 programs 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:47.009
 so further start and run after you can 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.100
