00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.500
 one of the most constant players of 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.420
 the last weeks of fc groningen 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.129
 Rasmus left a store and had 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.690
 a large enough weekly 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.639
 and that have position where he only since 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.949
 the away match against sc heerenveen 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.880
 February 22 plays as central 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.289
 defender 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.240
 belt has been one of the for a long time 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.679
 two defensive midfielders 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.420
 but as a central defender he appears 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.919
 also to work well 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.230
 and that gives him a lot of positive 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.370
 criticisms well I am also satisfied 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.690
 so far how I played 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.920
 Yes 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.530
 like a nice match to 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000
 play is going well so far 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.770
 now why is the nice position to 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.840
 play well I've always liked it 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.550
 actually I also played as midfield 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.090
 plays in my career 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.800
 I also have quite a few competition days 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.220
 plays and I have always liked it 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.180
 and most also played well 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.100
 to what extent is it different 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.570
 For example, playing in midfield 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.820
 except that you then more backward state 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.269
 well it is different because you have 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.790
 actually whole game full for you one 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.410
 my midfield you have n people for you 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.860
 and people behind you and here you have 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:16.600
 really only people for you and 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.330
 you can give more direction to the team 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.430
 because you look play could well and yes that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.659
 I think the left is positive 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.580
 about his current position 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.350
 that's why we present him a choice 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.670
 central defender 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.670
 or defensive midfielder 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.660
 yes they grow 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:40.010
 oh i got along like defensive 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.870
 midfielder is playing but actually 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.120
 I those times I 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.020
 central existence I always have good 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.510
 played so yes currently playing 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.060
 central and I think I think so 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.190
 very nice because play on this 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.840
 moment then say a central back 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.310
 The left is in the central back next 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.690
 eric botteghin 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 it seems like the two have been around for a long time 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.740
 standing together in the back while still 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.710
 real but recently 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.780
 must say good we have good 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.130
 communication with each other 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:17.660
 I think we are with smart players 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.160
 both and also a lot to coach and that is 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.450
 exactly now 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.670
 left and first the left central 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.570
 defender it can be tricky if you 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.570
 are right-legged 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.400
 yes it is of course better to be right 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.090
 to stand if you are bringing to the right 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.960
 but i think i don't find any problems sometimes 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.060
 sometimes you want to give a crossball 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.160
 I might just not come out with the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.210
 left leg would you if you stand sincerely 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.010
 might do it but maybe further 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.050
 I find the right or left it makes 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.340
 not with my is looking forward later 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.840
 we left and forward to the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.580
 major cup must counter 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.550
 excelsior and we'll explain him a few more 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.930
 choices for a successful sliding or one 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.930
 boss over 50 meters who arrives perfectly 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.930
 Yes 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 with race muslim grant in the back 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.240
 fc groningen left the last two 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.410
 games against psv and fc twente one 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.270
 good impression behind 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.670
 next weekend fc groningen due 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.080
 international not in action is left and 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.530
 happy with the free weekend 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.480
 actually I would like to continue playing and 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.850
 also that that cup west so quickly 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.030
 possible but after being a cruel child 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.440
 also nice but yes we have 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.410
 only had one point in the last one 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.610
 one but the feeling that the good is quite 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.810
 played 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.180
 what still needs to be done so that you 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.810
 can also picks up 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:51.510
 yes we have to be yes effective for yes 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.430
 for the goal and fewer goals 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.290
 to get 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.350
 I think they have almost no chance 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.930
 had a top score against last twente 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.550
 the first goal of FC Twente 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.290
 arose from the defensive action before 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.950
 left in which is not the desired effect 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.160
 had 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.210
 well I'm just trying to block the ball 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.640
 and you get a got in and the ball 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.870
 you are going to miss the sky and he had 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.760
 right out 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.270
 he shook fantastic pins yes 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.800
 bad luck for you at least no I go 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.370
 I want to dress it well I will find that 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.200
 someone who must have it then he does 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.900
 what luck that just got stuck in a tailbone 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.640
 despite the slipper against FC Twente 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.110
 LED linking in the last few weeks is great 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.060
 impression behind at fc groningen 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.570
 as with this purple with its left 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.040
 leg against psv a successful sliding 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.550
 or a boss about 50 meters deep effect 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.550
 arrive 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:53.410
 yes they both are beautiful things I think 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.710
 I always find it in the beginning 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.360
 nice to 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.000
 to possibly win in sleidinge 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.180
 I like that but yes a ball a 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.800
 man of five to look after those very well 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.820
 that beautiful then arrives that she is also beautiful 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.810
 difficult to choose then I still choose from 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.460
 threading 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.350
 left and in shape can FC Groningen 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.700
 excellent use later during the 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.750
 important cup match against 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.800
 excelsior 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.930
 a match at the fc 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.480
 groningen supporters already live up to immensely 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.360
 must do i must say i focus 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.400
 just at the competition but how 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.670
 the closer it gets the more 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:36.620
 are you going to think only now we have 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.510
 an ambasciatori vitesse for that and yes 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.490
 from Monday we are going to follow us 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.060
 and only then comes one 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.760
 cup competition 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.420
 I sometimes have a cup final split 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.060
 no yes in 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.290
 I was only here in Austria 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.930
 I have a semi-final in the Netherlands 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.030
 played and then hit 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:01.140
 Injured then I could not go to 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:04.080
 final we actually is but no so 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.690
 change that dream yes that will be 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.190
 from club like regular ones that have never been 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:14.070
 actually won a real prize 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:17.280
 so we are very close now and 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.260
 and this is a moment 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.450
 to grab that cup off the line 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:26.310
 pick or even corn 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:30.120
 even chorus yes i don't do it that way 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.940
 often a long time ago but yes 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.170
 score is it is the most beautiful with football 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.690
 I think so I always choose from so many 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.010
 I always pick up a few calls 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.849
 season 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.020
 that's the last few years 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.940
 I introduce myself to excelsior 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:52.930
 minute before time are still the same 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.930
 made through win that would be very nice
