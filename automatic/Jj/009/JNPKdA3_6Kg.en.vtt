tip and today what I really wanted to
talk<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.269> was<00:00:15.540> just<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.929> little<00:00:16.080> overview<00:00:16.500> of

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
talk about was just a little overview of

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.859 
talk about was just a little overview of
what<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> best<00:00:18.150> type<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> base

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
what I think is the best type of base

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.189 
what I think is the best type of base
coverage<00:00:19.710> defense<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.430> Madden<00:00:21.180> 13<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.900> what

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
coverage defense in Madden 13 and what

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.660 
coverage defense in Madden 13 and what
I'm<00:00:22.289> talking<00:00:22.560> about<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.949> defense<00:00:23.550> that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
I'm talking about is a defense that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.759 
I'm talking about is a defense that
you're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> use<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.570> pretty<00:00:25.050> much<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you're going to use on pretty much you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.410 
you're going to use on pretty much you
know<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:26.160> second<00:00:26.609> third<00:00:26.640> down<00:00:27.060> i'm<00:00:27.300> not

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
know first second third down i'm not

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.240 
know first second third down i'm not
talking<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:28.080> prevent<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.859> course

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
talking about like prevent of course

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.769 
talking about like prevent of course
prevent<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.849> always<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.240> use<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.599> when

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
prevent you always want to use that when

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.510 
prevent you always want to use that when
you<00:00:30.869> need<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.019> prevent<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:32.130> know<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> Hail<00:00:32.489> Mary

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you need to prevent you know a Hail Mary

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450 
you need to prevent you know a Hail Mary
or<00:00:32.910> something<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.710> now<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.280> me

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
or something like that now don't get me

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
or something like that now don't get me
wrong<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:36.270> every<00:00:36.899> defense<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.620> its

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
wrong I think every defense has its

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
wrong I think every defense has its
purpose<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.610> far<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.180> there

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
purpose as far as you know you there

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
purpose as far as you know you there
might<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:39.960> time<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.379> cover<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
might be a good time to use a cover to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.490 
might be a good time to use a cover to
or<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> cover<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.390> someone's<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
or a cover for if someone's just you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.959 
or a cover for if someone's just you
know<00:00:43.590> throwing<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.190> certain<00:00:44.489> kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.730> route

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
know throwing a certain kind of route

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.720 
know throwing a certain kind of route
but<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> best<00:00:47.070> base<00:00:47.399> type

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but what I think is the best base type

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600 
but what I think is the best base type
of<00:00:47.879> coverage<00:00:48.180> defenses<00:00:48.660> cover<00:00:48.899> three<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.610> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of coverage defenses cover three and the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
of coverage defenses cover three and the
reason<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
reason I think that is because a lot of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.430 
reason I think that is because a lot of
the<00:00:52.410> routes<00:00:52.879> this<00:00:53.879> year<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.420> usually<00:00:54.930> towards

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the routes this year are usually towards

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.830 
the routes this year are usually towards
you<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.190> outsides<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.059> there's<00:00:57.690> some

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you know the outsides and there's some

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.650 
you know the outsides and there's some
short<00:00:58.109> stuff<00:00:58.379> across<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.949> middle<00:00:59.309> but<00:01:00.180> this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
short stuff across the middle but this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.049 
short stuff across the middle but this
one<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.469> adjustable<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.309> example<00:01:02.850> we

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
one is just so adjustable for example we

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
one is just so adjustable for example we
get<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.480> outside<00:01:04.229> yellow<00:01:04.530> zones<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.040> put

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
get these outside yellow zones and put

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.429 
get these outside yellow zones and put
them<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.489> purples<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> outsides<00:01:07.290> are

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
them in purples and now the outsides are

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
them in purples and now the outsides are
completely<00:01:07.860> locked<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.760> yeah<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> middle

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
completely locked up now yeah the middle

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
completely locked up now yeah the middle
is<00:01:09.450> open<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.380> least<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> could

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
is open but at least you know you could

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
is open but at least you know you could
control<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.909> guy<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.689> could<00:01:12.930> control

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
control this guy or you could control

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.580 
control this guy or you could control
this<00:01:13.470> guy<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.010> try<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.930> pick<00:01:15.930> stuff<00:01:16.170> off<00:01:16.380> over

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this guy and try to pick stuff off over

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.870 
this guy and try to pick stuff off over
the<00:01:16.710> middle<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> kind<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the middle and that's the kind of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.190 
the middle and that's the kind of
defense<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> play<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> play

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
defense I like to play I like to play

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.510 
defense I like to play I like to play
the<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.619> Defense<00:01:19.920> where<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the kind of Defense where you have to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
the kind of Defense where you have to
throw<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.970> am<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> yeah<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> might<00:01:22.290> miss

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
throw where I am and yeah I might miss

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.700 
throw where I am and yeah I might miss
it<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> whole<00:01:22.860> bunch<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.159> times<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.659> um<00:01:24.710> that's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it a whole bunch of times but um that's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410 
it a whole bunch of times but um that's
what<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.210> hope

what I want you to do I want you to hope

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.810 
what I want you to do I want you to hope
that<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.960> make<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> mistake<00:01:28.560> over<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> over

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that I make a mistake over and over

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
that I make a mistake over and over
again<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.479> order<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.990> down<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> field<00:01:31.409> not

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
again in order to get down the field not

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
again in order to get down the field not
just<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.280> picking<00:01:32.640> apart<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.290> artificial

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
just you picking apart the artificial

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
just you picking apart the artificial
intelligence<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> outside<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.570> we

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
intelligence on the outside and so if we

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
intelligence on the outside and so if we
just<00:01:36.869> look<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> regular<00:01:37.439> base<00:01:37.920> cover

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
just look at the regular base cover

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.760 
just look at the regular base cover
three<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.750> let's<00:01:39.960> say<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.140> put<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.409> we

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
three and then let's say we put up we

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.469 
three and then let's say we put up we
see<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> formation<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.000> offense

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
see a formation like that one on offense

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300 
see a formation like that one on offense
and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.290> put<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> purple<00:01:43.829> zone<00:01:43.950> over<00:01:44.070> here

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and then we put a purple zone over here

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
and then we put a purple zone over here
now<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.240> side<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> two<00:01:45.960> wide

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
now this side with the two wide

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.139 
now this side with the two wide
receivers<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.619> completely<00:01:47.009> locked<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
receivers is completely locked up on the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.609 
receivers is completely locked up on the
left<00:01:48.360> side<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> flat

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
left side we're going to have a flat

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289 
left side we're going to have a flat
zone<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.549> double<00:01:50.850> flat<00:01:51.030> zones

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
zone and so we have double flat zones

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.490 
zone and so we have double flat zones
for<00:01:51.450> both<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> running<00:01:52.049> backs<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.470> we

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
for both of the running backs so we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.899 
for both of the running backs so we
pretty<00:01:52.740> much<00:01:52.860> could<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.340> guard<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> middle

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
pretty much could just guard the middle

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.219 
pretty much could just guard the middle
we<00:01:54.000> even<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.270> an<00:01:54.329> extra<00:01:54.600> yellow<00:01:54.780> zone<00:01:55.020> across

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
we even have an extra yellow zone across

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.160 
we even have an extra yellow zone across
the<00:01:55.470> middle<00:01:55.710> which<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.610> use<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.420> overall<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the middle which we can use so overall I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.660 
the middle which we can use so overall I
think<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> best<00:01:58.950> type<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.250> coverage

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
think this is the best type of coverage

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
think this is the best type of coverage
defense<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.750> could<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.170> some<00:02:01.350> blitzes

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
defense if you could get some blitzes

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.200 
defense if you could get some blitzes
out<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.280> where<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.579> still<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:02.969> enough

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
out of here where you still have enough

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
out of here where you still have enough
players<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:03.930> maybe<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> couple

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
players to do maybe you know a couple

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.639 
players to do maybe you know a couple
yellow<00:02:05.880> zones<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.479> mean<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> couple

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
yellow zones I mean of like a couple

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.800 
yellow zones I mean of like a couple
flat<00:02:07.920> zones<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.459> alternate<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> couple

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
flat zones or alternate with a couple

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.790 
flat zones or alternate with a couple
purple<00:02:10.170> zones<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> net

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
purple zones in the net

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.950 
purple zones in the net
least<00:02:10.920> look<00:02:11.250> over<00:02:11.520> across<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.970> middle<00:02:12.240> then

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
least look over across the middle then

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.410 
least look over across the middle then
that<00:02:13.230> would<00:02:13.350> be<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.530> great<00:02:13.920> blitzing<00:02:14.430> option<00:02:14.790> so

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
that would be a great blitzing option so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.300 
that would be a great blitzing option so
