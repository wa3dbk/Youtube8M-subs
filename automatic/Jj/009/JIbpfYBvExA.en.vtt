I'm<00:00:08.160> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.429> use<00:00:10.429> l1<00:00:12.740> and<00:00:14.299> I<00:00:15.680> just<00:00:16.680> kind<00:00:16.920> of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
I'm going to use l1 and I just kind of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.480 
I'm going to use l1 and I just kind of
imagine<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.600> area<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.500> would<00:00:20.460> be

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
imagine that the this area here would be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.920 
imagine that the this area here would be
darker<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.359> as<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.680> move<00:00:23.359> further<00:00:24.359> away<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
darker and as you move further away it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
darker and as you move further away it
would<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.289> lighter<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> yo<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.279> then

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
would be lighter so yo one and then

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.180 
would be lighter so yo one and then
we'll<00:00:29.670> make<00:00:29.939> coloring<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.539> partially<00:00:34.010> same<00:00:35.010> on
