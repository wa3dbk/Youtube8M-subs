00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of course the headset has a battery

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
of course the headset has a battery
built-in<00:02:04.080> now<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.320> battery<00:02:04.740> goes<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.430> you

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
built-in now the battery goes to you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.680 
built-in now the battery goes to you
into<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> side<00:02:06.090> since<00:02:06.270> there's<00:02:06.480> two

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you will do so right now it's set to

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.290 
you will do so right now it's set to
volume<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.070> what<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.460> also<00:02:35.550> do<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.910> they

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
volume but what you can also do is they

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
inside so you could hm a change all that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.310 
inside so you could hm a change all that
with<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:44.910> I'm<00:02:45.330> twist<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.870> example<00:02:46.170> here

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
with just one I'm twist for example here

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.050 
with just one I'm twist for example here
the<00:02:46.410> equalizer<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.130> see<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.490> can<00:02:47.670> change
