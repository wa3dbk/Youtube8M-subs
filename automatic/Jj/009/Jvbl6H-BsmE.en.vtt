00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.910
 This will be this summer in broad daylight why time will start every week 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.349
 visit a sport this week 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.109
 to lure 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.789
 that place is what it is about getting the hang of the open day and that there is work 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.739
 of 8 chairman 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.779
 both boys are football training afterwards that demands 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.449
 end up wondering if we will of course raffle off but it is one to 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.640
 a ticket duel is a place where I don't believe her yes that's right 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.240
 may still participate 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.289
 Yes of course 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.590
 but I leave the first time complete 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.360
 what is the wind what must it show and sports shorts and a spot it 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.540
 is on price 4 anyway 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.180
 let me say that few arena goes out for a few years but then would 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.990
 losses suffered from it 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.270
 we put there try 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 try to look into the card to see if it will work 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.310
 I don't think I am four, but I find it very light with him 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.680
 the sahara i need you too 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.250
 I understand I saw m 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.910
 he is seen 7 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.540
 2 I thought maybe you just didn't see it 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.090
 but what are you then know that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 basic techniques of hockey what I really first what you learn that comes 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.289
 but anyway why is this not sticking 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.920
 show how you do that 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.300
 but the Serbian hand is going on 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.609
 we win 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.850
 the votes just got on the Netherlands 2 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.750
 the other not against it 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.890
 the training is also meant for ball control 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 That is why this is a good fit for me 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.490
 Steve Darcis atp 4 percent 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.360
 8 chairman of the very many people, that is true 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.660
 not at all 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.740
 Even an attack became known as politicians 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.720
 had 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.550
 it is if you are really a sport in which good condition of big house but every 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.710
 nice and spicy it is one for a very strong one good 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.840
 condition to keep cup and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.769
 it is a sport with a lot of promises 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:09.859
 and 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.219
 People say it's a sport that's the center 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.700
 will be that we must have 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.090
 but to master the traffic situation because of precipitation 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.310
 it could of course not be understandable every day to create an artistic expression 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.239
 continue to breathe so nice of course 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.249
 van der valk is a weather alarm for us 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.150
 from left to right points 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.229
 become d66 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.229
 we are running this top, absolutely 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.119
 You can panic about this completely 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.459
 Yes 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:50.600
 the agenda 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.790
 33 years the participant in the ankle 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.479
 but it is no different 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.069
 since then it has been quiet 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.119
 very nice 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:02.689
 Yes 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:03.939
 nac breda 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.939
 what does it mean to those parties that have a cup? 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.390
 it is not very hot really experienced excellent starting points 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.369
 I still have to work 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.769
 I can still handle a higher ceiling 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:22.880
 they wave 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.880
 a few months 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.369
 i'm a bit but i hope of course you take care of it 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.530
