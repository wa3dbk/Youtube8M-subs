00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
and I like this a lot I was using this

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.410 
and I like this a lot I was using this
for<00:01:17.560> four<00:01:17.830> years<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.549> it<00:01:18.880> doesn't<00:01:19.120> really

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
for four years and it doesn't really

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.219 
for four years and it doesn't really
showed<00:01:19.720> too<00:01:20.680> many<00:01:20.920> signs<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.549> wear<00:01:22.360> it's<00:01:22.780> in

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
showed too many signs of wear it's in

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.240 
showed too many signs of wear it's in
quite<00:01:24.040> good<00:01:24.100> shape<00:01:24.390> however<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.799> turn<00:01:27.070> it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
quite good shape however if you turn it

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.550 
quite good shape however if you turn it
and<00:01:27.400> its<00:01:27.909> other<00:01:28.150> side<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.930> can<00:01:29.200> see<00:01:29.760> that<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
and its other side you can see that it's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.580 
and its other side you can see that it's
full<00:01:33.130> with<00:01:33.479> small<00:01:34.479> dots

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
full with small dots

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.070 
full with small dots
it<00:01:35.830> looks<00:01:36.100> like<00:01:36.280> rust<00:01:36.729> spots<00:01:37.299> right<00:01:37.750> there

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
it looks like rust spots right there

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.410 
it looks like rust spots right there
however<00:01:38.860> it's<00:01:39.369> not<00:01:39.610> really<00:01:39.670> rust

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
however it's not really rust

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.200 
however it's not really rust
it's<00:01:40.710> basically<00:01:41.710> its<00:01:42.460> original<00:01:43.000> surface

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
it's basically its original surface

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
it's basically its original surface
coming<00:01:43.630> off<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.619> can<00:01:44.799> see<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.490> brass

coming off and you can see the brass
material<00:01:47.740> right<00:01:47.979> there<00:01:48.010> so<00:01:48.939> if<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:50.049> look<00:01:50.979> at

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
material right there so if you look at

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.000 
material right there so if you look at
its<00:01:51.790> black<00:01:52.119> plate<00:01:52.479> careful<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.439> can<00:01:53.590> see<00:01:53.770> that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
still cases back which means that it's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.180 
still cases back which means that it's
not<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:11.940> rugged<00:02:12.240> actually<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.709> if<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.069> can

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.350 
have been using it for more than a year
and<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:33.090> basically<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:35.270> almost<00:02:36.270> perfect

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
and it's basically in almost perfect

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.870 
and it's basically in almost perfect
condition<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:37.140> doesn't<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.790> scratch<00:02:38.790> on

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
condition it doesn't have a scratch on

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.270 
condition it doesn't have a scratch on
it's<00:02:39.030> mineral<00:02:39.360> crystal<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.050> I've<00:02:40.830> dropped

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
it's mineral crystal and I've dropped

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.650 
it's mineral crystal and I've dropped
the<00:02:41.430> December<00:02:41.790> several<00:02:42.209> times<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.600> it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
the December several times and it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.580 
the December several times and it
survived<00:02:43.050> everything<00:02:44.720> let's<00:02:45.720> talk<00:02:46.019> about<00:02:46.170> its

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
survived everything let's talk about its

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.790 
survived everything let's talk about its
build<00:02:47.280> quality<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.930> some<00:02:49.170> features<00:02:49.560> okay

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
build quality and and some features okay

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.650 
build quality and and some features okay
so<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.310> full<00:02:50.519> stainless<00:02:50.940> steel<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.480> has<00:02:51.510> a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
so it's full stainless steel it has a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.960 
so it's full stainless steel it has a
mineral<00:02:52.050> crystal<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.340> made<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.700> shatter

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
mineral crystal it is made to be shatter

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.600 
mineral crystal it is made to be shatter
resistant<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.110> can<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.069> has<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
resistant you can see that it has a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.900 
resistant you can see that it has a
rubber<00:02:57.420> ring<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:58.500> black<00:02:58.800> thing<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.459> made<00:02:59.760> out

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
rubber ring this black thing is made out

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.229 
rubber ring this black thing is made out
of<00:02:59.940> rubber<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:01.110> material<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.180> not

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
of rubber like material but it's not

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.690 
of rubber like material but it's not
really<00:03:03.569> rubber<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:04.530> more<00:03:05.010> like<00:03:05.160> material

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
really rubber it's more like material

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.059 
really rubber it's more like material
which<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.269> used<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.660> geesh<00:03:06.930> acts<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.709> if<00:03:07.980> you

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
which is used in geesh acts so if you

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.370 
which is used in geesh acts so if you
drop<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.340> down<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:09.060> going<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.540> absorb<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
drop it down it's going to absorb the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.030 
drop it down it's going to absorb the
shocks<00:03:11.209> which<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:13.110> very<00:03:13.410> good<00:03:13.500> thing<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.920> my

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
shocks which is very good thing in my

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.729 
shocks which is very good thing in my
opinion<00:03:14.420> we've<00:03:15.420> got<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.780> several<00:03:16.079> times<00:03:16.350> and

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
opinion we've got it several times and

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.840 
opinion we've got it several times and
it's<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:17.130> rugged<00:03:17.430> shape<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.280> they

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
it's in rugged shape it is a they

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.990 
it's in rugged shape it is a they
display<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:22.620> has<00:03:23.630> military<00:03:24.630> time<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.670> has<00:03:26.880> an

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
display it has military time it has an

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.690 
display it has military time it has an
indigo<00:03:27.329> nightlight<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.700> it's

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
indigo nightlight and it's

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.130 
indigo nightlight and it's
water-resistant<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:31.110> 100<00:03:31.860> meters<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:34.019> a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
water-resistant to 100 meters so it's a
