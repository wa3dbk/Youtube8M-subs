as<00:02:02.259> I<00:02:02.409> think<00:02:02.740> such<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> great<00:02:03.700> complement<00:02:04.270> to

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
as I think such a great complement to

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.599 
as I think such a great complement to
this<00:02:04.509> shape<00:02:04.810> did<00:02:05.469> they<00:02:05.590> continental<00:02:06.490> do

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
this shape did they continental do

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.190 
this shape did they continental do
anything<00:02:06.880> particular<00:02:07.179> to<00:02:07.659> get<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:07.929> kind<00:02:08.140> of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
anything particular to get this kind of

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.749 
anything particular to get this kind of
a<00:02:08.259> luster<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.860> paint<00:02:09.070> they<00:02:09.280> did<00:02:09.460> it<00:02:09.610> was<00:02:09.729> a

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
a luster in the paint they did it was a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.520 
a luster in the paint they did it was a
very<00:02:09.850> intricate<00:02:10.360> paint<00:02:10.660> process<00:02:11.230> they<00:02:11.410> would

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
very intricate paint process they would

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.990 
very intricate paint process they would
mock<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.010> panels<00:02:12.580> up

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
mock the panels up

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.760 
mock the panels up
they<00:02:13.270> were<00:02:13.330> prime<00:02:13.810> they<00:02:14.050> were<00:02:14.110> sealed<00:02:14.530> they

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
they were prime they were sealed they

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.710 
they were prime they were sealed they
were<00:02:14.830> painted<00:02:15.340> then<00:02:15.490> they<00:02:15.580> were<00:02:15.640> wet<00:02:16.209> sanded

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720

they were painted again
baked<00:02:18.670> wet<00:02:19.120> sand<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.600> this<00:02:20.080> process<00:02:20.350> was

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
baked wet sand and this process was

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.290 
baked wet sand and this process was
repeated<00:02:20.830> until<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.490> wind<00:02:21.670> up<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> finish

process and blocked the panels so that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.630 
process and blocked the panels so that
you<00:02:38.140> wind<00:02:38.319> up<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.650> an<00:02:38.770> extremely<00:02:39.310> arrow

straight body highlighted by very
lustrous<00:02:42.250> rich<00:02:42.700> paint<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.750> was<00:02:44.230> trying<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
lustrous rich paint and I was trying to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.220 
lustrous rich paint and I was trying to
figure<00:02:44.950> out<00:02:45.100> why<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.459> looks<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.330> straight<00:02:47.200> I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
figure out why it looks so straight I

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.900 
figure out why it looks so straight I
mean<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.620> one<00:02:47.920> long<00:02:48.190> continuous<00:02:48.730> body

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
mean it's like one long continuous body

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.390 
mean it's like one long continuous body
panel<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.020> think<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.440> because<00:02:50.950> they<00:02:51.130> got

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
panel and I think it's because they got

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.160 
panel and I think it's because they got
rid<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.640> gaps<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.390> car<00:02:52.600> like<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.840> don't<00:02:52.989> see

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
rid of gaps in the car like I don't see

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.590 
rid of gaps in the car like I don't see
a<00:02:53.200> fuel<00:02:53.830> filler<00:02:54.100> door<00:02:54.190> no<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.940> gaps<00:02:55.180> are<00:02:55.390> very

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
a fuel filler door no the gaps are very

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.910 
a fuel filler door no the gaps are very
tight<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:55.870> they<00:02:56.050> did<00:02:56.230> subtle<00:02:56.560> things<00:02:56.800> like

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
tight and they did subtle things like

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.100 
tight and they did subtle things like
hiding<00:02:57.489> where<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.060> filled<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.450> fuel<00:02:58.690> they

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
hiding where you filled the fuel they

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.810 
hiding where you filled the fuel they
hid<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.440> behind<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.980> rear<00:03:00.160> taillight<00:03:00.459> which

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
hid it behind the rear taillight which

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.850 
hid it behind the rear taillight which
swings<00:03:01.090> away<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> hand<00:03:01.810> really<00:03:02.350> access<00:03:02.739> to

the food that also explains probably why

shock absorbers that were sensitive to

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.650 
shock absorbers that were sensitive to
temperature<00:05:17.949> so<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.729> ride<00:05:18.910> was<00:05:19.150> maintained

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
temperature so the ride was maintained

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.060 
temperature so the ride was maintained
in<00:05:19.900> all<00:05:20.080> conditions<00:05:20.320> sensitive<00:05:20.979> to

in all conditions sensitive to
temperature<00:05:21.580> to<00:05:22.090> give<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.389> smooth<00:05:22.599> ride
