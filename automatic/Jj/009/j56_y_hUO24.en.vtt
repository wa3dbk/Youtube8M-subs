waterproof pipes on the last one we took

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.020 
waterproof pipes on the last one we took
a<00:00:10.860> look<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> item<00:00:11.940> transport<00:00:12.420> pipes<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:14.030> in

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
a look at the item transport pipes so in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.950 
a look at the item transport pipes so in
the<00:00:15.299> waterproof<00:00:15.929> pipes<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.800> wooden

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
the waterproof pipes they are wooden

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.439 
the waterproof pipes they are wooden
cobblestone<00:00:18.960> waterproof<00:00:19.740> pipe<00:00:19.980> stone<00:00:20.820> iron

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
cobblestone waterproof pipe stone iron

cobblestone waterproof pipe stone iron
gold<00:00:22.140> emerald<00:00:22.980> sandstone<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.150> void<00:00:25.760> let's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
gold emerald sandstone and void let's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.700 
gold emerald sandstone and void let's
first<00:00:27.090> take<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> look<00:00:27.510> at<00:00:27.660> how<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.199> craft

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
first take a look at how you can craft

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.630 
first take a look at how you can craft
this<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:31.529> gravity's<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.160> need<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this so to do gravity's you need a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.470 
this so to do gravity's you need a
cactus<00:00:33.270> cactus<00:00:33.630> screen<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.940> course<00:00:36.360> you

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
cactus cactus screen and of course you

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.889 
cactus cactus screen and of course you
can<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.500> buy<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.120> smelting<00:00:39.120> cactus

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
can get this to buy a smelting cactus

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.299 
can get this to buy a smelting cactus
and<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:41.480> graph<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.750> into<00:00:43.559> pipe<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and you graph these into pipe for the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.950 
and you graph these into pipe for the
waterproofs<00:00:45.530> like<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:48.690> take<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
waterproofs like that and you take a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.330 
waterproofs like that and you take a
normal<00:00:49.530> transport<00:00:50.010> pipe<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.879> add<00:00:51.030> one

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
normal transport pipe and you add one

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.090 
normal transport pipe and you add one
pipe<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> proof<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.570> one

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
pipe or the proof and you get one

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
pipe or the proof and you get one
waterproof<00:00:56.100> pipe<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.420> same<00:00:57.809> for

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
waterproof pipe and this is same for

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:10.120 
waterproof pipe and this is same for
every<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.649> this<00:01:00.859> iron<00:01:04.729> gold<00:01:08.119> emerald

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
every one of this iron gold emerald

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
every one of this iron gold emerald
sandstone<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.119> void<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:15.170> what<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.710> does<00:01:17.150> or

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
sandstone and void and what this does or

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.870 
sandstone and void and what this does or
do<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.729> same<00:01:20.970> thing<00:01:21.330> oh<00:01:22.070> how<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.310> work<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
do is the same thing oh how this work is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
do is the same thing oh how this work is
is<00:01:24.150> same<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.009> ones<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.720> item<00:01:28.080> transport

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
is same as the ones the item transport

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.249 
is same as the ones the item transport
ones<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.240> through<00:01:30.479> them

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
ones so I'm not going to go through them

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.770 
ones so I'm not going to go through them
as<00:01:32.210> extinct<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.500> as<00:01:35.329> detailed<00:01:37.220> but<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
as extinct in as detailed but so you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.940 
as extinct in as detailed but so you
need<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.680> use<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> water<00:01:41.579> water<00:01:42.950> wooden

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
need you use the water water wooden

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.480 
need you use the water water wooden
waterproof<00:01:44.579> pipe<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.420> draw<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.079> items<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
waterproof pipe to draw out items from a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
waterproof pipe to draw out items from a
machine<00:01:48.619> that<00:01:50.119> delivers<00:01:51.119> water<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.290> water

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
machine that delivers water or has water

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.420 
machine that delivers water or has water
so<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.220> example<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.790> good<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:55.430> old

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
so one example of good be a a old

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.850 
so one example of good be a a old
refinery<00:01:57.259> where<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:59.000> turn<00:02:00.000> oil<00:02:00.360> into<00:02:00.869> fuel

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
refinery where you turn oil into fuel

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.510 
refinery where you turn oil into fuel
and<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.810> pipe<00:02:04.020> these<00:02:05.420> power<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:07.520> deliver

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
and you can pipe these power or deliver

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.710 
and you can pipe these power or deliver
these<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:10.039> liquid<00:02:11.039> using<00:02:11.879> these<00:02:12.180> into

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
these the liquid using these into

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.650 
these the liquid using these into
another<00:02:12.989> machine

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
another machine

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.460 
another machine
for<00:02:14.110> example<00:02:14.470> an<00:02:14.590> engine<00:02:16.140> every<00:02:17.140> single<00:02:17.320> one

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
for example an engine every single one

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.490 
for example an engine every single one
of<00:02:17.620> these<00:02:17.860> works<00:02:18.250> similar<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> ones<00:02:20.170> that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
of these works similar to the ones that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.740 
of these works similar to the ones that
doesn't<00:02:21.490> go<00:02:22.770> transport<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.830> items<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> I'm

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
doesn't go transport the items so I'm

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.050 
doesn't go transport the items so I'm
not<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.170> go<00:02:26.410> through<00:02:26.680> them<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:29.230> detailed

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
not going to go through them as detailed

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.840 
not going to go through them as detailed
now<00:02:31.060> you're<00:02:31.240> going<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.450> watch<00:02:31.540> watch<00:02:32.050> the

cobblestone<00:03:03.010> waterproof<00:03:03.760> pipe<00:03:04.030> stone<00:03:04.870> iron

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
cobblestone waterproof pipe stone iron

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.800 
cobblestone waterproof pipe stone iron
gold<00:03:06.190> emerald<00:03:07.030> sandstone<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.200> void<00:03:09.810> let's

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
gold emerald sandstone and void let's

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.720 
gold emerald sandstone and void let's
first<00:03:11.140> take<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.350> look<00:03:11.440> at<00:03:11.680> how<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.100> can<00:03:12.220> craft

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
first take a look at how you can craft

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.710 
first take a look at how you can craft
this<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:15.550> graph<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.210> need<00:03:16.360> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
this so to to graph this you need a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.490 
this so to to graph this you need a
cactus<00:03:17.290> cactus<00:03:17.680> screen<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.990> of<00:03:19.990> course<00:03:20.380> you

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
cactus cactus screen and of course you

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.910 
cactus cactus screen and of course you
can<00:03:20.650> get<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.520> buy<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:22.170> smelting<00:03:23.170> cactus

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
can get this to buy a smelting cactus

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.350 
can get this to buy a smelting cactus
and<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:25.530> graph<00:03:26.530> these<00:03:26.800> into<00:03:27.580> pipe<00:03:28.030> for<00:03:28.330> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
and you graph these into pipe for the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.970 
and you graph these into pipe for the
waterproofs<00:03:29.580> like<00:03:30.580> that<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:32.709> take<00:03:32.950> a

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
waterproofs like that and you take a

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.350 
waterproofs like that and you take a
normal<00:03:33.550> transport<00:03:34.060> pipe<00:03:34.270> and<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.900> add<00:03:35.080> one

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
normal transport pipe and you add one

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.110 
normal transport pipe and you add one
pipe<00:03:37.360> waterproof<00:03:37.990> and<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.440> get<00:03:38.620> one

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
pipe waterproof and you get one

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.880 
pipe waterproof and you get one
waterproof<00:03:40.120> pipe<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.440> same<00:03:41.860> for

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
waterproof pipe and this is same for

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:54.140 
waterproof pipe and this is same for
every<00:03:42.370> one<00:03:42.520> of<00:03:42.700> these<00:03:44.910> iron<00:03:48.780> gold<00:03:52.170> emerald

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
every one of these iron gold emerald

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:03.460 
every one of these iron gold emerald
sandstone<00:03:55.970> void<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:59.209> what<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.750> does<00:04:01.040> or<00:04:02.040> do

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
sandstone void and what this does or do

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.179 
sandstone void and what this does or do
is<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.769> same<00:04:05.010> thing<00:04:05.040> oh<00:04:06.079> how<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.349> work<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.890> is

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
is the same thing oh how this work is is

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.830 
is the same thing oh how this work is is
same<00:04:08.519> as<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:10.019> ones<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.760> item<00:04:12.120> transport<00:04:12.629> ones

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
same as the ones the item transport ones

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.120 
same as the ones the item transport ones
so<00:04:13.260> I'm<00:04:13.439> not<00:04:13.500> going<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.980> go<00:04:14.280> through<00:04:14.519> them<00:04:15.299> as

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
so I'm not going to go through them as

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.810 
so I'm not going to go through them as
extinct<00:04:17.130> then<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.820> guess<00:04:19.340> detailed<00:04:21.229> but<00:04:22.759> so<00:04:23.759> you

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
extinct then I guess detailed but so you

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.980 
extinct then I guess detailed but so you
need<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.720> use<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.470> water<00:04:25.620> water<00:04:26.990> wooden

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
need you use the water water wooden

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.490 
need you use the water water wooden
waterproof<00:04:28.620> pipe<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.430> draw<00:04:30.090> out<00:04:30.120> items<00:04:30.750> from<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
waterproof pipe to draw out items from a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.650 
waterproof pipe to draw out items from a
machine<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:34.160> delivers<00:04:35.160> water<00:04:35.699> or<00:04:36.060> has<00:04:36.330> water

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
machine that delivers water or has water

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.290 
machine that delivers water or has water
so<00:04:36.960> one<00:04:37.229> example<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.830> good<00:04:38.070> ba<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:39.440> old<00:04:40.440> refinery

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
so one example of good ba a old refinery

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.839 
so one example of good ba a old refinery
where<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:43.010> turn<00:04:44.010> oil<00:04:44.400> into<00:04:44.910> fuel<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.699> you<00:04:47.699> can

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
where you turn oil into fuel and you can

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:54.070 
where you turn oil into fuel and you can
pipe<00:04:48.060> these<00:04:49.400> ha<00:04:50.400> or<00:04:51.560> deliver<00:04:52.560> these<00:04:53.130> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
pipe these ha or deliver these the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.260 
pipe these ha or deliver these the
liquid<00:04:55.080> using<00:04:55.919> these<00:04:56.190> into<00:04:56.759> another<00:04:57.030> machine

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
liquid using these into another machine

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.610 
liquid using these into another machine
for<00:04:58.139> example<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.590> name<00:04:58.770> gene<00:05:00.169> every<00:05:01.169> single<00:05:01.470> one

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
for example a name gene every single one

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.520 
for example a name gene every single one
of<00:05:01.650> these<00:05:01.889> works<00:05:02.280> similar<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.360> ones<00:05:04.229> that

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
of these works similar to the ones that

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.770 
of these works similar to the ones that
doesn't<00:05:05.520> auto<00:05:06.650> transport<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.860> items<00:05:08.659> so<00:05:09.659> I'm

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
doesn't auto transport the items so I'm

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.080 
doesn't auto transport the items so I'm
not<00:05:09.900> going<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.199> go<00:05:10.440> through<00:05:10.740> them<00:05:12.560> ascii<00:05:13.560> dent

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
not going to go through them ascii dent

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.870 
not going to go through them ascii dent
now<00:05:15.090> you're<00:05:15.270> going<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.479> watch<00:05:15.570> watch<00:05:16.080> the

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
now you're going to watch watch the

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.810 
now you're going to watch watch the
previous<00:05:17.880> video<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.630> find<00:05:18.900> out<00:05:19.080> what<00:05:19.320> each<00:05:20.310> one

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
previous video to find out what each one

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.180 
previous video to find out what each one
of<00:05:20.849> these<00:05:21.650> does<00:05:23.570> ok<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:24.630> let's<00:05:25.289> next<00:05:25.710> take<00:05:26.159> a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
of these does ok so let's next take a

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.260 
of these does ok so let's next take a
look<00:05:26.310> at<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.639> conductive<00:05:27.180> pipes<00:05:27.889> we<00:05:28.889> lose<00:05:29.270> one

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
look at the conductive pipes we lose one

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.899 
look at the conductive pipes we lose one
percent<00:05:30.840> of<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.530> energy<00:05:32.419> each<00:05:33.500> block<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:35.220> will

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
percent of the energy each block it will

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:44.330 
percent of the energy each block it will
travel<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:38.220> gold<00:05:38.490> one<00:05:39.139> will<00:05:40.139> lose<00:05:40.620> only<00:05:43.340> 0.01

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
travel the gold one will lose only 0.01

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.680 
travel the gold one will lose only 0.01
percent<00:05:45.889> of<00:05:46.889> the<00:05:47.190> distance<00:05:47.639> of<00:05:48.080> each<00:05:49.080> block<00:05:49.800> it

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
percent of the distance of each block it

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.290 
percent of the distance of each block it
travels<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:54.800> golden<00:05:55.800> one<00:05:55.949> is<00:05:56.220> much<00:05:57.030> better

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
travels so the golden one is much better

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.399 
travels so the golden one is much better
but<00:05:57.570> but<00:05:58.409> also<00:05:58.889> its<00:05:59.280> bit<00:06:00.240> expect<00:06:01.229> more

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
but but also its bit expect more

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.600 
but but also its bit expect more
expensive<00:06:02.010> than<00:06:02.159> the<00:06:02.219> stone<00:06:02.520> one

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
expensive than the stone one

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.200 
expensive than the stone one
and<00:06:05.550> another<00:06:06.550> reason<00:06:08.610> what<00:06:09.610> was<00:06:09.759> I<00:06:09.909> going<00:06:10.120> to

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
and another reason what was I going to

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.570 
and another reason what was I going to
say<00:06:12.090> yeah<00:06:13.090> that<00:06:13.930> was<00:06:14.110> that<00:06:14.500> was<00:06:14.650> a<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:15.250> golden

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
say yeah that was that was a the golden

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.300 
say yeah that was that was a the golden
conductive<00:06:16.180> pipes<00:06:16.530> this<00:06:17.530> non<00:06:17.740> conductive

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
conductive pipes this non conductive

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.309 
conductive pipes this non conductive
pipe<00:06:18.550> doesn't<00:06:18.939> have<00:06:19.090> an<00:06:19.210> energy<00:06:19.479> limit<00:06:19.900> but

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
pipe doesn't have an energy limit but

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.360 
pipe doesn't have an energy limit but
the<00:06:20.530> golden<00:06:20.889> one<00:06:21.039> does<00:06:21.340> so<00:06:21.939> it's<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.419> thousand

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
the golden one does so it's a thousand

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.779 
the golden one does so it's a thousand
mega<00:06:24.370> joules<00:06:24.840> but<00:06:25.840> it's<00:06:26.259> really<00:06:26.590> hard<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:27.099> get

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
mega joules but it's really hard to get

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.939 
mega joules but it's really hard to get
and<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:29.110> only<00:06:29.289> happens<00:06:29.770> if<00:06:30.069> there's<00:06:30.340> a<00:06:30.430> loop<00:06:30.819> in

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
and it only happens if there's a loop in

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.670 
and it only happens if there's a loop in
your<00:06:32.949> system<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:33.699> something<00:06:34.389> feeds<00:06:34.680> constant

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
your system and something feeds constant

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.429 
your system and something feeds constant
and<00:06:35.949> change<00:06:36.939> into<00:06:37.330> this<00:06:37.599> and<00:06:37.870> this<00:06:38.199> will

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:38.439 
and change into this and this will

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:44.550 
and change into this and this will
explode<00:06:38.909> the<00:06:39.909> pipes<00:06:40.620> if<00:06:41.620> that<00:06:42.189> happens<00:06:43.560> so

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
explode the pipes if that happens so

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.249 
explode the pipes if that happens so
that<00:06:44.830> was<00:06:44.979> the<00:06:45.569> waterproof<00:06:46.569> pipes<00:06:46.870> and<00:06:47.229> the

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:47.259 
that was the waterproof pipes and the

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.890 
that was the waterproof pipes and the
conductive<00:06:48.039> pipes<00:06:48.250> and<00:06:49.000> the<00:06:49.029> next<00:06:49.539> one<00:06:49.719> we<00:06:49.870> are

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
conductive pipes and the next one we are

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.929 
conductive pipes and the next one we are
going<00:06:49.990> to<00:06:50.229> take<00:06:50.379> a<00:06:50.439> look<00:06:50.680> at<00:06:50.919> the<00:06:51.520> machines

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:51.939 
going to take a look at the machines

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.350 
going to take a look at the machines
that<00:06:52.300> go<00:06:52.360> with<00:06:52.779> this<00:06:53.020> or<00:06:54.090> that<00:06:55.090> you<00:06:55.210> can

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
that go with this or that you can

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.529 
that go with this or that you can
connect<00:06:55.689> with<00:06:55.870> these<00:06:57.750> pipes<00:06:59.909> so<00:07:00.909> thanks<00:07:01.449> for

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
connect with these pipes so thanks for

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.240 
connect with these pipes so thanks for
watching<00:07:01.900> and<00:07:02.080> I'll<00:07:02.469> see<00:07:02.529> you<00:07:02.860> on<00:07:02.889> the<00:07:03.219> next

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
watching and I'll see you on the next

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.520 
watching and I'll see you on the next
one
