you<00:01:01.469> see<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.949> works

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you see how that works

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
you see how that works
when<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.030> don't<00:01:03.270> die<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.680> more

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
when you don't die you can get more

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.570 
when you don't die you can get more
kills<00:01:06.560> it's<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.100> basketball

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
kills it's kind of like in basketball

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
kills it's kind of like in basketball
when<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> turnover<00:01:10.010> because<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
when you get a turnover because the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
when you get a turnover because the
turnover<00:01:11.790> basically<00:01:12.360> means<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.780> didn't<00:01:12.990> even

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
turnover basically means you didn't even

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
turnover basically means you didn't even
get<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> chance<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:14.070> score<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> other

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
get a chance to score and then the other

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
get a chance to score and then the other
team<00:01:15.689> could<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.500> an<00:01:16.590> easy<00:01:16.799> score<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.580> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
team could get an easy score so when you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
team could get an easy score so when you
die<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.990> doing<00:01:19.409> that's<00:01:20.189> why

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
die that's what you're doing that's why

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.399

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
live action hey especially on a big map

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.830 
live action hey especially on a big map
like<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:52.000> just<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.270> map<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.630> see<00:03:52.780> how

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
like this this is just a map you see how

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.120 
like this this is just a map you see how
