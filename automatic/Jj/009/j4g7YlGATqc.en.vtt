00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.230
 miss low let's see experience 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.230
 miss for nac today and kids twente 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.200
 piece piece experience piece setting 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.869
 it all remains low lying therefore you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 with rest on a zero state and then back 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.460
 no man is overboard yet 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.689
 he was woolly sleigh camera coming out of it 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.609
 that is not a good sign 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.720
 yes I spoke with your colleagues using 7 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.699
 they have come to have everything 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.080
 say done to get the game on 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.940
 to bring it to the end wants it with him 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 once 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.860
 yes indeed because this is because I am that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.899
 think that we will do everything possible 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.820
 only i have not seen what what 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.660
 full house today and I think so 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.399
 Unfortunately 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.780
 how is that because yes the situation of if 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.649
 you would say is in gas 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.860
 to give 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.379
 yes ok but if you go this week 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.030
 analyze with utrecht and with the eagles 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.190
 yes then you have a few nice ones 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.050
 tikjes goes so that plays along huh 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.760
 Only yes I still think so 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.289
 that you should not fear that you are there 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.760
 must go first 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.710
 and also because you feel at home and again 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.509
 it i have seen i was more it 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.220
 but the assignment of the trainer is full 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.799
 play the winnings of course 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.090
 we always play for the wind they want 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.590
 always win 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.600
 so that is one of them 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 commands you a painful week 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.479
 actually also expect in this competition 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.070
 the correcting you just before the bus and 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.990
 that you after the rest annoying me 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.000
 moments and he absolutely also because we 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.399
 acts of the fore 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 often play the first build on the too 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.970
 Others 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.960
 they often take the first pole so we 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.509
 are warned once 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.950
 and that was not enough 2 the second 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.509
 chances makes up for that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.340
 second half happens also an extra 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.509
 striker at mark even then you can think so 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.789
 don't make an xprize yet 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.619
 no fake are no ordinary we are not today 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.300
 must have done well 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.399
 i'm all with chilean van 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.750
 may have given everything today 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.580
 only I had something more 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.830
 expect I may still get in trouble 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.270
 pull you think so I was already a number 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.740
 weeks says you just have to fight 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.020
 for every points and if you have one if you 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.520
 is boiling and going full then I have 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.720
 All faith in it then you have to be there 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.179
 go for it and then you have to 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.069
 You radiate that you fire that 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.420
 and that you want to win for 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.360
 every opponent in any way 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.090
 also i didn't see that tonight 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.730
 I think that that that is a pity 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.810
 we are going to try to get a girl hello 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.489
 to hit 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.700
 yes but then also realize it 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.770
 everyone pointed and think i have that week 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.480
 so we're going to analyze we're going to 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.010
 contest also wants to speak of that of the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.450
 eagles and it and and and forget 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.519
 designed now all hands on deck 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.190
 to keep it back on the drawer 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.360
 a starter arrives and that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.700
 we don't want to 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.459
 and here this morning but hope that the ec 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.080
 Feyenoord of fleece in the kitchen now on 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.550
 is a big word but you just look 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.200
 each and now to position and that is normal 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.599
 would not want to and that's what this week 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.760
 can look different and connect 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.510
 must see fund 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.510
 unfortunately that did not work
