00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
through the pain in the proverbial

through the pain in the proverbial
backside<00:05:13.630> of<00:05:14.199> slipping<00:05:15.159> that<00:05:15.280> through<00:05:15.550> there

you<00:05:17.080> can<00:05:17.229> just<00:05:17.349> clip<00:05:17.620> it<00:05:17.650> around<00:05:17.949> but<00:05:18.880> just<00:05:19.210> for

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
you can just clip it around but just for

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.029 
you can just clip it around but just for
the<00:05:19.630> sake<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:20.050> exercise<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.710> wanted<00:05:20.949> to

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
the sake of the exercise I wanted to

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.790 
the sake of the exercise I wanted to
show<00:05:21.220> how<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.490> attached<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.449> there<00:05:22.599> so<00:05:23.530> let's

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
show how that attached in there so let's

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.879 
show how that attached in there so let's
say<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.039> attach<00:05:24.479> the<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:26.080> tripod<00:05:26.440> straps<00:05:26.740> to

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
say you attach the the tripod straps to

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.129 
say you attach the the tripod straps to
the<00:05:26.919> side<00:05:27.039> of<00:05:27.639> one<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.389> our<00:05:28.539> airport<00:05:28.930> roller

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
the side of one of our airport roller

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.420 
the side of one of our airport roller
bags<00:05:29.409> they're<00:05:30.009> all<00:05:30.130> quite<00:05:30.699> similar<00:05:32.219> this<00:05:33.219> is

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
bags they're all quite similar this is

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.230 
bags they're all quite similar this is
actually<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.030> monopod<00:05:34.449> strap<00:05:35.460> but<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:36.729> couldn't

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
actually a monopod strap but I couldn't

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.120 
actually a monopod strap but I couldn't
find<00:05:37.360> my<00:05:37.509> other<00:05:37.599> strap<00:05:37.900> so<00:05:38.110> I<00:05:38.409> just<00:05:38.979> thought

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
find my other strap so I just thought

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.249 
find my other strap so I just thought
I'd<00:05:39.280> use<00:05:39.430> it<00:05:39.580> say<00:05:39.789> because<00:05:40.539> it<00:05:40.690> has<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:41.020> same

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
I'd use it say because it has the same

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.200 
I'd use it say because it has the same
hook<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:41.889> loop<00:05:42.009> that<00:05:42.310> attaches<00:05:42.729> to<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.090> back

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
hook and loop that attaches to the back

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.820 
hook and loop that attaches to the back
there<00:05:43.449> I<00:05:43.949> hope<00:05:44.949> that's<00:05:45.159> been<00:05:45.219> helpful<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:46.830> if
