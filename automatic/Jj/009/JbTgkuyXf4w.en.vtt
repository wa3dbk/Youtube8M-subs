00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.179
 Welcome to my new Video Winner Poker math 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 it ties in directly with the doctors in Aachen 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.619
 Landes is concerned with the question of whether it is correct to Corinth or to do 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.789
 a very specific situation 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.630
 and there is a mathematical entanglement 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.630
 which factors do not matter 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.890
 "First of all, you have to test how high the probability is 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 what about your own fear for the next card 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.250
 that's about 2 cents in showdown the best one is 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.760
 Days you have to ask the question the Fielmann 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.980
 Numbers need to see the next card so it is 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.550
 Majo there to clarify 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 and you last how much 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 in Venice if the best hand 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
 around the showdown or the opponent and 11 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.780
 it's clear that the others are now 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.460
 that's just right to come up to train 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.550
 if it is likely that one 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.360
 So the hand wins the chance to move kiss as 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.830
 50 percent 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.050
 this statement is completely wrong 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.710
 correct is 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.680
 That's right 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.430
 if the probability to win 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.899
 is greater than the ratio between 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.610
 so urging in action and the post 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.020
 this relationship is called a product that is one 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.230
 rush hour 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.500
 if the probability is higher 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.940
 to win the chance will be from Siegburg 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.340
 when do you have positive earnings expectations and then you want to 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.439
 From a mathematical point of view, Kornnatter's overlong 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.970
 to win 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.160
 sounds very abstract now 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.479
 it's over 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.100
 still a small example 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.250
 and holds two heats on the hand and action brings the second heart on the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.290
 shelf 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 So you have a chat 4 4 ago St 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 the only opponent is set Bunder inflation 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 in Port are around 200 euros 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.059
 why familiar formula takes care of the probability 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.509
 and winning the bottle would then be the best hand of which one 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.789
 must go out in this calculation 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.799
 around according to our formula Vettel would be the profit probability 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.359
 at 20 percent 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.919
 so Bez you know this probability because it is always 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.959
 not yet if it is correct to follow coral reefs 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.549
 then you calculate 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.299
 the breads fruit 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.769
 and that is now 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.769
 maybe a bit complicated at first 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.199
 the Potters 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.070
 McCoy 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.719
 Road the animals 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.979
 In our case, our mission is to donate one hundred euros 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.639
 and tell them 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.019
 by 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.939
 what in puts 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 what is in the pot are baking â‚¬ 200 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.769
 but this one still counts the use of the opponent if you do not already 13 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.149
 Points 12 para 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.489
 at over 300 euros 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.419
 and then 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.419
 After the formula important you wrote down now you have to do that now 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.389
 so come in the exhibition halls you have to remember 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.159
 Expect another Tuesday against the use of it 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.099
 this means 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.390
 the port 200 euros including the circle Soest of the opponent Bamberger 300 euros 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.029
 again the use of over 400 euros 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.029
 Zeist one hundred euro tenth of a second as 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.059
 400 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.059
 Let's try at a decimal point 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.639
 and that's 25 percent 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.589
 It's easy here 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:56.540
 and compare the odds to the 20 percent middle of the product if this 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.759
 Probability Small 1 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.930
 as the portugal 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.269
 whether to be a negative one that is called expectations 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.929
 he could and not 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.669
 and just talk through it again 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.009
 our profit probability is 20 percent 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.309
 that means we win on average five hands played 4 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.279
 and to clarify this time 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.529
 that means we would if we do not even play for 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:25.139
 four times lose our bet of 100 euros 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 and the fifth time we win 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.360
 300 euros that means 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.349
 the operations center is Pott 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.460
 and the one hundred euros of the opponent 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.900
 that means we would have over five games 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.999
 lose on average 100 euros 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.999
 why the negative profit expectation 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:46.749
 so 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.050
 what you have to remember 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.270
 the proportionality in our calculations 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.930
 You can hear that in other places but also if you use them 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.860
 so now I passed the test of power 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.559
 Score every case 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.129
 "Our tenth is the use 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.770
 by 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.680
 10 short 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.159
 and belongs to the boss 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.159
 made perfect as set bet by the opponent 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.860
 + a second time the use of the opponent 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.950
 so still the little Setiawan the calculation is only a guide 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.050
 for this 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.850
 and you could be right in an individual case, other factors play a role 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.749
 but it is very important 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:29.659
 to improve our game 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.839
 and to be able to do these calculations alone 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:37.889
 Not far on this basis one can actually hates looking right 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.889
 Build a game 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.969
 Many thanks for watching 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.839
 maybe find a new video until next
