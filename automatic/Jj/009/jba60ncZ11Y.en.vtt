00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.390 
other things it levels up so good it's
so<00:02:19.260> good<00:02:21.920> just<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.790> beautiful<00:02:24.860> we<00:02:25.860> also<00:02:26.069> had

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
so good just it's beautiful we also had

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.930 
so good just it's beautiful we also had
a<00:02:26.610> earth<00:02:26.910> one<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> think<00:02:28.010> yes<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.310> one<00:02:29.550> level

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
a earth one I think yes this one level

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.800 
a earth one I think yes this one level
12<00:02:30.300> currently<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.790> get<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.060> level<00:02:36.450> 20

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
12 currently can we get it to level 20

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.370 
12 currently can we get it to level 20
probably<00:02:37.650> yeah

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
probably yeah

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.880 
probably yeah
yes<00:02:40.430> level<00:02:41.430> 20<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.450> our<00:02:42.930> nights<00:02:43.440> are<00:02:43.560> gonna<00:02:43.739> be

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
yes level 20 so our nights are gonna be

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.280 
yes level 20 so our nights are gonna be
so<00:02:44.160> Opie<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.330> we<00:02:45.450> check<00:02:45.630> right<00:02:45.840> over<00:02:46.080> here

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
so Opie so if we check right over here

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.070 
so Opie so if we check right over here
harmonic<00:02:47.100> battle<00:02:47.400> gear<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.360> put<00:02:48.630> one

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
harmonic battle gear if we put one

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.650 
harmonic battle gear if we put one
normal<00:02:49.860> air<00:02:50.130> fusion<00:02:50.760> boosts<00:02:51.000> on<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.420> let

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
normal air fusion boosts on it so let

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.080 
normal air fusion boosts on it so let
let's<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.019> how<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.220> star<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> fourth

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
let's see how is the to star the fourth

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.729 
let's see how is the to star the fourth
are<00:02:54.239> compared<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.959> two<00:02:55.110> times<00:02:55.320> as<00:02:55.560> better

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
are compared is it two times as better

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.990 
are compared is it two times as better
how<00:02:55.980> much<00:02:56.160> better<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:59.069> we<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.519> one

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
how much better is it so we have one

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.479 
how much better is it so we have one
level<00:03:00.269> or<00:03:00.510> one<00:03:00.870> level<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.739> half<00:03:01.890> our<00:03:02.250> money

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
level or one level and a half our money

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.729 
level or one level and a half our money
let's<00:03:03.090> see<00:03:03.269> what<00:03:03.420> earth<00:03:03.630> for<00:03:03.930> star<00:03:04.230> air<00:03:04.470> fusion

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
let's see what earth for star air fusion

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.860 
let's see what earth for star air fusion
boosts<00:03:05.040> can<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.519> us<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:09.000> we<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.269> max<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.690> but

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
boosts can get us if we can max it but

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.000 
boosts can get us if we can max it but
it's<00:03:10.080> just<00:03:10.319> saw<00:03:10.470> something<00:03:14.480> BAM<00:03:15.480> or<00:03:16.170> harmonic

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
it's just saw something BAM or harmonic

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.460 
it's just saw something BAM or harmonic
battle<00:03:17.700> gear<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.030> now<00:03:18.269> max<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.049> so

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
battle gear is now max that is so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.250 
battle gear is now max that is so
awesome<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.329> other<00:03:21.510> one<00:03:21.690> was<00:03:21.720> able<00:03:22.079> to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
awesome so the other one was able to

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.440 
awesome so the other one was able to
live<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.829> about<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.489> level<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.180> went

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
live it about one level and this went

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.720 
live it about one level and this went
four<00:03:25.140> levels<00:03:25.560> probably<00:03:25.980> more<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.670> don't

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
four levels probably more but I don't

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.870 
four levels probably more but I don't
know<00:03:26.970> but<00:03:27.209> four<00:03:27.959> levels<00:03:28.230> well<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.730> like

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
know but four levels well it's it's like

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.580 
know but four levels well it's it's like
four<00:03:30.180> times<00:03:30.420> better<00:03:30.630> than<00:03:30.840> double<00:03:31.200> few<00:03:31.380> news
