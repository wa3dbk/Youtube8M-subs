was<00:03:18.170> flown<00:03:18.440> up<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.830> Fenwick<00:03:19.459> factory<00:03:20.180> in

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
was flown up to Fenwick factory in

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.030 
was flown up to Fenwick factory in
Washington<00:03:20.930> State<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.440> Bainbridge<00:03:21.860> Island

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
Washington State on Bainbridge Island

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.140 
Washington State on Bainbridge Island
and<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:23.150> actually<00:03:23.390> cast<00:03:24.050> and<00:03:24.590> use<00:03:25.220> graphite<00:03:25.940> and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
and I actually cast and use graphite and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.710 
and I actually cast and use graphite and
boron<00:03:26.390> rods<00:03:26.810> in<00:03:27.340> 1972<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.610> year<00:03:29.240> before<00:03:29.420> they

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
boron rods in 1972 a year before they

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.000 
boron rods in 1972 a year before they
were<00:03:29.780> introduced<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.500> market<00:03:30.530> place

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
were introduced to the market place

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.000 
were introduced to the market place
based<00:03:31.520> off<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.820> my<00:03:32.090> term<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.480> casting<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.709> from

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
based off of my term in casting so from

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.670 
based off of my term in casting so from
that<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:35.630> know<00:03:35.660> had<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> lot<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.170> fun<00:03:36.470> working

with Jim on what I want for tournament
casting<00:03:39.740> rods<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.160> was<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.400> first<00:03:40.610> person<00:03:40.760> in

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
casting rods I was the first person in

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.449 
casting rods I was the first person in
the<00:03:41.209> world<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.570> have<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:42.230> graphite<00:03:42.920> tournament

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
game changer you know from fiberglass

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.890 
game changer you know from fiberglass
that<00:04:04.130> goes<00:04:04.250> like<00:04:04.370> this<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.510> then<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.780> go

that goes like this and and then you go

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.230 
that goes like this and and then you go
and<00:04:06.110> it<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.650> dampens<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.610> shoots<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.030> tight

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
and it just dampens and shoots a tight

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.270 
and it just dampens and shoots a tight
loop<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.780> more<00:04:08.959> distance<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.590> broke<00:04:10.040> all<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
loop and more distance I broke all the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.850 
loop and more distance I broke all the
records<00:04:10.660> everybody<00:04:11.660> said<00:04:11.930> unfair<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.680> said

first day of graphite development I've

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.170 
first day of graphite development I've
been<00:04:34.860> around<00:04:35.190> knowing<00:04:35.580> what<00:04:35.940> is<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
been around knowing what is the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.700 
been around knowing what is the
different<00:04:36.510> kind<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.750> graphite<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:37.320> can<00:04:37.500> get

kind of resin system usually in epoxy

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.689 
kind of resin system usually in epoxy
but<00:04:42.690> there's<00:04:42.900> other<00:04:43.080> things<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.830> all<00:04:44.490> these

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699

but there's other things and all these
ingredients<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.570> go<00:04:45.630> into<00:04:45.750> rod<00:04:46.199> design<00:04:46.590> so

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
ingredients that go into rod design so

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.800 
ingredients that go into rod design so
is<00:04:47.280> my<00:04:47.490> need<00:04:47.760> for<00:04:47.790> higher<00:04:48.210> performance

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
is my need for higher performance
