00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
driving so as you can see it's not a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.040

gyroscopes moving didn't notice it

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.370 
gyroscopes moving didn't notice it
earlier<00:06:45.430> but<00:06:45.720> you<00:06:46.720> sort<00:06:46.900> of<00:06:46.960> see<00:06:47.169> they're

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
earlier but you sort of see they're

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.530 
earlier but you sort of see they're
correcting<00:06:48.130> itself<00:06:48.430> slidin<00:06:49.030> turned<00:06:49.210> on<00:06:49.360> it's

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
correcting itself slidin turned on it's

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.629 
correcting itself slidin turned on it's
doing<00:06:49.750> that's<00:06:49.900> really<00:06:50.020> cool<00:06:50.290> right<00:06:51.070> go<00:06:51.550> and
