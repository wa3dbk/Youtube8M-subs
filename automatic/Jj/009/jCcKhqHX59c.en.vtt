is we need to stitch the bait shut so

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.850 
is we need to stitch the bait shut so
these<00:00:46.330> Gill<00:00:46.600> batches<00:00:46.990> stay<00:00:47.230> closed

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
these Gill batches stay closed

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.470 
these Gill batches stay closed
he's<00:00:48.070> mouth<00:00:48.370> stays<00:00:48.610> closed<00:00:48.940> otherwise<00:00:49.270> when

fall<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.410> bits<00:00:53.560> so<00:00:54.010> start<00:00:54.550> there<00:00:54.730> we'll<00:00:54.940> run

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
fall to bits so start there we'll run

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.730 
fall to bits so start there we'll run
noodle<00:00:55.420> straight<00:00:55.690> through<00:00:55.930> top<00:00:56.560> of<00:00:56.680> the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
noodle straight through top of the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.340 
noodle straight through top of the
pectoral<00:00:57.100> fin<00:00:57.310> out<00:00:58.200> through<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.320> other

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
pectoral fin out through the other

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.190 
pectoral fin out through the other
pectoral<00:00:59.860> fin<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:01.690> that's<00:01:01.900> straight

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
pectoral fin well that's straight

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.189 
pectoral fin well that's straight
through<00:01:02.470> like<00:01:02.590> that<00:01:02.770> we'll<00:01:03.580> leave<00:01:03.700> a<00:01:03.730> nice<00:01:04.199> tag

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
through like that we'll leave a nice tag

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.609 
through like that we'll leave a nice tag
in<00:01:06.180> hanging<00:01:07.180> out<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.540> other<00:01:07.689> side<00:01:07.990> there<00:01:08.290> pull

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
in hanging out the other side there pull

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.310 
in hanging out the other side there pull
that<00:01:08.770> one<00:01:08.920> up<00:01:08.979> okay<00:01:10.050> and<00:01:11.050> then<00:01:11.470> back<00:01:12.280> across

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that one up okay and then back across

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.980 
that one up okay and then back across
and<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:14.620> just<00:01:16.620> in<00:01:17.620> underneath<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.550> backbone

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
and then just in underneath a backbone

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.970 
and then just in underneath a backbone
through<00:01:21.620> their<00:01:21.920> cross<00:01:22.490> again<00:01:23.740> underneath<00:01:24.740> the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
through their cross again underneath the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.440 
through their cross again underneath the
backbone<00:01:26.350> through<00:01:27.350> their<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:29.000> just<00:01:29.240> helps

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
backbone through their that just helps

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.940 
backbone through their that just helps
support<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.140> shoulders<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:30.650> we<00:01:30.740> come<00:01:30.920> back

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
support the shoulders then we come back

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.240 
support the shoulders then we come back
over<00:01:31.370> again<00:01:35.380> ways<00:01:36.380> try<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:36.770> push<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.070> needle

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
over again ways try and push the needle

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.580 
over again ways try and push the needle
and<00:01:37.670> see<00:01:37.910> there<00:01:38.150> I've<00:01:38.390> come<00:01:39.080> back<00:01:39.200> through<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
and see there I've come back through the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.960 
and see there I've come back through the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
same hole that I went through and we've

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.850 
same hole that I went through and we've
got<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.210> nice<00:01:41.440> crisscross<00:01:42.440> pattern

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
got that nice crisscross pattern

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.460 
got that nice crisscross pattern
happening<00:01:43.250> there<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.700> back<00:01:47.000> across

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.670 

everything's<00:01:51.470> got<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.650> stay<00:01:51.890> nice<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.160> firm

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
everything's got to stay nice and firm

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.060 
everything's got to stay nice and firm
back<00:01:54.680> through<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.310> pectoral<00:01:55.729> fin<00:01:55.910> again<00:01:57.070> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
back through the pectoral fin again and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.010 
back through the pectoral fin again and
out<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.550> other<00:01:58.700> side<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.390> that's<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.690> initial

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
out the other side so that's the initial

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.130 
out the other side so that's the initial
part<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.410> their<00:02:00.910> skip<00:02:01.910> bait<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:02.750> can<00:02:02.899> see

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140

part of their skip bait you can see
there<00:02:03.350> that's<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:03.830> holding<00:02:04.550> each<00:02:04.670> shoulders

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
there that's just holding each shoulders

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.719 
there that's just holding each shoulders
that<00:02:05.660> will<00:02:05.780> help<00:02:05.930> hold<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.259> fish<00:02:06.560> nice<00:02:07.460> and

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
that will help hold that fish nice and

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.210 
that will help hold that fish nice and
tight<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.119> together<00:02:08.630> back<00:02:09.590> into<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> noodle

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
tight and together back into the noodle

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.820 
tight and together back into the noodle
there<00:02:10.340> now<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.270> what<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:11.510> want<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.690> do<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.590> go

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
there now and what we want to do is go

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.970 
there now and what we want to do is go
back<00:02:13.100> around<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.780> pull<00:02:15.530> those<00:02:15.650> Gill

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
back around and and pull those Gill

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.420 
back around and and pull those Gill
watches<00:02:16.310> together<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.320> from<00:02:18.920> there<00:02:19.160> back
