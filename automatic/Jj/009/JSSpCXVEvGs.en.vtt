the gallonage for the house comes out of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
the gallonage for the house comes out of
and<00:00:36.270> how<00:00:36.660> many<00:00:36.840> zones<00:00:37.079> heads<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.620> could<00:00:37.800> put<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and how many zones heads we could put on

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.490 
and how many zones heads we could put on
a<00:00:38.129> zone<00:00:38.460> based<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.180> gallery<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.350> guys

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
a zone based on that gallery you guys

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
a zone based on that gallery you guys
work<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> plan<00:00:41.340> yes

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
work off a plan yes

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.790 
work off a plan yes
but<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> plan<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.110> an<00:00:43.290> estimate<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
but the plan is just an estimate to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
but the plan is just an estimate to
figure<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> need<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.660> comes

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
figure out what I need like it comes

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.779 
figure out what I need like it comes
down<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> they<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.559> yard<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.520> start

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
down to they actually yard you start

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
down to they actually yard you start
flagging<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.719> gives<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
flagging it out that gives you the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
flagging it out that gives you the
actual<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> yard<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.000> where<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
actual what what the yard is where the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.000 
actual what what the yard is where the
trees<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.350> everything<00:00:52.620> else<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.949> needs

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
trees are and everything else that needs

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.160 
trees are and everything else that needs
to<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.520> covered<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.300> once<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.989> figure

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to be covered so once you figure

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
to be covered so once you figure
everything<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:57.030> ready<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> pull

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
everything out then you're ready to pull

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.729 
everything out then you're ready to pull
some<00:00:57.570> pipe<00:00:57.719> yep<00:00:57.989> we'll<00:00:58.199> start<00:00:58.410> pulling<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
some pipe yep we'll start pulling the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.959 
some pipe yep we'll start pulling the
pipe<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.129> away<00:00:59.309> we'll<00:00:59.489> start<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
pipe right away we'll start with the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.180 
pipe right away we'll start with the
lateral<00:01:00.359> lines<00:01:00.660> first<00:01:01.079> okay<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.829> what's<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
lateral lines first okay so what's a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.979 
lateral lines first okay so what's a
lateral<00:01:02.520> line<00:01:02.730> lateral<00:01:03.390> lines<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
lateral line lateral lines are the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.750 
lateral line lateral lines are the
headlines<00:01:04.409> where<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> heads<00:01:05.100> run<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.700> if

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
headlines where the heads run so if

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
headlines where the heads run so if
there's<00:01:05.970> five<00:01:06.330> heads<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.810> its<00:01:06.960> own<00:01:07.110> over<00:01:07.320> now

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there's five heads on its own over now

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.340 
there's five heads on its own over now
all<00:01:08.070> five<00:01:08.610> heads<00:01:08.939> first<00:01:09.270> now<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> pull<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
all five heads first now to pull the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
all five heads first now to pull the
line<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.280> using<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.640> vibratory

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
line is here you're using a vibratory

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.690 
line is here you're using a vibratory
plow<00:01:12.270> correct<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> does<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> puts<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
plow correct what it does is it puts the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.280 
plow correct what it does is it puts the
blade<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.119> ground<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> pulse<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.110> pipe

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
blade in the ground and a pulse of pipe

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.600 
blade in the ground and a pulse of pipe
underneath<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> ground<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.340> less

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
underneath the ground it's less

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
underneath the ground it's less
nutritive<00:01:18.420> especially<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.170> grass

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
nutritive especially if it's grass

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
nutritive especially if it's grass
obviously<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.040> yard<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.460> dirt<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.180> once<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
obviously this yard is dirt so once you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.030 
obviously this yard is dirt so once you
get<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> lateral<00:01:22.140> lines<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.530> connecting<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
get the lateral lines in connecting the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
get the lateral lines in connecting the
heads<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.580> you're<00:01:23.820> ready<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> pull<00:01:24.240> mean

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
heads then you're ready to pull mean

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.149 
heads then you're ready to pull mean
like<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.170> pull<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> mainline<00:01:25.860> butts

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
like when we pull the mainline butts

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310 
like when we pull the mainline butts
under<00:01:26.640> pressure<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.210> times<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.810> there's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
under pressure at all times and there's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
under pressure at all times and there's
a<00:01:28.409> low<00:01:28.590> voltage<00:01:28.799> cable<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.520> goes<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.939> with

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
a low voltage cable that goes right with

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.390 
a low voltage cable that goes right with
that<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.930> low<00:01:31.140> voltage<00:01:31.560> cable<00:01:31.920> goes<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that the low voltage cable goes to the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.210 
that the low voltage cable goes to the
valves<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> control<00:01:33.000> each<00:01:33.840> zone<00:01:34.320> where<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
valves that control each zone where the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.359 
valves that control each zone where the
lateral<00:01:35.579> lines<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.500> there<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
lateral lines are on there is a lot of

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.490 
lateral lines are on there is a lot of
handing<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> digger<00:01:40.380> on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
handing and to do you got a digger on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
handing and to do you got a digger on
obstacles<00:01:41.159> utilities<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.600> got<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> dig<00:01:42.899> in

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
obstacles utilities you got a dig in

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.050 
obstacles utilities you got a dig in
your<00:01:43.110> boxes<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:44.820> pipe

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
your boxes and to make all your pipe

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
your boxes and to make all your pipe
connections<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.810> they're<00:01:46.380> putting<00:01:46.619> me<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
connections so they're putting me to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.649 
connections so they're putting me to
work

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
work

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.389 
work
so<00:01:48.659> once<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> pipe<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> pulled<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so once all the pipe is pulled then you

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.310 
so once all the pipe is pulled then you
can<00:01:50.579> start<00:01:50.850> connecting<00:01:51.060> things<00:01:51.450> yes<00:01:52.079> we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
can start connecting things yes we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.450 
can start connecting things yes we
connect<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> number<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
connect them up with a number of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.469 
connect them up with a number of
different<00:01:53.880> fittings

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
different fittings

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
different fittings
we'll<00:01:55.439> use<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.619> combination<00:01:56.040> T<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.939> on

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
we'll use a combination T if it's on

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
we'll use a combination T if it's on
that<00:01:57.149> tee<00:01:57.740> or<00:01:58.740> an<00:01:59.070> end<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> end

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that tee or an end up that's on the end

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.850 
that tee or an end up that's on the end
up<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.540> every<00:02:00.840> head<00:02:01.049> gets<00:02:01.290> put<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.680> this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
up in every head gets put on this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.039 
up in every head gets put on this
flexible<00:02:02.340> pipe<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.299> see<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> few

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
flexible pipe and I see you have a few

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.359 
flexible pipe and I see you have a few
different<00:02:04.409> heads<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> you're<00:02:04.860> working<00:02:05.009> with

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
different heads that you're working with

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.429 
different heads that you're working with
here<00:02:05.640> yeah<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.930> those<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.259> have

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
here yeah what we do is those they have

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
here yeah what we do is those they have
a<00:02:07.469> different<00:02:07.920> type<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.129> heads<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
a different type of heads that for the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.760 
a different type of heads that for the
applications<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.989> are<00:02:10.140> needed<00:02:10.410> we've<00:02:10.649> got

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
applications that are needed we've got

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.910 
applications that are needed we've got
the<00:02:10.979> large<00:02:11.760> head<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.270> pops<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.750> four<00:02:13.050> inches

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the large head that pops up four inches

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.610 
the large head that pops up four inches
and<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> rotates<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.120> does<00:02:15.350> thirty<00:02:16.350> feet

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and it rotates and it does thirty feet

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.700 
and it rotates and it does thirty feet
or<00:02:17.010> better<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:18.030> medium<00:02:18.480> head<00:02:18.810> which<00:02:19.530> is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
or better the medium head which is

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.340 
or better the medium head which is
rotates<00:02:20.670> finger<00:02:21.450> things<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.080> does<00:02:22.320> it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
rotates finger things so that does it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.650 
rotates finger things so that does it
there<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.070> go<00:02:23.190> up<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.580> about<00:02:23.610> twenty<00:02:24.180> five<00:02:24.360> feet

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
there to go up to about twenty five feet

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.530 
there to go up to about twenty five feet
and<00:02:24.900> then<00:02:25.290> there's<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.560> spray<00:02:26.040> head<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:27.270> does

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
and then there's a spray head that does

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.530 
and then there's a spray head that does
a<00:02:27.570> smaller<00:02:28.140> surf<00:02:28.530> surf<00:02:28.860> areas<00:02:29.340> which<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.270> for

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
a smaller surf surf areas which is for

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.360 
a smaller surf surf areas which is for
more<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.080> mist<00:02:31.410> you're<00:02:31.920> also<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> be

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
more of a mist you're also going to be

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.490 
more of a mist you're also going to be
doing<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.700> little<00:02:32.850> bit<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.060> drip<00:02:33.330> irrigation

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
doing a little bit of drip irrigation

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500 
doing a little bit of drip irrigation
yes<00:02:34.500> we're<00:02:34.770> actually<00:02:34.890> putting<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.550> some<00:02:36.240> drip

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
yes we're actually putting in some drip

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.110 
yes we're actually putting in some drip
lines<00:02:36.780> wherever<00:02:37.110> planting<00:02:37.770> beds<00:02:37.980> are<00:02:38.160> at<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
lines wherever planting beds are at to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.390 
lines wherever planting beds are at to
be<00:02:39.300> able<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.600> water<00:02:40.140> them<00:02:40.470> efficiently<00:02:41.220> as

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
be able to water them efficiently as

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.460 
be able to water them efficiently as
well<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:42.420> here's<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.050> Mark<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.440> talking

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
well so here's what Mark was talking

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.460 
well so here's what Mark was talking
about<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> actual<00:02:44.730> valve<00:02:45.060> assembly

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
about this is the actual valve assembly

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.470 
about this is the actual valve assembly
here<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.740> your<00:02:46.890> main<00:02:47.310> water<00:02:47.550> supply<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
here you have your main water supply and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.660 
here you have your main water supply and
these<00:02:48.990> are<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> three<00:02:49.470> different<00:02:49.890> zones<00:02:50.100> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
these are the three different zones that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.860 
these are the three different zones that
go<00:02:50.850> out<00:02:51.000> into<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.360> yard

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
go out into the yard

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.620 
go out into the yard
so<00:02:52.350> when<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> controller<00:02:53.340> calls<00:02:54.060> for<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> zone

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
so when the controller calls for a zone

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.870 
so when the controller calls for a zone
to<00:02:54.810> come<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.290> turn<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.920> will<00:02:56.430> open<00:02:56.580> up

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
to come on and turn on that will open up

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.300 
to come on and turn on that will open up
any<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.720> these<00:02:57.870> valves<00:02:58.200> which<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.070> calls

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
any one of these valves which it calls

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.160 
any one of these valves which it calls
for<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.790> send<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.420> water<00:03:00.600> out<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.959> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
for and send the water out to the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.850 
for and send the water out to the
sprinklers<00:03:02.390> Simple<00:03:03.390> Simon<00:03:03.660> now<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.530> also

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
sprinklers Simple Simon now you also

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.530 
sprinklers Simple Simon now you also
have<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.160> few<00:03:05.400> things<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.790> help<00:03:06.060> kind<00:03:06.450> of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
have a few things that help kind of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.810 
have a few things that help kind of
control<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.050> run<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> system<00:03:07.440> yes<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.489> do<00:03:08.610> it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
control and run the system yes we do it

should<00:03:09.150> have<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.360> rain<00:03:09.600> sensor<00:03:09.870> bylaw<00:03:10.440> and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
should have a rain sensor bylaw and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.040 
should have a rain sensor bylaw and
Minnesota<00:03:11.489> they<00:03:11.640> are<00:03:11.760> required<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.870> there's

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
Minnesota they are required and there's

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.900 
Minnesota they are required and there's
also<00:03:13.230> another<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:13.860> which<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.250> actually<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
also another one which is actually a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.060 
also another one which is actually a
weather<00:03:15.420> station<00:03:15.810> which<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.440> application

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
weather station which is the application

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.740 
weather station which is the application
we're<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.459> using<00:03:17.790> today<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.330> it

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
we're going to be using today and it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.890 
we're going to be using today and it
actually<00:03:19.070> dictates<00:03:20.070> how<00:03:20.880> long<00:03:21.360> it's<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.840> to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
actually dictates how long it's going to

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.229 
actually dictates how long it's going to
run<00:03:22.140> based<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.739> temperature<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.790> solar

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
run based on temperature and solar

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.300 
run based on temperature and solar
radiation<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.560> course<00:03:25.769> there's<00:03:25.980> also<00:03:26.130> a

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
radiation and of course there's also a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.759 
radiation and of course there's also a
controller<00:03:26.760> yes<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.540> controller<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.019> runs

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
controller yes the controller that runs

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.280 
controller yes the controller that runs
all<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.010> zones<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:30.209> be<00:03:30.330> able<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.570> water<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
all the zones to be able to water the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.539 
all the zones to be able to water the
certain<00:03:31.560> amount<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.830> times<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.400> means

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
certain amount of times that it means

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.550 
certain amount of times that it means
and<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.180> course<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.480> controller<00:03:33.930> will<00:03:34.380> talk

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and of course the controller will talk

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.100 
and of course the controller will talk
about<00:03:34.680> more<00:03:34.920> on<00:03:35.130> these<00:03:35.250> correct

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.140 

Oh
