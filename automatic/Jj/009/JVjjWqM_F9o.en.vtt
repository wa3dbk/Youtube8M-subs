earn the jack pad so well in the correct

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.610 
earn the jack pad so well in the correct
location<00:00:22.640> with<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.850> jack

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
location with the jack

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.550 
location with the jack
um<00:00:24.620> the<00:00:24.920> ABS<00:00:25.310> sensors<00:00:25.730> are<00:00:26.110> sort<00:00:27.110> of<00:00:27.230> tucked<00:00:27.440> in

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
um the ABS sensors are sort of tucked in

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.480 
um the ABS sensors are sort of tucked in
behind<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.980> wheel<00:00:28.010> good<00:00:28.190> luck<00:00:28.340> behind<00:00:28.810> the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
behind the wheel good luck behind the

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.540 
behind the wheel good luck behind the
disc<00:00:31.490> so<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:32.539> they're<00:00:33.530> attached<00:00:33.800> by<00:00:34.010> an<00:00:34.129> Allen

bolt<00:00:35.499> I'm<00:00:36.499> actually<00:00:36.739> using<00:00:37.070> American<00:00:37.820> size

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
bolt I'm actually using American size

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.290 
bolt I'm actually using American size
Allen<00:00:39.050> wrenches<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:39.649> they're<00:00:40.640> not<00:00:40.730> perfectly

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
Allen wrenches so they're not perfectly

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.739 
Allen wrenches so they're not perfectly
on<00:00:41.469> let's<00:00:42.469> see<00:00:42.710> what<00:00:43.059> what<00:00:44.059> size<00:00:44.329> I'm<00:00:44.570> actually

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
on let's see what what size I'm actually

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.639 
on let's see what what size I'm actually
using<00:00:45.909> it<00:00:46.909> is<00:00:47.120> right<00:00:47.929> over<00:00:48.079> here

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
using it is right over here

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.959 
using it is right over here
ok<00:00:49.809> so<00:00:50.809> I'm<00:00:50.989> using<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:53.030> 3/16<00:00:53.960> allen<00:00:54.260> wrench

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
ok so I'm using the 3/16 allen wrench

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.700 
ok so I'm using the 3/16 allen wrench
which<00:00:55.969> it's<00:00:56.629> actually<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.079> little<00:00:57.289> bit<00:00:57.379> small

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
which it's actually a little bit small

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.520 
which it's actually a little bit small
so<00:00:58.300> if<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.389> have<00:00:59.479> a<00:00:59.510> metric<00:00:59.960> version<00:01:00.350> it's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
so if you have a metric version it's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.959 
so if you have a metric version it's
like<00:01:00.739> one<00:01:01.159> half<00:01:01.789> size<00:01:02.120> larger<00:01:02.569> than<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.780> 3/16

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
like one half size larger than the 3/16

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.929 
like one half size larger than the 3/16
American<00:01:05.079> American<00:01:06.079> style<00:01:06.759> so<00:01:07.759> we'll<00:01:07.850> be

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
American American style so we'll be

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.959 
American American style so we'll be
using<00:01:07.969> this<00:01:09.340> ok<00:01:10.340> let's<00:01:10.549> take<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.820> wheel<00:01:10.969> off

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
using this ok let's take the wheel off

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.459 
using this ok let's take the wheel off
alright<00:01:13.969> we<00:01:14.119> got<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.360> wheel<00:01:14.479> off<00:01:14.689> we<00:01:15.229> got<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469

to<00:01:35.810> put<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.289> jack<00:01:36.530> stand<00:01:36.770> where<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:37.009> one<00:01:37.159> is

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
to put the jack stand where that one is

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.990 
to put the jack stand where that one is
that's<00:01:37.789> on<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.240> main<00:01:38.420> frame<00:01:38.810> rail<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:40.000> that's

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
that's on the main frame rail and that's

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.490 
that's on the main frame rail and that's
not<00:01:41.240> supporting<00:01:41.869> any<00:01:41.990> weight<00:01:42.200> it's<00:01:42.380> just

not supporting any weight it's just

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.069 
not supporting any weight it's just
there<00:01:42.619> for<00:01:42.649> safety<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.340> if<00:01:43.429> that<00:01:43.549> fails<00:01:44.079> then

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
there for safety so if that fails then

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.779 
there for safety so if that fails then
that<00:01:45.229> will<00:01:45.380> take<00:01:45.560> over<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.070> then<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.369> also<00:01:46.520> put

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
that will take over and then I also put

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.510 
that will take over and then I also put
the<00:01:46.880> wheel<00:01:47.740> underneath<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.920> car<00:01:49.130> right

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520

underneath<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.210> skid<00:01:50.810> plate<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:52.000> have

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
underneath the the skid plate so I have

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.950 
underneath the the skid plate so I have
two<00:01:53.299> backups

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
two backups

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.529 
two backups
if<00:01:54.079> that<00:01:54.439> decides<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.219> fail<00:01:55.429> because<00:01:56.390> that's

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
if that decides to fail because that's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.459 
if that decides to fail because that's
the<00:01:56.659> only<00:01:56.749> point<00:01:57.079> you're<00:01:57.200> supposed<00:01:57.439> to

look deeper in here

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.600 
look deeper in here
his<00:02:12.239> box<00:02:12.540> right<00:02:12.810> over<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.530> one<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.430> is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
his box right over here this one this is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.860 
his box right over here this one this is
where<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.830> DSC<00:02:18.080> sensor<00:02:19.080> goes<00:02:19.620> into<00:02:20.040> then<00:02:20.879> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
where the DSC sensor goes into then it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.990 
where the DSC sensor goes into then it
comes<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.849> comes<00:02:23.849> out<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.239> box<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.879> it

comes out comes out of that box and it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.830 
comes out comes out of that box and it
goes<00:02:27.150> down<00:02:27.480> behind<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.819> lights<00:02:30.209> on<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.690> way

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
goes down behind the lights on the way

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.720 
goes down behind the lights on the way
these<00:02:31.410> are<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.670> Coney<00:02:32.670> shocks<00:02:33.120> sport<00:02:33.810> shocks

here<00:02:38.879> on<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:40.019> side<00:02:40.879> let's<00:02:41.879> get<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> light

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
here on this side let's get the light

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.110 
here on this side let's get the light
over<00:02:42.750> here<00:02:46.280> damn<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.459> hard<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.760> film<00:02:47.970> with

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
over here damn it's hard to film with

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.119 
over here damn it's hard to film with
this<00:02:48.239> iPhone<00:02:51.170> okay<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.410> see<00:02:52.560> right<00:02:52.769> there

this iPhone okay you can see right there

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.670 
this iPhone okay you can see right there
that<00:02:54.090> cord<00:02:54.510> loops<00:02:55.410> up<00:02:56.269> back<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.540> box<00:02:57.780> up<00:02:58.500> in

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
that cord loops up back to the box up in

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.559 
that cord loops up back to the box up in
there<00:02:59.060> this<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.450> DSC<00:03:02.000> it's<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.120> DSC

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
there this is the DSC it's the DSC

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.150 
there this is the DSC it's the DSC
sensor<00:03:03.959> I've<00:03:04.079> already<00:03:04.290> cleaned<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.890> left

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
sensor I've already cleaned the left

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.789 
sensor I've already cleaned the left
side<00:03:05.489> I'm<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.720> right<00:03:06.900> side<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.739> can

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
side I'm on the right side so you can

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.259 
side I'm on the right side so you can
see<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.010> Allen<00:03:08.400> screw<00:03:08.700> right<00:03:08.910> there<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
see the Allen screw right there in the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.330 
see the Allen screw right there in the
middle<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.569> screen<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.140> want<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.069> take<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
middle of the screen I want to take that

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
middle of the screen I want to take that
off<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:12.680> then<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.040> comes<00:03:14.280> right<00:03:14.549> now<00:03:14.640> you

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
off and then it just comes right now you

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.500 
off and then it just comes right now you
just<00:03:14.849> pull<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.269> out<00:03:17.329> let's<00:03:18.329> see<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:21.060> after<00:03:21.359> I<00:03:21.419> do

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
just pull it out let's see so after I do

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.500 
just pull it out let's see so after I do
that<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:22.109> I'm<00:03:22.530> gonna<00:03:22.650> clean<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.329> this<00:03:24.329> will

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that and I'm gonna clean it this will

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.280 
that and I'm gonna clean it this will
hopefully<00:03:24.690> fix<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.349> problem<00:03:25.859> of<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.639> of<00:03:27.450> all

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
hopefully fix the problem of a of all

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.190 
hopefully fix the problem of a of all
those<00:03:28.560> caution<00:03:29.130> lights<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.730> car<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.299> have

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
those caution lights on the car I have

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.120 
those caution lights on the car I have
that<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:32.370> light<00:03:32.609> trio<00:03:32.970> thing<00:03:33.419> where<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.980> have

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
that the light trio thing where you have

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.650 
that the light trio thing where you have
the<00:03:35.250> main<00:03:35.400> warning<00:03:35.910> light<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> middles<00:03:36.450> on

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the main warning light the middles on

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.099 
the main warning light the middles on
and<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.380> also<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:38.359> the<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.690> brake<00:03:39.900> light

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
and you also have the the brake light

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.920 
and you also have the the brake light
turns<00:03:40.319> yellow<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.030> there's<00:03:42.209> two<00:03:42.389> lights<00:03:42.630> that

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
turns yellow so there's two lights that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.319 
turns yellow so there's two lights that
are<00:03:42.989> always<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.620> dashboard<00:03:44.099> I<00:03:44.329> think

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
are always on the dashboard I think

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.080 
are always on the dashboard I think
those<00:03:45.480> are<00:03:45.510> being<00:03:45.750> tripped<00:03:46.079> because<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:47.790> can't

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
those are being tripped because it can't

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.839 
those are being tripped because it can't
tell<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:50.040> sensors<00:03:50.400> aren't<00:03:50.549> giving<00:03:50.760> any

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
tell the sensors aren't giving any

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.759 
tell the sensors aren't giving any
information<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.900> car<00:03:52.109> turns<00:03:52.290> lights<00:03:52.590> on

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
information so the car turns lights on

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.599 
information so the car turns lights on
this<00:03:53.730> will<00:03:53.849> hopefully<00:03:54.000> turn<00:03:54.269> them<00:03:54.450> off<00:03:54.629> and

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
this will hopefully turn them off and

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.119 
this will hopefully turn them off and
this<00:03:56.609> problem<00:03:56.849> is<00:03:56.970> actually<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.680> problem<00:03:58.680> that

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
this problem is actually a problem that

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.289 
this problem is actually a problem that
people<00:03:59.310> don't<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.459> much<00:03:59.700> answers<00:04:00.090> to

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
people don't have much answers to

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.879 
people don't have much answers to
there's<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.139> whole<00:04:01.349> bunch<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.709> different

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
there's a whole bunch of different

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.259 
there's a whole bunch of different
explanations<00:04:02.669> on<00:04:02.790> what<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.060> could<00:04:03.150> possibly

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
explanations on what it could possibly

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.990 
explanations on what it could possibly
be<00:04:04.579> okay<00:04:05.579> this<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.000> DSC<00:04:06.540> sensor<00:04:06.930> removed

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
be okay this is the DSC sensor removed

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.479 
be okay this is the DSC sensor removed
it<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.299> really<00:04:10.169> dirty<00:04:11.540> extremely<00:04:12.540> dirty<00:04:13.489> has

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
it is really dirty extremely dirty has

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.509 
it is really dirty extremely dirty has
crud<00:04:14.910> all<00:04:15.150> over<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.569> it's<00:04:15.989> actually<00:04:16.349> it<00:04:17.250> seems

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
crud all over it it's actually it seems

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.870 
crud all over it it's actually it seems
like<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.940> magnetize<00:04:18.539> because<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.079> can<00:04:19.469> see

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
like to magnetize because I can see

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.940 
like to magnetize because I can see
I<00:04:20.910> can<00:04:21.600> seize<00:04:21.870> pieces<00:04:22.290> of<00:04:22.410> metal<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.890> are

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
I can seize pieces of metal that are

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.090 
I can seize pieces of metal that are
attached<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.670> a<00:04:23.730> magnetic<00:04:24.150> formation<00:04:25.010> sort<00:04:26.010> of

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
attached in a magnetic formation sort of

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.700 
attached in a magnetic formation sort of
made<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.400> up<00:04:26.520> magnetic<00:04:26.880> formation<00:04:27.540> but<00:04:27.780> you

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
made that up magnetic formation but you

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.410 
made that up magnetic formation but you
know<00:04:28.800> how<00:04:28.920> stuff<00:04:29.490> it's<00:04:29.670> attracted<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.270> looks

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
know how stuff it's attracted it looks

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.900 
know how stuff it's attracted it looks
like<00:04:30.710> it's<00:04:31.710> like<00:04:31.830> spidering<00:04:32.400> off<00:04:32.550> at<00:04:32.730> one

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
like it's like spidering off at one

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.590 
like it's like spidering off at one
point<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:34.350> can<00:04:34.530> see<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.950> in<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.700> video<00:04:35.970> it's

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
point you can see it in the video it's

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.900 
point you can see it in the video it's
right<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.960> middle<00:04:37.170> of<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.700> so<00:04:38.700> I'm<00:04:38.790> going

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
right in the middle of that so I'm going

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.350 
right in the middle of that so I'm going
to<00:04:38.940> clean<00:04:39.120> this<00:04:39.150> off<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:40.550> put<00:04:41.550> some<00:04:41.730> towels<00:04:41.970> on

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
to clean this off I put some towels on

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.120 
to clean this off I put some towels on
the<00:04:43.220> brake<00:04:44.220> pad<00:04:44.490> because<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:46.010> want<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.040> be

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
the brake pad because I want to be

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.620 
the brake pad because I want to be
spraying<00:04:47.400> an<00:04:47.550> ammonia<00:04:47.880> based<00:04:48.030> cleaner<00:04:48.450> this

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
spraying an ammonia based cleaner this

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.790 
spraying an ammonia based cleaner this
is<00:04:48.780> actually<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.170> windshields<00:04:51.500> it's<00:04:52.500> glass

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
is actually for windshields it's glass

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.430 
is actually for windshields it's glass
cleaner<00:04:53.420> I'm<00:04:54.420> just<00:04:54.540> going<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.690> use<00:04:54.810> that<00:04:55.020> for

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
cleaner I'm just going to use that for

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.320 
cleaner I'm just going to use that for
it's<00:04:55.650> not<00:04:55.890> intense<00:04:56.190> as<00:04:56.460> ammonia<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.180> so

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
it's not intense as ammonia in it so

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.550 
it's not intense as ammonia in it so
it's<00:04:57.450> going<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.630> penetrate<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.990> little<00:04:58.230> bit<00:04:58.350> but

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
it's going to penetrate a little bit but

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.510 
it's going to penetrate a little bit but
it's<00:04:58.680> not<00:04:58.710> gonna<00:04:58.940> doing<00:04:59.940> actual<00:05:00.180> damage<00:05:01.520> okay

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
it's not gonna doing actual damage okay

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.550 
it's not gonna doing actual damage okay
so<00:05:02.580> I'm<00:05:02.790> gonna<00:05:02.910> clean<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.240> off<00:05:03.480> it's<00:05:03.990> really

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
so I'm gonna clean this off it's really

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.870 
so I'm gonna clean this off it's really
dirty<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.890> I<00:05:05.040> think<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.460> probably<00:05:05.670> the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
dirty and I think this is probably the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.120 
dirty and I think this is probably the
issue<00:05:06.000> why<00:05:06.330> it's<00:05:07.290> tripping<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.740> sensor

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
issue why it's tripping the sensor

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.030 
issue why it's tripping the sensor
because<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.790> can't<00:05:09.060> get<00:05:09.150> any<00:05:09.210> readings<00:05:10.040> I'm

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
because it can't get any readings I'm

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.380 
because it can't get any readings I'm
not<00:05:11.160> sure<00:05:11.280> exactly<00:05:11.520> how<00:05:11.790> it<00:05:11.880> gets<00:05:12.000> readings

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
not sure exactly how it gets readings

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.310 
not sure exactly how it gets readings
but<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:14.730> most<00:05:15.030> likely<00:05:15.150> needs<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.870> clean

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
but it it most likely needs to be clean

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.370 
but it it most likely needs to be clean
to<00:05:16.980> get<00:05:17.130> an<00:05:17.220> accurate<00:05:17.580> reading<00:05:18.230> okay<00:05:19.230> I'm

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
to get an accurate reading okay I'm

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.550 
to get an accurate reading okay I'm
going<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.530> spray<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.860> down<00:05:19.890> and<00:05:20.490> then<00:05:21.470> put<00:05:22.470> it

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
going to spray it down and then put it

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.370 
going to spray it down and then put it
back<00:05:22.590> in<00:05:22.710> put<00:05:23.340> some<00:05:23.900> anti-seize<00:05:24.900> on<00:05:25.790> this<00:05:27.380> and

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
back in put some anti-seize on this and

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.540 
back in put some anti-seize on this and
put<00:05:28.530> some<00:05:28.740> anti-seize<00:05:29.340> on<00:05:29.640> here<00:05:31.280> there<00:05:32.280> we<00:05:32.370> go

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
put some anti-seize on here there we go

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.450 
put some anti-seize on here there we go
there's<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.000> anti-seize<00:05:33.510> can<00:05:34.340> and<00:05:35.340> I'll

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
there's the anti-seize can and I'll

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.730 
there's the anti-seize can and I'll
screw<00:05:35.760> it<00:05:35.790> back<00:05:36.000> down<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.540> hopefully<00:05:37.350> lights

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
screw it back down and hopefully lights

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.130 
screw it back down and hopefully lights
will<00:05:37.860> go<00:05:37.980> off<00:05:38.990> okay

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.230 

okay<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.770> got<00:05:43.980> the<00:05:44.070> wheel<00:05:44.220> back<00:05:44.400> on<00:05:44.610> sensors

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
okay I got the wheel back on sensors

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.570 
okay I got the wheel back on sensors
been<00:05:45.420> cleaned<00:05:46.550> cars<00:05:47.550> down<00:05:47.880> safely<00:05:49.490> all<00:05:50.490> right

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
been cleaned cars down safely all right

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.650 
been cleaned cars down safely all right
I<00:05:52.520> think<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:53.820> might<00:05:54.000> fix<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.330> problem

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
I think this might fix the problem

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.620 
I think this might fix the problem
there's<00:05:54.840> also<00:05:55.020> sensors<00:05:55.740> in<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.920> back<00:05:56.070> so<00:05:56.630> I'll

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
there's also sensors in the back so I'll

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.380 
there's also sensors in the back so I'll
have<00:05:57.780> to<00:05:57.870> clean<00:05:58.050> those<00:05:58.200> another<00:05:58.500> day<00:05:58.710> but<00:05:59.390> this

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
have to clean those another day but this

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.990 
have to clean those another day but this
is<00:06:00.480> definitely<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:00.840> good<00:06:00.930> step<00:06:01.200> but<00:06:01.880> step<00:06:02.880> in

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
is definitely a good step but step in

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.910 
is definitely a good step but step in
the<00:06:03.060> direction<00:06:03.210> of<00:06:03.450> getting<00:06:03.690> these<00:06:03.810> things

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
the direction of getting these things

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.160 
the direction of getting these things
you<00:06:04.920> know<00:06:05.300> these<00:06:06.300> things<00:06:06.510> all<00:06:06.720> done<00:06:06.930> and

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
you know these things all done and

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.890 
you know these things all done and
cleaned<00:06:07.530> up

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.750 

I<00:06:09.930> can<00:06:10.350> probably<00:06:10.500> reset<00:06:10.920> the<00:06:11.010> computer<00:06:11.160> to<00:06:11.580> see

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
I can probably reset the computer to see

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.780 
I can probably reset the computer to see
if<00:06:11.790> it's<00:06:12.560> I'll<00:06:13.560> turn<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:13.890> lights<00:06:14.100> off<00:06:14.280> but<00:06:14.580> I

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
if it's I'll turn the lights off but I

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.720 
if it's I'll turn the lights off but I
can't<00:06:15.000> even<00:06:15.450> access<00:06:15.600> these<00:06:15.990> lights<00:06:16.230> with<00:06:16.730> the

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
can't even access these lights with the

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.460 
can't even access these lights with the
interface<00:06:18.360> thing<00:06:18.660> that<00:06:18.750> I<00:06:18.810> have<00:06:19.020> I<00:06:19.050> have<00:06:19.320> the

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
interface thing that I have I have the

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.300 
interface thing that I have I have the
movi<00:06:19.950> Pro<00:06:21.410> Bluetooth<00:06:22.410> module<00:06:22.650> that<00:06:23.040> you<00:06:23.130> put

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
movi Pro Bluetooth module that you put

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.310 
movi Pro Bluetooth module that you put
the<00:06:23.490> put<00:06:23.700> into<00:06:23.880> the<00:06:23.970> obd2<00:06:24.180> port<00:06:24.480> and<00:06:25.110> it<00:06:25.200> goes

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
the put into the obd2 port and it goes

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.860 
the put into the obd2 port and it goes
to<00:06:25.470> your<00:06:25.560> computer<00:06:26.390> so<00:06:27.390> I'll<00:06:27.450> see<00:06:27.570> if<00:06:27.630> I<00:06:27.720> can

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
to your computer so I'll see if I can

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.630 
to your computer so I'll see if I can
mess<00:06:27.990> around<00:06:28.110> with<00:06:28.320> that<00:06:28.380> but<00:06:29.100> as<00:06:29.220> far<00:06:29.430> as<00:06:29.460> I'm

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
mess around with that but as far as I'm

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.160 
mess around with that but as far as I'm
concerned<00:06:30.030> this<00:06:30.270> sensor<00:06:30.630> cleaning<00:06:30.990> for<00:06:31.140> the

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
concerned this sensor cleaning for the
