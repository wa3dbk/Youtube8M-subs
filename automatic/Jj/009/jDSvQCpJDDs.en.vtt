00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.170
 hello with this video I would like to try 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.150
 answer the question what is a 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.540
 beginner with guitar 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.400
 this is because many people are mine 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.289
 students he met physically but 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.770
 also people who write to me from all over 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.840
 Italy 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.000
 they ask me but what is my condition 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.730
 i am a beginner i am a level 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.250
 intermediate level at what level and why 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.140
 they wish to understand at what point of the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.870
 route have arrived and is one 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.159
 absolutely legitimate request e 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.199
 understandable but not always simple 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.100
 catalog people by level then 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.080
 which 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.510
 what are the discriminating factors to understand 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.909
 if we are talking about a beginner of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.400
 an intermediate level or less than that 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.780
 obviously there are no limitations to 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.699
 rigid and impossible to have so 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.799
 precisely of the boundaries that 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.780
 allow to insert a person in 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.390
 definitive manner either in one or the other 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.340
 in the other category they are necessarily 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:14.539
 flexible categories in my personal 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:17.570
 experience use some say so 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.579
 some sample topics for just 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.509
 evaluate this issue 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.969
 one is certainly that of the bars 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.899
 here I use the question of bars and 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.520
 just because a guitarist 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.829
 beginner hardly succeeds in 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.829
 master the bars on the handle to make them 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.509
 play clean and so have 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.829
 therefore a definitive mastery of 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.840
 this technique 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.439
 those who are able to do so outsole 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.450
 bars with absolute fluency and absolute 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.079
 mastery and from my point of view it is 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.490
 exited from that condition precisely of 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.249
 beginner and can be counted 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.710
 reasonably in an intermediate level 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:01.899
 therefore a criterion surely are i 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.310
 bar another criterion I use for 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.100
 evaluate the level of the guitarists and the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.380
 knowledge of the agreements that is if a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.580
 guitarist only knows the chords 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.490
 in first position 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.770
 some barrÃ¨ but don't know for example 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.380
 the seventh agreements 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.700
 suspended solids power races and others 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.140
 forms of agreements 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.930
 from my point of view it is however a 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.580
 beginner guitarist because he has one 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.710
 however, a restricted knowledge of the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.330
 agreements and whenever it is found 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.420
 in front of a song that comes out 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.310
 minimally from this system of the former 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.280
 simple agreements you will find difficulties 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.230
 then a level guitarist 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.750
 intermediate that is no longer beginner has 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.970
 a little bit more knowledge 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.460
 of families and types of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.220
 agreements 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.080
 here is more generally a guitarist of 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.520
 intermediate level then a guitarist 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.230
 more evolved to a range of modes 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.390
 accompanying much greater respect 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.390
 to a beginner a beginner 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.550
 always use the same few rhythms 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.250
 played flat with the strum 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.280
 flat and linear a guitarist more 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.500
 evolved uses bass and bass notes 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.170
 alternated blocks of the right hand 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.650
 left accents whoever has the most ne 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.060
 put 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.570
 ok so there's a big difference 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.350
 in terms of experience e 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.380
 self-sufficiency in the techniques of 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.720
 accompaniment personally I have 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.060
 developed a course called course 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.280
 intermediate just to allow 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.200
 to do this step, that is, to leave yourself 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.970
 definitively behind the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.430
 beginner condition 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.630
 all are contained in the course 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.390
 these topics I told you about 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.370
 now then how to switch to having the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.970
 definitive mastery over the bars 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.830
 knowledge of new and other agreements but 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.010
 especially the techniques of 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.780
 accompanying a large range of 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.540
 accompanying method to give 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.520
 finally a vast vocabulary to yours 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.890
 way to play then if you want to pass 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.660
 finally from being a beginner 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.690
 he is now a level guitarist 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.300
 intermediate or in any case more advanced not 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.340
 wait you do this course see you 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.540
 there so finally after doing 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.830
 this passage 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.830
 Hello and see you soon
