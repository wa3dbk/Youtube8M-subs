00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
one and there's the time one if I'm

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.200 
one and there's the time one if I'm
correct<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:59.070> able<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.609> stack<00:00:59.940> them

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
correct you're able to stack them

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.209 
correct you're able to stack them
together<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.649> give<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> more

experience<00:01:02.850> don't<00:01:03.059> take<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.359> hundred<00:01:03.690> percent

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
experience don't take my hundred percent

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.359 
experience don't take my hundred percent
word<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.769> that's<00:01:05.100> possible

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
word on that but I think that's possible

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.760 
word on that but I think that's possible
but<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> choose<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.350> from<00:01:07.500> them

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
but if you have to choose one from them

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.460 
but if you have to choose one from them
the<00:01:08.369> pair<00:01:08.580> win<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.600> pier<00:01:09.810> win<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the pair win on the pier win one is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.789 
the pair win on the pier win one is
weaker<00:01:11.369> depending<00:01:12.330> how<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> play<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
weaker depending how much you play the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.859 
weaker depending how much you play the
other<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.700> cost<00:01:15.150> efficient<00:01:15.689> time

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
other one will be cost efficient time

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
other one will be cost efficient time
one<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.560> cost<00:01:16.799> efficient<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.520> your

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
one will be more cost efficient for your

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.179 
one will be more cost efficient for your
RP<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.869> sink<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.439> money<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> of

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
RP you have to sink some money and of

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.330 
RP you have to sink some money and of
course<00:01:20.549> depending<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.570> much<00:01:21.750> time<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> have

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
course depending how much time you have

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.249 
course depending how much time you have
but<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.759> makes<00:01:23.970> everything<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.200> much

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
but this it makes everything so much

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.219 
but this it makes everything so much
faster<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> champion<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> should

if you end the game before seven minutes
this<00:02:37.480> will<00:02:37.660> give<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.050> significantly<00:02:38.890> less

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
this will give you significantly less

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.350 
this will give you significantly less
experience<00:02:40.620> I'm<00:02:41.620> not<00:02:41.860> sure<00:02:41.920> about<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.489> IP<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
experience I'm not sure about the IP the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.120 
experience I'm not sure about the IP the
less<00:02:43.569> experienced<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.800> have<00:02:44.980> to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
less experienced in this you have to

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.880 
less experienced in this you have to
always<00:02:45.280> stall<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.060> bit<00:02:46.300> before<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.680> end

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
always stall for a bit before you end

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.640 
always stall for a bit before you end
the<00:02:48.040> game<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.489> this<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.239> really<00:02:49.420> important<00:02:50.080> as

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
the game and this is really important as

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.979 
the game and this is really important as
for<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:50.980> starting<00:02:51.430> items<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:52.330> need<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.750> take

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
for the starting items you need to take

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.130 
for the starting items you need to take
the<00:02:53.200> e<00:02:53.230> curve<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.830> five<00:02:54.280> potions<00:02:55.060> five<00:02:55.930> health

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the e curve and five potions five health

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.370 
the e curve and five potions five health
potions<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.799> for<00:02:57.160> many<00:02:57.280> potions<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:58.380> haven't

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
potions and for many potions I haven't

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.080 
potions and for many potions I haven't
tried<00:02:59.650> like<00:02:59.950> Dorrans<00:03:00.280> blade<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.850> Doran

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
tried like Dorrans blade and Doran

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.550 
tried like Dorrans blade and Doran
swings<00:03:01.390> start<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:01.959> they<00:03:02.080> think<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.380> Iker

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
swings start but they think the Iker

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.729 
swings start but they think the Iker
gives<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> most<00:03:03.580> benefit<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.470> time

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
gives you the most benefit for the time

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.009 
gives you the most benefit for the time
as<00:03:06.069> also<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> think<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.390> has<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.600> really<00:03:07.870> high

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
as also I think it has a really high

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.900 
as also I think it has a really high
duration<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:08.980> don't<00:03:09.250> need<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.580> really

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
duration so you don't need to really

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.910 
duration so you don't need to really
change<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.420> or<00:03:10.569> anything<00:03:10.840> during<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.319> game<00:03:11.590> at

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
change it or anything during the game at

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.820 
change it or anything during the game at
least<00:03:12.190> once<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.660> like<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.110> said<00:03:14.170> if<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.590> die

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
least once and like I said if you die

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.890 
least once and like I said if you die
you<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.280> simply<00:03:15.519> teleport<00:03:16.150> back<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.660> base

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
you just simply teleport back to base

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.940 
you just simply teleport back to base
and<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:19.030> kinda<00:03:19.390> ends<00:03:19.570> up<00:03:19.660> my<00:03:19.870> power<00:03:20.560> leveling

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
and this kinda ends up my power leveling

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.430 
and this kinda ends up my power leveling
