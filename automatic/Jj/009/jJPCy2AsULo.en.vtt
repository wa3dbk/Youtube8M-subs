00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
I got to do some work to the bike all

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.490 
I got to do some work to the bike all
kinds<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.230> my<00:00:10.260> damn<00:00:11.210> garage<00:00:12.210> here<00:00:12.690> but

108 UK 195 65 17 pretty much it's a soft

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.130 
108 UK 195 65 17 pretty much it's a soft
compound<00:00:24.920> work<00:00:25.920> really<00:00:26.460> well<00:00:26.779> from<00:00:27.779> some<00:00:28.050> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
compound work really well from some of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.950 
compound work really well from some of
the<00:00:28.199> reports<00:00:28.650> I've<00:00:28.830> gotten<00:00:29.539> but<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> what

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the reports I've gotten but this is what

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
the reports I've gotten but this is what
you<00:00:31.080> guys<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.560> wanted<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you guys really wanted to see the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.100 
you guys really wanted to see the
difference<00:00:33.030> between<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.450> full<00:00:33.660> floating

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
difference between the full floating

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.979 
difference between the full floating
rotor<00:00:34.350> that's<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:34.950> race<00:00:35.130> bike<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
rotor that's all my race bike here and a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.130 
rotor that's all my race bike here and a
floating<00:00:37.680> rotor<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> factory<00:00:39.140> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
floating rotor from the factory the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.569 
floating rotor from the factory the
difference<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.329> Aprilia<00:00:42.899> rsv4

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
difference is so this is my Aprilia rsv4

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.479 
difference is so this is my Aprilia rsv4
2010<00:00:44.719> okay<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.960> has<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.320> 7,000<00:00:47.039> miles<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
2010 okay it has about 7,000 miles on it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.130 
2010 okay it has about 7,000 miles on it
but<00:00:47.960> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.559> factory<00:00:50.190> floating<00:00:50.610> rotor

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
but this is a factory floating rotor

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.310 
but this is a factory floating rotor
okay

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
okay

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
okay
and<00:00:52.410> uh<00:00:52.550> I<00:00:53.550> try<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> shake<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:56.510> let<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> heaven

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and uh I try to shake it let the heaven

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.010 
and uh I try to shake it let the heaven
see<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.410> moves<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:59.489> little<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.750> tell

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
see it moves very little as you can tell

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.920 
see it moves very little as you can tell
it<00:01:01.710> doesn't<00:01:02.699> move<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.180> doesn't<00:01:03.210> make<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> sound

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it doesn't move it doesn't make a sound

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.200 
it doesn't move it doesn't make a sound
when<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.199> try<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> move<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> lot

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
when you try to move it so you get a lot

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.770 
when you try to move it so you get a lot
of<00:01:06.299> brake<00:01:06.479> drag<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.260> me<00:01:07.560> rolling<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.780> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of brake drag this is me rolling it you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.149 
of brake drag this is me rolling it you
can<00:01:09.930> hear<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.170> stops<00:01:11.040> okay<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.210> does<00:01:12.390> about

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
can hear it stops okay it does about

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
can hear it stops okay it does about
rotation<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> half<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.850> stops<00:01:15.150> okay

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
rotation and a half and it stops okay

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
rotation and a half and it stops okay
here's<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.409> full<00:01:16.710> floating<00:01:17.299> on<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:19.640> race<00:01:20.640> bike

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
here's a full floating on my race bike

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.240 
here's a full floating on my race bike
here<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.630> zucchini<00:01:21.840> chicks<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.439> 750<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
here is the zucchini chicks and 750 so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
here is the zucchini chicks and 750 so
when<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> buttons

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
when I do this you can see the buttons

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.690 
when I do this you can see the buttons
moving<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.630> both<00:01:27.869> sides

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
moving here on both sides

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.080 
moving here on both sides
you<00:01:29.700> start<00:01:29.970> aside

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.420 

so<00:01:34.090> here's<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.860> history<00:01:35.860> difference<00:01:36.189> in<00:01:36.310> how

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
so here's the history difference in how

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.510 
so here's the history difference in how
they<00:01:36.580> roll

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.580 

come<00:01:45.520> over<00:01:45.670> here<00:01:48.690> that<00:01:49.690> thing<00:01:49.930> stops<00:01:50.259> rolling

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
come over here that thing stops rolling

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.260 
come over here that thing stops rolling
before<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.190> one<00:01:51.369> does<00:01:51.580> but<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.970> can<00:01:52.119> hear

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
before this one does but you can hear

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.570 
before this one does but you can hear
all<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.539> noise<00:01:52.750> from<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.860> rotors<00:01:54.220> moving

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
all the noise from the rotors moving

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.320 
all the noise from the rotors moving
around<00:01:54.850> on<00:01:55.330> there<00:01:55.570> for<00:01:55.750> rotation
