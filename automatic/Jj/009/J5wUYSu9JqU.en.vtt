00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.120
 the shirt is a basic shirt like 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.310

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.069
 nothing this tape that sewn up as 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.720

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.900

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.480
 white jeans good to see you for 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.489

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.310

 How much was it worth that I do not remember?

 It has the label on but I think 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.120

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.340
