okay<00:00:02.969> at<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.150> time<00:00:03.420> we<00:00:03.689> are<00:00:03.810> going<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.140> draw

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
okay at this time we are going to draw

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.249 
okay at this time we are going to draw
the<00:00:05.040> shadow<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.630> wire-framed<00:00:07.260> chair

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:11.259 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.049 

I<00:00:11.290> think<00:00:12.009> we<00:00:12.099> should<00:00:12.250> already<00:00:12.459> know<00:00:12.549> how<00:00:12.700> to<00:00:12.879> do

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
I think we should already know how to do

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.720 
I think we should already know how to do
this<00:00:13.240> I've<00:00:13.809> let<00:00:14.320> it<00:00:14.349> out<00:00:14.500> simply<00:00:14.950> in<00:00:15.160> pencil

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
this I've let it out simply in pencil

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.990 
this I've let it out simply in pencil
and<00:00:15.969> I'm<00:00:16.630> designing<00:00:17.109> the<00:00:17.529> shadow<00:00:18.009> to<00:00:18.189> meet

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
and I'm designing the shadow to meet

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.890 
and I'm designing the shadow to meet
certain<00:00:19.680> criteria<00:00:20.680> I<00:00:21.430> know<00:00:21.759> that<00:00:22.090> I<00:00:22.119> don't

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
certain criteria I know that I don't

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.720 
certain criteria I know that I don't
want<00:00:23.079> the<00:00:23.199> lines<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.529> overlap<00:00:23.949> and<00:00:24.310> I<00:00:24.640> know

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
want the lines to overlap and I know

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.570 
want the lines to overlap and I know
that<00:00:24.970> I<00:00:25.029> do<00:00:25.150> want<00:00:25.750> to<00:00:25.840> see<00:00:26.289> things<00:00:26.980> stop<00:00:27.369> and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
that I do want to see things stop and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.269 
that I do want to see things stop and
start<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.119> certain<00:00:28.449> places<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:30.039> ease<00:00:30.250> of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
start in certain places for ease of

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.350 
start in certain places for ease of
learning<00:00:31.089> had<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:31.599> do<00:00:31.750> this<00:00:31.929> if<00:00:32.199> nothing<00:00:32.349> else

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
learning had to do this if nothing else

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.340 
learning had to do this if nothing else
the<00:00:34.360> first<00:00:34.690> thing<00:00:34.960> that<00:00:34.989> I'm<00:00:35.260> going<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.680> do<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.410 

start<00:00:41.350> with<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.620> seat<00:00:42.430> area<00:00:42.699> because<00:00:43.180> it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
start with the seat area because it

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.889 
start with the seat area because it
represents<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.620> simple<00:00:45.550> cube<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.660> we<00:00:46.750> already

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
represents a simple cube and we already

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.590 
represents a simple cube and we already
know<00:00:47.370> excuse<00:00:48.370> me<00:00:48.520> we<00:00:48.699> already<00:00:48.969> know<00:00:49.120> how<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:49.420> do

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
know excuse me we already know how to do

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.849 
know excuse me we already know how to do
this<00:00:52.379> starting<00:00:53.379> um<00:00:53.850> back<00:00:54.850> at<00:00:55.149> leg<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.590> will

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
this starting um back at leg a I will

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:06.480 
this starting um back at leg a I will
pull<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.340> flagpole<00:00:57.670> shadow<00:00:58.269> a<00:01:02.489> b<00:01:03.489> c<00:01:03.789> and<00:01:04.600> d<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:06.070> i

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
pull a flagpole shadow a b c and d and i

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.550 
pull a flagpole shadow a b c and d and i
pretty<00:01:06.820> much<00:01:06.880> already<00:01:07.149> chosen<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.750> length<00:01:08.170> I

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
pretty much already chosen the length I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.010 
pretty much already chosen the length I
know<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.610> want<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.440> wind<00:01:11.440> up<00:01:11.679> in<00:01:11.890> here

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
know that I want it to wind up in here

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.580 
know that I want it to wind up in here
so<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.080> can<00:01:14.289> work<00:01:14.470> backwards<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.459> here's<00:01:15.849> my

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so I can work backwards and here's my

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.809 
so I can work backwards and here's my
son's<00:01:17.590> ray<00:01:17.920> if<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.729> go<00:01:18.910> to<00:01:18.970> be<00:01:20.700> keeping<00:01:21.700> that

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
son's ray if I go to be keeping that

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:30.589 
son's ray if I go to be keeping that
somewhat<00:01:22.599> parallel<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:25.450> right<00:01:25.720> there<00:01:27.239> C<00:01:28.739> and

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:30.599 
somewhat parallel it's right there C and

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:35.250 
somewhat parallel it's right there C and
D

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.250 

and<00:01:35.950> what<00:01:36.130> do<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.280> know<00:01:36.970> if<00:01:37.420> all<00:01:37.630> these<00:01:37.810> dots<00:01:38.050> out

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
and what do I know if all these dots out

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.790 
and what do I know if all these dots out
here<00:01:38.590> random<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.730> know<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.470> seat<00:01:41.770> goes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
here random I know that the seat goes

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.110 
here random I know that the seat goes
from<00:01:42.310> A<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.520> B<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.850> C<00:01:43.060> D<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.930> back<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:45.120> going

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
from A to B to C D and back to a going

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.690 
from A to B to C D and back to a going
down<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.540> leg<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.750> out<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.410> flagpole<00:01:48.040> this

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
down the leg and out the flagpole this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.170 
down the leg and out the flagpole this
is<00:01:48.910> a<00:01:49.210> on<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:49.900> shadow<00:01:50.460> goes<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.640> B<00:01:51.820> on<00:01:52.030> the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
is a on the shadow goes to B on the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.290 
is a on the shadow goes to B on the
shadow<00:01:52.570> goes<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.740> see<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.670> shadow<00:01:55.000> and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
shadow goes to see on this shadow and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.290 
shadow goes to see on this shadow and
goes<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.290> D<00:01:56.620> on<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.950> shadow<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:57.970> right

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
goes to D on the shadow and then right

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.840 
goes to D on the shadow and then right
back<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.740> a<00:02:00.150> so<00:02:01.150> there's<00:02:01.390> my<00:02:01.630> shadow<00:02:02.400> of<00:02:03.400> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
back to a so there's my shadow of the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.900 
back to a so there's my shadow of the
seat<00:02:04.060> now<00:02:04.960> what<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.380> need<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.560> do<00:02:05.830> is<00:02:06.160> draw<00:02:06.670> this

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
seat now what I need to do is draw this

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.410 
seat now what I need to do is draw this
the<00:02:07.300> chair<00:02:07.570> back<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:10.090> really<00:02:10.330> very

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
the chair back and it's really very

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.250 
the chair back and it's really very
simple

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
simple

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.680 
simple
we<00:02:12.070> just<00:02:12.340> need<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.580> extend<00:02:13.300> leg<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.620> leg<00:02:14.880> D

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.500 

so<00:02:19.690> if<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.960> extend<00:02:20.470> leg<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:22.120> don't<00:02:22.300> know<00:02:22.360> how

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
so if I extend leg a I don't know how

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.980 
so if I extend leg a I don't know how
far<00:02:22.780> yet<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.290> needs<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.680> come<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.720> do

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
far yet it needs to come but I can do

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.710 
far yet it needs to come but I can do
this<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.880> make<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.180> meet

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.290 

it<00:02:35.650> should<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:35.980> right<00:02:36.190> there<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.820> need<00:02:40.150> to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
it should be right there now I need to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.160 
it should be right there now I need to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:59.199 
do leg D you just pull this out a little
bit<00:02:45.360> farther<00:02:46.360> again<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.930> don't<00:02:46.990> know<00:02:47.230> how<00:02:47.320> far

do<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.930> connect<00:03:07.030> right<00:03:08.030> there<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:08.989> have<00:03:09.260> the

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
do is connect right there so I have the

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.330 
do is connect right there so I have the
leg<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:10.129> up<00:03:10.900> get<00:03:11.900> connecting<00:03:12.469> across<00:03:12.859> and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
leg going up get connecting across and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.440 
leg going up get connecting across and
then<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.969> comes<00:03:14.269> back<00:03:14.599> down<00:03:15.939> we<00:03:16.939> also<00:03:17.090> have

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
then it comes back down we also have

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.750 
then it comes back down we also have
this<00:03:17.659> horizontal<00:03:19.810> along<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.930> chair<00:03:21.170> back<00:03:21.760> so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
this horizontal along the chair back so

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.520 
this horizontal along the chair back so
I<00:03:22.790> can<00:03:23.239> pull<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.310> sun's<00:03:25.310> ray<00:03:25.609> there<00:03:25.939> on<00:03:26.329> like<00:03:27.290> a

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
I can pull the sun's ray there on like a

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.819 
I can pull the sun's ray there on like a
and<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.340> can<00:03:28.639> pull<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.030> sun's<00:03:29.359> ray<00:03:30.609> here<00:03:31.609> on<00:03:32.829> D

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
and I can pull the sun's ray here on D

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:42.170 
and I can pull the sun's ray here on D
and<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.609> connect<00:03:34.939> those<00:03:35.599> two<00:03:36.109> dots

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.800 

so<00:03:42.780> there<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.470> shadow<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:45.390> back<00:03:45.569> of

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
so there is the shadow of the back of

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.429 
so there is the shadow of the back of
the<00:03:45.930> chair

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
the chair

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.110 
the chair
all<00:03:47.069> right<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.340> make<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.640> little<00:03:47.819> bit<00:03:48.000> more

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
all right to make this a little bit more

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.569 
all right to make this a little bit more
clear<00:03:48.500> let's<00:03:49.760> say<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.420> chair<00:03:51.870> back<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.709> a

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.929 

translucent<00:03:56.599> green<00:03:57.599> glass<00:03:58.110> striped

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
translucent green glass striped

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.990 
translucent green glass striped
vertically<00:03:59.939> a<00:04:00.209> lot<00:04:00.750> parallel<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:02.370> leg<00:04:02.609> I

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
vertically a lot parallel to the leg I

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.530 
vertically a lot parallel to the leg I
know<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:04.319> here's<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.519> chair<00:04:05.760> back<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.420> I'm

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
know that here's the chair back and I'm

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.110 
know that here's the chair back and I'm
going<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.870> stripe<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.650> vertically<00:04:08.400> going

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
going to stripe it vertically going

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.009 
going to stripe it vertically going
parallel<00:04:09.540> with<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:11.609> legs<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.209> sides<00:04:14.750> if<00:04:15.750> the

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
parallel with the legs the sides if the

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.110 
parallel with the legs the sides if the
seat<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:19.489> Greenglass<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.710> it<00:04:22.710> would<00:04:23.010> be<00:04:23.280> if<00:04:23.910> it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
seat is Greenglass and it would be if it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.170 
seat is Greenglass and it would be if it
I<00:04:24.330> decided<00:04:24.870> it's<00:04:25.169> striped<00:04:25.850> parallel<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
I decided it's striped parallel to the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.529 
I decided it's striped parallel to the
sides<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:29.330> can<00:04:30.330> draw<00:04:30.449> that<00:04:30.539> in<00:04:30.870> there<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:32.539> the

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
sides I can draw that in there and the

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.180 
sides I can draw that in there and the
seat<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.080> under<00:04:34.470> here<00:04:34.620> this<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.889> going<00:04:35.070> to

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
seat is under here this is going to

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.740 
seat is under here this is going to
overlap<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.820> be<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:35.970> little<00:04:36.180> bit<00:04:36.270> confusing

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
overlap and be a little bit confusing

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:47.460 
overlap and be a little bit confusing
but<00:04:37.740> those<00:04:38.010> stripes<00:04:38.840> would<00:04:39.840> be<00:04:40.050> doing<00:04:40.380> this

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.340 

following<00:04:48.370> that<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.810> if<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.080> was<00:04:50.320> a

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
following that so if this was a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.490 
following that so if this was a
translucent<00:04:51.250> glass<00:04:53.730> chair<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.990> would<00:04:56.290> be

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
translucent glass chair this would be

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.350 
translucent glass chair this would be
the<00:04:57.310> stripes<00:04:57.640> of<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:57.910> glass<00:05:02.940> okay<00:05:03.940> here<00:05:04.180> is

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
the stripes of the glass okay here is

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.280 
the stripes of the glass okay here is
the<00:05:04.950> chair<00:05:05.950> and<00:05:06.250> shadow<00:05:06.580> traced<00:05:07.180> onto<00:05:07.600> flimsy

the original direction and flip it and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.970 
the original direction and flip it and
there's<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.230> shadow<00:05:14.410> go<00:05:14.650> in<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.860> other
