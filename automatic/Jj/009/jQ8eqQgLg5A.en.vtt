internet<00:04:59.680> you<00:04:59.860> don't<00:05:00.490> need<00:05:00.810> Java<00:05:01.810> as<00:05:02.440> such<00:05:03.039> I

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
internet you don't need Java as such I

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.870 
internet you don't need Java as such I
mean<00:05:04.599> it<00:05:04.810> we'd<00:05:05.560> like<00:05:05.740> just<00:05:06.130> disabling<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.760> on

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
mean it we'd like just disabling it on

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
got like if they've got a good server or

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.870 
got like if they've got a good server or
not<00:05:35.240> might<00:05:36.240> take<00:05:36.480> a<00:05:36.510> while<00:05:36.720> or<00:05:37.640> probably<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.730> bit

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
not might take a while or probably a bit

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.790 
not might take a while or probably a bit
longer<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.630> just<00:05:39.840> like<00:05:40.140> depends<00:05:40.530> on<00:05:40.590> their
