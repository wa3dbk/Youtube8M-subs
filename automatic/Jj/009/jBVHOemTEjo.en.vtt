we designed and built this drift boat as

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.370 
we designed and built this drift boat as
an<00:00:25.640> answer<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.240> a<00:00:26.270> problem<00:00:26.509> we<00:00:26.750> had<00:00:26.930> which<00:00:27.140> was

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
an answer to a problem we had which was

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.190 
an answer to a problem we had which was
that<00:00:27.560> our<00:00:27.710> heart<00:00:28.460> drift<00:00:28.759> boats<00:00:28.970> would<00:00:29.720> not<00:00:29.930> go

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
that our heart drift boats would not go

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.530 
that our heart drift boats would not go
in<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.560> shallow<00:00:30.829> rough<00:00:31.250> technical<00:00:32.180> streams

in the shallow rough technical streams
that<00:00:32.900> we<00:00:32.989> wanted<00:00:33.260> a<00:00:33.290> fish<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:33.770> what<00:00:34.220> we<00:00:34.340> did<00:00:34.550> is

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
that we wanted a fish and what we did is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.400 
that we wanted a fish and what we did is
we<00:00:34.699> designed<00:00:35.059> a<00:00:35.420> boat<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:35.960> would<00:00:36.170> do

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
we designed a boat that would do

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.990 
we designed a boat that would do
everything<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:37.040> a<00:00:37.100> heart<00:00:37.340> boat<00:00:37.579> would<00:00:37.790> do

everything that a heart boat would do

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.729 
everything that a heart boat would do
but<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.510> would<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.839> it<00:00:38.960> in<00:00:39.080> an<00:00:39.199> inflatable

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739
