00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.430 

the<00:00:02.580> end<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.000> ink<00:00:03.149> sketches<00:00:03.540> we<00:00:03.899> tried<00:00:04.170> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
the end of the ink sketches we tried to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.430 
the end of the ink sketches we tried to
draw<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:05.040> cube<00:00:05.569> now<00:00:06.569> what<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> same

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
draw a cube now what to do the same

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.709 
draw a cube now what to do the same
again<00:00:07.830> i'm<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.940> try<00:00:09.590> exactly<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> same

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
again i'm going to try exactly the same

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.300 
again i'm going to try exactly the same
effects<00:00:14.839> but<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.990> tried<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
effects but we tried to get with the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.150 
effects but we tried to get with the
cube<00:00:18.050> in<00:00:19.050> ink<00:00:22.279> this<00:00:23.279> time<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.699> pencil<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
cube in ink this time with pencil and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.050 
cube in ink this time with pencil and
reasonably<00:00:26.160> graded<00:00:26.699> shading<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.820> see

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
reasonably graded shading you can see

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.999 
reasonably graded shading you can see
the<00:00:30.210> pencil<00:00:30.630> point<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.349> beginning<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> lose

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the pencil point is beginning to lose

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.720 
the pencil point is beginning to lose
its<00:00:32.250> tip<00:00:32.550> there<00:00:33.110> now<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> side<00:00:34.530> was<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> dark

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
its tip there now this side was the dark

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
its tip there now this side was the dark
side<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> ink<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.530> top<00:00:38.059> was<00:00:39.350> slightly

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
side with the ink the top was slightly

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
side with the ink the top was slightly
darker<00:00:40.829> than<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.129> front<00:00:41.460> side<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
darker than this front side because the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
darker than this front side because the
light<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.450> coming<00:00:43.050> from<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.500> left<00:00:43.530> hand<00:00:43.950> side

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
light is coming from the left hand side

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670 
light is coming from the left hand side
and<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.329> striking<00:00:45.960> pretty<00:00:46.440> well

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and going to be striking pretty well

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.119 
and going to be striking pretty well
that<00:00:47.489> left<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.239> side<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.710> time<00:00:49.739> I'm

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that left on side there this time I'm

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.660 
that left on side there this time I'm
just<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:51.090> lightly<00:00:51.960> shade<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.430> top

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
just going to very lightly shade the top

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:27.440 
just going to very lightly shade the top
surface

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.179 

although<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.289> flat<00:01:28.619> surface<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.689> flat<00:01:31.189> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
although a flat surface is flat it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.950 
although a flat surface is flat it
doesn't<00:01:32.549> mean<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.759> shading<00:01:33.420> has<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> be

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
doesn't mean that shading has to be

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.270 
doesn't mean that shading has to be
exactly<00:01:34.619> evil<00:01:37.039> because<00:01:38.299> no<00:01:39.299> flat<00:01:39.570> surface<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
exactly evil because no flat surface is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:49.669 
exactly evil because no flat surface is
perfectly<00:01:41.280> flat<00:01:47.210> now<00:01:48.210> i'm<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> try<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
perfectly flat now i'm going to try the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.020 
perfectly flat now i'm going to try the
right-hand<00:01:50.130> side<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.759> was

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
right-hand side and this was

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.080 
right-hand side and this was
considerably<00:01:51.719> darker<00:01:51.929> than<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.789> top<00:01:53.789> surface

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
considerably darker than the top surface

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.940 
considerably darker than the top surface
in<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.590> ink<00:01:55.590> drawing<00:01:57.319> start<00:01:58.319> with<00:01:58.500> vertical

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
in the ink drawing start with vertical

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:12.730 
in the ink drawing start with vertical
lines<00:02:03.619> now<00:02:04.729> move<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.050 

will<00:02:13.740> strengthen<00:02:14.070> ipsum<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:16.790> what<00:02:17.790> about

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
will strengthen ipsum not what about

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:27.220 
will strengthen ipsum not what about
that<00:02:19.460> slip

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.519 

that<00:02:27.800> we<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:28.129> a<00:02:28.159> cube
