00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.020
 hello we are on Monday and we start 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:21.669
 right away with a new new tutorial 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.250
 let's talk about keyframes, then zoom and 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.529
 what the final cut pro hicks is 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.250
 called ken burns effect ie 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.810
 that effect of zooming in and zooming out 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.890
 or move to the right to the left 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.579
 top down with the in post 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.100
 production therefore not through stamps 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.250
 of the movement sliders 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.590
 of the camera but via the post 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.719
 production with go pro studio in many me 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 you asked if it was possible to do it 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.059
 finally I found the time to 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.850
 take ten minutes to show it to you 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.989
 thank and advertise a little too 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.660
 our friend chris whites who a 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.369
 this youtube channel here below and 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.490
 which in fact asked me this question 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.050
 intrigued by the fact if you could 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.039
 to make these zoom effects or not 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.569
 let's start with the video which is a simple one 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.880
 timelapse of passing clouds 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.250
 through precisely saslong 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.259
 the frame is still there are not 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.750
 I don't have women I don't have to travel 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.300
 no type of mechanical means for 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
 move the perfect shot as a 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.950
 I'm interested in moving the recovery 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.660
 we start from the staff directly 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.619
 let's go the step more so that we don't 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.619
 we are wasting time 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.030
 we do not make templates and insert 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.399
 in our timeline 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.539
 the video that is nothing but the time 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.880
 laps of clouds and let's start we want to do 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.800
 a zoom in and a zoom out 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.229
 in this video to give an example 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.110
 so let's start by setting the first one 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.569
 keyframe going to click on the plus e 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.729
 let's choose a point in our timeline 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.349
 where we want the zoom to arrive 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.200
 so here we want the zoom 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:15.040
 we insert another keyframe of course 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:18.909
 arrive at the maximum so then we go up 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.350
 to here and we want to add another 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:27.360
 keyframe the mess 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.760
 to say it again but not too much we go 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.430
 up to here 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.730
 add another keyframe and it 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.050
 move horizontally from here 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.270
 are only examples of course that is 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.960
 I'm showing you let's go here and there 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.340
 move excuse me add a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:58.740
 keyframe and move it here then 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:04.550
 zoom in and zoom out we move to 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.550
 left and then we move to the right 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.030
 obviously in the video you can 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.170
 make any kind of move 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:20.460
 now I'm just showing them to you 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.370
 horizontally vertically the 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.540
 possibility to do also rotations 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.270
 obviously up here a time lapse doesn't have 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.010
 a sense though if you have some videos in 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.480
 which can be useful a rotation 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:38.700
 never say never and boom with distortion 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.780
 image and dynamic that distorts into 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.260
 other way 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.910
 so you have enough possibilities to 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.330
 post production editing 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.930
 I hope I have been useful for what 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.610
 they concern the frames and everything 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.100
 what concerns the zoom effects 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.740
 kamberis etc. 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.370
 now I greet you and wish you a good one 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.700
 week and you feel the next 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.160
 times 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:12.510
 know that it sorts by organizing with 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:16.109
 various tutorials so we have it 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.600
 done and then we're going to use i 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.609
 titles and effects are entitled we will go to 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.830
 mix audio with video with 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.850
 music and format exports 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.640
 correct for youtube 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.510
 so if you have questions, write apples 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.470
 that god has time for time 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.440
 allowing 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.880
 I 'll put myself here to make videos and 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.330
 explain a little about how it works 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.370
 all the rest I greet you all one 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.430
 thanks to the guys I say room like al 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.900
 usually the numbers are a good one 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.900
 hello every week
