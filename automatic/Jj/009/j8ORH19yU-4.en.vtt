00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
Helios 53 F 1.8 on it and there was also

Helios 53 F 1.8 on it and there was also
a<00:00:32.000> Jupiter<00:00:33.000> 53<00:00:33.930> f2<00:00:34.920> which<00:00:35.130> wasn't<00:00:35.370> quite<00:00:35.640> as

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a Jupiter 53 f2 which wasn't quite as

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.459 
a Jupiter 53 f2 which wasn't quite as
sharp<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> was<00:00:36.630> based<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> older

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
sharp but it was based on the older

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.959 
sharp but it was based on the older
contacts<00:00:37.950> design<00:00:38.250> where<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> newer

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
contacts design where this is a newer

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.959 
contacts design where this is a newer
Soviet<00:00:39.540> design<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.579> course<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
Soviet design so of course it is the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.440 
Soviet design so of course it is the
contacts<00:00:42.510> bayonet<00:00:42.960> mount<00:00:43.190> which<00:00:44.190> comes<00:00:45.000> right

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
contacts bayonet mount which comes right

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.299 
contacts bayonet mount which comes right
up<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
up like that

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
up like that

and<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:59.039> interesting<00:00:59.340> thing<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> found<00:00:59.730> with

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and the interesting thing I found with

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
and the interesting thing I found with
this<00:01:00.120> particular<00:01:00.660> setup<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:02.370> mount<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.570> 35

millimeter lens you do have to be at
focus<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.340> infinity<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:08.970> body<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
focus of infinity with the body now the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
focus of infinity with the body now the
one<00:01:10.380> thing<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.650> find<00:01:10.979> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.310> peculiar

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
one thing I do find kind of peculiar

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
one thing I do find kind of peculiar
with<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.049> stop<00:01:13.770> your

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
with this is this will stop your

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
with this is this will stop your
infinity<00:01:14.880> lock<00:01:15.090> from<00:01:15.270> engaging<00:01:15.720> whereas<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
infinity lock from engaging whereas it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
infinity lock from engaging whereas it
will<00:01:16.920> engage<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.520> 50s<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.869> other

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
lenses that use that mount I don't

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.850 
lenses that use that mount I don't
believe<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> longer<00:01:22.170> lenses<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> don't

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
believe the longer lenses do but I don't

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.289 
believe the longer lenses do but I don't
have<00:01:23.009> any<00:01:23.189> personal<00:01:23.610> experience<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.180> them

as<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.940> can<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.270> mine<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.140> needles<00:01:55.410> pretty

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
as you can see mine the needles pretty

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.040 
as you can see mine the needles pretty
much<00:01:55.770> pegged<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.190> for<00:01:56.430> life<00:01:56.810> but<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> way

much pegged out for life but the way

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.290 
much pegged out for life but the way
you'd<00:01:58.230> set<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.010> you'd<00:01:59.460> find<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.940> dose

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
you'd set that is you'd find the dose

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.680 
you'd set that is you'd find the dose
speed<00:02:00.660> which<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.260> Soviet<00:02:01.800> system<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.690> then

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
speed which was a Soviet system and then

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.469 
speed which was a Soviet system and then
match<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:04.910> your<00:02:07.250> pep<00:02:08.250> stop<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:09.360> your

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
shutter speed and the needle would move

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.190 
shutter speed and the needle would move
to<00:02:11.100> indicate<00:02:11.400> accordingly<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.020> have<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
to indicate accordingly here we have the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.050 
to indicate accordingly here we have the
film<00:02:13.470> counter<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.580> advance<00:02:14.880> you

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060

turn this knob one full rotation and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
here to turn to rewind and of course

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.570 
here to turn to rewind and of course
this<00:02:27.780> has<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.110> plastic<00:02:28.380> rewind<00:02:29.040> lever<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.550> it

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this has the plastic rewind lever on it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.870 
this has the plastic rewind lever on it
and<00:02:30.980> then<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> turn<00:02:32.280> both<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.640> these<00:02:32.730> it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
and then if you turn both of these it

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.130 
and then if you turn both of these it
pulls<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.330> up<00:02:33.540> which<00:02:33.660> I'm<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:33.930> going<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
pulls the back up which I'm not going to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.690 
pulls the back up which I'm not going to
do<00:02:34.230> because<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.740> rolled<00:02:34.980> akhtar<00:02:35.520> in

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
do because I do have a rolled akhtar in

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.240 
do because I do have a rolled akhtar in
it<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:37.170> overall<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:37.890> really<00:02:38.160> enjoyed

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
it but overall I have really enjoyed

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.970 
it but overall I have really enjoyed
this<00:02:38.550> camera<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.540> one<00:02:40.470> thing<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.830> like

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this camera and one thing to I like

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.260 
this camera and one thing to I like
about<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.520> think<00:02:41.580> maybe<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.940> bit<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.209> an

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
about this I think maybe a bit of an

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.729 
about this I think maybe a bit of an
improvement<00:02:42.600> over<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.140> contact<00:02:43.590> so

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
improvement over the contact so

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.530 
improvement over the contact so
definitely<00:02:44.130> probably<00:02:44.310> not<00:02:44.519> built<00:02:44.850> as<00:02:45.030> well<00:02:45.239> is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
definitely probably not built as well is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.710 
definitely probably not built as well is
you<00:02:46.260> do<00:02:46.350> have<00:02:46.500> both<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.310> hotshoe<00:02:47.760> here<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
you do have both the hotshoe here and a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.540 
you do have both the hotshoe here and a
sync<00:02:49.050> port<00:02:49.350> which<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.340> put<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.550> plug<00:02:50.880> over

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
sync port which I put a plug over

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.040 
sync port which I put a plug over
because<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.880> was<00:02:54.360> not<00:02:54.540> know<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.870> just

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
because I was not know if it's just

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.610 
because I was not know if it's just
particular<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.870> but<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.230> was

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
particular to this one I have but I was

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.890 
particular to this one I have but I was
shooting<00:02:59.010> with<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.280> with<00:02:59.430> flash<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.660> get<00:03:00.810> my

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
shooting with it with flash and I get my

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.240 
shooting with it with flash and I get my
finger<00:03:01.200> over<00:03:01.320> here<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.620> get<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.769> little<00:03:02.010> jolt

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
finger over here and get a little jolt

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.940 
finger over here and get a little jolt
so<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.550> put<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.850> cover<00:03:03.060> over<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.660> I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
so I put that cover over there so I

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.490 
so I put that cover over there so I
wouldn't<00:03:04.950> experience<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.640> we're<00:03:06.450> overall<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
wouldn't experience that we're overall a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.979 
wouldn't experience that we're overall a
