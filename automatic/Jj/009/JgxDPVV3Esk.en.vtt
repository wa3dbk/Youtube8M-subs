 the ssii 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.510
 dl 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.490
 an external disk 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.520

 as well as an image 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.410
 of the system 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.310
 I click on save the settings and run the soup 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.820

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.270
 arpi shit the details 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 we can follow now 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.910
 the different states 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.300
 of the backup 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.770
 since sunday 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 save it now 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.450
 by taking two executions 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.410
 why we see the soca 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.580
 2 some elements in one year for two 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.610
 damn aum 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.609
 so yes it does not end there 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.609
 creating a system image 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.560
 the backup 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.360
 what was done correctly 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 Click on the button 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.960
 that the backup disk 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.149
 to win backup 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.349
 happy birthday at different times 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.449
 besides 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.899
 users or computers the dispute 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.809
 the omission the information go on the last 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.489
 backup with thiviers spaces 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.829
 by clicking 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.940
 on the same tone see the smile 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.690
 here are some backup plans already the cube 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.730
 on this disk and possibly delete the backups 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.019
 they no longer have to be 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.719
 the story there was only one savior 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.719
 wants it 30 'and the scrum 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.759
 to back up your system go hop to one or two configuration 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.149
 save 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.509
 and sports 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.979
 but then to proceed to the configuration of 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.999
 of the backup 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.139
 the UNOCI 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.160
 we do not use a disk spd 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.219
 external 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.709
 to walk on caen so it's the record the ssii 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:17.530
 4 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.119
 the game selection 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.349
 I leave it to 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.320
 windows 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.649
 to choose 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.979
 but the parameters 2 moreover 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.910
 so the city-close the back up all users evacuated 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.329
 a system image 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.990
 the parameters are now in gold-rib 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.739
 in the second row 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.049
 the backup 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.550
 how will be little more at home 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.889
 to be able to follow all of 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.659
 the backup 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.089
 creation 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.339
 but clichy 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.979
 instantaneous 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.389
 and then 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.939
 backup holder the different files 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.759
 most laurent 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.759
 and the system 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.119
 here is backup 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:13.119
 donovan folder 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.370
 here is the beginning of his term 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.419
 folder 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.660
 document 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.829
 in addition 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.199
 oudjit 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.900
 we are going to start 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.729
 the preparation 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.350
 the disk backup 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.930
 this system 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.800
 race 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 these acts 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.659
 meal preparation 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.050
 uncertain time 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.969
 now here is the creation 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.259
 of a twisted system image that would have come to blows this is the point that 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.599
 contains the operating system 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.300
 windows 7 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.349
 the guests image 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.020
 correctly 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.020
 I want now click on it 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.470
 let's go see now so quickly 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.610
 the contents 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.729
 of the disc 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.729
 served well the backup 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.480
 so this is 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.629
 the pc's confession it's called 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.839
 he wants and if the wc who is most proud the depths of the ranking 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.279
 the candle 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.120
 and for 100 girls china 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.449
 to see the contents of the plan 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:43.670
 the folder 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.440
 you have to show
