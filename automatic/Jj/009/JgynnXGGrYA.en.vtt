down<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:04.799> bit<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:07.130> what<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
down a little bit and what I've got here

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.260 
down a little bit and what I've got here
is<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> swivel<00:01:10.010> fishing<00:01:11.010> swivel<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.970> couple

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
is a swivel fishing swivel just a couple

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.200 
is a swivel fishing swivel just a couple
pieces<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.780> wire<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.380> attached<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
pieces of wire and it's attached to the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.460 
pieces of wire and it's attached to the
Shepherd's<00:01:15.210> hook<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.200> there's<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
Shepherd's hook and then there's a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.140 
Shepherd's hook and then there's a
clothespin<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> keep<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:17.790> blowing

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
clothespin here to keep it from blowing

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
clothespin here to keep it from blowing
off<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.720> case<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.080> gets<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.439> windy<00:01:19.650> so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
off in case it gets really windy so

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.310 
off in case it gets really windy so
anyway<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> way<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> works<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.140> motion

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
anyway the way it works is the motion

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
anyway the way it works is the motion
detector<00:01:22.950> gets<00:01:23.159> kicked<00:01:23.460> off<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.970> sprinkler

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
detector gets kicked off the sprinkler

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.620 
detector gets kicked off the sprinkler
goes<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:25.340> hits<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.420> pans<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:29.329> makes<00:01:30.329> noise

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
goes on hits the pans and makes noise

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
goes on hits the pans and makes noise
and<00:01:32.840> generate<00:01:33.840> soapy<00:01:34.350> water<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.770> soapy<00:01:35.400> smell

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and generate soapy water and soapy smell

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.030 
and generate soapy water and soapy smell
and<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.299> should<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.380> job<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.829> keeping

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and that should do a good job of keeping

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.609 
and that should do a good job of keeping
away<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> deer<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> rabbit<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.470> we're

away the deer in the rabbit so we're

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
away the deer in the rabbit so we're
going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> find<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.909> I'll<00:01:42.270> show<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> what

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
going to find out and I'll show you what

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
happens when a deer sized person animal

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.940 
happens when a deer sized person animal
comes<00:01:48.360> around

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.260 

and<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.429> see<00:01:54.259> definitely<00:01:55.259> works<00:01:56.270> got

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and as you can see definitely works got

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.109 
and as you can see definitely works got
it<00:01:57.420> set<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.750> setting<00:01:58.380> number<00:01:58.560> eight

it set on setting number eight

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.059 
it set on setting number eight
sensitivity<00:02:00.119> setting<00:02:00.570> number<00:02:00.869> eight<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:04.069> I'm

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
sensitivity setting number eight and I'm

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.550 
sensitivity setting number eight and I'm
about<00:02:05.310> 25<00:02:06.179> feet<00:02:06.509> away<00:02:06.659> from<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.170> motion

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
about 25 feet away from the motion

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.180 
about 25 feet away from the motion
detector<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:09.060> kicking<00:02:09.360> off<00:02:09.890> as<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
