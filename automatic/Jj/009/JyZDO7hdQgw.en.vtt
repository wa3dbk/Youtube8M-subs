Koscheck<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.460> imagine<00:00:29.460> he<00:00:29.580> still<00:00:29.820> wants<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119

fight<00:00:30.359> why<00:00:30.510> would<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
fight why would you get in there and I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.860 
fight why would you get in there and I
understand<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.360> performance

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
understand you have that performance

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.500 
understand you have that performance
against<00:00:34.200> Jake<00:00:34.380> Ellenberger<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.160> didn't<00:00:35.820> go

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
against Jake Ellenberger it's didn't go

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750 
against Jake Ellenberger it's didn't go
the<00:00:36.719> way<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> wanted<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.370> then<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.610> have

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the way you wanted to and then you have

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.369 
the way you wanted to and then you have
this<00:00:38.879> fight<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.270> Eric<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.079> he

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
this fight with Eric so and I think he

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.720 
this fight with Eric so and I think he
looked<00:00:40.590> better<00:00:40.770> than<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.040> did<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.520> fight

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
looked better than he did in that fight

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.910 
looked better than he did in that fight
with<00:00:41.940> Jake<00:00:42.180> Ellenberger<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
with Jake Ellenberger and I think if you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
with Jake Ellenberger and I think if you
give<00:00:44.100> Josh<00:00:44.370> Koscheck<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.059> right<00:00:45.270> matchups

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
give Josh Koscheck the right matchups

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.650 
give Josh Koscheck the right matchups

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
product and I think this fight would go

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.819 
product and I think this fight would go
wow<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.870> know<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.049> can<00:03:43.260> sell<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> fact<00:03:43.769> that

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
wow you know you can sell the fact that

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.039

of it that's what you have to do do you

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.259 
of it that's what you have to do do you
think<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.160> they're<00:04:08.310> being<00:04:08.430> successful<00:04:09.120> thus

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
think that they're being successful thus

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.000 
think that they're being successful thus
far<00:04:09.450> because<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.959> that's<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.410> blueprint<00:04:10.889> or

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
far because that that's the blueprint or

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.920 
far because that that's the blueprint or
are<00:04:11.100> we<00:04:11.190> even<00:04:11.310> going<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.700> know<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.329> this

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
are we even going to know this this

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.379 
are we even going to know this this
early<00:04:13.290> in<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.620> game<00:04:13.739> where<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.850> going<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.329> be

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
early in the game where it's going to be

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.629 
early in the game where it's going to be
2015<00:04:16.289> that<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:16.799> look<00:04:16.979> at<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> end<00:04:17.430> of

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
2015 that I think we look at the end of

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.789 
2015 that I think we look at the end of
the<00:04:17.760> year<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.150> how<00:04:18.479> successful<00:04:18.989> was<00:04:19.260> Bellator

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
the year of how successful was Bellator

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.379 
the year of how successful was Bellator
with<00:04:19.919> this<00:04:20.039> formula<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.700> certainly<00:04:21.120> worked

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
with this formula it certainly worked

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.540 
with this formula it certainly worked
for<00:04:21.630> Tito<00:04:21.900> Ortiz<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.169> Stephan<00:04:22.590> Bonnar<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.190> it

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
for Tito Ortiz and Stephan Bonnar is it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.219 
for Tito Ortiz and Stephan Bonnar is it
going<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.880> be<00:04:24.000> diminishing<00:04:24.419> returns<00:04:24.900> with

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
going to be diminishing returns with

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.290 
going to be diminishing returns with
bringing<00:04:26.130> back<00:04:26.400> other<00:04:26.640> names<00:04:26.940> from

two-hour<00:06:00.750> drive<00:06:01.139> plus<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:02.039> money<00:06:02.219> spent<00:06:02.580> on

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
two-hour drive plus the money spent on

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.790 
two-hour drive plus the money spent on
tickets<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.300> hotels<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:04.199> go<00:06:04.319> and<00:06:04.500> see<00:06:04.650> this

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
tickets and hotels to go and see this

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.050 
tickets and hotels to go and see this
show<00:06:05.009> because<00:06:05.219> we<00:06:05.310> all<00:06:05.430> know<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.610> people<00:06:05.940> are

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
show because we all know that people are

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.640 
show because we all know that people are
doing<00:06:06.270> it<00:06:06.360> for<00:06:06.449> the<00:06:06.509> UFC<00:06:06.690> people<00:06:07.409> are<00:06:07.500> driving

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
doing it for the UFC people are driving

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.219 
doing it for the UFC people are driving
five<00:06:07.979> hours<00:06:08.009> to<00:06:08.460> go<00:06:08.580> see<00:06:08.819> the<00:06:08.849> UFC<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.599> I<00:06:09.960> think

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
five hours to go see the UFC and I think

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.019 
five hours to go see the UFC and I think
it<00:06:10.379> comes<00:06:10.620> down<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:11.039> Bellator<00:06:11.520> creating<00:06:11.969> a

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
it comes down to Bellator creating a

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.999 
it comes down to Bellator creating a
product<00:06:12.270> that's<00:06:12.779> hot<00:06:13.050> enough<00:06:13.319> for<00:06:13.710> people<00:06:13.860> to

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
product that's hot enough for people to

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.529 
product that's hot enough for people to
say<00:06:14.219> you<00:06:14.250> know<00:06:14.370> what<00:06:14.639> I'm<00:06:14.789> willing<00:06:15.180> to<00:06:15.330> take

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
say you know what I'm willing to take

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:16.939 
say you know what I'm willing to take
the<00:06:15.719> track<00:06:15.930> I'm<00:06:16.110> willing<00:06:16.259> to<00:06:16.409> spend<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.800> money

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
the track I'm willing to spend the money

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.070 
the track I'm willing to spend the money
I<00:06:17.159> think<00:06:17.669> that<00:06:17.849> with<00:06:18.210> Bellator<00:06:18.659> en<00:06:18.840> world

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
I think that with Bellator en world

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.480 
I think that with Bellator en world
series<00:06:19.409> of<00:06:19.560> fighting<00:06:19.590> I<00:06:19.919> mean<00:06:20.099> you<00:06:20.219> are<00:06:20.340> going

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
series of fighting I mean you are going

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.189 
series of fighting I mean you are going
to<00:06:20.550> find<00:06:20.699> these<00:06:21.000> weekends<00:06:21.539> coming<00:06:21.750> up<00:06:22.020> where

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
to find these weekends coming up where

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.290 
to find these weekends coming up where
there<00:06:22.319> is<00:06:22.469> no<00:06:22.710> UFC<00:06:22.979> these<00:06:23.370> are<00:06:23.550> definitely<00:06:23.909> the

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
there is no UFC these are definitely the

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.180 
there is no UFC these are definitely the
acceptable<00:06:24.990> eyes<00:06:25.199> rather<00:06:25.560> than<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:25.979> rule<00:06:26.129> and

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
acceptable eyes rather than the rule and

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.879 
acceptable eyes rather than the rule and
I<00:06:26.759> think<00:06:26.969> you<00:06:27.599> go<00:06:27.719> back<00:06:27.870> to<00:06:28.020> strikeforce<00:06:28.319> where

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
I think you go back to strikeforce where

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.860 
I think you go back to strikeforce where
there<00:06:29.190> was<00:06:29.310> a<00:06:29.340> lot<00:06:29.699> more<00:06:29.729> free<00:06:30.240> time<00:06:30.270> amongst
