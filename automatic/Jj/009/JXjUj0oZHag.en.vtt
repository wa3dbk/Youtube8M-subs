00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
worker count some reason the Terran

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.790 
worker count some reason the Terran
dropped<00:05:54.509> off<00:05:54.719> and<00:05:54.990> workers<00:05:55.289> I<00:05:55.529> guess<00:05:55.680> because

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
dropped off and workers I guess because

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.499 
dropped off and workers I guess because
this<00:05:56.009> is<00:05:56.129> not<00:05:56.279> diamond<00:05:56.819> and<00:05:57.089> they<00:05:57.150> do<00:05:57.210> stupid

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
this is not diamond and they do stupid

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.529 
this is not diamond and they do stupid
things<00:05:57.659> like<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.169> so<00:05:59.039> there<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.550> go<00:05:59.610> well

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
things like that so there you go well

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.899 
things like that so there you go well
maybe<00:06:00.719> he<00:06:00.810> just<00:06:00.839> not<00:06:01.560> on<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:01.889> gas<00:06:02.129> no<00:06:02.430> hes<00:06:02.610> on<00:06:02.789> 2

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
maybe he just not on to gas no hes on 2

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.909 
maybe he just not on to gas no hes on 2
gas<00:06:03.210> so<00:06:03.509> he's<00:06:03.659> a<00:06:03.690> little<00:06:04.050> under<00:06:04.319> saturated<00:06:04.740> on

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
gas so he's a little under saturated on

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.269 
gas so he's a little under saturated on
the<00:06:05.009> mineral<00:06:05.339> literally<00:06:05.810> weird<00:06:06.810> well<00:06:07.589> that's

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
the mineral literally weird well that's

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.279 
the mineral literally weird well that's
alright<00:06:08.819> it's<00:06:09.419> not<00:06:09.539> great<00:06:09.839> he's<00:06:10.050> probably

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
alright it's not great he's probably

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.939 
alright it's not great he's probably
like<00:06:10.500> two<00:06:10.680> more<00:06:10.889> no<00:06:11.849> big<00:06:12.029> deal<00:06:12.150> there<00:06:12.529> now<00:06:13.529> this

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
like two more no big deal there now this

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.329 
like two more no big deal there now this
i<00:06:14.190> found<00:06:14.339> interesting<00:06:14.610> i<00:06:15.210> didn't<00:06:15.719> see<00:06:15.900> this

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:16.339 
i found interesting i didn't see this

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:23.180 
i found interesting i didn't see this
while<00:06:17.339> I<00:06:17.370> was<00:06:17.610> playing<00:06:19.639> and<00:06:21.589> so<00:06:22.589> I<00:06:22.620> thought<00:06:23.039> we

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
while I was playing and so I thought we

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.769 
while I was playing and so I thought we
were<00:06:23.430> still<00:06:23.849> you<00:06:24.150> know<00:06:24.210> the<00:06:24.330> game<00:06:24.509> was<00:06:24.629> still

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.059 
were still you know the game was still
in<00:06:24.870> doubt<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:25.680> so<00:06:26.460> I<00:06:26.490> went<00:06:26.849> for<00:06:27.060> that<00:06:27.919> and<00:06:28.919> oh

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
in doubt and so I went for that and oh

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.459 
in doubt and so I went for that and oh

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.879 
that's beautiful I did not see him do
this<00:06:31.620> at<00:06:31.860> all<00:06:32.069> that's<00:06:32.879> really<00:06:33.180> cool<00:06:33.560> I'll<00:06:34.560> to

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
this at all that's really cool I'll to

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.320 
this at all that's really cool I'll to
keep<00:06:35.310> in<00:06:35.430> mind<00:06:35.459> that<00:06:35.669> that<00:06:35.819> kind<00:06:36.060> of<00:06:36.120> stuff<00:06:36.300> can

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
keep in mind that that kind of stuff can

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.380 
keep in mind that that kind of stuff can
actually<00:06:36.779> happen<00:06:36.959> in<00:06:37.229> the<00:06:37.289> future

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
actually happen in the future

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.470 
actually happen in the future
and<00:06:40.260> this<00:06:40.380> is<00:06:40.530> one<00:06:40.920> shotting<00:06:41.400> SCV's<00:06:41.970> it's<00:06:42.300> so

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
and this is one shotting SCV's it's so

and this is one shotting SCV's it's so
devastating<00:06:43.700> and<00:06:44.700> you<00:06:44.820> really<00:06:45.150> need<00:06:45.300> like

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
devastating and you really need like

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.030 
devastating and you really need like
missile<00:06:45.900> turrets<00:06:46.200> for<00:06:46.380> that<00:06:46.500> or<00:06:46.710> at<00:06:46.800> least<00:06:46.950> to

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
missile turrets for that or at least to

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.580 
missile turrets for that or at least to
scout<00:06:47.280> the<00:06:47.310> proxy<00:06:47.880> I<00:06:48.060> hear<00:06:48.870> people<00:06:49.170> say<00:06:49.350> Dark

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590

Templar<00:06:49.740> aren't<00:06:50.190> that<00:06:50.340> great<00:06:50.520> well<00:06:51.030> it<00:06:51.600> just

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
Templar aren't that great well it just

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.240 
Templar aren't that great well it just
depends<00:06:52.080> on<00:06:52.230> scouting<00:06:52.620> and<00:06:52.860> whether<00:06:53.070> you<00:06:53.130> get

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
depends on scouting and whether you get

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.090 
depends on scouting and whether you get
an<00:06:53.370> opportunity<00:06:53.460> for<00:06:53.970> it<00:06:54.710> and<00:06:55.710> you<00:06:55.770> really<00:06:55.950> if

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
an opportunity for it and you really if

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.210 
an opportunity for it and you really if
you<00:06:56.190> don't<00:06:56.250> see<00:06:56.550> them<00:06:56.670> coming<00:06:56.910> in<00:06:57.030> like<00:06:57.210> that

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
you don't see them coming in like that

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.170 
you don't see them coming in like that
even<00:06:59.220> if<00:06:59.310> you're<00:06:59.340> awesome<00:06:59.880> you're<00:06:59.970> going<00:07:00.120> to

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
even if you're awesome you're going to

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.850 
even if you're awesome you're going to
lose<00:07:00.270> some<00:07:00.480> workers<00:07:00.840> and<00:07:01.170> a<00:07:01.290> lot<00:07:01.470> of<00:07:01.500> mining

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
lose some workers and a lot of mining

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.650 
lose some workers and a lot of mining
time<00:07:02.100> and<00:07:02.370> probably<00:07:03.030> a<00:07:03.210> couple<00:07:03.330> buildings

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
time and probably a couple buildings

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.930 
time and probably a couple buildings
before<00:07:04.050> you<00:07:04.260> get<00:07:04.350> your<00:07:04.440> forces<00:07:04.860> back<00:07:04.890> and<00:07:05.820> it's

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
before you get your forces back and it's

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.660 
before you get your forces back and it's
just<00:07:06.150> you<00:07:06.330> know<00:07:06.390> three<00:07:06.600> Dark<00:07:06.810> Templar<00:07:07.580> you<00:07:08.580> had

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 
just you know three Dark Templar you had

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.070 
just you know three Dark Templar you had
it<00:07:08.790> a<00:07:08.850> little<00:07:08.940> expensive<00:07:09.330> but<00:07:09.570> in<00:07:09.810> this<00:07:09.870> case

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
it a little expensive but in this case

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.830 
it a little expensive but in this case
the<00:07:10.260> price<00:07:10.470> was<00:07:10.680> right<00:07:11.390> in<00:07:12.390> terms<00:07:12.540> of<00:07:12.720> the

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
the price was right in terms of the

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.590 
the price was right in terms of the
damage<00:07:13.170> done<00:07:13.440> and<00:07:13.740> you<00:07:14.610> even<00:07:14.790> snuck<00:07:15.240> up<00:07:15.390> there

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
damage done and you even snuck up there

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.120 
damage done and you even snuck up there
so<00:07:15.870> while<00:07:16.020> i'm<00:07:16.140> getting<00:07:16.380> muta<00:07:16.590> lists<00:07:16.860> my

teammate end of the game for me so

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.950 
teammate end of the game for me so
minimal<00:07:19.980> contribution<00:07:20.280> from<00:07:20.790> me<00:07:21.030> but<00:07:21.750> you

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
minimal contribution from me but you

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.830 
minimal contribution from me but you
know<00:07:22.080> I<00:07:22.110> helped<00:07:22.910> survive<00:07:23.910> the<00:07:24.150> rush<00:07:24.360> and<00:07:24.690> help

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
know I helped survive the rush and help

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.420 
know I helped survive the rush and help
them<00:07:24.990> counter-attack<00:07:25.680> so<00:07:26.010> that's<00:07:26.160> always<00:07:26.340> a

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
them counter-attack so that's always a

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.770 
them counter-attack so that's always a
plus<00:07:26.640> and<00:07:27.000> that<00:07:27.630> will<00:07:27.750> be<00:07:27.930> a<00:07:28.230> good<00:07:28.590> game
