 we are the planets 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 we see the moons 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.310
 important piece of moving as the increased prices demanded if we were to

 only now to oneself 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.290
 we stand here to make a sign 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.730
 we are all persons together 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.940
 the Fördergemeinschaft have been created 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.230
 and this cohesion would end in the swamp of despair 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.760
 on some days when two spirits find each other 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.990
 we stand together like today and give the voice 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.080
 not for all eternity 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.300
 such moments as this will remain in our heroes 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.179
 we think about the future 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.179
 we are kids we do not see family why 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.869

 Schweikert two free spirits 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:27.429
 Visibility hit more than two years ago at a common known 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.069
 to have 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.309
 after 2 o'clock lively rounds they had to 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.739

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.459
 Nicki to a man in and St 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.189
 we let our thoughts reach Germain points that he himself experiences 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.109
 in which they laughed together and have life companions 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.869
 were happy 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.149
 then we think moments around the 5 lost to the speed

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.519
 we live a roller coaster as ups and downs 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.889
 and the beautiful ones to life 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.699
 we are unique 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:04.959
 it does not give us any 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.699
 it does not exist twice 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.529

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.549
 that's it dark "Our thought existing and to the deepest instincts

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.299
 we were clear 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.299
 that there are several people who choose Hessen 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:31.049
 the sun continues towards 10 mid 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.049
 We also become so that the "purely political" people are here 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.139
 Justin Ende tends the sun to today and now can 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.949
 sunk in the Seeland Nagy because of the missing evening rolled 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.689
 our life ends in the prudish day 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:45.779
 by knowing 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.779
 what we did and are proud of us 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:53.549

 we are here for each other

 Sponsors are on their feet and become a supporting pillar of the partner 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.690
 even if their lives are governed by embedded systems 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.750
 Clubs until the mishap had voted out would have led thick advocaat 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.479
 so the niches do not give either one to them to put each other 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.479
