00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.729
 or the one that you know for sure that many 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.430
 know that one of our disasters 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:08.349
 year were strikes but it seems that 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.660
 there is another company in this case toshiba 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.089
 that has been encouraged to do something more in 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.320
 this issue that we were already waiting for and 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:19.660
 these glasses are these glasses 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.900
 augmented reality that are called the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.359
 toshiba glass to see if this is encouraged 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:31.720
 a little bit more the reality 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:33.430
 increased in which toshiba has thought to the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.739
 time to manufacture these glasses or better 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.559
 said in who has thought then in all 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.579
 those people who need to receive 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.090
 information through a screen 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.410
 but they need hands- free as 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.710
 for example those people who 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 they work in medicine 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.290
 or even eye not only for workers 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 but for housewives you are there 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.280
 cooking and suddenly you need to see the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.739
 recipe for example for that too 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 serves the augmented reality system 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.180
 of toshiba is very simple we have a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 module on the right side of the pin 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 but you can also put on the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.440
 left part according to tastes that has 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.600
 a projector this project what does 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.180
 is to project the images on a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 crystal that is a special crystal is a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.050
 semi transparent glass sure that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.340
 you can appreciate that in the lenses there are 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.570
 a kind of lines some lines are 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.460
 transparent is to say that they allow us 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.320
 see what we have in front and other 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.110
 what they do is reflect the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.600
 images that the little one is projecting 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.880
 projector so we have a little screen that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 is giving us all the information that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.820
 we have in our mobile device 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.490
 For that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.040
 in this part of here we have a cable 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.750
 which will connect for example to our 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.580
 smart the fact that it carries cable is 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.800
 because obviously being designed to 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.140
 people who carry certain equipment 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.880
 above, it does not bother them to have the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.790
 cable with the smartphone or whatever 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.990
 this would give greater durability to 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.910
 device with which you do not know 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.680
 they would pay more than with your battery 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.750
 smartphone but I also knew that 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.220
 the glasses are much lighter and more 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.200
 comfortable to wear especially if 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.050
 We will use it for eye hours 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.850
 still at the moment they are a prototype not 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.150
 they have price has no date 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.860
 launch and are thinking a little bit what 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.680
 type of applications may or may not have 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.060
 what is quite clear is that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.739
 what they want is to have some glasses 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.920
 open is to say that they can work 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.900
 with any device to make it 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.910
 compatible with all operating system and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.910
 any application that we want to place 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.739
 but beware this of course is for now 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.570
 speculation until they get out at 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.470
 market does not know very well how they will come out 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.630
 for example that I am cooking 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.190
 I put on my glasses, I add pepper 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.840
 45 seconds to remove is that it is 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.850
 saying the time is telling me 40 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.180
 seconds 39 38 and I finished the first 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.830
 step and now let's see what else for 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.440
 example was giving me information 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.970
 about the building that I have here and now 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.710
 is warning me that it 's time to 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.320
 eating are the 12 good they really are not 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.430
 12 but he's telling me that according to 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.870
 my agenda right now I'm left to eat 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.030
 You see the little screen that is projected 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.190
 Well, all the information that we 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.690
 we configure and that we have in our 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.970
 smartphone so this has been the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 preview of the glass toxins in this 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.360
 test 2015 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.360
 well I'm going to put some nails 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.090
 by the way, I have a target here for 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.480
 know exactly where I have to put 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.480
 The nail 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.989
 to
