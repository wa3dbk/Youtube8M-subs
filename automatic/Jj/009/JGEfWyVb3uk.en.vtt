be the best they could possibly be I
like<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> idea<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:43.520> understanding<00:00:44.540> food<00:00:45.540> and

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
like the idea of understanding food and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.540 
like the idea of understanding food and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
getting connected to it I think you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.550 
getting connected to it I think you
learn<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:48.000> from<00:00:48.060> animals<00:00:48.720> from<00:00:49.050> livestock

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560

each<00:01:00.239> site<00:01:00.630> visit<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.140> would<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.860> we

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
each site visit we would go out and we

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.170 
each site visit we would go out and we

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
would conduct an environmental

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
would conduct an environmental
assessment<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> take<00:01:04.649> environmental

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
assessment so we take environmental

see<00:01:08.070> how<00:01:08.370> often<00:01:08.760> people<00:01:09.650> for<00:01:10.650> instance<00:01:10.890> touch

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
see how often people for instance touch

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910 
see how often people for instance touch
their<00:01:11.549> face<00:01:11.760> or<00:01:12.180> touch<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.960> coop<00:01:13.200> surface<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
their face or touch the coop surface and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
their face or touch the coop surface and
touch<00:01:14.070> themselves<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.150> had<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
touch themselves and then we had a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
touch themselves and then we had a
survey<00:01:16.470> which<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.340> animal<00:01:17.909> health<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
survey which got at animal health and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.750 
survey which got at animal health and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
husbandry zoo just reminding people that

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.210 
husbandry zoo just reminding people that
there<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.420> never<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.780> zero<00:01:22.170> risk<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
there is never a zero risk but this is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.530 
there is never a zero risk but this is
how<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.430> protect<00:01:23.729> yourself<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
how you protect yourself with this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
how you protect yourself with this
particular<00:01:25.170> species<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.040> positives<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
particular species the positives I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.910 
particular species the positives I
definitely<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.770> having<00:01:28.770> people

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
definitely think are having people

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
definitely think are having people
reconnect<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.610> animal<00:01:30.000> agriculture<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
reconnect with animal agriculture not to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.570 
reconnect with animal agriculture not to
mention<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.350> human<00:01:31.710> animal<00:01:31.979> bond<00:01:32.159> though

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
mention that human animal bond though

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.550 
mention that human animal bond though
these<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:33.030> production<00:01:33.479> animals<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
these are production animals if you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.320 
these are production animals if you
raise<00:01:34.920> them<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.490> socialize<00:01:36.030> them

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
raise them right you socialize them

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.820 
raise them right you socialize them
really

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.560 
really
really<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.580> know<00:01:37.700> they're<00:01:37.940> practically

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
really you know they're practically

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.290

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
me a snack so the benefits especially

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.940 
me a snack so the benefits especially
for<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.020> boys<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.380> that's<00:01:48.530> having<00:01:48.770> fresh

for the boys and that's having fresh

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.780 
for the boys and that's having fresh
eggs<00:01:49.250> far<00:01:49.550> outweigh<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.210> risks
