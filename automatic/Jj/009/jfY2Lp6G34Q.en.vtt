00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.590
 walking down the boulevard I came across 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.240
 the shop of melisa of the solar store 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.430

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
 walk in short or on the beach that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.009

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.580

 on wave I'm here anyway 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.039
 because I'm determined as if you 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.320
 compito were to put a somewhat crochet 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.200
 ossa is you do not know what the foot is 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.600
 but so soft then you have to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.430
 have something like this also not because 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.220
 they are a little more chan and more like to 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.770
 the beach that I am and in fact that a 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.810
 sandal flash you 're not with little sparkles 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.670
 They are also nice for a meeting 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.320
 in the night of repeated a barbecue 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.630
 that you want to be comfortable but with a 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.630
 Pretty sandal, I do not know how it says 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.740
 I had seen this cabin 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.990
 who seemed attracted to indonesia but not 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.270
 had had time to enter now I 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.430
 I went around and I found a 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.940
 store that sells everything brought from 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.940
 Indonesia 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.710
 these furniture are imported or the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:35.530
 imported facts in indonesia what 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:38.060
 pretty what happens if they're already done in 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.870
 rat material 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.180
 and the rattan lasts if enough if they are very 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.440
 good have long batik dresses 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.750
