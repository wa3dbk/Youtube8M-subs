00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
effect it has it's kind of like the the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
zombies in five in that it kind of

freezes<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.970> zombies<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.600> then<00:03:42.140> it

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
freezes the zombies and then it

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.710 
freezes the zombies and then it
basically<00:03:42.680> kills<00:03:43.280> them<00:03:43.520> there<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.330> delay

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
basically kills them there is a delay

effect<00:03:45.140> which<00:03:45.320> is<00:03:45.470> why<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:46.040> not<00:03:46.220> one<00:03:46.430> of

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
effect which is why this is not one of

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.240 
effect which is why this is not one of
