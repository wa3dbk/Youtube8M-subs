particular<00:00:20.340> bike<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.760> really<00:00:21.029> cool<00:00:21.240> because

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
particular bike is really cool because

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.710 
particular bike is really cool because
it's<00:00:21.960> got<00:00:22.109> what<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.710> call<00:00:23.010> dual<00:00:23.789> motion<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
it's got what they call dual motion so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.450 
it's got what they call dual motion so
basically<00:00:25.350> you're<00:00:25.650> riding<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.010> your<00:00:26.189> feet

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
basically you're riding with your feet

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.009 
basically you're riding with your feet
and<00:00:26.699> you're<00:00:27.119> moving<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.449> arms<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> same

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and you're moving your arms at the same

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
and you're moving your arms at the same
time<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> key<00:00:29.789> benefits<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
time so just some of the key benefits to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
time so just some of the key benefits to
think<00:00:30.570> about<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
think about what we really like is that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.370 
think about what we really like is that
it's<00:00:32.460> very<00:00:32.550> compact<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.750> fits<00:00:33.930> nicely<00:00:34.170> in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it's very compact and it fits nicely in

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's very compact and it fits nicely in
the<00:00:34.469> corner<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> your<00:00:34.890> house<00:00:35.130> they've

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the corner of your house they've

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
the corner of your house they've
redesigned<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.329> styling<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.110> bicycle

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
redesigned the styling for this bicycle

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.100 
redesigned the styling for this bicycle
so<00:00:37.829> basically<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.790> looks<00:00:39.120> nice<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.780> modern

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so basically it looks nice in a modern

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.830 
so basically it looks nice in a modern
family<00:00:40.320> home<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.739> home<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> today<00:00:41.840> it's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
family home the home of today it's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.180 
family home the home of today it's
really<00:00:43.140> easy<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.410> assemble<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.920> takes<00:00:44.070> about

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
really easy to assemble it takes about

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
really easy to assemble it takes about
an<00:00:44.370> hour<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.239> heavy<00:00:45.420> side<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
an hour it is a bit on the heavy side so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.959 
an hour it is a bit on the heavy side so
you<00:00:46.140> might<00:00:46.320> need<00:00:46.469> someone<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.010> help<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> unbox

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you might need someone to help you unbox

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.310 
you might need someone to help you unbox
it<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.270> move<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> stairs<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it and move it up the stairs and that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.750 
it and move it up the stairs and that
sort<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> thing

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
sort of thing

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
sort of thing
compared<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.360> other<00:00:51.570> bikes<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.230> fan<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
compared to other bikes the fan is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.119 
compared to other bikes the fan is
actually<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> bad<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.329> terms<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.690> noise

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
actually not that bad in terms of noise

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually not that bad in terms of noise
obviously<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> harder<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> pedal<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
obviously the harder you pedal the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
obviously the harder you pedal the
louder<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> fan<00:00:57.510> gets<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.070> relative<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
louder the fan gets but relative to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.439 
louder the fan gets but relative to
other<00:00:59.340> bikes<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.910> too<00:01:00.090> bad

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
other bikes it's not too bad

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.139 
other bikes it's not too bad
as<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.199> mentioned<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.980> dual<00:01:02.550> motion<00:01:02.789> so

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
as I mentioned it's it's dual motion so

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
as I mentioned it's it's dual motion so
you<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> work<00:01:03.719> both<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> upper<00:01:04.439> body<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you get to work both the upper body and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.280 
you get to work both the upper body and
the<00:01:04.979> lower<00:01:05.010> body<00:01:05.280> which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> awesome<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.080> it's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the lower body which is awesome and it's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.620 
the lower body which is awesome and it's
got<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> computer<00:01:08.460> console<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.210> which<00:01:09.420> makes

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
got a computer console on it which makes

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.080 
got a computer console on it which makes
it<00:01:09.840> pretty<00:01:09.990> easy<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> record<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it pretty easy to record your level of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.410 
it pretty easy to record your level of
overall<00:01:12.450> fitness<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> that's<00:01:15.060> pretty<00:01:15.330> much

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
overall fitness so that's pretty much

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
overall fitness so that's pretty much
all<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> benefits<00:01:16.259> oh<00:01:16.380> yeah<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.860> last

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
all the benefits oh yeah the one last

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.340 
all the benefits oh yeah the one last
thing<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> resistance<00:01:18.900> system

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
thing is that with the resistance system

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890 
thing is that with the resistance system
of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> air<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:21.150> gets<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> air

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
of the air it actually gets the air

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289 
of the air it actually gets the air
blowing<00:01:22.290> cool<00:01:22.710> towards<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.180> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
blowing cool towards you so you get you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
bit of a cool down effect although with

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.499 
bit of a cool down effect although with
the<00:01:27.990> last<00:01:28.229> model<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> ad<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:30.390> was

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the last model the ad for it was

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.969 
the last model the ad for it was
actually<00:01:30.869> quite<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.740> made<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
actually quite a bit more and it made it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
actually quite a bit more and it made it
uncomfortable<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.640> they've<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> fixed

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
uncomfortable but they've kind of fixed

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.050 
uncomfortable but they've kind of fixed
it<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.729> some<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> features

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it for this one so some of the features

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.990 
it for this one so some of the features
to<00:01:36.570> look<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.189> particular<00:01:38.490> model

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
to look at that this particular model

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120 
to look at that this particular model
has<00:01:39.259> it's<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> said<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
has it's like I said it's got the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.550 
has it's like I said it's got the
computer<00:01:41.520> console<00:01:42.000> which<00:01:42.689> records<00:01:43.229> time

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
computer console which records time

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
computer console which records time
distance<00:01:44.130> workload<00:01:44.939> calories<00:01:45.720> Watts<00:01:46.110> heart

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
distance workload calories Watts heart

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
distance workload calories Watts heart
rate<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.280> sort<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.549> stuff<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.479> got

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
rate all that sort of stuff it's got

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.170 
rate all that sort of stuff it's got
it's<00:01:48.960> got<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.200> extra<00:01:49.409> padded<00:01:49.829> seat<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> 300

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it's got an extra padded seat up to 300

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.520 
it's got an extra padded seat up to 300
pound<00:01:51.390> capacity<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.200> you're<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> bigger

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
pound capacity so if you're a bigger

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.719 
pound capacity so if you're a bigger
person<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.070> should<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.340> quite<00:01:53.549> comfortable

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
person you should be quite comfortable

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.190 
person you should be quite comfortable
again<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.869> fan<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> frictionless<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.189> quiet

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
again the fan is frictionless and quiet

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.899 
again the fan is frictionless and quiet
the<00:01:58.200> linkage<00:01:58.740> systems<00:01:59.070> got<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.399> shrouding

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the linkage systems got some shrouding

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
the linkage systems got some shrouding
on<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> bit<00:02:00.630> safer<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.920> got<00:02:02.040> an

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
on it so it's a bit safer it's got an

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.179 
on it so it's a bit safer it's got an
RPM<00:02:02.490> gauge<00:02:03.619> there's<00:02:04.619> there's<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> new

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
RPM gauge there's there's a new

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.969 
RPM gauge there's there's a new
integrated<00:02:05.790> bottle<00:02:06.270> holder<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
integrated bottle holder so it's so you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.650 
integrated bottle holder so it's so you
could<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.190> your<00:02:08.310> water<00:02:08.489> there<00:02:08.759> rate<00:02:08.970> rate

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
could have your water there rate rate

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.320 
could have your water there rate rate
within<00:02:09.959> reach<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.430> transport<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.090> around

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
within reach you can transport it around

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.460 
within reach you can transport it around
because<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.629> got<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> new<00:02:12.959> wheels

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
because it's got the new wheels

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
because it's got the new wheels
it<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:14.280> got<00:02:14.430> straps<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> feet<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:15.480> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750

the<00:02:27.930> ad<00:02:28.170> -<00:02:28.760> we<00:02:29.760> haven't<00:02:29.970> reviewed<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.570> this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
the ad - we haven't reviewed it in this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.150 
the ad - we haven't reviewed it in this
particular<00:02:31.170> video<00:02:31.320> because<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
particular video because this is just a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.090 
particular video because this is just a
far<00:02:32.430> superior<00:02:32.850> machine<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.780> 86<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
far superior machine the 86 and and the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.920 
far superior machine the 86 and and the
price<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.910> negligible<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.570> not<00:02:36.750> that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
price is really negligible it's not that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.360 
price is really negligible it's not that
much<00:02:37.050> more<00:02:37.230> expensive<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> one

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
much more expensive so this is the one

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.310 
much more expensive so this is the one
we<00:02:38.490> wanted<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.820> focus<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.240> now<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:40.080> with<00:02:40.170> any

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
we wanted to focus on now just with any

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.720 
we wanted to focus on now just with any
product<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.130> few<00:02:41.310> things<00:02:41.490> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
product there are so few things to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.690 
product there are so few things to
consider<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> 86<00:02:43.430> people<00:02:44.430> have

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
consider with the 86 people have

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.270 
consider with the 86 people have
reported<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.390> it's<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:45.810> ideal<00:02:46.170> we're<00:02:47.010> we're

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
reported that it's not ideal we're we're

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.590 
reported that it's not ideal we're we're
a<00:02:47.310> bit<00:02:47.490> larger<00:02:47.850> than<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.060> but<00:02:48.209> people<00:02:48.420> have

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
a bit larger than this but people have

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.210 
a bit larger than this but people have
reported<00:02:49.020> who<00:02:49.290> are<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> 5<00:02:49.860> foot<00:02:50.070> 4<00:02:50.400> or<00:02:50.610> less<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
reported who are a 5 foot 4 or less that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.410 
reported who are a 5 foot 4 or less that
it's<00:02:53.220> hard<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.580> reach<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.940> handles<00:02:54.300> when

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
it's hard to reach the handles when

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.400 
it's hard to reach the handles when
they're<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.630> their<00:02:54.750> fully<00:02:54.959> extended<00:02:55.380> position

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
they're in their fully extended position

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.440 
they're in their fully extended position
so<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:55.920> you're<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.490> know<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.640> smaller<00:02:56.970> female

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
so if you're you know a smaller female

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.140 
so if you're you know a smaller female
or<00:02:57.660> male<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.190> you're<00:02:59.190> under<00:02:59.400> 5<00:02:59.580> foot<00:02:59.790> 4<00:03:00.030> you

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
or male and you're under 5 foot 4 you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.370 
or male and you're under 5 foot 4 you
might<00:03:00.270> want<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> consider<00:03:00.840> looking<00:03:00.959> at<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
might want to consider looking at a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.650 
might want to consider looking at a
different<00:03:01.680> machine<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.180> that's<00:03:03.330> something<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
different machine so that's something to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.110 
different machine so that's something to
think<00:03:03.690> about<00:03:03.930> also<00:03:04.580> people<00:03:05.580> who<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
think about also people who are on the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.449 
think about also people who are on the
larger<00:03:06.390> side<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.170> 200<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.740> 300<00:03:08.280> pound

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
larger side of the 200 to 300 pound

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.949 
larger side of the 200 to 300 pound
weight<00:03:08.550> category<00:03:09.150> may<00:03:09.360> want<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.660> consider

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
weight category may want to consider

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.199
