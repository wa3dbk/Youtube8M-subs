00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.309 
PDA and I did some research on there
and<00:02:11.459> I'm<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.360> confirm<00:02:12.659> this<00:02:12.840> once<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.170> get

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and I'm going to confirm this once I get

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.559 
and I'm going to confirm this once I get
it<00:02:13.409> installed<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.980> I'll<00:02:14.040> update<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.239> it

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
it installed and I'll update but the it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.509 
it installed and I'll update but the it
looks<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.170> PDA<00:02:16.500> will<00:02:16.950> retain<00:02:17.250> all

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
looks like the PDA will retain all

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.930 
looks like the PDA will retain all
functionality<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.440> system<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.099> only

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
functionality with this system the only

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.420 
functionality with this system the only
thing<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.269> won't<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.510> able<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.780> do<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.049> program

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
thing you won't be able to do is program

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.610 
thing you won't be able to do is program
the<00:02:23.430> pump<00:02:23.819> times<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.540> still<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.989> turn

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the pump times but you still can turn

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.740 
the pump times but you still can turn
stuff<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.310> off<00:02:26.459> set<00:02:26.909> spa<00:02:27.209> temperature

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
stuff on and off set spa temperature

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.640 
stuff on and off set spa temperature
full<00:02:28.140> temperature

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
full temperature

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.890 
full temperature
lights<00:02:29.489> on<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.879> off<00:02:30.000> stuff<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.720> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
lights on and off stuff like that you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.960 
lights on and off stuff like that you
can't<00:02:31.079> do<00:02:31.170> any<00:02:31.349> really<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.769> programming<00:02:32.640> you

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
can't do any really like programming you

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.030 
can't do any really like programming you
can<00:02:33.480> set<00:02:33.780> temperature<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> PDA<00:02:34.860> will

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
can set temperature so the PDA will

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.610 
can set temperature so the PDA will
still<00:02:35.280> work<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.849> regard<00:02:36.349> which<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.560> know

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
still work in that regard which you know

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.569 
still work in that regard which you know
I<00:02:37.799> don't<00:02:37.920> know<00:02:38.010> about<00:02:38.099> you<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.519> don't

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
I don't know about you but I don't

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.369 
I don't know about you but I don't
really<00:02:38.700> mind<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.510> PDA<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.110> just

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
really mind that because the PDA is just

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.380 
really mind that because the PDA is just
such<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> slow<00:02:40.980> pile<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.489> crap<00:02:41.760> compared<00:02:42.329> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
such a slow pile of crap compared to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.059 
such a slow pile of crap compared to
this<00:02:42.540> which<00:02:43.049> this<00:02:43.200> allows<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.680> access<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
this which this allows you to access it

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.220 
this which this allows you to access it
on<00:02:44.250> your<00:02:44.370> phone<00:02:44.549> your<00:02:44.819> computer<00:02:45.230> basically

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
on your phone your computer basically

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.559 
on your phone your computer basically
anywhere<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> world<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.060> another<00:02:48.299> thing

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
anywhere in the world and another thing

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.530 
anywhere in the world and another thing
that<00:02:49.190> I've<00:02:50.190> noticed<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.450> an

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that I've noticed that I have I have an

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.750 
that I've noticed that I have I have an
older<00:02:51.870> system<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> port<00:02:53.519> for

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
older system and this is the port for

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.599 
older system and this is the port for
the<00:02:54.260> aqua-pure<00:02:55.260> or<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.859> salt<00:02:56.129> chlorinator

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
the aqua-pure or the salt chlorinator

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.940 
the aqua-pure or the salt chlorinator
and<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.599> my<00:02:58.109> salt<00:02:58.470> system<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.829> actually

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and my my salt system is actually

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.099 
and my my salt system is actually
located<00:02:59.220> behind<00:02:59.849> this<00:02:59.970> board<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.329> flips<00:03:00.690> open

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
located behind this board it flips open

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.380 
located behind this board it flips open
and<00:03:01.379> it's<00:03:01.500> actually<00:03:01.829> behind<00:03:02.129> here<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.180> have

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
and it's actually behind here so I have

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.000 
and it's actually behind here so I have
an<00:03:03.480> extra<00:03:03.810> step<00:03:03.989> involved<00:03:04.409> with<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.859> have

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
an extra step involved with this I have

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.309 
an extra step involved with this I have
to<00:03:05.159> remove<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.730> bezel<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.840> front<00:03:07.109> here

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
to remove this bezel on the front here

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.520 
to remove this bezel on the front here
and<00:03:07.470> replace<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.069> my<00:03:08.340> old<00:03:08.579> one<00:03:09.530> because

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and replace it with my old one because

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.080 
and replace it with my old one because
this<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.769> actually<00:03:11.400> at<00:03:11.519> first<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.879> thought<00:03:12.030> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
this is actually at first I thought you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.250 
this is actually at first I thought you
could<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:12.299> take<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.750> off<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.140> it's

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
could just take this off but it's

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.120 
could just take this off but it's
actually<00:03:13.590> formed<00:03:14.480> into<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.569> plastic<00:03:16.169> so<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.680> do

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
actually formed into the plastic so I do

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.860 
actually formed into the plastic so I do
have<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.519> remove<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.269> replace<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.780> with

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
have to remove that and replace it with

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.890 
have to remove that and replace it with
mine<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.849> all<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> same<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> front

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
mine and it's all the same on the front

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.270 
mine and it's all the same on the front
so<00:03:22.079> everything<00:03:22.410> should<00:03:22.530> line<00:03:22.709> up<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.160> be

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
so everything should line up and just be

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.589 
so everything should line up and just be
fine<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.470> but<00:03:26.450> instructions<00:03:27.450> seem

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
fine with that but instructions seem

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.050 
fine with that but instructions seem
pretty<00:03:27.810> straightforward<00:03:28.079> well<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.190> looks

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
pretty straightforward well it looks

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.670 
pretty straightforward well it looks
like<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.239> relatively<00:03:30.629> easy<00:03:30.900> kit<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.349> install

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
like a relatively easy kit to install

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.930 
like a relatively easy kit to install
and<00:03:31.919> it<00:03:31.980> sure<00:03:32.129> as<00:03:32.190> hell<00:03:32.400> beats<00:03:32.430> paying

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and it sure as hell beats paying

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.400 
and it sure as hell beats paying
somebody<00:03:33.150> hundreds<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> dollars<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.230> come<00:03:34.319> out

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
somebody hundreds of dollars to come out

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.890 
somebody hundreds of dollars to come out
here<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.590> do<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:35.359> there's<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.510> back<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
here and do it there's the back of the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.140 
here and do it there's the back of the
board

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
board

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.250 
board
here's<00:03:39.150> your<00:03:41.120> rs-485<00:03:42.120> connectors<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:43.109> is

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
here's your rs-485 connectors this is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.629 
here's your rs-485 connectors this is
for<00:03:43.410> your<00:03:43.530> variable<00:03:43.949> speed<00:03:44.160> pumps<00:03:44.489> or

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
for your variable speed pumps or

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.360 
for your variable speed pumps or
anything<00:03:44.819> that<00:03:45.060> uses<00:03:45.329> communication<00:03:46.370> another

anything that uses communication another

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.949 
anything that uses communication another
thing<00:03:47.549> too<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:48.000> if<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.299> do<00:03:48.449> have<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.690> PDA

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
thing too is if you do have the PDA

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.080 
thing too is if you do have the PDA
system<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.709> can<00:03:49.859> connect<00:03:50.160> up<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> two<00:03:50.699> things

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
system you can connect up the two things

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.970 
system you can connect up the two things
to<00:03:51.329> each<00:03:51.510> one<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.780> these<00:03:51.900> ports<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.410> for<00:03:52.829> my

various things but my pool is relatively

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.640 
various things but my pool is relatively
simple<00:04:12.599> so<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.840> don't<00:04:13.049> really<00:04:13.109> need<00:04:13.379> that

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
simple so I don't really need that

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.659 
simple so I don't really need that
additional<00:04:14.280> functionality<00:04:16.250> but<00:04:17.250> if<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.489> do

additional functionality but if you do

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.520 
additional functionality but if you do
it's<00:04:17.849> definitely<00:04:18.000> an<00:04:18.299> option<00:04:18.530> underneath

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
it's definitely an option underneath

just<00:05:50.500> plug<00:05:50.740> everything<00:05:50.860> in<00:05:51.280> where<00:05:51.640> it<00:05:51.730> was

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
just plug everything in where it was

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.200 
just plug everything in where it was
before<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:53.250> follow<00:05:54.250> these<00:05:54.460> instructions<00:05:54.490> and

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
before and follow these instructions and

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.400 
before and follow these instructions and
you<00:05:55.330> shouldn't<00:05:55.540> have<00:05:55.690> any<00:05:55.870> problem<00:05:56.320> it<00:05:56.380> should

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
you shouldn't have any problem it should

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.360 
you shouldn't have any problem it should
work<00:05:56.710> just<00:05:56.740> fine

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
work just fine

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.330 
work just fine
another<00:05:58.360> thing<00:05:58.510> that's<00:05:58.600> included<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.200> the

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
another thing that's included is the

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.500 
another thing that's included is the
labels<00:06:00.340> so<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.360> can<00:06:01.600> label<00:06:02.530> everything<00:06:03.510> if

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
labels so you can label everything if

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.840 
labels so you can label everything if
you<00:06:04.870> know<00:06:04.960> if<00:06:05.590> this<00:06:05.890> board<00:06:06.160> fits<00:06:06.490> in<00:06:06.700> your

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
you know if this board fits in your

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.600 
you know if this board fits in your
application<00:06:07.570> or<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.380> bezel<00:06:08.680> mine<00:06:09.430> it

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
application or this bezel mine it

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.280 
application or this bezel mine it
doesn't<00:06:09.970> so<00:06:10.180> mine's<00:06:10.450> already<00:06:10.690> labeled<00:06:10.960> on<00:06:11.260> the

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
doesn't so mine's already labeled on the

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.630 
doesn't so mine's already labeled on the
on<00:06:11.530> the<00:06:11.680> side<00:06:11.830> of<00:06:11.860> my<00:06:12.010> house<00:06:12.190> I<00:06:12.400> don't<00:06:12.550> have

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
on the side of my house I don't have

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.140 
on the side of my house I don't have
that<00:06:12.790> problem<00:06:13.260> but<00:06:14.260> but<00:06:15.010> if<00:06:15.130> you<00:06:15.280> if<00:06:15.790> this<00:06:15.940> fits

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
that problem but but if you if this fits

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.970 
that problem but but if you if this fits
yours<00:06:16.450> you<00:06:16.660> can<00:06:16.810> real<00:06:17.170> able<00:06:17.440> everything<00:06:17.830> like

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
yours you can real able everything like

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.520 
yours you can real able everything like
it<00:06:18.100> was<00:06:18.130> before<00:06:18.400> so<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:19.350> shouldn't<00:06:20.350> have<00:06:20.470> a

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
it was before so you shouldn't have a

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.610 
it was before so you shouldn't have a
problem<00:06:20.560> identifying<00:06:21.280> anything<00:06:22.380> but<00:06:23.380> that's

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
problem identifying anything but that's

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.160 
problem identifying anything but that's
about<00:06:23.830> it<00:06:24.010> for<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:24.250> system<00:06:24.610> it<00:06:25.120> looks<00:06:25.330> very

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
about it for the system it looks very

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.430 
about it for the system it looks very
simple<00:06:26.500> to<00:06:26.710> install<00:06:26.830> very<00:06:27.790> straightforward

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
simple to install very straightforward

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.540 
simple to install very straightforward
so<00:06:29.440> I'm<00:06:29.920> gonna<00:06:30.010> go<00:06:30.130> ahead<00:06:30.220> and<00:06:30.310> get<00:06:30.460> it

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
so I'm gonna go ahead and get it

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.070 
so I'm gonna go ahead and get it
installed<00:06:30.700> and<00:06:31.060> then<00:06:31.150> update<00:06:31.600> once<00:06:31.840> it's<00:06:31.990> up

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
installed and then update once it's up

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.760 
installed and then update once it's up
and<00:06:32.170> running<00:06:32.260> and<00:06:32.590> see<00:06:33.520> how<00:06:33.640> it<00:06:33.730> goes
