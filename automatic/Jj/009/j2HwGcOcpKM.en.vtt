species of pond plants are they like
around<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> world<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.360> originally<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> had

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
around the world and originally I had

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.870 
around the world and originally I had
like<00:01:30.960> three<00:01:31.200> questions<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.250> my<00:01:32.400> books<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.760> I

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
like three questions in my books that I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480 
like three questions in my books that I
write<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.690> once<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.650> heard<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.370> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
write down and once I heard about them I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.140 
write down and once I heard about them I
thought<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.180> were<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.780> boring<00:01:37.620> so<00:01:38.580> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
thought they were kind of boring so I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.880 
thought they were kind of boring so I
wanted<00:01:39.479> something<00:01:39.540> interesting<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.590> more

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
wanted something interesting and more

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.990 
wanted something interesting and more
complex<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.180> fun<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.640> started<00:01:44.640> thinking

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
complex and fun so I started thinking

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.570 
complex and fun so I started thinking
about<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:46.020> interests<00:01:46.500> me<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
about what really interests me so I

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.610 
about what really interests me so I
asked<00:01:47.790> myself<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.510> do<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.290> want<00:01:49.409> to

wanderings from that they do their

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.490 
wanderings from that they do their
finding<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.130> their<00:02:42.030> tuning<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.600> they<00:02:43.200> then

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
finding out their tuning in they then

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.360 
finding out their tuning in they then
move<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:45.270> big<00:02:45.780> question<00:02:46.350> after<00:02:47.220> their

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
move on to the big question after their

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.250 
move on to the big question after their
big<00:02:47.610> question<00:02:48.090> they<00:02:48.270> go<00:02:48.660> into<00:02:48.840> their<00:02:49.020> research

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
big question they go into their research

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.190 
big question they go into their research
phase<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.130> after<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.090> research<00:02:51.480> phase<00:02:51.720> they

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
phase and after the research phase they

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.730 
phase and after the research phase they
then<00:02:52.710> need<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.520> take<00:02:53.970> action<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.560> think

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
then need to take action and I think

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.449 
then need to take action and I think
it's<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.980> take<00:02:56.220> action<00:02:57.350> phase<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
it's a take action phase that is the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.880 
it's a take action phase that is the
most<00:02:59.970> important<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:00.930> far<00:03:00.959> as<00:03:01.200> student<00:03:01.740> voice

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
most important as far as student voice

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.220 
most important as far as student voice
because<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.910> phase<00:03:03.120> where<00:03:03.480> they<00:03:04.050> are

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
because that is the phase where they are

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.630 
because that is the phase where they are
able<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.740> have<00:03:05.130> total<00:03:05.970> control

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.620 

the<00:03:12.540> deforestation<00:03:13.170> project<00:03:13.860> would<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.630> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the deforestation project would be the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.300 
the deforestation project would be the
most<00:03:15.900> obvious

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
most obvious

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.370 
most obvious
I<00:03:17.340> suppose<00:03:18.000> example<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.600> where<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.960> students

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
I suppose example of where the students

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.150 
I suppose example of where the students
have<00:03:19.560> been<00:03:19.860> able<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:21.150> make<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> difference<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
have been able to make a difference the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.810 
have been able to make a difference the
students<00:03:23.580> were<00:03:23.730> able<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.470> tap<00:03:25.470> into<00:03:25.820> local

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
students were able to tap into local

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.850 
students were able to tap into local
government<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.750> federal<00:03:28.170> government<00:03:28.320> they

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
government to federal government they

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.650 
government to federal government they
were<00:03:28.950> able<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.340> collaborate<00:03:29.940> with<00:03:29.970> students

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
were able to collaborate with students

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.600 
were able to collaborate with students
across<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.110> world<00:03:31.350> they<00:03:31.950> were<00:03:32.010> able<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.400> work

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
across the world they were able to work

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.240 
across the world they were able to work
with<00:03:32.670> multinational<00:03:33.570> companies<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:35.190> think

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
with multinational companies and I think

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.470 
with multinational companies and I think
that<00:03:35.610> has<00:03:36.390> been<00:03:36.860> for<00:03:37.860> our<00:03:38.220> students<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.300> most

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that has been for our students the most

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.240 
that has been for our students the most
valuable<00:03:39.990> experience<00:03:40.530> because<00:03:40.830> they<00:03:40.950> came

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
valuable experience because they came

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.670 
valuable experience because they came
away<00:03:41.550> with<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.510> feeling<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.990> as<00:03:43.170> as

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
away with the feeling that as as

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.500 
away with the feeling that as as
children<00:03:44.550> they<00:03:44.820> were<00:03:44.910> able<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.270> make<00:03:45.480> a

children they were able to make a

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:54.420 
children they were able to make a
difference

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
the children have a physical box at the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.530 
the children have a physical box at the
start<00:04:37.460> of<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> year<00:04:37.880> they'll<00:04:38.150> bring<00:04:38.360> in

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
start of the year they'll bring in

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.600 
start of the year they'll bring in
something<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.230> interests<00:04:40.070> them<00:04:40.220> so<00:04:40.550> it

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
something that interests them so it

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.880 
something that interests them so it
could<00:04:40.760> be<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> toy<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.930> could<00:04:42.110> be<00:04:42.230> a<00:04:42.260> photograph

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
could be a toy it could be a photograph

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.580 
could be a toy it could be a photograph
of<00:04:43.130> something<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.760> book<00:04:44.300> they<00:04:44.750> then<00:04:45.020> put<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:45.440> in

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
of something a book they then put it in

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.860 
of something a book they then put it in
that<00:04:45.770> learning<00:04:46.190> box<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.150> becomes<00:04:47.570> their

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
that learning box and that becomes their

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.040 
that learning box and that becomes their
focus<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.070> it's<00:04:49.190> very<00:04:49.340> student-centered<00:04:50.240> I

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
focus so it's very student-centered I

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.590 
focus so it's very student-centered I
don't<00:04:51.620> have<00:04:51.830> any<00:04:52.010> control<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.360> first

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
don't have any control so the first

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.420 
don't have any control so the first
thing<00:04:53.840> we<00:04:53.930> do<00:04:54.140> is<00:04:54.320> find<00:04:54.740> out<00:04:54.950> their<00:04:55.190> prior

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
thing we do is find out their prior

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.060 
thing we do is find out their prior
knowledge<00:04:55.670> so<00:04:56.450> I<00:04:56.480> ask<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:57.140> children<00:04:57.350> what<00:04:57.710> do

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
knowledge so I ask the children what do

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.040 
knowledge so I ask the children what do
you<00:04:58.130> already<00:04:58.340> know<00:04:58.550> about<00:04:58.700> your<00:04:59.180> topic<00:04:59.630> and

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
you already know about your topic and

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.610 
you already know about your topic and
we'll<00:05:00.770> video<00:05:01.100> clip<00:05:01.430> them<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.050> go<00:05:03.050> around<00:05:03.200> and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
we'll video clip them and go around and

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.530 
we'll video clip them and go around and
and<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.250> children<00:05:04.550> will<00:05:04.670> say<00:05:04.820> well<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.300> know

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
and the children will say well I know

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.070 
and the children will say well I know
that<00:05:06.440> cars<00:05:06.740> transport<00:05:07.460> people<00:05:07.670> to<00:05:08.270> places<00:05:08.810> and

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
that cars transport people to places and

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.140 
that cars transport people to places and
then<00:05:09.710> ask<00:05:10.040> them<00:05:10.490> well<00:05:10.670> what<00:05:10.820> would<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.000> like

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
then ask them well what would you like

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.770 
then ask them well what would you like
to<00:05:11.540> find<00:05:11.840> out<00:05:12.020> about<00:05:12.680> cars<00:05:13.040> so<00:05:13.820> they<00:05:14.300> direct

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
to find out about cars so they direct

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.590 
to find out about cars so they direct
those<00:05:14.960> questions<00:05:15.100> from<00:05:16.100> there<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.790> then<00:05:17.240> teach

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
those questions from there I then teach

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.520 
those questions from there I then teach
them<00:05:17.630> how<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.620> use<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:20.240> internet<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:21.500> find

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
them how to use the internet to find

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.880 
them how to use the internet to find
relevant<00:05:22.370> applicable<00:05:23.240> information<00:05:23.960> to

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
relevant applicable information to

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.430 
relevant applicable information to
answer<00:05:25.070> their<00:05:25.430> questions<00:05:26.000> it<00:05:26.870> doesn't<00:05:27.260> last

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
answer their questions it doesn't last

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.490 
answer their questions it doesn't last
for<00:05:27.770> very<00:05:27.920> long<00:05:28.330> its<00:05:29.330> developmental<00:05:30.170> stage

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
for very long its developmental stage

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.950 
for very long its developmental stage
but<00:05:31.190> if<00:05:31.310> we<00:05:31.490> teach<00:05:31.820> them<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.330> capitalize<00:05:32.930> on

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
but if we teach them and capitalize on

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.470 
but if we teach them and capitalize on
it<00:05:33.260> when<00:05:33.440> they<00:05:33.590> at<00:05:33.830> that<00:05:34.220> age<00:05:34.430> then<00:05:35.000> later<00:05:35.360> on

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
it when they at that age then later on

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.000 
it when they at that age then later on
in<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.080> primary<00:05:36.500> school

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
in the primary school

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.100 
in the primary school
you<00:05:37.160> can<00:05:37.370> then<00:05:37.580> teach<00:05:37.850> them<00:05:38.210> how<00:05:38.420> to<00:05:38.450> broaden

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
you can then teach them how to broaden

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.800 
you can then teach them how to broaden
their<00:05:39.590> thinking<00:05:40.070> how<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.340> go<00:05:40.730> to<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:41.030> deeper

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
their thinking how to go to a deeper

their thinking how to go to a deeper
level<00:05:41.840> with<00:05:42.650> their<00:05:42.980> questions<00:05:43.250> how<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:43.940> use

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
level with their questions how to use

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.950 
level with their questions how to use
wider<00:05:45.170> research<00:05:45.800> skills<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.730> then<00:05:47.270> also<00:05:47.480> how

asked the person about their research
which<00:06:00.550> really<00:06:00.940> challenged<00:06:01.540> them<00:06:01.720> to<00:06:01.750> find<00:06:02.140> out

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
which really challenged them to find out
