00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.209 
in one plug mirror so as you can see
it's<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.750> plague<00:00:52.050> mere<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
it's going to be for plague mere but I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.119 
it's going to be for plague mere but I
still<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.360> fact<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> add<00:00:54.899> one

felt like I'd want to point those out
different<00:01:07.500> art<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> holographic<00:01:09.770> 3<00:01:10.770> plague

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
different art and holographic 3 plague

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.560 
different art and holographic 3 plague
stingers<00:01:11.400> only<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.360> holographic

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
stingers only this one is a holographic

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.730 
stingers only this one is a holographic
so<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.900> four<00:01:16.170> plex<00:01:16.380> stingers

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
so it's going to be four plex stingers

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.600 
so it's going to be four plex stingers
