00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.150
 bmw 3 series 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.160
 the real popular BMW small 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.170
 sedan can and family accommodate and in close 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.300
 the city turn around but what is this 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:24.289
 the car has to actually know 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:26.119
 given by no means to its owner for 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.090
 In order to find out, I took a course 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.239
 near her BMW drawings under pepper 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.689
 the leadership of the best pilot in Russia 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.879
 exactly there 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.930
 the character of this sedan is hiding 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:42.290
 totally believe me able 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.739
 likely but first you need to look around 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.530
 salon 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.989
 we got version 335 of a complete set 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.399
 that is modern with bright even female 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.770
 cream-colored salon 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.000
 steering wheel beef and even instrument scales 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.609
 there are light brown 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.140
 bright and impractical but the place has become 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.000
 noticeably more than in the previous one 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.580
 generation and even in the rear can now 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.750
 sit adult passengers 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.820
 widescreen screen system oh site 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.840
 as if they stuck socks and it seems that he 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.330
 detachable 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.800
 but no fixed on the dead seat 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.259
 adjustable in all directions 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.570
 using electrics and even support 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.810
 kneel sit correctly 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.870
 knees as low and upright as possible 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.340
 stretched down 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 crimping blades back 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.659
 mouth armor in position 9 and 3 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.369
 let's go to our car installed the most 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.110
 the most powerful currently available 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.030
 engines petrol six with 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.869
 turbocharged capacity of 306 horse 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.450
 forces 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.850
 this motor is already familiar to many by 5 7 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.130
 series even there it allows a lot 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.250
 from treshka with him and does turn into 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.140
 today's sports equipment moment 400 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.869
 newton meters will allow if not all that 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.729
 can a sports car is at least almost all 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.009
 the box here is not stepped 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.660
 machine and he knows how to work smart with 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.759
 With my tears, you can't be a normal new 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.039
 treshka comfortable even at 20 inch 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.550
 hub drive hole this roller 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.350
 not at all 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.180
 and if you want to drive to the limit 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.090
 the car grabs the roadbed 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.660
 if does not cancel strongly pushing laws 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.670
 physicists 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.680
 most sedans would have long been 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.630
 creaked and rubber and went into the trajectory 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.030
 with the foot follows the instructions not 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.920
 a driver with an incredible fanatic 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.530
 limit is still there but it is more than 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.940
 expect a ball overdone with gas and demolition 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.890
 front axle which is great 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.840
 controlled by the fuel supply but for 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.390
 In order to achieve this, you must turn off 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.730
 stabilization system if it is slightly us 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.030
 the machine does not allow any need 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.720
 in the trajectory the heating chronicle is not 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.880
 so simple 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.950
 you need to press a few keys 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.440
 certain machines will follow this as 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.440
 would be hinting respected 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.450
 week in the company with treshka BMW 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.830
 flew completely unnoticed paromashina 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.140
 give them a pity 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.470
 I'll go I still ride 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.470
 with representation we would somehow 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.470
 to finish
