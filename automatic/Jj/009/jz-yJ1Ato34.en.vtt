00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.150
 hi my people today we are going to make a 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.809
 craft with adhesive tape a straw 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.750
 straw as it is called in your country 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.710
 Cani puts sorbet and basically what 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.840
 let's do is take a piece of 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.030
 red adhesive tape to form 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.370
 a rose or what will be the petal of a 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.190
 pink plus or minus 4 inches of ribbon 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.640
 adhesive and basically we double in the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.400
 medium and then we doubled on the other side 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.120
 of the adhesive tape forming a 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.210
 triangle with some exposed tape 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.049
 in the base here we are going to cut to give 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.479
 the shape of a petal and one can cut 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.540
 to give it the shape of a petal or 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:21.549
 You can also leave the tip as per 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.369
 example with this piece to thus have 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.320
 a rose that is pointy to me 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.170
 like to shape it a little bit more 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.409
 round to my rose so let's go to 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.249
 start basically we go 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.440
 more the central part of the rose and we're going 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:42.560
 to bend 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.870
 the piece of duct tape around 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.780
 what is the pop hotel chalice sorbet 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.280
 mind as he is called in his country here I 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.760
 I have several pieces that I have already trimmed 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.260
 I have about 12 pieces of adhesive tape 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.400
 that pre cut and that also cut to 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.040
 give it the curved shape at the edge and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.490
 basically we continue with this process 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.460
 to have the roses already this way 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.550
 once we have the roses already formed 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.620
 so let's put the sepal and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.770
 for the sepal I just took a 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.470
 piece of green tape 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.650
 as you see here and the court in the form of 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.560
 lawn and now I'm going to take my piece of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.850
 duct tape and I will pass it around 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.940
 from my straw 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.670
 a straw feed solvent as you 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.910
 call in your country and basically I'm going to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.250
 pass around this in order to 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.680
 form the sepal 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.100
 once I have the sepal formed by 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.180
 the rose in this way because my straw 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.240
 It is green but also if they have 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.460
 a straw food straw of another color 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.650
 They can do what I 'm doing now 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.760
 which is basically basically a 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.520
 technique to cover what would be the basis 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.640
 of our roses in addition to what would be 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.220
 the stem of our rose 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.110
 we can do the same thing again now 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.709
 I'm going to take a piece of duct tape 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.280
 a little bit longer to cover the base 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.810
 whole of the rose or the stem once 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.290
 I have the stem covered in this 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.200
 way then I can cut what will be 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.360
 excess on top of the rose 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.660
 as well as at the bottom of the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.350
 roses 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.140
 once I have my stem covered and my 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.530
 Separate it and my rose a little bit 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.740
 more natural then I can take a 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.860
 piece of green tape 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.010
 to form the sheet I'm basically 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.550
 taking about four inches and 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.100
 He folded it in half and I'm going to leave a 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.490
 little bit of exposed adhesive tape 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.710
 so that once the sheet is formed 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.670
 stick the leaf to what is the stem of 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.480
 the roses 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.890
 this can be done with their children 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.320
 trimming the parts that are going to 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.650
 use to form roses by 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.880
 example pre cutting the leaves 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:28.630
 trimming the petals of the rose and so 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.650
 have all the elements already 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.690
 by hand to form the roses this is the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.670
 last step of our project and I hope 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.620
 that everyone liked it since it was 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.690
 a project well requested by the majority 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.740
 of the people who see our show 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.740
 see you later 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:00.739
 or not
