and of course it changes with every

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.949 
and of course it changes with every
different<00:02:21.970> blast<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.780> particular

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
the hits on the base just like this

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.550 
the hits on the base just like this
this<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.330> most<00:02:53.540> difficult<00:02:53.750> part<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
this is the most difficult part of the

this is the most difficult part of the
drum<00:02:54.830> beat<00:02:55.010> because<00:02:55.220> your<00:02:56.090> hand<00:02:56.360> has<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.660> do

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
something that would be normally more

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.610 
something that would be normally more
comfortable<00:02:58.850> both<00:02:59.090> hands<00:02:59.390> doing<00:02:59.660> that's<00:03:00.350> the

comfortable both hands doing that's the

comfortable both hands doing that's the
whole<00:03:00.650> magic<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.640> drum<00:03:02.030> beat<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
whole magic of this drum beat is that it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.460 
sounds inhuman there's there's a trick
to<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.390> lot<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.720> people<00:03:05.930> call<00:03:06.050> it<00:03:06.200> flying

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
to this a lot of people call it flying

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.140 
to this a lot of people call it flying
fingers<00:03:06.800> or<00:03:07.220> whatever<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.670> don't<00:03:07.820> have<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.970> name

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
fingers or whatever I don't have a name

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.930 
fingers or whatever I don't have a name
for<00:03:08.210> it<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.680> technique<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.370> creating

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
for it but the the technique is creating

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.030 
for it but the the technique is creating
a<00:03:11.000> fulcrum<00:03:11.450> on<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.930> drum<00:03:12.140> stick<00:03:12.380> with<00:03:12.680> your

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
a fulcrum on the drum stick with your

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.740 
a fulcrum on the drum stick with your
two<00:03:13.310> fingers<00:03:13.520> here<00:03:13.910> your<00:03:14.300> thumb<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:14.690> your

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
two fingers here your thumb and your

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.360 
two fingers here your thumb and your
forefinger<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.260> using<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.800> other<00:03:15.920> three

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
forefinger and using the other three

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.990 
forefinger and using the other three
fingers<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:17.390> make<00:03:17.990> up<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.520> levee<00:03:19.520> oh<00:03:19.550> yeah<00:03:19.820> you

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
fingers to make up a levee oh yeah you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.940 
fingers to make up a levee oh yeah you
can<00:03:20.240> see<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.420> if<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.990> see<00:03:21.170> my<00:03:21.320> three<00:03:21.620> fingers

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
can see it if you see my three fingers

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.160 
can see it if you see my three fingers
there<00:03:22.130> you're<00:03:22.280> making<00:03:22.610> it<00:03:22.760> you're<00:03:23.720> using<00:03:23.930> it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
there you're making it you're using it

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.410 
there you're making it you're using it
to<00:03:24.320> push<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.920> stick<00:03:25.130> down<00:03:25.460> creating<00:03:26.180> this

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
to push the stick down creating this

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.270 
to push the stick down creating this
part<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.840> stick<00:03:27.050> push<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.980> stick<00:03:28.100> up

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
part of the stick push the stick up

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.920 
part of the stick push the stick up
actually<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.880> making<00:03:29.390> this<00:03:29.480> portion<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:29.870> the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
actually and making this portion of the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.290 
actually and making this portion of the
stick<00:03:30.110> move<00:03:30.320> down<00:03:30.530> now<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.760> seems<00:03:32.090> easy

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
stick move down now that seems easy

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.910 
stick move down now that seems easy
enough<00:03:32.480> except<00:03:33.260> for<00:03:33.290> when<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.620> put<00:03:33.770> it<00:03:33.860> on

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
enough except for when you put it on

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.140 
enough except for when you put it on
your<00:03:34.070> snare<00:03:34.400> you're<00:03:34.640> going<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.820> get<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.940> little

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
your snare you're going to get a little

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.200 
your snare you're going to get a little
bit<00:03:35.240> of<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:35.390> bounce<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:36.910> had<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.030> sit<00:03:38.150> and

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
bit of a bounce I had to sit and

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.700 
bit of a bounce I had to sit and
practice<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:38.720> on<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.900> practice<00:03:39.260> pad<00:03:39.440> for<00:03:39.680> a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
practice this on a practice pad for a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.470 
practice this on a practice pad for a
good<00:03:40.040> long<00:03:40.190> time<00:03:40.250> before<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.850> was<00:03:41.030> able<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.360> get

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
good long time before I was able to get

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.200 
good long time before I was able to get
a<00:03:41.540> good<00:03:41.780> clean<00:03:42.310> single<00:03:43.310> strike<00:03:43.700> out<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.060> my

a good clean single strike out of my
right<00:03:45.020> hand<00:03:45.320> it's<00:03:45.590> really<00:03:46.100> really<00:03:46.580> hard<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:47.000> do

right hand it's really really hard to do

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.940
