 or the youtube people mister this new 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:14.230
 video on how you can get the 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.530

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.660
 how to save the current one and it is safe then 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.380
 I feel we have to do to 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.050
 get them is to come between eleven and 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.270
 mean in the morning in the game not 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.769
 matter what you want at this point on the map 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.769
 without a parachute 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:47.740
 and well then once we are here 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.040
 we will be able to appreciate that to see how 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:55.030
 a dream like a guy together they are not 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.379
 checking the satellites the satellites 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.379
 Well, how do you see here? 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 the police the fbi and the buffalo 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.970
 Well, I'm going to talk about the buffalo 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.690
 then I'm going for the car and if I do not 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.570
 kill I will not be able to perfect it well 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.340
 Well, they do not give them good stars 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.259
 in three levels of search 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.329
 and finally talk to save it in 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.329
 our garage as you see in general 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.140
 to save it first obviously 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 let's go to our garage I 'll 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.550
 mark here and here I will want me 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.340
 I confuse I'm going to make a little one a 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.070
 small post and when would be from the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.590
 fixed how to save it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.229
 well then once we get to your 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.630
 garage was made at night because they had 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.160
 small problems out there but then 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.600
 It is arranged well once 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.440
 we arrived at your garage what we have to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.990
 do is 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.770
 to put it to put the car to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.540
 garage is to stick the car in this way 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.060
 the garage so well and is well glued 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.440
 and get off when we get off we have 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.880
 to start running for us 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.560
 stop at the door and thus be able to do 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.980
 the lic 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.230
 the trick as we are by the fast 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.430
 and if we are lucky enough to us 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.400
 first 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.680
 here it looks 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.950
 So if that happens to you, do not worry 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.550
 simply 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.550
 to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.390
 to the box vat gates this sector 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.450
 It depends on what game platform 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.709
 once we are inside the garage 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.709
 we do not go out 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.980
 other times we have here 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.150
 and it has not been known 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.730
 i 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.990
 and we have the door open 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:22.080
 and anybody and turn your back on 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.540
 garage 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.900
 and point the water and walk the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.909
 figures 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.000
 towards the door of our 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.450
 car so what are we like this we press 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.290
 we got on the car 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.290
 and ready 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.290
 in question that's like saving it as 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.860
 come is not insured 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.860
 without insuring 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.340
 to ensure what we need to do 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.030
 is any vehicle that we have 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.660
 securing 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.990
 We do not have to destroy, I'm going to try 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.990
 this 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.040
 we take it out of the garage 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.870
 all right 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.220
 and once we leave simply what 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.540
 we say 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.540
 eggs of 4 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.020
 I am 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.330
 what 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.330
 I have to remove the police with Lester 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.510
 well once we saw it we went back to 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.510
 put into the garage 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.370
 we also study between 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.230
 and well once we enter 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.960
 our garage we are going to have our 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:08.630
 vehicle the buffalo or the van 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.630
 fbi the one we have chosen 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.270
 we take it 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.930
 and before they do not leave the garage 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.650
 yet but let's see contacts and 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.650
 let's go to lunch 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.430
 to claim the insurance of the vehicle that 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.430
 we did 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.700
 now yes when we are when they give us 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.980
 this menu is about this option we are going to 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.930
 leave the garage and when it has been 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.650
 the animation of the output we are going to 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.950
 press 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.310
 to claim the vehicle and say yes 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.860
 and well then once there is something 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.220
 they have done it this way exactly as I did 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.220
 it says 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.020
 I keep the has insured your vehicle 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.289
 of the fbi 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.590
 and whenever you lose it, that's not what 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.270
 they will be able to recover and to show them 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.810
 that is already completely insured already 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.900
 that we completely 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.880
 there is efe and best of it or how to say 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.350

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.350
 the vehicle can not be modified 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.009
 because you can not modify any 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.009
 Advertising vehicle can modify 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:34.070
 and it can be done with all vehicles 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.930
 police 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.530
 how do you see the insured list in this 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.530

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:47.780
 I am here also insured 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:51.490
