flank it with a six millimeter bicone on
each<00:02:26.410> end<00:02:29.280> now<00:02:30.280> once<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.700> string<00:02:31.000> up<00:02:31.150> that

each end now once you string up that

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.530 
each end now once you string up that
section<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.200> push<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.620> together<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
section and you push it together the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.600 
section and you push it together the
crystals<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:35.320> naturally<00:02:35.920> start<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.340> clump

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
crystals just naturally start to clump

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.300 
crystals just naturally start to clump
up<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.150> they<00:02:37.750> get<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.140> clustered<00:02:38.740> spiky

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
up and they get that clustered spiky

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.610 
up and they get that clustered spiky
look<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.210> it's<00:02:40.360> really<00:02:40.630> simple<00:02:41.050> there's<00:02:41.410> no

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
look so it's really simple there's no

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.430 
look so it's really simple there's no
trick<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.250> all<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.330> do<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.750> string

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
trick to it all you have to do is string

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.700 
trick to it all you have to do is string
it<00:02:44.560> up<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.980> then<00:02:45.310> scrunch<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.210> together<00:02:46.710> once

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
it up and then scrunch it together once

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.350 
it up and then scrunch it together once
you've<00:02:47.890> done<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.130> you're<00:02:48.940> going<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.150> take

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.420 
second section the one that looks like a
pair<00:03:49.570> of<00:03:49.660> lips<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.140> you're<00:03:50.920> going<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.130> squish

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
pair of lips and you're going to squish

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.550 
pair of lips and you're going to squish
it<00:03:51.670> this<00:03:52.300> is<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.720> flatten<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.200> bead<00:03:53.380> and

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
it this is going to flatten the bead and

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.140 
it this is going to flatten the bead and
put<00:03:53.710> a<00:03:53.740> dent<00:03:54.040> straight<00:03:54.400> down<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.760> center<00:03:54.790> of

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
put a dent straight down the center of

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.060 
put a dent straight down the center of
it<00:03:55.390> then<00:03:56.320> you're<00:03:56.530> going<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.710> turn<00:03:57.040> that

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
it then you're going to turn that

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.580 
it then you're going to turn that
flattened<00:03:57.790> section<00:03:58.210> on<00:03:58.330> its<00:03:58.510> side<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.170> you're

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
flattened section on its side and you're

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.080 
flattened section on its side and you're
going<00:03:59.740> to<00:03:59.800> put<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.040> in<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.220> front<00:04:00.430> portion<00:04:00.940> of

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
going to put it in the front portion of

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.670 
going to put it in the front portion of
your<00:04:01.180> crimper<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:01.780> that's<00:04:02.260> going<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.530> take

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
your crimper and that's going to take

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.060 
your crimper and that's going to take
that<00:04:02.920> dent<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.460> it's<00:04:03.640> going<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.850> fold<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.300> over

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
that dent and it's going to fold it over

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.530 
that dent and it's going to fold it over
so<00:04:06.070> it's<00:04:06.280> essentially<00:04:06.820> squishing<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.420> and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so it's essentially squishing it and

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.720 
so it's essentially squishing it and
folding<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:07.960> over<00:04:08.080> twice<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.830> it's<00:04:09.430> far<00:04:09.670> more

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
folding it over twice and it's far more

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.910 
folding it over twice and it's far more
secure<00:04:10.330> than<00:04:10.480> using<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:11.080> pair<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.650> chain<00:04:11.860> nose

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
secure than using a pair of chain nose

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.700 
secure than using a pair of chain nose
pliers<00:04:12.460> I<00:04:12.940> know<00:04:13.360> people<00:04:13.660> still<00:04:14.080> do<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.290> but<00:04:14.560> it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
pliers I know people still do it but it

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.890 
pliers I know people still do it but it
really<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:15.100> more<00:04:15.910> effective<00:04:16.420> using<00:04:16.810> the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
really is more effective using the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.890 
really is more effective using the
crimper<00:04:17.260> it's<00:04:17.470> far<00:04:17.710> more<00:04:17.739> secure<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.900> that's

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
crimper it's far more secure and that's

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.520 
crimper it's far more secure and that's
it<00:04:20.080> all<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.620> have<00:04:20.770> to<00:04:20.920> do<00:04:21.100> is<00:04:21.340> string<00:04:21.820> up

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
it all you have to do is string up

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.150 
it all you have to do is string up
a<00:04:22.910> section<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:23.970> crystals<00:04:24.420> in<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.630> front<00:04:25.160> some

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
a section of crystals in the front some

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.100 
a section of crystals in the front some
accent<00:04:26.639> crystals<00:04:27.060> going<00:04:27.360> up<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.630> body<00:04:27.810> and

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
accent crystals going up the body and

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.700 
accent crystals going up the body and
then<00:04:28.920> you're<00:04:29.130> going<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.310> crimp<00:04:29.639> on<00:04:30.500> your<00:04:31.500> end

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
then you're going to crimp on your end

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.340 
then you're going to crimp on your end
