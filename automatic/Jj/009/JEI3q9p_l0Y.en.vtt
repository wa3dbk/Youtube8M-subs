 false 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.569
 hi everyone is here so today we're going to do a little test of 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.419
 iphone speedware 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.680
 reading this book is published in writing because it has developed through 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.230
 boxing frequencies 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.620
 while 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.680
 the race but I can 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 I prefer to say that it is one of the memos perpetual race 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.239
 that's a lot but to justify why 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.970
 the chase 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.720
 enter the menu 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.940
 so what did you think of this tournament that will be played in the innovation of the player 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 basic marking 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.380
 so it's a race fact has been drafted because you have everything a 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.070
 low level system 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.180
 so I would rather high 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.040
 here 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.470
 you can gain levels which seems to unlock 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.670
 it is to say if 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.870
 for it to be 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.470
 the power level that this visual 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.500
 eight others 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.720
 jacques mode samarut visual power 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.810
 e then 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.470
 of cugnaux already shows a few cars 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.470
 austria four titles 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.300
 later to catch up since he posted yesterday about twenty 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.980
 car thefts 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.970
 % 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.870
 his parents are all the time 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.550
 3i basically the first 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 after the beautiful you can buy monster 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.530
 normal so we treated schengen 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.600
 young unemployed marceau too long 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.640
 the critics and it's not enough anymore you also have to 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.259
 what happens at 40% the Belgian cyclist 15 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.580
 toyota corolla 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.160
 eva ziegler on the wozniak court after we go to cars a little bit more 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.059
 powerful no comment audi s5 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.049
 bmw z4 t 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.299
 I am a young stylist Maxime simoëns cooking 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.399
 especially as the level of cars 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.579
 grossomodo will be posted 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.659
 some structures 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.479
 the biggest modo 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.679
 we start with cars 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:36.570
 1-2 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.769
 the fan club of friends of the ardenne in real life 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.769
 in fact we pass car 3000 ha ha 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.939
 and then we go cars 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.099
 big luxury 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.479
 back to the luxury of him I'm luxor berlitz anyway 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.219
 but the second project that is 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.439
 corvette of silica 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.569
 gallardo 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.079
 and then Saturday and ancient theater 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.419
 one of his favorites 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.559
 while 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:09.949
 woods did not pass daniel's turn 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.889
 the story 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.889
 35 hours 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.479
 % and I'm going to talk more about matte skin 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.510
 the poor is especially what makes you think of buying at home because beyond 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.929
 levels that do not make 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.059
 from more than 30 companies 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.059
 it gets normal with 37 9% 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:35.559
 then in points 20% per year as the game is entirely in English is 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:36.919
 has been playing better since its beginnings 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.229
 the center of london ambühl is also taken to the commander m to see 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.349
 if this translated into French guilty 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.609
 so 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.859
 you can do one of those who are poor bocsa on the subject I do not know 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.309
 why do not I know because it's exactly 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:56.069
 we have words that can block the traffic on the first of the race of 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.599
 closing against withdrawals in a group 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.599
 thomas lüthi which allows to recharge all skills 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.719
 for the poor by demonstrating its skills within this reactor 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.579
 I like to do 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.309
 for 100 euros the moral neuron after the siege is to Toulouse his daughter 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.019
 that is to say if you are lucky second you feel that you 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.299
 can tell his opponents that he is almost exhausted a last turn stock 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.729
 and 47% 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.169
 little more for peace appear more and more clues about the stay 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.880
 of more than three his opponents the game is worth it in fact you would do what 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.969
 another idea of ​​this fact almost a year 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.969
 it's special for prosecution 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.580
 the reception that police have because the possibility always has this 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.879
 which allows to associate the members 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.380
 with telecom 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.110
 discover it the pursuit pretending 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.039
 I tell you what I feel good and I did not understand everything I'm sorry but 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.009
 if your opinion 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 the paths I work very well 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.580
 nitro because I like it too much this time it is specified in the form of 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.199
 apple vote 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.490
 or common skills I said 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.870
 so that makes you a little bit that day 148 meters of a course 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.229
 to wrestle with that dream 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.210
 hourly index 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.569
 this week 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.569
 the arranged wants of this perilous to escape 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.909
 flattering drama that you have% and maybe costs of lawsuits 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.370
 this stop we did it 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.370
 and chile the shield that allows france 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.830
 used against the poor others 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.770
 there are others% it is thus visible that if it should also 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.960
 than 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.589
 the group adds since yesterday 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:42.009
 and the supervisor of all this sale had iron this week 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.520
 so then these thieves in addition attributed 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.089
 in the different circus modes racing circuits that you're going to have 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.610
 that is to say the back of the man 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.699
 basically we see rats that is normal 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.199
 not without basic sequence nor too much of the kind who want to live 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.539
 I will not take any other 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.559
 racing circuit 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:09.709
 traffic maniette stmicro j was small we continue the life of amanda blood 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:12.839
 flowing foot agencé will say that I find a misfortune 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.070
 coralie too much for the priest sprint sporting club series i think i 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.520
 I'm not going to touch that much because 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.520
 5 okay even though I did not understand everything around 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.979
 so that's so this racing is also the skill of an umbrella in rpg 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.600
 that you choose ideas about what you want to be able ladies 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.800
 we find our skills 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.099
 a fake 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.029
 show them the notes from alaska 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.499
 thales on a parapet it happened to win against 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.460
 so 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.080
 acea source games
