00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 I love you , it's me again 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.430
 a long time ago but now I am in old age 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.109
 get back fresh and it will be 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.589
 again regular videos of me 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.210
 come 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.490
 I had a very stressful 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.099
 Clausurphase and now it's all over 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.630
 and I have time again and have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 pretty much planned and happy 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.880
 also extremely today you see from 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 me my favorite month and that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.350
 it's about the month of february 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 and if your interest have what 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.070
 I especially like products in february 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 like to have then stay up 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 In any case, my first product 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.670
 I want you to meet the anna 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.640
 heat spray from l'oréal 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 I watched it at a youtube 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 but I can not call me at 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.590
 rain that was 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.379
 if you have seen this could be here 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.850
 sign or something I know 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.680
 it's no longer because I like that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.539
 many youtube already in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 my list and also shivering 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.649
 therefore I do not know exactly 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.059
 Something comes up but because now price 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.750
 I have to say I am very very 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.910
 picky 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 So I had everything from John Frieda 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.359
 I once tried out of that 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 try barbershop and I think 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.619
 with heat spray that is always so lets 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.799
 So they totally become hair after that 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.960
 so sticky and somehow so hard and so on 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.150
 I really want my hair in 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.970
 but only to protect oneself from the senses 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.220
 not extremely steep so annoying me 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.159
 This hairspray effect the most 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.920
 have heat protection agent for me and yes 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.960
 I searched for a long time and exactly a few 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 Schwimmerin mentioned this and me 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 as I said I do not know who but me 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.229
 am very grateful to her in any case because 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.060
 that it is absolutely super there are three 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.280
 There are different but there are volume lure 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
 and smooth and then over three each 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.580
 days from this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.500
 creates and yes so I have that now 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.790
 volume was from time to time makes me login from 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.590
 and i do with straight hair and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 then I did not want to commit myself there 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.520
 I just wanted both hairstyles because 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.810
 have, each with volume so 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.030
 I decided to do it 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.590
 it smells divine and I find it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.020
 just does not stick your hair like that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.850
 my other products and that's why 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.289
 it's a big favorite so every 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.899
 when I share my hair now 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.850
 then I do it purely and today also 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.190
 they are still supple 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.450
 and are just not as glued as with 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.970
 the other products I have so far 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.620
 So I've tested a very big one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.110
 Lover for me this month 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.459
 my next product is once and that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.530
 I would not have thought of myself 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.360
 buy with my problematic house 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.220
 I actually mostly products 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.459
 from the pharmacy or leave me 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.989
 prescribe my skin doctors and 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.310
 This time I thought okay for that 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.120
 maybe a little something from the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.130
 because I'm not because of that 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.560
 opinion that the expensive always the same 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.640
 better than cheap products and me 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.680
 Think if you look at the right one 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.390
 then ingredients can pay attention 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.400
 cheap or drugstore products certainly 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.320
 also have their appeal and here I have 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 but the m looked around and am up 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.769
 the garnier clear what a game came 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 Revolution because I am there after the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.600
 come and have it here once 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.730
 for finished to impurities prone 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.269
 I can definitely skin anyone 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.600
 recommend 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:07.500
 I get it said neither 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.990
 exciting skin even more 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.160
 impurities as I do not react 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.870
 It is definitely negative 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.760
 great and I have it almost now 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.770
 half full used for about two 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.600
 months and so I have to say it is 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.980
 I am super happy that I am 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.980
 It may have been found on everyone 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.480
 If any of you recommend the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.460
 my videos are a bit longer 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.460
 I know that I actually 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:35.440
 my power and my bronze about everything 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.510
 Love and that the products are the ones I 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.730
 actually so to marry and 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.940
 control constantly used now 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.500
 I got married with sleep 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.480
 I was on the side and I am 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.040
 by blanches super excited and 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.720
 that's why I thought okay try 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.490
 something different and here I 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.190
 found the face account child 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:59.340
 Here is once in the container 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:02.110
 both rider and bronze or 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.700
 contoured brother almost because it 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.110
 There is no real orange there 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.390
 light therefore can it also good for 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.810
 use contours and I have 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.140
 I did not even get that 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.380
 I did not bother with that, okay 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.620
 because I'm my next product 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.390
 once the cola liner of p2 and over 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.220
 I've used it more often 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.810
 Pattex and I do not know if I'm in 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.370
 mentioned my year's favorites 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.390
 but since the case definitely would 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.460
 great fit 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.860
 that's a skin-colored little one 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.240
 or kajal and I always wear it 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.229
 So on the waterline on white 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.630
 Christmas is always for the waterline 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.750
 a bit problematic because of her 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.000
 just as stand out from yours 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.949
 natural color on the 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.780
 Waterline is so much 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.729
 Fast artificial looks from there 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.470
 I always try somehow more in the 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.539
 groove or beige or rosé direction 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.949
 go around easier with one eye 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.229
 to offer effect 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.880
 and yes then I'm actually very much 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.229
 well, there are things like that 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.210
 maybelline i believe the cost around that 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.860
 five euro p2 is of course one 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.050
 unbeatable price i think i have 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.310
 I already shot my next 190 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.080
 Product and sand become me 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.789
 probably many ask because the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.800
 most popular question is about what 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.630
 you wear on your lips and that is 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.270
 also my new favorite because this 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.039
 month I have worn him constantly and 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.449
 that is once from l'oreal the coal 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:31.440
 rieschen in the color 257 square and it is 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.389
 everything so unbelievably beautiful old 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.669
 pink color so actually the colors 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.909
 I use my lips in everyday life 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.210
 I like wearing most of my clothes 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:45.720
 color type as far as everyday life is concerned 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.070
 when i go out then and she does 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.509
 I wear that on my lips 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.130
 he looks a bit too 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.900
 with ginger out because I'm still there 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.150
 I can mix another color 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.669
 In any case, I recommend any further 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.580
 love the l'oréal kolorit lipsticks 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.830
 I think they are just colors 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.699
 intense and yet 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.639
 moisturizing and who is there 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.469
 a good 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.789
 who wants to afford good things then 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.560
 that can definitely be on this 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.680
 I can resort to lipsticks 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.930
 Highly recommend 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.330
 my penultimate product and I am 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.130
 curious how you react to it 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.659
 I've talked about it so often 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.460
 What are you doing with your hair 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.630
 cut off for you makes another 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.810
 color or do you make a pony and 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.180
 Whatever and I have one 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.520
 had little idea what the ponies 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.170
 concerns and I'm very curious what 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.350
 Of course, you would think so too 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.440
 super happy if we would communicate that 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.450
 In any case, I have thought about it 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.800
 you get a pony now i know yeah 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.520
 we will not try it out like that first 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.520
 would look like 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.580
 I do not know what do you think about it 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.440
 I've been thinking for a long time and I'm too 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.250
 The decision was just something 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.380
 to be true and yes that's my pony 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.420
 it is currently straight and on the other hand 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.740
 a little bit longer 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.110
 Write me the comments here 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.920
 will find out if that suits me or if it is 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.660
 Absolute fallacy would be and I say 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.730
 would of course was I can not 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.650
 conjure up and all at once from a moment 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.200
 have on the other a pony that is 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.000
 a clip in the pony and I'm awesome 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.980
 Loved the quality I have 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.600
 I ordered them from Amazon 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.520
 now already out writing me in 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.900
 the comments how he finds that 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.580
 most did not ask are there 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.020
 Not that excited I am 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.120
 always a bit skeptical I think 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.240
 opinion in front of the effective pony 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.970
 quickly dangerous and that was it
