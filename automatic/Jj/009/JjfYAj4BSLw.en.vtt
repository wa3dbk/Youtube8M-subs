okay<00:00:00.810> well<00:00:00.960> here's<00:00:01.290> my<00:00:01.410> solution<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.920> the

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
okay well here's my solution to the

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.880 
okay well here's my solution to the
solenoid<00:00:02.610> for<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.480> flippers<00:00:03.929> so<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.740> get

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
solenoid for the flippers so you get

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.980 
solenoid for the flippers so you get
that<00:00:05.069> authentic<00:00:05.279> sound<00:00:05.790> went<00:00:06.569> ahead<00:00:06.660> went<00:00:06.930> to

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
that authentic sound went ahead went to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.849 
that authentic sound went ahead went to

here<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> demonstrate<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.759> does

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
here just to demonstrate what it does

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
here just to demonstrate what it does
basically<00:00:33.690> put<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> ground<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
basically put the ground it right there

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
basically put the ground it right there
and<00:00:36.030> yeah<00:00:37.940> there<00:00:38.940> right<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.390> thumps

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and yeah there right there and thumps

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
and yeah there right there and thumps
give<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:42.260> solenoid<00:00:43.260> action<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.829> wasn't

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
give that solenoid action I wasn't

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.889 
give that solenoid action I wasn't
really<00:00:44.789> happy<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> wasn't

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
really happy with it because it wasn't

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
really happy with it because it wasn't
loud<00:00:46.260> enough<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> did<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.000> take

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
loud enough so what I did is I take

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.940 
loud enough so what I did is I take
check<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.660> these<00:00:48.840> rivets<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.680> four

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
check out these rivets on all four

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.740 
check out these rivets on all four
corners<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.500> inside<00:00:52.910> it's<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.239> baffle

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
corners and inside it's a little baffle

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.700 
corners and inside it's a little baffle
that<00:00:55.340> keeps<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> quiet<00:00:57.140> well<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.320> don't<00:00:58.469> want

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that keeps it quiet well we don't want

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.349 
that keeps it quiet well we don't want
it<00:00:58.829> quiet<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.820> bit<00:00:59.969> louder

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it quiet we want a little bit louder

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.770 
it quiet we want a little bit louder
so<00:01:00.899> take<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> rivets<00:01:02.219> off<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.510> tapped

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so take the rivets off then we tapped

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410 
so take the rivets off then we tapped
the<00:01:04.229> screws<00:01:04.559> give<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.790> space<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the screws give it a little space so the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
the screws give it a little space so the
air<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> sound<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.130> out

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
air can get out the sound we can get out

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.440 
air can get out the sound we can get out
a<00:01:08.310> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.670> better<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> hear<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
a little bit better and you can hear the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.700 
a little bit better and you can hear the
difference<00:01:17.780> once<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> mounted

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
difference once I have this mounted

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.080 
difference once I have this mounted
inside<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> cabinet<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:22.400> face<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.939> here

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
inside the cabinet that face right here

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
inside the cabinet that face right here
will<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.479> against<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.930> wood<00:01:27.590> push<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.860> on

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
will be up against the wood push down on

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
will be up against the wood push down on
it<00:01:33.020> I'll<00:01:34.020> run<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.560> 12<00:01:34.860> volts<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:36.750> power<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it I'll run off 12 volts and to power it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.480 
it I'll run off 12 volts and to power it
up<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:38.070> an<00:01:38.189> extra<00:01:38.640> spare<00:01:39.740> laptop<00:01:40.740> power

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
