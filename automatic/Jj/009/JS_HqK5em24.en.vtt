00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.370
 another guest named volcano john his 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.130
 steam will be in the description of the video 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.630
 for now it does not occupy channel so only 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.140
 they can hire him for steam 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.450
 and good today we continue with the house but 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.640
 this time we are going to do as 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.010
 I do not know how other parts for the house 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.010
 like stairs and things like that 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.370
 well what we are going to do first is going to 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.190
 be a ramp the ramp we do it with a 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.950
 wood on platform that I explain to this 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.950
 in the previous video 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.600
 we need a wing platform and 4 wood 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.810
 in his because this we do creation or 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.150
 sticks and gives us the wood in ram good to 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.890
 this I can not place it for now 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.960
 because I need to have for example this 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.290
 roof do not see that it does not have to be what 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.850
 we'll put more or less around there to see if 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.850
 maybe it happens that I put it here 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.550
 Well, he put me here now like that but it's 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.170
 so they can see it like this we can go up 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.110
 and everything now that they have to do other 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.680
 things over here so it is not so bad 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 what we will do now are stairs for 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.740
 make stairs we need sticks 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.740
 and tape that would be like tape 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.360
 Well this can be placed in the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.970
 walls to climb to places 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.230
 these things well what are we going to do 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.880
 now they are the door of the house 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.340
 for this we need 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.200
 a good inframen that we do this 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.420
 making wood after wood in 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.409
 plate and the wing place gave us in the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.520
 frame and we need volts that 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.500
 for this 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.280
 to take out to find the bolts 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 we only search for cities 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.300
 well we have the door I can 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.300
 put here 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.940
 We open it like this 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.959
 good and what the only thing left for 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.290
 explain now is that I do not know if they are going 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.849
 to use a lot but with a pillar what 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.800
 What we can do is place in the kraft 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.980
 eo and we cut it in half with nothing 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.870
 we put it and not give the wood in post 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.250
 this one that would give us two of this would be 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.800
 as 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.110
 I do not know why they want to place it in 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.740
 some side I do not know well yet I've never 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.740
 used this 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.970
 to see if I can place it on the roof 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.710
 we can do it this way to create 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.600
 that you can make a boat 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.170
 barricade as well as half of a wall 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.150
 so that all those good things do not happen 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.040
 an interesting fact that I wanted them 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 tell is also that if we place 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.840
 wood and a mountain here would give us 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.319
 I only tell you that so that 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.140
 know for those who did not know 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.069
