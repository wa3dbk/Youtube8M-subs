still<00:01:30.630> live<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.280> mostly<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.429> of<00:01:32.639> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
still live it mostly because of the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.279 
still live it mostly because of the
curse<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:34.399> it<00:01:35.539> not<00:01:36.539> going<00:01:36.719> to<00:01:36.780> break<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> sub

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
curse but it not going to break the sub

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.300

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
he goes I go yeah I'll go out to donphan
basically<00:02:44.770> gonna<00:02:44.950> go<00:02:45.130> for<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> earthquake

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
basically gonna go for the earthquake

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.670 
basically gonna go for the earthquake
but<00:02:46.030> I'm<00:02:46.300> predicting<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.080> switch<00:02:47.350> back<00:02:47.650> to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
but I'm predicting a switch back to

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.170 
but I'm predicting a switch back to
something<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.130> will<00:02:48.310> completely<00:02:48.610> dodge<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
something that will completely dodge it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.449 
something that will completely dodge it
so<00:02:49.870> I'm<00:02:49.990> went<00:02:50.170> with<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.320> thunder<00:02:50.680> fang<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.070> it

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
so I'm went with a thunder fang and it

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.259 
so I'm went with a thunder fang and it
missed<00:02:51.700> flip<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.870> missed<00:02:53.550> its<00:02:54.550> choice<00:02:54.940> banded

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
missed flip and missed its choice banded

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.280 
missed flip and missed its choice banded
so<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.440> was<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.430> bold<00:02:57.700> when<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.510> flipping<00:02:58.930> missed

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
so I was so bold when it flipping missed

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.580 
so I was so bold when it flipping missed
I<00:02:59.620> I<00:03:00.100> can't<00:03:00.550> believe<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:01.200> now<00:03:02.200> I'm<00:03:02.350> trying<00:03:02.500> to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.310 
I I can't believe that now I'm trying to
figure<00:03:02.769> out<00:03:02.920> what<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.190> should<00:03:03.280> switch<00:03:03.670> out<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
figure out what I should switch out to
