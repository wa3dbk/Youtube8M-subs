00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.240
 Hello and welcome to the second part forward Ax 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.369
 Gensler 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:15.609
 I do not even want to drum around this Freyer and I'll just go 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:22.069
 I start happily as I said five new App Store today 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.169
 Of course I also 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.929
 would like to introduce 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.939
 now the very nice ones are the first EP 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.609
 I have there 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.499
 tiny 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.650
 Avery 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.679
 once in it 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:37.660
 it is leak 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.080
 and you can do that 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.220
 his PC remote control is yes by 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.070
 Sinners for all is nothing new 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.780
 What is really so empty in the case is the following and 2 at least short 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.030
 outside I can show my de sample pictures 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.640
 since my Mac Book action is Elsner here 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.580
 I'll go for a while 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.160
 I decided briefly 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.390
 and we see yes 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.120
 Ellwürden 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.860
 and then Dr 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.350
 wait a moment 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.260
 and how do you see it? 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.640
 Öhler an EEV in front and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.870
 a pet 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.909
 and new trends 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.409
 Screenshot to see Cameron has the extra the panels 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.350
 for example Word of Warcraft 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.440
 for which human error and with hot Thurman can flash videos 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.060
 look at it and the super thing is years 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 you see all the videos and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.400
 Game in 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.470
 at least 2 30 frames per second 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.450
 So to cover and 30 frames Busacca entire first ipad and 60 brakes short 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.330
 and is also in the second a no brainer 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.640
 according to percent four times and I have tried it once and it's true like her 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 have said it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.409
 All of this in any case was in the fall after that look over in July he is a very 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.580
 really nice 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.890
 then the next warm up is actually self-explanatory picture HD 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.239
 This also became free since the newest 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.279
 and around 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.109
 but is free only in the party Arge Wels ions 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.339
 but otherwise you had to pay 9 70 cents for it 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:25.879
 so for that 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.259
 that's it 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.909
 they increased very acutely and had now also made really chic 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:37.449
 The graphics are very well it's all home-wm percent MA nation and so small 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.100
 You can always live on ticker 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.169
 we would have optimized everything for this just perfect 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.500
 You can read about it very well 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.500
 everything too 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.999
 the next AP the IEC but I always get used market but again correctly 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.159
 hung so I can put my age right in 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.059
 is the following 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.539
 and Stampa rank 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:08.069
 Understood in copper probably promptly 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.620
 that's not the way to go 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.289
 but the man is also 9% 93 Kossert 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.519
 and that's where EPR goes 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.939
 I've been made bad that he will pay for not so much money again 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.539
 but if it is free, of course 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
 if I spend the money so you look at her 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.179
 you're a bit of a summer hummer man and man percent 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.719
 Dieter moves through the individual things young man's iPad up and down and 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.859
 to the left or right 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.919
 Commander left and right 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.569
 And now you just have to live just once, so you have to 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.819
 getting faster and faster 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.239
 and the shift Tat summer meant a lot of time for that 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.229
 and you have to spend a year on it when the different items come 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.309
 that one dodges it will be so must punishments is Arctic 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:58.109
 shut up 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.429
 but now it is going to be a very nice evening 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.099
 it is for itself 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.359
 very cool actually made but I want to embarrassing still no 93 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.459
 Meters so 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.019
 if it's now percent really long time again what should costs cost then 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:12.810
 I meant 'me 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.439
 do not buy 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.439
 it cost them in BIH King 9 70 cents 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.209
 and so the next corner I have when 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.150
 the Renault Sa a 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.270
 can be almost understood by myself I have really topical 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.390
 Player on the court 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.590
 Percent is very suboptimal 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.349
 around 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.849
 No, I would not 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.440
 dapd Müller I was briefly together 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.010
 around the two EPS in the background and s make them here in age where I am 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.740
 Euro is the big of all ages 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.539
 to Jutzi now all the time throughout an ear costs 59 o'clock 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.699
 around 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.580
 Maybe you pay for it, so it's so easy 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.469
 nicely done 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:01.370
 Wiesemann now for the Wanner numbers and you have to stop then percent 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.629
 of the order you have so over only 1 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.629
 and we were successful 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.469
 So here you just have to follow the order 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.459
 It's getting harder, of course, and then you just go to the end 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:21.840
 Percent that 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.150
 the respective ones here called in age 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.740
 it is also very nice 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.219
 in power 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.919
 the next thing we have is the following 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.919
 what I have to say dress manager 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.650
 it is unfortunately an iphone application 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.749
 around 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:45.480
 But what the fun now is not necessarily percent of the film in custody 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.270
 So that is very nicely done so to make it completely natural and 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.490
 you can play like this the graphics are not up to scratch 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.379
 not always hung up all admired 1 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.219
 and around 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.499
 Here you have to dress because so someone with their service significantly after 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:03.830
 lean forward to the back 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.629
 with the one with the driver 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.080
 and percent with Divine Gas and there you have to stop 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.319
 only that was the first mistake 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.860
 you have to stop before Lindemann Garzón 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.280
 and percent, of course, backwards "anyone gives no gas 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.570
 um and then there are so many key jumps and you have to 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:22.980
 sometimes make somersaults 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.660
 So it is very nice too 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.250
 So it's free, it's just around 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.379
 that not picture WDR always shows easy 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.569
 I hope by the mouth that you also liked that we almost 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.389
 Failed to thumbs up 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.580
 You do not necessarily have to do it if you do not have one 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.250
 what do you think of your sad 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.309
 around 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:48.309
 It is a pity that I had to be relatively soon this time 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.120
 So water was very deep he was the mandate of course the markets that I am 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:55.430
 do not see anymore 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.560
 not normal and a bit unprofessional 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.899
 he did everything 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.769
 Femininity today not so much time he which free of work came back 

00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:04.749
 am 

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.960
 but what are you interested in that? 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.199
 until then r 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.210
 first 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.699
 thus left the young ones
