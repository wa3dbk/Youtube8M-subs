00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.990
 everything is on the edge of it 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.670
 although that you already know the rest you will have 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.070
 to see it for yourself 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.619
 welcome to dubai gentlemen 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.020
 hello guys and girls that I've been waiting for 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.580
 also as always today I bring you my 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.920
 first impressions on the demo of the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.650
 campaign mode of spec ops the line is 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.320
 the game of tuca is available so much 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.790
 in playstation store as in xbox and 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.680
 good as you see is a third game 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.150
 person who called me a lot 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.070
 the attention in his first trailer his 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.720
 first two trailers the first one I think 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.160
 that was if I remember correctly in the in the 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.320
 e3 of 2010 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.690
 two years ago then it began to leave a 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.100
 little on the side was not taught anything and good 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.839
 this is the trailer I want to remember that 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.170
 It was already a gameplay I 'm not disappointed 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.120
 a little if after testing the demo 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.710
 some things have surprised me 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.440
 pleasantly but others have 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.750
 confirmed that disappointment that I had in 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.340
 its moment regarding the gameplay 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.600
 Well, I think you've searched for 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.180
 formula that gives success some 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.770
 software in the microsoft saga and I 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.450
 I think the worst thing of all is that I do not 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.920
 say anything in particular at least to me 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.690
 I'm talking from my point of view 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.649
 he does not say anything special to me and I think that 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.450
 it may be the worst thing that a 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.840
 video game not that is the playable part not 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.909
 tell you nothing special 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.869
 has its peculiarities obviously as 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.630
 the theme of interacting with 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.820
 arena scenarios of 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.710
 interact with the sand about everything but 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.920
 I do not know, it seems too forced 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.530
 too encrypted everything too much and not 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.509
 be limited perhaps on the other hand is the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.880
 plot story in the story itself 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.370
 of the game that I think is the big trick 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.020
 who has this game 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.190
 they are giving great importance to the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.600
 time to sell the game and the truth is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.040
 that to me yes that has left me wanting 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.530
 to know what happens 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.960
 and maybe that's what I'm left with 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.810
 after playing the demo not that I 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.690
 I am wanting to know not to live the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.970
 adventure not to know the history of this 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.670
 character which the truth seems to me 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.950
 impossible to be less charismatic not 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.050
 he has transmitted nothing special to me but 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 good has been a first sensation and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.780
 well many times we give them either 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.690
 they do justice to what the product is 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.520
 final, so I 'm not going to either 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.080
 judge him for it and well up here my 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.760
 first impressions on the demo of the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.320
 multiplayer I do not know anything because there's 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.570
 possibility to try it down the demo 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.920
 that weighs a kilo and a half exactly and 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.280
 play yourselves 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.660
 see you later chau chau 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.660
 with the conrad
