 they inspired in wrestling 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 especially in the king fighter 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.909
 mysterio for the current design of the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.769
 shirt from tri to díaz who is 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.629
 official sponsor of the selection

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.799
 they talk about why they were inspired by 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.439
 The design of the mask of King Mysterio 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.180

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.250
 the world of struggle 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.040
 we wanted him to show up on the shirt 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 in a bold and striking way not 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.990
 it's a million miles away 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.320
 of this culture should give the team 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.420
 a very strong image towards the world 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.420
 good for Mexicans and hopefully advance 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.159
 in World 2 something that has been 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.540
 sounding strong from spit could 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.030
 split up lemman mures now 30 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.800
 there is a rumor that the separation of 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.840
 skeletal group could occur in the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.180
 great event of wells germany though 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.100
 there is still no confirmed fight for 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.870
 the group for the event is thought to 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.170
 could face cane in which 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.150
 outlaws if so is expected to exist 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.430
 a betrayal against Roman king ins 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.470
 what would be the separation of the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.630
 group that has been very successful during 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.430
 its first year of existence these are 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.979
 only rumors and plans could 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.870
 change at any time this 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.110
 attitude and talk about returning to the fight 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.149
 professional free the former star of ww 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.970
 scotti 2 or spoke to you recently with 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.970
 brian fritz from the orlando sentinel here 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.130
 are some examples going back to the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.560
 wrestling after raul school I gave 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.750
 account last year I went to school 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.820
 of firefighters and to the technical school in 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.100
 medical emergencies and I graduated both 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.170
 things ended and I started looking for a 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.450
 work and I thought I was out of the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.400
 wrestling and then they gave me the call 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.440
 to go to world school and do that and 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 be there that day that I realized 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.360
 I can still do it, I do not want to be 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.670
 that guy embarrassing himself I know 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.340
 that was still 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.220
 I'm in better shape now than the last 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.380
 time I was there full time and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.540
 I just know that I can probably do 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.480
 this a few more years and at the level that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.390
 I want to do it I started taking some 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.090
 reservations I said during the past 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.130
 years that I'm just using this as a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.350
 vehicle to take me to different 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.319
 places that I've never been to 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.930
 Anyway just I went to Ecuador for 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.230
 first time south america for the first 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.269
 things in history so I say to 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.160
 my children I found a job that goes 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.930
 to pay a trip around the world with the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.170
 someone else's money and that's 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.120
 basically what I use for now 3 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.459
 brett art talks about how he lost his 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.920
 Daniel Bryan title in Germany and the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.870
 march of punk cm the interview is something 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.959
 long but listen to the recontra 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.049
 interesting about how he lost his first 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.090
 title of the wwf I really wanted 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.370
 to work with yoko in ures lehman and 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.950
 that's when I win the belt in 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.140
 October 92 was not like when gun 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.210
 had to work with a long list of 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.940
 talents that was so deep 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.070
 when I was champion the list had been 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.840
 reduced because of the tests of 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.110
 drugs and many of the big names 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.420
 they had left since Robert had gone 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.480
 and he was someone with whom he had to fight 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.580
 but that never happened also had to 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.800
 fight with ultimate warrior in the royal 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.590
 rumble and that never happened either 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.480
 then groove gun came back and told me 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.240
 vince that o gun had nothing to do 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.980
 with what was happening you can 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.230
 imagine how surprised he was 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.080
 when gun won the title in rest lehman 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.600
 he no longer sees he had not already agreed to win that 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.910
 I fought against yoko so I did not have any 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.580
 idea that my reign was going to be this way 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.440
 I would end so abruptly me 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.140
 They said that when I won the belt 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.460
 I was going to be a champion for a long time but 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.710
 at the same time 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.470
 vince told me with the title always 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.700
 anything can happen 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.220
 I felt that I had not had the opportunity 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.290
 to prove that he was good like me 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.110
 I thought it was about wells lehman and 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.060
 a-30 I hope you give daniel bryan his 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.490
 chance to win the title in ures 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.050
 telemanía since it has not had the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.050
 opportunity to be the champion 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.090
 that deserves to be hopefully this year a 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.030
 gray telemanía be a great achievement for 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.759
 daniel bryan on the abandonment of tm pam 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.069
 pam that is burned he always gives the 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.349
 100 x 100 in all its combats and has 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.590
 made some of the best bouts of 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.659
 ppb in the last 10 years should not 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.759
 be easy when there are legends that only 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.729
 they work part-time and types like 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.169
 punk and brian who do all the work 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.629
 It has to be hard for them to see 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.460
 someone like brock lesnar being part 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.440
 of the great battles without then 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.750
 have to be on the road all the 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.659
 time I think that had a lot to do 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.210
 with your decision and rightly one of the 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.969
 favorite phrases of vince mc mahon is the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.310
 life is not fair I do not see punk 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.469
 participating in a réstele mania but he 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.469
 still has a lot to offer from the 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.479
 greatness that he had as a fan I hope 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:50.940
 I come back and as a wrestler I have a great 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:55.530
 respect for him too 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.629
 4The WWS forget it feels punk dcm 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.659
 offended triple h by the refusal of 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.580
 punk to work with him according quinn cyber 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.099
 there is a 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.680
 that probably triple h will not admit 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.659
 about ccm punk it seems that a ter 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.729
 he feels offended by the rejection of 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:14.000
 chicago to face the english him 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.759
 mania 30 the officers of the wwf 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.590
 including the triple h themselves they thought 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.469
 to work with bread facing the biggest 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.250
 event of the year was something big now 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:27.439
 same attitude within the wwf m punk 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.389
 has changed de vince will take care of the subject 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:32.240
 and everything will be solved to an answer 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.099
 negative when the subject comes to light the 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.990
 Most of those in the company 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:38.719
 they think that punk made all the money that 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.729
 he could and then he left good friends 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:42.800
 that was all I know that most of the 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.960
 news I talk about pong but it's that 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.030
 I researched several pages and everything went 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.400
 tell him what they thought of him 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.530
 video and what news you liked most or you 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.659
 it impacted more remember than the fourth 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.210
 part will leave in April days after 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:59.259
