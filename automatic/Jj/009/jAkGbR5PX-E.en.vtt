00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.110 
basically so here's how you start every
HTML<00:02:08.099> document<00:02:08.640> starts<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.319> weird

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
HTML document starts with this the weird

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.930 
HTML document starts with this the weird
sideways<00:02:12.120> thing

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
sideways thing

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.690 
sideways thing
h<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.870> then<00:02:14.020> HTML<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:14.950> another<00:02:15.280> one<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.580> those

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
h and then HTML and another one of those

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.620 
h and then HTML and another one of those
now<00:02:16.360> these<00:02:16.540> are<00:02:16.750> called<00:02:16.990> tags<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.630> tags

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
now these are called tags so on tags

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.290 
now these are called tags so on tags
define<00:02:20.260> what<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.830> information<00:02:21.300> you're

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
define what kind of information you're

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.650 
define what kind of information you're
going<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.540> write<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.070> an<00:02:24.070> HTML<00:02:24.790> page<00:02:24.820> begins

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
going to write so an HTML page begins

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.090 
going to write so an HTML page begins
and<00:02:25.960> ends<00:02:26.350> with<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:28.060> HTML<00:02:28.690> tag<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.320> it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
and ends with this the HTML tag so it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.530 
and ends with this the HTML tag so it
just<00:02:30.130> finished<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:30.940> me<00:02:31.060> alright<00:02:31.330> so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
just finished it for me alright so

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.680 
just finished it for me alright so
basically<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.800> tag<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.490> defer<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.270> opening

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
basically a tag you defer to the opening

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.580 
basically a tag you defer to the opening
tag<00:02:35.520> has<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.940> two<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.780> sideways

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
tag has just the two like sideways

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.080 
tag has just the two like sideways
things<00:02:38.920> on<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> outside<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.820> then<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
things on the outside and then the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.110 
things on the outside and then the
ending<00:02:40.420> tag<00:02:40.630> has<00:02:40.900> aside<00:02:41.800> wasting<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.370> slash<00:02:42.730> and

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
ending tag has aside wasting a slash and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.880 
ending tag has aside wasting a slash and
then<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.570> other<00:02:43.690> thing<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.230> other<00:02:44.260> end<00:02:44.590> so

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
then the other thing on the other end so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.030 
then the other thing on the other end so
that's<00:02:45.100> how<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.340> write<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> tad<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.800> next

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
that's how you write a tad now the next

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.440 
that's how you write a tad now the next
tag<00:02:49.380> found<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.710> HTML<00:02:51.550> documents<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.210> called

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
tag found in HTML documents is called

tag found in HTML documents is called
the<00:02:52.600> head<00:02:52.840> tag<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:54.100> tag<00:02:55.710> basically<00:02:56.710> includes
