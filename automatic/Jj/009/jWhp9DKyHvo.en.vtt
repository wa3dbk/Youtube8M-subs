 at the training lessons Rome 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.300
 and murder 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.340
 so and you see the whole here 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.530
 and there are in principle how give percent creatures look like 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.869
 and that at &amp; t put our ears to our ears 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.119

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.189
 mky 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.189

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.059
 Quendt you always paste like that 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:02.049
 depending on which study you want you can use this 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.749

 Percent Synexus in the description 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.189
