point<00:00:43.320> where<00:00:43.559> there's<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.210> too<00:00:45.210> much

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239

to<00:00:45.510> say<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> gameplay<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:47.160> any<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.489> my

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to say about the gameplay in any of my

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.630 
to say about the gameplay in any of my
videos<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> whole<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.190> mean<00:00:50.190> yeah<00:00:50.340> there's<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
videos as a whole I mean yeah there's a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.060

it might be for ps3 as well but I might

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.840

to be tolerant enough to put up with

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.100 
to be tolerant enough to put up with
everyone<00:02:34.370> else<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.700> world<00:02:34.930> unless<00:02:35.930> it

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
everyone else in the world unless it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.160 
everyone else in the world unless it
benefits<00:02:36.230> them<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.860> some<00:02:37.040> particular<00:02:37.190> way<00:02:38.170> now

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
benefits them in some particular way now

know promote gay rights which in itself

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.500 
know promote gay rights which in itself
is<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.380> weird<00:03:06.650> thing<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.860> say<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.510> why

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
is a weird thing to say because why

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.850 
is a weird thing to say because why
would<00:03:08.690> gay<00:03:08.870> people<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.320> any<00:03:09.500> different

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
would gay people have any different

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.060 
would gay people have any different
rights<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.989> heterosexual<00:03:11.989> people<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.500> don't

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
rights to heterosexual people I don't

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.789 
rights to heterosexual people I don't
know<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:14.780> then<00:03:14.900> you've<00:03:15.020> got<00:03:15.170> groups<00:03:15.380> like<00:03:15.590> I

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
know but then you've got groups like I

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.740 
know but then you've got groups like I
assume<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.519> Catholic<00:03:16.880> Church<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.090> against<00:03:17.630> it

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
assume the Catholic Church is against it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.320 
assume the Catholic Church is against it
just<00:03:17.930> because<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.560> Bible<00:03:18.860> says<00:03:19.070> gays<00:03:19.910> must<00:03:20.120> be

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
just because the Bible says gays must be

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.150 
just because the Bible says gays must be
stoned<00:03:20.570> or<00:03:20.810> something<00:03:21.200> something<00:03:22.070> along

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
stoned or something something along

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.580 
stoned or something something along

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
I think if everyone is going to be

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.310 
I think if everyone is going to be
tolerant<00:06:01.100> of<00:06:01.250> each<00:06:01.340> other<00:06:01.780> at<00:06:02.780> least<00:06:03.080> what<00:06:03.230> you

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
tolerant of each other at least what you

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.230 
tolerant of each other at least what you
got<00:06:03.470> to<00:06:03.560> do<00:06:03.680> is<00:06:03.950> not<00:06:04.310> try<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:04.640> force<00:06:04.880> your<00:06:05.060> own

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
got to do is not try and force your own

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.420 
got to do is not try and force your own

that<00:06:17.960> is<00:06:18.080> my<00:06:18.260> way<00:06:18.500> of<00:06:18.880> you<00:06:19.880> know<00:06:19.910> how<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.720> world

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
that is my way of you know how the world

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.540 
that is my way of you know how the world
could<00:06:21.230> be<00:06:21.380> improved<00:06:21.560> if<00:06:21.890> everyone<00:06:22.310> was<00:06:22.430> more

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
could be improved if everyone was more

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.450 
could be improved if everyone was more
tolerant<00:06:23.050> how<00:06:24.050> do<00:06:24.110> you<00:06:24.260> do<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.410> I<00:06:24.800> don't<00:06:25.340> know

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
tolerant how do you do that I don't know

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.120 
tolerant how do you do that I don't know
I<00:06:25.490> assumed<00:06:26.000> by<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.180> gradual<00:06:26.720> process<00:06:27.170> of<00:06:27.350> you

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
I assumed by the gradual process of you

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.850 
I assumed by the gradual process of you
know<00:06:28.160> global<00:06:28.670> integration<00:06:29.090> of<00:06:29.860> economies

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
know global integration of economies

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.500 
know global integration of economies
populations<00:06:31.580> whatever<00:06:31.910> it's<00:06:32.210> eventually

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
populations whatever it's eventually

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.830 
populations whatever it's eventually
going<00:06:32.810> to<00:06:32.870> happen<00:06:33.200> but<00:06:34.120> who<00:06:35.120> knows<00:06:35.300> all<00:06:35.600> kind

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
going to happen but who knows all kind

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.120 
going to happen but who knows all kind
of<00:06:35.900> up<00:06:35.990> in<00:06:36.080> the<00:06:36.140> air

so what do you guys think is the way to

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.140 
so what do you guys think is the way to
improve<00:06:40.350> the<00:06:40.500> world<00:06:40.820> could<00:06:41.820> be<00:06:41.940> something

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
improve the world could be something

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.300 
improve the world could be something
simple<00:06:42.360> like<00:06:43.430> kill<00:06:44.430> all<00:06:44.990> stupid<00:06:45.990> people<00:06:46.470> what

okay<00:06:56.160> here's<00:06:56.430> an<00:06:56.520> example<00:06:57.500> morality<00:06:58.500> is<00:06:58.620> all

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
okay here's an example morality is all

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.260 
okay here's an example morality is all
relative<00:06:58.980> really<00:06:59.520> everyone<00:06:59.850> has<00:07:00.030> their<00:07:00.180> own

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.960 
thought he was creating a better human
race<00:07:24.570> but<00:07:24.870> all<00:07:25.560> of<00:07:25.770> us<00:07:25.860> would<00:07:26.070> argue<00:07:26.340> that<00:07:26.550> he

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
race but all of us would argue that he

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.510 
race but all of us would argue that he
was<00:07:27.060> doing<00:07:27.270> the<00:07:27.360> wrong<00:07:27.480> thing<00:07:28.250> so<00:07:29.250> that's<00:07:29.430> the

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
was doing the wrong thing so that's the

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.560 
was doing the wrong thing so that's the
point<00:07:29.610> I'm<00:07:29.790> making<00:07:29.820> about<00:07:30.300> it<00:07:30.420> being

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
point I'm making about it being

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.600 
point I'm making about it being
subjective<00:07:31.280> everyone<00:07:32.280> has<00:07:32.400> their<00:07:32.550> own

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
subjective everyone has their own

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.490 
subjective everyone has their own
different<00:07:32.910> ways<00:07:33.090> of<00:07:33.540> how<00:07:33.840> the<00:07:33.900> world<00:07:34.020> can<00:07:34.350> be

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 
different ways of how the world can be

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.310 
different ways of how the world can be
improved<00:07:35.270> so<00:07:36.270> let<00:07:36.420> me<00:07:36.480> know<00:07:36.600> the<00:07:36.630> conversation

I'm curious what do you think if you had

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.320
