00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
years uh last 55 years and I don't think

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.789 
years uh last 55 years and I don't think
there's<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.600> many<00:01:51.689> high<00:01:52.020> schools<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.649> in

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
there's very many high schools really in

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.109 
there's very many high schools really in
the<00:01:52.889> state<00:01:53.069> of<00:01:53.100> Illinois<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.609> that<00:01:53.789> could<00:01:53.939> say

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the state of Illinois get that could say

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.959 
the state of Illinois get that could say
that<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.869> top<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.139> it<00:01:55.350> we've<00:01:55.560> had<00:01:55.969> only

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that and on top of it we've had only

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.029 
that and on top of it we've had only
three<00:01:57.270> losing<00:01:57.600> seasons<00:01:57.959> in<00:01:58.079> those<00:01:58.200> 55<00:01:58.709> years

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
three losing seasons in those 55 years

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.830 
three losing seasons in those 55 years
so<00:01:59.280> again<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> would<00:01:59.850> compare<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.389> to<00:02:00.450> really

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
so again I would compare that to really

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.480 
so again I would compare that to really
any<00:02:01.139> school<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> state<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
tradition let's talk a little bit about

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.809 
tradition let's talk a little bit about
this<00:02:07.170> season's<00:02:07.619> team<00:02:07.859> it's<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.190> very<00:02:08.490> junior

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
this season's team it's a very junior

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.880 
this season's team it's a very junior
dominated<00:02:09.569> team<00:02:09.810> how<00:02:10.380> do<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> fill<00:02:10.860> a

did<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.239> look<00:04:09.450> at<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.690> as<00:04:09.870> team<00:04:10.440> defense<00:04:10.860> we

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
did we look at it as team defense we

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.340 
did we look at it as team defense we
play<00:04:11.790> really<00:04:11.970> any<00:04:12.209> team<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.720> specifically

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
play really any team but specifically

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.860 
play really any team but specifically
place<00:04:13.769> on<00:04:14.100> amira<00:04:14.400> from<00:04:14.730> from<00:04:15.180> benedict<00:04:15.510> add<00:04:15.720> me

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
place on amira from from benedict add me

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.920 
place on amira from from benedict add me
for<00:04:16.049> example<00:04:16.519> 610<00:04:17.519> Division<00:04:17.970> one<00:04:18.090> player<00:04:18.359> of

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
for example 610 Division one player of

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.449 
for example 610 Division one player of
we're<00:04:19.440> not<00:04:19.590> gonna<00:04:19.709> guard<00:04:19.979> him<00:04:20.160> individually

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
we're not gonna guard him individually

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.860 
we're not gonna guard him individually
so<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:20.970> going<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.150> kind<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.390> come<00:04:21.570> down<00:04:21.720> to

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
so it's going to kind of come down to

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.350 
so it's going to kind of come down to
our<00:04:21.900> team<00:04:22.260> defense<00:04:22.710> uh<00:04:22.919> how<00:04:23.820> we<00:04:23.880> do<00:04:24.210> it
