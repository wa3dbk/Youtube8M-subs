00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
omap 4470 here and TI omap 4470 here so

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.059 
omap 4470 here and TI omap 4470 here so
same<00:02:43.120> ohm<00:02:43.330> up<00:02:43.450> here<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
same ohm up here and this one is a

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.500 
same ohm up here and this one is a
rockchip<00:02:46.080> yeah<00:02:47.430> android<00:02:48.430> 4.1<00:02:48.849> is<00:02:49.150> already

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
rockchip yeah android 4.1 is already

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.200 
rockchip yeah android 4.1 is already
running<00:02:49.930> on<00:02:50.080> here<00:02:50.379> i<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.800> open<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.550> up<00:02:51.640> here

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
running on here i can open it up here

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.300 
running on here i can open it up here
going<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.630> be<00:02:53.780> very<00:02:54.500> being<00:02:54.800> very<00:02:55.010> soon

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
going to be very being very soon

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.400 
going to be very being very soon
actually<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.630> can<00:02:56.780> see<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.050> running

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
actually it's I can see it's running

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.510 
actually it's I can see it's running
right<00:02:57.560> now<00:02:57.620> already<00:02:58.360> jellybean<00:02:59.680> 4.1<00:03:00.680> but<00:03:01.340> here

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
right now already jellybean 4.1 but here

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.630 
right now already jellybean 4.1 but here
very<00:03:01.700> soon<00:03:01.790> right<00:03:02.150> here<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.260> still<00:03:03.530> 4.0<00:03:04.400> I

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
very soon right here is still 4.0 I

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.490 
very soon right here is still 4.0 I
guess<00:03:04.910> but<00:03:05.300> it's<00:03:05.480> going<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.690> be<00:03:05.750> 4.1<00:03:06.200> when<00:03:06.380> it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
guess but it's going to be 4.1 when it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.080 
guess but it's going to be 4.1 when it
launched<00:03:06.830> maybe<00:03:07.160> yes<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.560> also<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.220> age

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
launched maybe yes so and also the age

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.490 
launched maybe yes so and also the age
the<00:03:11.600> GPU<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:13.090> very<00:03:14.090> powerful<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:14.960> it's<00:03:15.260> really

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the GPU is very powerful so it's really

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.630 
the GPU is very powerful so it's really
good<00:03:15.770> for<00:03:15.950> gaming<00:03:16.370> experience<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.240> well<00:03:17.590> so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
good for gaming experience as well so

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.750 
good for gaming experience as well so
this<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.850> manly<00:03:20.090> 400<00:03:20.950> quad-core<00:03:21.950> mali-400

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
this is the manly 400 quad-core mali-400

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.620 
this is the manly 400 quad-core mali-400
GPU<00:03:23.140> runs<00:03:24.140> on<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.470> one<00:03:25.090> good<00:03:26.090> screen<00:03:26.360> what

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
GPU runs on this one good screen what

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.880 
GPU runs on this one good screen what
kind<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.870> screen<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:29.090> not<00:03:29.210> IPS<00:03:29.890> IPS

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
kind of screen is this it's not IPS IPS

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.600 
kind of screen is this it's not IPS IPS
but<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.670> high<00:03:32.270> quality<00:03:32.350> angry<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.620> grade

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
but it's a high quality angry a grade

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.420 
but it's a high quality angry a grade
and<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:35.780> one<00:03:35.960> a<00:03:36.170> great<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.800> PS<00:03:37.640> i<00:03:38.410> guess<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.310> we

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
and this one a great I PS i guess so we

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.920 
and this one a great I PS i guess so we
can<00:03:40.580> compare<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.060> screen<00:03:41.360> angle<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:42.530> i<00:03:42.680> go<00:03:42.920> on

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
can compare the screen angle if i go on

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
can compare the screen angle if i go on
something<00:03:44.930> like<00:03:45.860> this<00:03:47.530> screen<00:03:48.530> angles<00:03:48.800> are

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
something like this screen angles are

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.640 
something like this screen angles are
finally<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.370> all<00:03:49.550> of<00:03:49.670> them<00:03:50.200> alright<00:03:51.200> so<00:03:51.470> which

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
finally on all of them alright so which

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.540 
finally on all of them alright so which
one<00:03:51.830> do<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:51.950> think<00:03:52.010> you're<00:03:52.220> going<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.400> sell

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550
