00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.160
 I am on the way with the new skoda 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.109
 yeti strictly speaking to the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.390
 SUVs are like most 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.850
 cars of its genus on normal 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 Roads are moved on asphalt 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.640
 So it goes up to the direction of stone 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.830
 sea 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.930
 and if you are so curvy on that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 one makes mountain roads uphill 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.740
 fast 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.540
 you 're not overpowered around 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.930
 to politely express it if I'm honest 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.000
 am 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.239
 feels the two-liter common rail 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 Diesel from the Volkswagen Group does not matter 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.579
 like a valium tablet until 1800 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.410
 turns nothing can happen there 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.280
 you press the accelerator pedal to the bottom plate 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.030
 by pressing 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.020
 then the torque in button 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.430
 homeopathic cans on the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.239
 crankshaft until then again 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.160
 back the thing goes off and on 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.780
 totally this 140 ps 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.710
 from these two liters of diesel 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.330
 Squeeze so subjectively slow 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 objectively but actually very lively with 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.680
 9 9 seconds from 0 to 100 and one 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.680
 top speed of 190 the yeti 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.740
 Available with front or four-wheel drive 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.780
 our four-wheel drive has but 96 leads 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.500
 percent of the driving force only on the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.300
 vorderachse 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.070
 under normal conditions and when you are 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.869
 then a little faster so in the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.750
 tight curves then squeaks also 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.960
 quickly the soft again 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.720
 that would be called control 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.850
 say the yeti is something for sparfüchse 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.520
 in the car can be with six and a half 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.770
 to move the liter diesel to 100 kilometers 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.259
 but these sparfüchse should not 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.259
 have higher demands on comfort 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.150
 how does the comparison now go? 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.880
 corporation brother of yeti vw tiguan the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.869
 absolute top dog among the compact 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.340
 suvs 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.720
 I'm just saying the same engine the same 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.030
 all-wheel system and from the windscreen wiper to 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.150
 to the navi the same technology in the vw 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.130
 The cars are now becoming a part of the group 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.050
 cloned but in our case see yeti 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.440
 and tiguan yes completely different 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.190
 out and the tiguan really feels 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.739
 completely different 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.160
 is called the yeti he is rather like 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.650
 You sit 5 cm above the street one 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.110
 has a better overview and you roll 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.910
 also much more comfortable from before 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.760
 all things if you have the adjustable 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.800
 damper for almost 1000 euros surcharge 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.440
 board has and goes from then on of 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.630
 comfort on sport then you even have 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.700
 subjectively the feeling one drives 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.880
 sports, above all because the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.670
 gcb brevity is traded the tiguan 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.450
 in the second and third course essential 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.910
 better 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.090
 but that's all subjective 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.130
 Objectively, the tiguan is 120 kilograms 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.410
 heavier and that does the same 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.010
 motor simply worse driving 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.230
 from 0 to 100 5 seconds so six 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.480
 tenths slower than the yeti and up 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.820
 the freeway even drives him the scola 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.160
 around the ears because of the team only 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.930
 to 186 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.080
 one notices this higher weight 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.190
 of course, also in the consumption vw says 6 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.600
 4 liters 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.250
 but we have ours 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.810
 test drives her he seven liters 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.770
 but wanted the church in 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.200
 leave my village 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.930
 two suvs like the yeti and the tiguan 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.500
 with room for five people 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.720
 four-wheel drive and a big one 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.000
 trunk the whole with under seven 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.860
 liter diesel at 100 kilometers that is 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.120
 already a real progress in the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.120
 genus SUV
