00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.210 
because the circuit surveys are so
accurate<00:04:13.630> now<00:04:13.960> for<00:04:14.200> us<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.680> simulator<00:04:15.100> and

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
accurate now for us in the simulator and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.160 
accurate now for us in the simulator and
for<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.640> game<00:04:15.790> as<00:04:16.030> well<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.420> can<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:16.959> drive

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
for the game as well you can just drive

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.080 
for the game as well you can just drive
around<00:04:17.290> in<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.680> game<00:04:17.829> on<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.430> same<00:04:18.609> circuit

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
around in the game on the same circuit

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.280 
around in the game on the same circuit
you<00:04:19.150> won't<00:04:19.299> get<00:04:19.420> any<00:04:19.510> surprises<00:04:20.019> when<00:04:20.049> you

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
you won't get any surprises when you

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.720 
you won't get any surprises when you
turn<00:04:20.470> up<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.769> won't<00:04:20.920> be<00:04:21.010> completely<00:04:21.370> different

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.640 

yes<00:04:26.390> actually<00:04:26.690> quite<00:04:26.840> funny<00:04:27.080> because<00:04:27.260> when<00:04:27.590> I

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
yes actually quite funny because when I

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.200 
yes actually quite funny because when I
was<00:04:27.740> playing<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.160> game<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.670> was<00:04:28.790> hooked

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
was playing the game and I was hooked

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.580 
was playing the game and I was hooked
before<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.690> from<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.900> one<00:04:30.050> guy<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.350> really

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
before it from the one guy I really

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.630 
before it from the one guy I really
fought<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:30.980> little<00:04:31.130> bit<00:04:31.220> too<00:04:31.310> much<00:04:31.460> like

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
fought it's a little bit too much like

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.520 
fought it's a little bit too much like
an<00:04:31.790> arcade<00:04:32.150> game<00:04:32.180> or<00:04:32.510> fish<00:04:32.660> or<00:04:32.990> something<00:04:33.440> like

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
an arcade game or fish or something like

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.990 
an arcade game or fish or something like
that<00:04:33.590> but<00:04:33.980> now<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.160> really<00:04:34.430> have<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.580> say<00:04:34.850> it's

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
that but now I really have to say it's

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.510 
that but now I really have to say it's
really<00:04:35.300> good
