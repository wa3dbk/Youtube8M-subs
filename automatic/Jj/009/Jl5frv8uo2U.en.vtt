00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.400
 all gardens are subject to 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.130
 attack of a series of plagues and diseases 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.829
 any time 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.140
 an important issue to be highlighted is 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.000
 the predisposition of the vegetable to the action of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.810
 parasites because of deficiencies 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.599
 nutrients a malnourished plant tends to 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.680
 to be more attacked by pests and diseases 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.629
 They are called deficiency diseases fits 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.309
 also a clarification on the 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.210
 product control practices 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.879
 chemical 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.770
 the prescription of pesticides is a 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.930
 attribution of some professionals of the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.329
 agrarian sciences, highlighting the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.030
 agronomist products 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.039
 used are toxic that can cause 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.340
 the well-being of people and the 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.340
 environment 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.800
 with respect to the pests to avoid 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.770
 application of pesticides can be 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.020
 used insecticides and also 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.320
 mechanical control , ie the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.420
 manual collection of insects in the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.640
 In most cases, what is done is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.990
 collect and eliminate insects in 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.990
 times of greatest attack 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.940
 the cutter ants with prominence 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.310
 to be saved is a problem 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.710
 serious for any gardener 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.560
 they cut and carry leaves branches 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.479
 flowers and crops in sant mind 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 effective control is only possible with 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.899
 Chemicals 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.259
 most of them dangerous in terms of 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.110
 The most commonly used product is 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.479
 formicidal bait that is highly attractive 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.149
 for the sauces and so is loaded by 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.190
 they til the tune assis song 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.630
 distributed alongside the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.330
 way that the ants have 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.399
 ease of access are also 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.190
 placed next to the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.330
 ant if possible locate 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.340
 the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.780
 this distribution must be made in the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.429
 late afternoon on non-rainy days 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.459
 other types of control as is the case 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.890
 of the term nebulization can only be made 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.930
 revenue and under the guidance of a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.030
 The agronomist is a 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.099
 typically found in shoots and 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 land shares of many species of 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.530
 ornamental plants are trapped in 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.510
 plants and suck their sap causing 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.239
 appearance of spots in general 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.640
 often appear yellowish 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.440
 covered by a viscous substance and 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.380
 white 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.820
 if the presence of these insects is detected 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.120
 small amount in a single 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.670
 plant can remove them with your hands but 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.920
 grows their presence should 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.990
 insecticides are used in 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.100
 regular applications until your 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.980
 elimination 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.530
 chemical control is done with the product 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.670
 malation whose application must be 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.670
 under technical guidance
