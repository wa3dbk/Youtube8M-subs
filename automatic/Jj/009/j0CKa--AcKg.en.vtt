00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
texture pack right into bin and some

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.250 
texture pack right into bin and some
tutorials<00:00:17.010> say<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.789> problem<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.660> you

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
tutorials say do this problem but you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.660 
tutorials say do this problem but you
can<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.920> want<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.250> your<00:00:20.400> choice

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
can do that if you want it's your choice

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
can do that if you want it's your choice
but<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> problem<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.810> at<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> end<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> day

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
but the problem is at the end of the day

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.939 
but the problem is at the end of the day
is<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:24.119> default<00:00:24.480> look<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.320> Minecraft

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
is that the default look of Minecraft

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.020 
is that the default look of Minecraft
won't<00:00:26.400> work<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:29.150> what<00:00:30.150> we're<00:00:30.240> gonna<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
won't work so what we're gonna do is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.280 
won't work so what we're gonna do is
show<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.090> how<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:34.520> fix<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.079> first<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.170> all

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
show you how to fix it and first of all

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.310 
show you how to fix it and first of all
we<00:00:37.380> need<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> protect<00:00:39.110> not<00:00:40.110> that

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we need to go to protect not that

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.220 
we need to go to protect not that
percentage<00:00:45.590> dates<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:47.059> percentage<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> you've

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
percentage dates at percentage so you've

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.600 
percentage dates at percentage so you've
obviously<00:00:49.289> been<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.920> before<00:00:50.010> he's<00:00:50.489> gone

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
obviously been here before he's gone

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.069 
obviously been here before he's gone
your<00:00:50.760> dot<00:00:50.910> minecraft<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> from<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.600> when

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
your dot minecraft so from that one when

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.420 
your dot minecraft so from that one when
you're<00:00:55.199> fixing<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.100> only<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you're fixing this you only go to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.119 
you're fixing this you only go to
texture<00:00:56.969> pack<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> I'll<00:00:58.440> explain<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
texture pack so I'll explain that at the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.950 
texture pack so I'll explain that at the
end<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> video<00:00:59.699> first<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> need

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to go to bin now this is just for the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.350 
to go to bin now this is just for the
sake<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> video<00:01:05.220> don't<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> go<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.150> but

I<00:02:33.950> what<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.459> had<00:02:34.730> before<00:02:35.090> was<00:02:35.329> I<00:02:35.510> have<00:02:35.719> geek<00:02:35.930> pack

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
I what I had before was I have geek pack

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.470 
I what I had before was I have geek pack
at<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.739> point<00:02:36.889> and<00:02:37.099> zip<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.969> had<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
at one point and zip and I had the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.030 
at one point and zip and I had the
default<00:02:38.870> look<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.200> Minecraft<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.799> was<00:02:39.920> at

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
default look of Minecraft that was at

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.670 
default look of Minecraft that was at
the<00:02:40.129> top<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.629> couldn't<00:02:41.870> get<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:42.349> so<00:02:42.590> this

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
the top and I couldn't get this so this

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.979 
the top and I couldn't get this so this
now<00:02:43.549> you've<00:02:43.760> cleaned<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.269> you'll<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.689> this

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
now you've cleaned it you'll have this

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.149 
now you've cleaned it you'll have this
default<00:02:45.500> now<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:47.030> then<00:02:47.269> that's<00:02:48.260> done<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.950> is

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
default now so then that's done this is

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.420 
default now so then that's done this is
the<00:02:49.189> default<00:02:49.579> texture<00:02:49.939> pack<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.359> Minecraft

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
