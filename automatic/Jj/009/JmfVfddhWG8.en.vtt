00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.010 
where the cameras are you know so I
think<00:03:12.670> that's<00:03:12.940> was<00:03:13.240> a<00:03:13.270> bit<00:03:13.540> like<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.960> know

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
think that's was a bit like you know

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.330 
think that's was a bit like you know
this<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.410> good<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.800> beginning<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.280> I

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
this is good in the beginning but I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.530 
this is good in the beginning but I
thought<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.640> whole<00:03:15.790> process<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.300> mobile

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
thought the whole process of the mobile

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.000 
thought the whole process of the mobile
is<00:03:16.630> quite<00:03:16.840> easy<00:03:17.020> because<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.680> wasn't<00:03:17.860> doing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
is quite easy because I wasn't doing

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.220 
is quite easy because I wasn't doing
like<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.280> difficult<00:03:19.270> role<00:03:19.450> or<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.810> series
