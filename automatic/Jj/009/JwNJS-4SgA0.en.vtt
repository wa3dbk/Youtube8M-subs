00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.700
 followed the gameplay live on clarity the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.410
 fifteen beds at any moment pretty much 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
 around two thirty-one minutes of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.580
 few seconds where our friend 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.890
 has attempted to make a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 imitation of me and I offered you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.769
 something rather didactic 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.760
 rather like shit and others 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.980
 things like that to say that made me 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 laughing do not worry julien I 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.590
 besides I go as there is a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.859
 little concern in his imitation you 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.859
 will understand 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 rise and his little name bise to 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:53.039
 incessant of your salvation is this same 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.239
 rate not like that's not all that's 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.930
 not at all that college but it's not 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.539
 at all that there is not at all like 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.809

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.909
 it all alone early anyway though when when I 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.710
 do it with my friend it's rather lots 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 at the lowest point to leave his grave on the ground 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.119
 m full nintendo rate with a small 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250
 Japanese accent must be done with a 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.670
 little parody because his parody the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.140
 nintendo direct from satoru iwata is a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.580
 little naughty also a same theme 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.530
 so much of your cynic when we love 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.180

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 a techno it's all my life we 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.570

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 music all the same 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.280

 eyes and that's it 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.369
 not intending to miss the twenties 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.350

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.149
 possible to copy myths and my 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.240
 imitation it can to two ex machina 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.880
 as they say do not forget more than pau 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.289
 minutes and you have to talk quickly 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.140
 it's a very important thing 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:12.340
 Julian it takes times tendo and a cap 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.640

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.800
 opportunities here here 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.660

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.760

 plate by the way I have no this 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.890
 attaches more than the field staffing 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.920
 like the shirt since there is still 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:50.010

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.530
 not miss a little fun comparison 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.540
 between the attempt at imitation and and the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.180
 predict that's good on this I you 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.830
