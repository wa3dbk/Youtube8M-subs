00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello everyone i'm coming back today 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.030
 to show you the tutorial on the small 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.370
 pirate cracker 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 so this mold I bought it I'm 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.420
 marine workshops 33.88 besides I 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.539
 do you a kiss on the way so I had 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 need an outing air scalpel with 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.300
 bits of different size from the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 ocher like this here 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:36.690
 Then I took the red tian number 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:40.730
 two large 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:48.059
 t1 of the range effect number 81 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:57.290
 that's dark chocolate is no longer the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 number and black the hÃ©rault 9 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:06.960
 I took a little bit of orange effect 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:09.509
 translucent number 404 with the oc rejects 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.970
 so that filled the mold like this I 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.289
 now come delicately take out the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.100
 little biscuit of the mold 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.100
 wuala 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.100
 using the scalpel I will remove the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.540
 tiny little surplus you see on the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 edges to be as clean as possible 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.980
 and with the little outing I come 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.800
 push back the cuts actually for this 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 the cleanest and most natural 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.980
 possible 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.700
 then I take the scalpel and I 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.060
 come cut off a leg and an arm of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.060
 little biscuit 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.180
 with chocolate so I form a 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.860
 little triangle like this it's me 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.000
 will serve to make the wooden leg actually 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.130
 of the little biscuit so I go back 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.640
 slightly edges that could serve 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 basic actually in the leg and I 'm coming 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.230
 adjust it on 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.959
 then for texture is a little bit I 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.840
 take the scalpel I'm doing small 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.840
 very ripe wood 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.160
 with a piece of pat burke in shades 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.260
 brown beige so I form a small 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.890
 ball cam ferland tip in fact of the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.890
 wooden leg 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.240
 so now with the brown as 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.130
 you can see I crushed it so 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.130
 to be able to make a rectangle like these 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.080
 and it will serve me in fact two arms 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.080
 two hooks 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.340
 so the rectangle as you can see 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.140
 I also rounded up to be able to 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.250
 do the sleeve in fact and I come 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.250
 to lay on the arm 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.800
 and I texture the same as the leg 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.959
 a little bit of my brown beige of everything 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.060
 at the time so yes at the beginning I had 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.500
 taken translucent orange which you 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.930
 go see I did not use it I 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.829
 wanted to introduce at the beginning of the video but 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.720
 I am not served I am 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.000
 folded over his colors there to stay 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 in the tones actually of the order of 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.720
 extra brown 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.860
 then using the money I'm doing 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.380
 so a little pudding that I shot at 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.090
 maximum I platinum it will serve me to 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.090
 crochet hand 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.520
 that's it and then I come and place it 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.680
 with the black I therefore form a ball 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.940
 that I flattened to do the eye patch 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.460
 in fact the pirate 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.870
 so here I ask it right because with the 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.180
 black so I'll also trained a little 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.290
 straps 20 end of a very fine I 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.210
 will shoot to make the thongs of the 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.210
 hiding eye that will be below 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.270
 this is now attacking the party 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.400
 red as you see I have flattened 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.990
 a manceau of red I cut to 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.210
 inside a small room to serve me 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.210
 to make the little vest of the pirate 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.870
 I give him a shape I know him 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.120
 make small folds to make it the 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.080
 more realistic possible 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.080
 here I am putting outing 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.820
 and we come to ask it then I put 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.780
 outing always to ask him for 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.780
 do the roundings etc 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.800
 I do the same operation for the 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.800
 second side 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.650
 so now include where I did the 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.030
 pirate hat see I'm going to give 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.879
 this form so if I try to 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:00.979
 adjust it to the best of his head balance 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.979
 the sides at best 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.759
 and now I will try to 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:09.469
 digging give it a shape most 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.469
 realistic possible pirate hat 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.610
 so that's what ends up so 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.610
 it's gone for cooking 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.050
 so here is the creature ends up so we could 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.880
 see it I added some paint 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.980
