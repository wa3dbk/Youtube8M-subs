with<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:23.420> this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> distilled<00:00:25.439> water<00:00:25.680> we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
with these this is a distilled water we

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.929 
with these this is a distilled water we
have<00:00:27.289> some<00:00:28.289> special<00:00:29.279> needs<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.730> house

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
have some special needs in this house

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
have some special needs in this house
that<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> machines<00:00:31.679> requires

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that one of the machines requires

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.650 
that one of the machines requires
distilled<00:00:32.610> water<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> bunch<00:00:33.540> of

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
distilled water so we have a bunch of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.900 
distilled water so we have a bunch of
these<00:00:34.140> empty<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.070> used<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> save<00:00:35.610> them<00:00:35.790> when

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
these empty and I used to save them when

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
these empty and I used to save them when
they<00:00:36.000> had<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> twist<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.690> cap<00:00:37.070> now<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.280> years

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
they had the twist on cap now two years

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
they had the twist on cap now two years
ago<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:39.059> replaced<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.079> line<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.260> just

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
ago they replaced it in line with just

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.810 
ago they replaced it in line with just
the<00:00:40.680> snap<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.340> don't<00:00:41.399> store<00:00:41.700> them

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the snap on so I don't store them

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.600 
the snap on so I don't store them
anymore<00:00:42.290> besides<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.710> lot<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> people<00:00:44.250> say<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
anymore besides a lot of people say this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 
anymore besides a lot of people say this
degrades<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.750> will<00:00:45.930> leak<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> leach<00:00:46.950> things

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
degrades and will leak and leach things

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.060 
degrades and will leak and leach things
into<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.579> water<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> murky<00:00:49.070> murky

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
into your water I have a murky murky

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
into your water I have a murky murky
water<00:00:50.430> filter<00:00:50.850> which<00:00:51.059> will<00:00:51.270> take<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
water filter which will take all that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.240 
water filter which will take all that
junk<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.530> I'm<00:00:52.620> not<00:00:52.649> worried<00:00:52.980> about<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
junk out so I'm not worried about the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.209 
junk out so I'm not worried about the
leaching<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.379> it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.500> good<00:00:55.649> off<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.039> know<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
leaching but it's a good off you know a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
leaching but it's a good off you know a
good<00:00:56.370> thing<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> beginner<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
good thing for this beginner don't use a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.139

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
same thing two of those roughly again

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.070 
same thing two of those roughly again
and<00:01:27.990> then

and then

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.890 
and then
this<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.130> what<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.370> really<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:31.880> it's<00:01:32.630> heavy

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
this is what I really like it's heavy

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.270 
this is what I really like it's heavy
plastic<00:01:34.030> good<00:01:35.030> screw<00:01:35.330> on<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:35.570> lid<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:36.440> holds<00:01:36.830> a

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
plastic good screw on the lid it holds a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.940 
plastic good screw on the lid it holds a
gallon<00:01:38.180> some<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.720> them<00:01:38.870> are<00:01:39.080> three<00:01:39.590> quarts

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
gallon some of them are three quarts

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.480 
gallon some of them are three quarts
this<00:01:40.640> one's<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.910> gallon<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:42.710> can't<00:01:43.040> add<00:01:43.250> a

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
this one's a gallon now you can't add a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.410 
this one's a gallon now you can't add a
couple<00:01:43.970> of<00:01:44.090> drops<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.600> bleach<00:01:44.900> per<00:01:45.260> gallon<00:01:46.220> I

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
couple of drops of bleach per gallon I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.420 
couple of drops of bleach per gallon I
don't<00:01:47.420> because<00:01:47.960> there's<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.800> lot<00:01:48.980> of<00:01:49.070> chlorine

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
don't because there's a lot of chlorine

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.760 
don't because there's a lot of chlorine
in<00:01:49.550> our<00:01:49.640> water<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.210> like<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.260> said<00:01:51.320> I<00:01:51.470> have<00:01:51.650> the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
in our water and like I said I have the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.230 
in our water and like I said I have the
Berkey<00:01:52.070> filter<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:52.640> can<00:01:52.850> just<00:01:52.970> run<00:01:53.150> it

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
Berkey filter so I can just run it
