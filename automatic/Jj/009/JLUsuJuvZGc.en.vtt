00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.619

 sales of residential buildings 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.580
 in 2009 they could not

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.930

 this is fundamental we know observed 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.060
 growth does not have 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.410
 indeed the strongest clubs are not 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 promised citizens to upgrade the park 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.340
 first time a year 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.380

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.479

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.400
 not solved now 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.960
 what I am doing here you would not be happy 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.650

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.329
 it helps or hinders 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.329
 serious business class inclusive 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.179
 also the head of state noted 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:29.100
 but 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490
 I thought and being affected 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 motion 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.820
 I oppose to provide my 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.540
 future 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540

 on the field and tell all the winners why 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.309
