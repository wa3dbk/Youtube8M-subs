00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
could see the shine on the car that's

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.700 
could see the shine on the car that's
because<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> did<00:01:23.100> some<00:01:23.310> cutting<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.330> polishing

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
because I did some cutting and polishing

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.540 
because I did some cutting and polishing
okay<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:27.060> looks<00:01:27.420> almost<00:01:28.010> brand<00:01:29.010> spanking<00:01:29.520> new

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
okay it looks almost brand spanking new

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.090 
okay it looks almost brand spanking new
a<00:01:29.940> little<00:01:30.540> too<00:01:30.690> shiny<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.010> know

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
a little too shiny for you if you know

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.370 
a little too shiny for you if you know
some<00:01:32.280> might<00:01:32.430> say<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.230> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
some might say but this is some of the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.360 
some might say but this is some of the
really<00:01:38.040> bad<00:01:38.370> areas<00:01:38.910> right<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.920> really<00:01:40.920> focus

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
really bad areas right here really focus

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.170 
really bad areas right here really focus
on<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.730> yeah<00:01:42.830> it's<00:01:43.830> really<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:45.120> really<00:01:45.870> bad

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
on it yeah it's really really really bad

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.550 
on it yeah it's really really really bad
but<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.330> again<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.410> most

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
but then again this is one of the most

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.360 
but then again this is one of the most
exposed<00:01:50.160> areas<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> car<00:01:51.480> so<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.980> it<00:01:53.220> got

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
exposed areas of the car so if it got

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.300 
exposed areas of the car so if it got
the<00:01:53.580> hottest<00:01:53.820> most<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.350> probably<00:01:55.590> cracked

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the hottest most so it probably cracked

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.020 
the hottest most so it probably cracked
the<00:01:56.940> most<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:58.950> fortunate<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.790> you
