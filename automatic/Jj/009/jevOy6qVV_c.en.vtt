00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
Sun and some of the trees look what they

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.960 
Sun and some of the trees look what they
were<00:00:27.259> drawn<00:00:27.560> by<00:00:28.240> schoolchildren<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:30.820> in<00:00:31.820> this

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
were drawn by schoolchildren and in this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.180 
were drawn by schoolchildren and in this
first<00:00:32.270> screen<00:00:32.360> if<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.840> shoot<00:00:33.199> arrows<00:00:33.470> kill

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
first screen if the shoot arrows kill

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.840 
first screen if the shoot arrows kill
everybody<00:00:34.760> on<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.120> screen

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.490 

then<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:39.970> walk<00:00:40.120> across<00:00:40.390> this<00:00:40.660> bridge<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.320> go

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
then you walk across this bridge and go

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.430 
then you walk across this bridge and go
to<00:00:41.560> the<00:00:41.800> second<00:00:42.190> screen<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.540> here<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.140> I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
to the second screen and here you I

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.160 
to the second screen and here you I
think<00:00:45.250> you're<00:00:45.640> using<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:45.970> knife<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.600> try<00:00:47.110> to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
think you're using a knife to try to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.710 
think you're using a knife to try to
kill<00:00:47.410> him<00:00:47.559> but<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.790> weird<00:00:49.000> thing<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.600> have

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
kill him but the weird thing is you have

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.930 
kill him but the weird thing is you have
to<00:00:49.780> be<00:00:49.989> a<00:00:50.020> almost<00:00:50.500> exactly<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.309> exact<00:00:51.700> same

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
to be a almost exactly the exact same

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.660 
to be a almost exactly the exact same
plane<00:00:52.300> that<00:00:52.330> they're<00:00:52.870> on<00:00:53.110> if<00:00:54.040> you're<00:00:54.190> off<00:00:54.340> by

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
plane that they're on if you're off by

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.280 
plane that they're on if you're off by
just<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:55.000> little<00:00:55.120> bit<00:00:55.270> you<00:00:56.199> can't<00:00:56.500> hurt<00:00:56.800> them

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
just a little bit you can't hurt them

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.299 
just a little bit you can't hurt them
and<00:00:59.290> they<00:00:59.500> just<00:01:00.489> walk<00:01:00.760> back<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.239> forth<00:01:02.309> but

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
and they just walk back and forth but

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.910 
and they just walk back and forth but
they<00:01:03.610> will<00:01:03.820> kill<00:01:04.119> you<00:01:04.300> if<00:01:04.479> you're<00:01:05.170> not<00:01:05.350> using

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
they will kill you if you're not using

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.130 
they will kill you if you're not using
your<00:01:06.100> knife<00:01:06.369> or<00:01:06.729> club<00:01:07.000> or<00:01:07.270> whatever<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:08.080> is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
your knife or club or whatever it is

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.730 
your knife or club or whatever it is
you've<00:01:08.380> got<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.990> at<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.170> top<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.560> have<00:01:11.590> a

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
you've got now at the top you have a

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.380 
you've got now at the top you have a
counter<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.570> counts<00:01:13.570> up<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.180> have

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
counter that counts up and then you have

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.080 
counter that counts up and then you have
a<00:01:16.420> five<00:01:16.780> in<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.080> one<00:01:17.259> I<00:01:17.290> think<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:18.490> five<00:01:18.759> is

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
a five in the one I think the five is

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.410 
a five in the one I think the five is
the<00:01:19.560> lives<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.800> have<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:21.640> guess<00:01:21.940> one<00:01:22.210> is

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
the lives you have and I guess one is

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.560 
the lives you have and I guess one is
the<00:01:22.570> level<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.729> really<00:01:25.030> don't<00:01:25.149> know<00:01:25.390> what

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
the level but I really don't know what

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.930 
the level but I really don't know what
the<00:01:25.690> counter<00:01:26.020> does<00:01:26.250> there's<00:01:27.250> no<00:01:27.430> score<00:01:27.789> in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
the counter does there's no score in

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.120 
the counter does there's no score in
this<00:01:28.030> game<00:01:28.149> or<00:01:29.190> anything<00:01:30.190> it's<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:31.920> very<00:01:32.920> odd

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
this game or anything it's a very odd

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.990 
this game or anything it's a very odd
game<00:01:34.380> plus<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.560> fact<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.580> look<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.880> lot

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
game plus the fact that you look a lot

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.969 
game plus the fact that you look a lot
like<00:01:37.210> your<00:01:37.420> opponents<00:01:38.020> except<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.740> you're

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
like your opponents except that you're

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.660 
like your opponents except that you're
the<00:01:39.190> guy<00:01:40.090> with<00:01:40.270> green<00:01:40.570> pants<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:42.490> have

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
the guy with green pants and they have

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.170 
the guy with green pants and they have
brown<00:01:42.939> pants

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.630 

on<00:01:52.180> this<00:01:52.330> screen<00:01:52.570> go<00:01:52.960> back<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.549> having<00:01:54.549> to

these guards at this castle that will

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.170

try<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.680> shoot<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.190> sometimes<00:02:03.970> they<00:02:04.119> shoot

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
try to shoot you sometimes they shoot

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.300 
try to shoot you sometimes they shoot
the<00:02:04.450> other<00:02:04.600> guys<00:02:04.840> though<00:02:05.080> -<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.100> say<00:02:09.280> I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
the other guys though - I have to say I

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
the other guys though - I have to say I
haven't<00:02:09.580> played<00:02:09.850> this<00:02:10.060> game<00:02:10.119> all<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.690> much

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
haven't played this game all that much

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.500 

so<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.959> don't<00:02:14.260> really<00:02:14.380> know<00:02:15.060> how<00:02:16.060> much<00:02:16.239> there<00:02:16.480> is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so I don't really know how much there is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.240 
so I don't really know how much there is
to<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:18.780> mean<00:02:19.780> it's<00:02:20.020> kind<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.320> weird<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.650> start

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
to it I mean it's kind of weird to start

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.720 
to it I mean it's kind of weird to start
off<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:21.820> this<00:02:22.590> sunshine<00:02:23.590> with<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.220> smiley

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
face and the little rays like a like I

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.030 
face and the little rays like a like I
said<00:02:27.610> like<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.000> kid<00:02:28.269> would<00:02:28.420> draw<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.260> then<00:02:29.860> you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
said like a kid would draw and then you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.520

apparently<00:04:00.150> later<00:04:00.660> on<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:00.960> guess<00:04:01.290> people<00:04:01.500> got

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
apparently later on I guess people got

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.200

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
tired of that and they started releasing

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.390

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820
