00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.219
 a real oriental invasion in the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.049
 beginning of the 90's the models 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.299
 Japanese reached the market by weight 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.090
 Brazil in the following decade was the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.970
 of Koreans and now the Chinese 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.340
 this is the case of jec j5 we give more than 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350
 600 kilometers by inland roads 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.640
 from now on you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.640
 knows all the details 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 is 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.480
 at first sight 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.970
 calls drawing the attention the balance 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.060
 sedan has the design has hit the tire 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.920
 farina with highlight for the wheels of 17 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:06.110
 flowing lines passing a 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:12.010
 light impression brings even headlights 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.010
 auxiliary and the parking sensor 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.640
 The engine is made of aluminum and has 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.640
 baiÃ£o valves 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.619
 the first quality stands out in j5 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.829
 without doubt the seat space 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.049
 rear interior space gives to floor 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.519
 pretty comfortable back here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.580
 it even has easier than the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.550
 corolla that the other civic details is the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.370
 bank does not have three point belt 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.310
 for the passenger goes in the middle and also 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.769
 I do not have good arm rests for another 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.290
 side it has the ventilation outlet 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.680
 something important and that so far 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.940
 not only have we seen in the peugeot 408 since in 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.970
 front 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.030
 j5 has a good economy 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.140
 a driver and passengers also travel 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:46.260
 so comfortable that the j5 year banks 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.299
 in leather finishes of the doors and so 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.190
 how logical the good devices 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.209
 also has good negatives like us 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.250
 we speak is one of them is that the steering wheel 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.390
 covered in leather but not multi 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.549
 functions 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.299
 it also does not bring the 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.609
 board and also does not bring the pilot 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.310
 automatic 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.400
 in return beyond the transmission 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.889
 manual or postpone it so far 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.630
 Brazil brought the automatic transmission 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.630
 the model something that is being quite 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.930
 required in large cities as they are 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.609
 Paulo is probably next year 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.970
 comes the version with a transmission 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.900
 automatic other detail is conditioned 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.780
 digital 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.920
 here is a reader an audio system 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.700
 with mp3 ibex is quite complete in this 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.700
 sense is an issue until the reader 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.250
 you can check some publications 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.100
 some journalists complain about the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.139
 panel lighting as it was in the beginning 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.530
 a trip is great through the interior of 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:55.079
 Sao Paulo traveling on day roads and 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.120
 also in the evening and we did not have 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.200
 no problem whatsoever this information 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.200
 It seems a bit inconsistent. 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.849
 in the model city shows some 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.490
 limitations due to low displacement 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.229
 and the thousand three hundred and fifteen kilos but 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.090
 road it keeps pace even in the 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.220
 resumed and goes well 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.889
 we rode with three people on board air 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.720
 flashes on and conditioning the wail 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.720
 was one of the highlights 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.650
 with staff there is an old proverb 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.979
 Chinese saying that even the great 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.020
 constructions start from below and 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.330
 exactly this way the Chinese marks 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.460
 especially jack are conquering 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.250
 place in space already past that phase 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.740
 the initial mistrust of the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.620
 Brazilians and the trend is always 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.539
 to improve in this module the 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.710
 certainly some problems in the future 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.689
 quite close 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.689
 we talk too much
