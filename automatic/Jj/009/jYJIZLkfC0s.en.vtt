00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.500
 so today we talk with a tattered 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.240
 ways to distribute wifi to the foundation of god 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.220
 or internet via wi-fi from laptop 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.140
 so the first of these ways is this 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.240
 Vertov's free router + program 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.800
 The problem with this program is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.169
 that if you search simply 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.890
 via google or yandex you will find 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:27.380
 not at all either or it will include 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.499
 candles installer other programs that us 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.739
 do not need the official website of this program 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:36.560
 is here at this address here we are 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:44.030
 we can download in its pure form 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:47.750
 zip-archive to save where we 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.870
 more convenient to unpack the archive 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.110
 I have it already unpacked and run 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.110
 the program 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.940
 after that all you need will be 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.170
 make it choose which connection we are 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.970
 We will distribute Wi-Fi 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.000
 that is, there are days through which we 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.300
 get internet choose name name 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.070
 access point and password to press it 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.070
 start virtual router plus button 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.610
 ready she launched i demonstrate 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.500
 I can not because he does not show my 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.150
 own access point which 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.620
 running but if you try now 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.100
 connect with some other 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.850
 devices everything will turn out so this is the first 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.490
 way the second way is tonic program 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.909
 it is described in figures in my instructions 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.470
 the link that is at the bottom of this video 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.500
 frankly here yes everything is simple but 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.330
 I do not recommend using the reason there 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.049
 the fact that she changes everything too much 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.450
 system files ie result 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.030
 your car let's say it turns into 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.830
 wi-fi distribution tool too 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.479
 I would not advise to load much though 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.380
 can use and on your case 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.090
 works and the last way is another 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.260
 opportunity to do without any 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.430
 there was a program just using 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.920
 command line 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.229
 you can do it too 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 described in detail in my instructions 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.680
 eat come read can do 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.719
 generally ways to create an office 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.310
 I have a lot of laptops 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.959
 recommended this simplest and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.140
 effective then this virtual router 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.140
 plus
