that came after pulled something from

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
that came after pulled something from
the<00:00:47.789> work<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> Debbie<00:00:48.329> Harry<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the work of Debbie Harry much of the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.540 
the work of Debbie Harry much of the
reason<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.530> album<00:00:49.800> stands<00:00:50.129> above<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> rest

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
reason this album stands above the rest

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.010 
reason this album stands above the rest
for<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.449> presents<00:00:51.629> such<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
for me is because it presents such a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
for me is because it presents such a
stark<00:00:52.440> musical<00:00:52.860> shift<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> band<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
stark musical shift for the band as the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.790 
stark musical shift for the band as the
New<00:00:54.210> Wave<00:00:54.420> tones<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.320> gone<00:00:55.350> when<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
New Wave tones are all but gone when you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.229 
New Wave tones are all but gone when you
compare<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> their<00:00:56.370> earlier<00:00:56.670> work<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.090> it's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
compare to their earlier work and it's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
compare to their earlier work and it's
far<00:00:57.449> more<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.660> pop<00:00:58.020> record<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
far more a pop record with a bit of a

much<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.500> due<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> guitar<00:01:32.189> work

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
much of this is due to the guitar work

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
much of this is due to the guitar work
of<00:01:32.520> Chris<00:01:32.790> Stein<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:33.450> seamlessly<00:01:34.049> switches

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of Chris Stein as he seamlessly switches

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380

from<00:01:34.470> electric<00:01:34.979> guitar<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.549> 12-string<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.329> he

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
from electric guitar to 12-string and he

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
from electric guitar to 12-string and he
even<00:01:36.630> plays<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> ebo<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.619> points<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.189> it's

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
even plays the ebo at points and it's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.039 
even plays the ebo at points and it's
the<00:01:38.520> diversity<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.150> sound<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.570> lets<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the diversity and sound that lets the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.260 
the diversity and sound that lets the
album<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.530> such<00:01:40.860> sonic<00:01:41.340> difference<00:01:41.790> whether

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
album have such sonic difference whether

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
album have such sonic difference whether
it's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> driving<00:01:42.780> high-energy<00:01:43.320> riff<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.950> on

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
