especially<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.500> toy<00:04:22.070> Kardos<00:04:22.460> because<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:22.760> takes

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
especially a toy Kardos because it takes

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.790 
especially a toy Kardos because it takes
shots<00:04:23.270> around<00:04:23.419> corners<00:04:23.810> I'm<00:04:24.500> gonna<00:04:24.650> ricochet
