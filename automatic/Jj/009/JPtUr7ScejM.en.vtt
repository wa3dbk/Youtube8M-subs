this<00:00:56.049> was<00:00:56.260> pretty<00:00:56.500> enjoyable<00:00:56.890> but<00:00:57.580> this

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
this was pretty enjoyable but this

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.090 
this was pretty enjoyable but this
episode<00:00:58.390> was<00:00:58.510> mainly<00:00:58.780> for<00:00:59.110> laughing<00:00:59.769> giggles

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.609 
episode was mainly for laughing giggles
i<00:01:00.189> think<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:01.089> other<00:01:01.119> half<00:01:01.479> i<00:01:01.659> predict<00:01:02.379> will<00:01:02.530> be

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
i think the other half i predict will be

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:03.929 
i think the other half i predict will be
a<00:01:02.650> little<00:01:02.860> bit<00:01:03.010> more<00:01:03.129> action<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.549> stuff<00:01:03.790> like

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
a little bit more action and stuff like

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.700 
a little bit more action and stuff like
that<00:01:04.000> but<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.659> was<00:01:04.750> definitely<00:01:05.019> enjoyable<00:01:05.530> to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
that but it was definitely enjoyable to

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.350 
that but it was definitely enjoyable to
see<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.890> lot<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.100> different<00:01:06.330> mixtures<00:01:07.330> of
