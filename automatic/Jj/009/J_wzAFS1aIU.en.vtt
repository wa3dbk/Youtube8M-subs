to do it go to your local farm store get

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.770 
to do it go to your local farm store get
a<00:03:42.260> go<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.010> welding<00:03:43.370> Department<00:03:43.629> get<00:03:44.629> a

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
a go to the welding Department get a

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.099 
a go to the welding Department get a
torch<00:03:45.199> cleaner<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.150> use<00:03:47.479> the<00:03:47.840> torch

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
torch cleaner and I use the torch

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.909 
torch cleaner and I use the torch
cleaner<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:48.919> run<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.579> up<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:51.260> center<00:03:51.709> of

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
cleaner and I run that up the center of

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.039 
cleaner and I run that up the center of
the<00:03:52.099> breech<00:03:52.310> plug<00:03:52.549> where<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.269> ignitions<00:03:53.810> at

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
the breech plug where the ignitions at

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.360 
the breech plug where the ignitions at
and<00:03:54.349> this<00:03:55.129> has<00:03:55.659> jagged<00:03:56.659> edges<00:03:56.870> on<00:03:57.229> it<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.069> it

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
and this has jagged edges on it so it

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.530 
and this has jagged edges on it so it
will<00:03:58.579> clean<00:03:58.909> out<00:03:59.120> all<00:03:59.359> of<00:03:59.479> the<00:04:00.909> if<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:02.299> will

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
will clean out all of the if you will

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.619 
will clean out all of the if you will

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
pellets or the powder and it gets it

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.270 
pellets or the powder and it gets it
really<00:04:09.229> clean<00:04:11.109> but<00:04:12.109> it's<00:04:12.290> very<00:04:12.620> important<00:04:13.159> to

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
this with bored butter but I'll end up

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.640 
this with bored butter but I'll end up
doing<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.490> I'll<00:04:42.640> end<00:04:42.790> up<00:04:43.110> putting<00:04:44.110> some<00:04:44.260> down

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
it'll be bore buttered and what I'll do

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.910 
it'll be bore buttered and what I'll do
I'll<00:05:17.530> do<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.890> same<00:05:18.160> on<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.460> breech<00:05:18.700> in<00:05:19.140> so<00:05:20.140> if

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
I'll do the same on the breech in so if

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.950 
I'll do the same on the breech in so if
you<00:05:20.980> store<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.670> in<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:22.120> place<00:05:22.390> where<00:05:22.660> you<00:05:22.780> have

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
you store it in a place where you have

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.570 
you store it in a place where you have
high<00:05:23.200> humidity<00:05:24.480> like<00:05:25.480> here<00:05:25.780> in<00:05:25.870> Iowa<00:05:26.580> that

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
high humidity like here in Iowa that

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.510 
high humidity like here in Iowa that
will<00:05:27.970> not<00:05:28.300> allow<00:05:28.510> any<00:05:29.100> moisture<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.340> get

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
will not allow any moisture to get

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.200 
will not allow any moisture to get
inside<00:05:31.000> of<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.450> barrel<00:05:32.640> which<00:05:33.640> will<00:05:36.210> not

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
inside of the barrel which will not

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.760 
inside of the barrel which will not
really<00:05:38.190> mess<00:05:39.190> anything<00:05:39.550> up<00:05:39.700> for<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:39.970> so

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
really mess anything up for you so

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.990 
really mess anything up for you so
that's<00:05:41.770> what<00:05:41.980> I've<00:05:42.130> learned<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:42.490> do<00:05:42.670> because

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
that's what I've learned to do because

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.980 
that's what I've learned to do because
I've<00:05:43.330> stored<00:05:43.960> this<00:05:44.140> in<00:05:44.290> my<00:05:44.410> basement<00:05:44.620> and

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
I've stored this in my basement and

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.810 
I've stored this in my basement and
before<00:05:46.990> doing<00:05:47.200> that<00:05:47.320> I've<00:05:47.770> swapped<00:05:48.340> it<00:05:48.610> and

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
before doing that I've swapped it and

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.300 
before doing that I've swapped it and
I've<00:05:48.970> had<00:05:49.180> rust<00:05:49.540> in<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:49.900> barrel<00:05:50.230> so<00:05:50.500> I've

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310

I've had rust in the barrel so I've
learned<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.700> do<00:05:51.850> this<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:52.360> rust<00:05:52.750> stays

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
learned to do this and that rust stays

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.410 
learned to do this and that rust stays
out<00:05:55.530> other<00:05:56.530> than<00:05:56.650> that<00:05:57.010> oil<00:05:57.670> it<00:05:57.940> up<00:05:58.090> really
