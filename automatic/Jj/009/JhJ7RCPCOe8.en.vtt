issues no these are principles these are
principles<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:01.920> eternal<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.719> we

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
principles that are eternal and if we

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.260 
principles that are eternal and if we
understand<00:01:04.650> those<00:01:04.979> principles<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.119> can

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
understand those principles then we can

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.800 
understand those principles then we can
use<00:01:06.450> them<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.869> template<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:08.570> evaluate<00:01:09.570> all

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
use them as a template to evaluate all

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
use them as a template to evaluate all
of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> issues<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.680> come<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:10.950> either

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
of the issues that come with either

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910 
of the issues that come with either
today<00:01:12.060> tomorrow<00:01:12.479> or<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.229> hundred<00:01:13.590> years<00:01:13.770> from

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
today tomorrow or a hundred years from

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.969 
today tomorrow or a hundred years from
now<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.760> either<00:01:14.909> pass<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.170> principles<00:01:16.740> or

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
now they either pass the principles or

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.460 
now they either pass the principles or
they're<00:01:17.340> defeated<00:01:17.640> by<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> principles<00:01:18.540> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
they're defeated by the principles so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670 
they're defeated by the principles so
the<00:01:19.560> idea<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.400> focus<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.880> principles<00:01:21.689> not

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the idea is to focus on principles not

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.030 
the idea is to focus on principles not
issues<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> certainly<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.060> on

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
issues and certainly not on

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.670 
issues and certainly not on
personalities<00:01:26.689> now<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> can't<00:01:28.110> claim<00:01:28.350> real

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
all in one piece of paper it was really

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.580 
all in one piece of paper it was really
pretty<00:01:46.439> easy<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:48.210> only<00:01:48.329> took<00:01:48.509> me<00:01:48.570> 42<00:01:49.020> years<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pretty easy it only took me 42 years to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
pretty easy it only took me 42 years to
do<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:51.860> well<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> didn't<00:01:53.220> work<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
do it well I didn't work on it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.830 
do it well I didn't work on it
constantly<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:56.070> took<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> long<00:01:56.549> time<00:01:56.840> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
constantly but it took a long time so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.999 
constantly but it took a long time so
here<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> Creed<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> freedom<00:01:59.159> I

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
here it is the Creed of freedom I

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
here it is the Creed of freedom I
believe<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.310> only<00:02:02.689> individuals<00:02:03.689> have

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
believe that only individuals have

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.920 
believe that only individuals have
rights<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.189> collective<00:02:05.640> group<00:02:05.930> that

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
rights not the collective group that

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.479 
rights not the collective group that
these<00:02:07.110> rights<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.590> intrinsic<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> each

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
these rights are intrinsic to each
