00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
average but it's kind of sample my

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.539 
average but it's kind of sample my
opinion<00:03:58.500> cuz<00:03:58.650> man<00:03:58.829> when<00:03:59.099> you<00:03:59.159> play<00:03:59.340> with<00:03:59.519> a

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
opinion cuz man when you play with a

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.059 
opinion cuz man when you play with a
beast<00:03:59.819> party<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.689> really<00:04:00.780> hard<00:04:01.169> to<00:04:01.439> get<00:04:01.829> a
