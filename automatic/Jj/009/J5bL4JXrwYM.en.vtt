00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
summers when it would it felt natural we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
summers when it would it felt natural we
would<00:00:34.739> play<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> took<00:00:36.480> two<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
would play that but when it took two and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
would play that but when it took two and
half<00:00:36.840> years<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> get<00:00:37.230> through<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.680> high

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
half years to get through one your high

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.470 
half years to get through one your high
school<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> way<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
school so be it that was just the way it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.220 
school so be it that was just the way it
was<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.540> give<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
was you know and and so we do give a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.950 
was you know and and so we do give a
time<00:00:43.680> job<00:00:44.010> from<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> first<00:00:45.120> episode<00:00:45.300> into<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
time job from the first episode into the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.290 
time job from the first episode into the
second<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.649> account<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.910> fact<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
second to account for the fact that

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.569 
second to account for the fact that
Rebecca<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:49.190> technically<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Rebecca was technically off the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
Rebecca was technically off the
mericanomad<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.320> we'll<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.559> little

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
mericanomad and so we'll do little

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.110 
mericanomad and so we'll do little
things<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.579> try<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> keep<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
things like that to try to keep the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
things like that to try to keep the
timelines<00:00:54.690> feeling<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.770> they're<00:00:55.949> mirroring

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
timelines feeling like they're mirroring

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
timelines feeling like they're mirroring
each<00:00:56.340> other<00:00:56.579> without<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.570> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
each other without you know because this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
each other without you know because this
will<00:00:58.050> never<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.379> specific<00:00:58.859> enough<00:00:59.039> about

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
will never be specific enough about

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.080 
will never be specific enough about
where<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.670> are

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
where we are

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.529 
where we are
that<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.969> totally<00:01:02.969> discount<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that one will like totally discount the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.969 
that one will like totally discount the
other<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:04.799> bit

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
other and it's going to be a little bit

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.609 
other and it's going to be a little bit
of<00:01:05.070> trickery<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.640> hopefully<00:01:06.119> it'll<00:01:06.240> work

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
of trickery but hopefully it'll work

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.880 
of trickery but hopefully it'll work
what<00:01:07.619> are<00:01:07.710> we

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
