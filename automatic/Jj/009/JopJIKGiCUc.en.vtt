00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello good evening everyone and welcome to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.450
 this video where I will be able to you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 learn all the combinations we 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.769
 can go out to poker to win a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.210
 hand then the combinations I 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.480
 presentais will go from the weakest 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.060
 to the strongest ie if you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 have a combination of the beginning of that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.020
 that I want to introduce and that the other in 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 face a combination that is towards the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 end of the one I present and the other 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.630
 will win because your combination 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.510
 will be weaker 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 the first combination is the map 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.480
 the highest 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.079
 if you have for example a king in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.910
 your hand or better an ace and that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 no one else has anything to do with 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.550
 on top or a pair a role in all this 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.530
 and you have the strongest card 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.820
 from all hands present around 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 the table you win the game 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.610
 the second possible combinations the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.010
 also known is the pair if you 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.930
 have a pair of aces for example or a 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 pair of anything else and that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.170
 nobody has a loss with a figure 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.420
 higher a higher head or a one 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.659
 stronger combination you win the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.619
 sleeve the second we can have 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.990
 it's the double pair if you have an ace 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.150
 in your hand and that on the flop 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 there is an ace and a parent who 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.720
 appears you have a first pair 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.659
 aud jpy you have for example an eight 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.280
 in your hand and that an 8 and that 15.8 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 talk we come to the flop 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.250
 so you have a pair of 8 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.909
 a pair of aces that's the rank just at 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.840
 above the pair what beats the double 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.750
 pair is the three of a kind 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.570
 obviously three cards of the same rank 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.159
 of course if you have a three of a kind and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.439
 than the other in front of a straight set 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.600
 the other one will win because he has a 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:00.780
 three of a kind with more level cards 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 raised the fifth leave the one that goes the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.540
 burning if you have for example five 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.060
 cards 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:18.880
 which follow each other for example age without the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:26.090
 straight das 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:28.130
 there you have or five cards 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.240
 at the end of the round no matter which one 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.430
 that you had in your hand if you 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.200
 had the l2 in your hand and the 3 4 5 in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.170
 flop you know happens if you had the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.250
 5 and 4 in the hand and the pass of three 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:45.140
 on the flop as long as you manage to 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.030
 gather five cards that follow you 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.790
 have a fifth that can beat a 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.709
 brelan a double pair a pair or the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.920
 highest map then la 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.850
 combination at the top of the map it's 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.040
 the color if you have 5 people cards 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.050
 that I am gay clover five cards of 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:13.670
 same color and same shape 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.870
 I have 4 already, and here we are 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.540
 matter what I had in my hand 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.489
 they may not follow each other if you 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.750
 have 5 clover cloaks at the end of the 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.370
 sleeve you can beat the fifth the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.810
 burning the double pair 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.000
 the pair and the highest card 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:38.560
 then the next combination is 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.510
 the full then the full how we do it 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.510
 we do with a three of a kind 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.469
 and a pair so here we have these 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.090
 three cards the same and a pair of 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:56.159
 cards the same way you can 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.370
 have any card in your 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.090
 hand provided that at the end of the round 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.280
 you have your trip and your father 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.430
 Here it is a combination that already 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.879
 is starting to be difficult to have because 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.790
 that it is a lot of chance and we have 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.280
 we do not often have the opportunity to see 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.150
 that's when I think it's there 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:28.620
 many to have is the square then 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:32.840
 obviously we have four cards of the same 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.840
 value if I can find here are three 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.229
 hernia worlds here I say that's the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.820
 more difficult to find 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.160
 because of the moment when someone a 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.590
 square it is very likely that someone 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.360
 is one too 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.970
 and if you have a quarter is 3 and that 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.169
 the other to a square of 5 for example 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.639
 the other one will still win although 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.900
 you have a pretty strong hand 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.979
 So here by simply because 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:03.690
 that he has a higher square of cards 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:06.750
 now the flush flush takes that 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:11.010
 takes that takes support on the color 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.020
 normal is if you have cards of 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:18.720
 stings a sequence of five cards of spades 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:23.539
 that follow each other so it's even more 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.539
 hard alas if I go out ace of spades 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:36.240
 that's where I actually have a mixture of 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.740
 after 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.710
 finally following the colors and is 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.370
 a normal sequel so here it gives us 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.470
 a flush is one of the cards 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.639
 is stronger one of the neighborhoods of 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.990
 strongest combinations 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:06:02.310
 so now that's the combination that 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:05.290
 which came all the other combinations 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.600
 it's the royal flush 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.210
 so what is going to consist of the fifth 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.570
 royal it will consist of having the 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.620
 combination that follows one must have 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:23.770
 the ace of spades the king of spades 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:28.979
 the queen of spades the jack of spades and the 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.979
 last if I find him 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.770
 I lost the last where she is we go 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:43.080
 to find it is not serious is the 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.030
 say spades the royal flush 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:51.720
 it's just five cards of 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:57.280
 same color in this order there as 10 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:01.120
 was worthy lady is king here belongs 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.340
 you have that no more no other hand 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.080
 can face this combination 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.930
 simply because if you have 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.940
 this combination the other person does not 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.390
 can have it so you have won the 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.220
 handle for sure that's it I hope it 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:20.040
 you were pleased 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.040
 have a good time see you soon
