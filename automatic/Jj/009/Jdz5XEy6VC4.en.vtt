that<00:00:17.429> they<00:00:18.269> were<00:00:18.300> still<00:00:18.599> a<00:00:18.630> little<00:00:18.840> too<00:00:19.109> loud

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
that they were still a little too loud

has some harsher tones to it this is all
pretty<00:03:18.540> mellow<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.980> Vance<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.400> Hines<00:03:21.230> if

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
pretty mellow on the Vance and Hines if

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.259 
pretty mellow on the Vance and Hines if
I<00:03:22.440> had<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> bike<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.250> did<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.849> a<00:03:23.879> radio

I had a bike that did not have a radio
in<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.720> would<00:03:24.840> probably<00:03:25.379> stick<00:03:26.099> with<00:03:26.129> the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
in it I would probably stick with the

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.880 
in it I would probably stick with the
CFR's<00:03:27.209> because<00:03:27.810> you've<00:03:28.200> got<00:03:28.410> nothing<00:03:28.739> but

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
CFR's because you've got nothing but

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.830 
CFR's because you've got nothing but
muffler<00:03:29.310> music<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.790> listen<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.810> really

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
muffler music to listen to and it really

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.619 
muffler music to listen to and it really
