00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.890 
um it doesn't replace the DLC entirely
because<00:00:27.440> I'm<00:00:27.710> pretty<00:00:27.890> sure<00:00:28.039> that<00:00:28.430> they'll

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
because I'm pretty sure that they'll

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.240 
because I'm pretty sure that they'll
remake<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.110> way<00:00:30.200> the<00:00:30.380> factions<00:00:30.890> will<00:00:31.070> look

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.590 
earlier was like a hundred and twenty
factions<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.680> choose<00:01:00.890> from<00:01:01.160> with<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:01.489> mod<00:01:01.730> so

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
still really cool and fun to play and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.740
