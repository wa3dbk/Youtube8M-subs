00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.840
 in this video we will calculate a square 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.710
 of a difference of two forms 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.710
 different 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.509
 we will calculate 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.710
 2x - yes 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 squared first of all we know that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.170
 2x 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.170
 yes squared 2 x 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.780
 2x yes and now we multiply all by 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.600
 everyone 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:38.710
 this for 2x by 2 x 4 x squared 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.210
 for 2 xx less and more x less less and 2 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 x for these x 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:53.190
 now less and by 2 x less for more 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:56.550
 less and by 2x commutative property 2x 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 and now less and for less and less for 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.920
 minus plus and by and squared 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.910
 we will have 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910
 squared 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.100
 now minus 2 x and minus 2 x and apart 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:16.710
 literal the letters are the same x and less 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.710
 2 - 2 - 4x 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.070
 and now finally more and squared 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.830
 we have calculated in a first way 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.370
 by definition a square 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.350
 the expression by the expression but 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.090
 we also know 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.570
 to calculate 2 x less and squared 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.730
 square of a subtraction unless 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.350
 square we know it is 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.390
 square first plus square the second 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.840
 less double the first for the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.840
 second 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.380
 then this would be applying this 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.510
 expression that we have here and that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.480
 expression is demonstrated by doing what 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.500
 same as we have done above 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.930
 it develops us 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.310
 4 the first plus with the second square 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.789
 of the first 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.300
 square of the second least twice 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.130
 first double the first by the second 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.650
 this is 2x squared 2 al 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.940
 square because it squares 4 x to the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.890
 square plus and squared were minus 2 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.480
 x 2 minus 4 x 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.810
 two ways to effect the same 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.600
 operation and obviously the result and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.330
 as we can see 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.330
 this is how the result is the same
