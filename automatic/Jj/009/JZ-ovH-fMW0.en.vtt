00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.600
 All the people I'm sure of this year and saw with a new market 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.410
 carpet 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.830
 Smart was there and it last because they are not just the 50 technician 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.779
 that is a bit silly now 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:14.690
 but let's see 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.789
 So whether he writes the oncoming traffic with Fanny what makes this motto 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:19.470
 adds 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.679
 Three new ones then test us 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.829
 here i have the normal then i have of course all of Frank 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.169
 Frye is fighting 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.689
 about that Sinclair comes wanted 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.170
 here that is the normal plants have the code then have to 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.930
 therein 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.570
 Gates said Biedermann and ideas 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.530
 percent 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 Places and others may like that 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.360
 the painter has three special features the new first every normal 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.770
 natural shape I have and it is a hand to him 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.220
 Do not be surprised that it's happening so fast now 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.110
 Jan Meiners again Corner with the normal stuff per circle Wesel 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.800
 and two more 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.320
 this is the normal couple after 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.460
 the RIAA Albion 3 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.210
 are a bit more complex 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 startup rolls on the standard first 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.940
 percent 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.860
 the eight-year-old and thus 5 percentage points for the market 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.520
 two rather than just one 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.289
 who would have nothing nonsense 2 ZPO without decency want 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.290
 that welds 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.740
 not so far as it was just right by Dr 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 Robbie Maddison does that 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.600
 from stubborn 4 1 front I have extinguished the exclamation confessed is the other 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.740
 warm meal Finland I have hacked out 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.840
 different Service Gelenau helps four diamonds so you can see that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.080
 it's better than the other one 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.540
 a cake thriller he again three diamonds as he looks at the tops are 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.860
 here he quacks defied the old ones are already much better here 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.500
 the next round Stella Bresler to songs in the St there 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.510
 Putin had recently been in transition 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.750
 so what has come up 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.930
 after all, the tournament did not understand so not so Reeker not 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.589
 he is a bit stupid now 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:17.549
 no idea why that is if that is to be suspected is that us again 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.389
 on 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.439
 I think I see formally 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.969
 After such a result, a child and a family can be added 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.179
 not hold this time 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.049
 Peter Krettek percent weighted 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.630
 Everything I then kept under lock and key 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.599
 one two Three 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.249
 Prize won 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.029
 and 8 including 1 Lions Wonder 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:47.419
 what now every percent I do not know if I start too stupid and they die 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.879
 festive or gives chicane 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.190
 So whoever either only exists in this or Lattek has them in general 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.269
 simply no KERS or the Loom prohibit people from coming 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.119
 Knecht sorry that's strange most important I do not know 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.119
 why that is 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.779
 while not being wealthy either 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.349
 Percent exactly so that we then much Borna but 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.439
 Rheine 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.839
 Ronan seems to be unless I'm just unlucky 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.239
 the Illertisser Côte d'azur and then the last Dr 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.560
 But I think I have done that with TNT because this is always one 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.219
 Special feature draws for years 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:38.209
 That's in Moers 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.969
 League not 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.969
 Ties I meant Hetfield down 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.689
 Neo bayern-chance at the top but to make it better here long 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.219
 it fits 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.349
 Percent why is not too deep inside but so much light 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:58.880
 no idea 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.880
 Piech the procedure percent 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.859
 fluent than he looks 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.859
 1 4 am 8 it would be nice now one more 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.359
 that hiker also somewhere else 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.250
 okay if I'm in the wall but in the wall of his and here everything is fix 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.779
 He also got one of them 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.779
 the procedure is still open 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.860
 Well, apparently not 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.029
 and me here on earth is different from Mattias 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.159
 one sees 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.520
 that seems tih 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.210
 Ultra Light misses he is a pity 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.620
 gloomy but twice and Münster clear 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.500
 Bürk, I can demonstrate everything now with this murder too 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 newly added cancer fire of course not 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.550
 and that is currently drawing life 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.830
 a silence 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.270
 Thie 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.250
 there are sometimes services my life out because otherwise you can so far just industry 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.250
 not fully refueling should just do it you no longer see 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.520
 I can with the shovel all in one fell swoop everything 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.520
 Moderately dismantling a shovel is the keyword 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.809
 with the first duty my God we have a chance we have completely 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.870
 nice broken "at the Hertha 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.870
 okay that's pretty cool 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.839
 So a super bad run 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:23.560
 more 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.389
 Tel 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.319
 then we have a super fast 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.150
 Matchday 11 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
 Gerd Weymann victory of CETV no longer earth and I have 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:34.939
 leave it 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.759
 I wonder if they break with Plock with just we try 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.759
 have it yes 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 and that man from Art 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.960
 By the way, that's probably the last traffic coming to what percent ASK year 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.509
 will show 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:54.699
 Kläsener 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.699
 20 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.569
 Zack makes all LAV a radius of 20 and Rebecca and sewers 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:04.839
 erupts 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:08.809
 The city council you can not but I think that's it 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:11.599
 do not worry enough formally not only moan 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.279
 Dr then of course there is still to think that Oenning himself 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.229
 Do not be surprised that the whole time has built the next edition of the houses 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.580
 the canopy me a weather change 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.569
 because the troops are made up 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.569
 we assume despite 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.849
 So beneficials also degenerate snacks while I can with the ax I here 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.059
 custom 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.960
 to break everything with one blow 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.509
 as it seems not 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.339
 Collins the referee does not exist 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:40.710
 Meier OKI that is 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.550
 this waits i hope you liked it and then i say that 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.240
 First of all I feel
