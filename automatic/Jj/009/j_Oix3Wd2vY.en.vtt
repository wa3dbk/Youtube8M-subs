cancelled Tron 3 I don't really see that
happening<00:06:36.500> but<00:06:37.500> I'm<00:06:37.620> certain<00:06:38.070> it<00:06:38.250> would<00:06:38.310> make

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
happening but I'm certain it would make

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.730 
happening but I'm certain it would make
a<00:06:38.490> profit<00:06:39.060> just<00:06:39.360> for

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
a profit just for

singing<00:06:40.130> a<00:06:40.280> million<00:06:40.580> times<00:06:41.050> although<00:06:42.050> I<00:06:42.080> would

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
singing a million times although I would

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.600 
singing a million times although I would
not<00:06:42.500> be<00:06:42.949> opposed<00:06:43.370> to<00:06:43.849> a<00:06:43.880> well<00:06:44.210> done<00:06:44.449> reboot

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
not be opposed to a well done reboot

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.279 
not be opposed to a well done reboot
basically<00:06:46.610> I<00:06:46.910> see<00:06:47.180> Disney's<00:06:47.660> Inspector

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
look at Space Jam I understand why is

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.279 
look at Space Jam I understand why is
this<00:06:54.289> liked<00:06:54.650> and<00:06:55.069> hated<00:06:55.520> by<00:06:55.669> many<00:06:55.729> people<00:06:56.449> but

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
this liked and hated by many people but

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.529 
this liked and hated by many people but
I<00:06:57.349> consumed<00:06:57.979> it<00:06:58.160> so<00:06:58.490> much<00:06:58.729> in<00:06:58.910> my<00:06:59.060> younger<00:06:59.389> days

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
I consumed it so much in my younger days

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.620 
I consumed it so much in my younger days
I've<00:07:00.289> too<00:07:00.949> big<00:07:01.310> of<00:07:01.430> a<00:07:01.520> soft<00:07:01.759> spot<00:07:02.000> for<00:07:02.300> it<00:07:02.479> and

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
I've too big of a soft spot for it and

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.219 
I've too big of a soft spot for it and
so<00:07:03.169> I<00:07:03.199> genuinely<00:07:03.949> liked<00:07:04.520> it<00:07:04.789> less<00:07:05.720> of<00:07:05.750> the<00:07:06.080> day

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
so I genuinely liked it less of the day

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.870 
so I genuinely liked it less of the day
