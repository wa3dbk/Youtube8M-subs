them with your bow now what's really

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.310 
them with your bow now what's really
weird<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.060> timing<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.690> mean<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:43.960> have<00:01:44.140> to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
weird is the timing I mean you have to

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.740 
weird is the timing I mean you have to
hit<00:01:44.500> him<00:01:44.620> when<00:01:44.770> he<00:01:44.860> sort<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.280> ducking<00:01:45.850> not<00:01:46.570> when

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
hit him when he sort of ducking not when

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.480 
hit him when he sort of ducking not when
he's<00:01:46.870> standing<00:01:47.140> up<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.710> guess<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.159> would<00:01:48.280> make

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
he's standing up I guess that would make

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.120 
he's standing up I guess that would make
too<00:01:48.730> much<00:01:48.880> sense<00:01:48.940> so<00:01:49.510> it's<00:01:50.229> obviously<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.830> game

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
too much sense so it's obviously a game

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.060 
too much sense so it's obviously a game
flaw<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:53.140> there's<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.470> level<00:01:53.830> where<00:01:53.979> you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
flaw then there's that level where you

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.880 
flaw then there's that level where you
have<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.400> save<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.850> dam<00:01:55.229> April<00:01:56.229> O'Neil<00:01:56.560> says
