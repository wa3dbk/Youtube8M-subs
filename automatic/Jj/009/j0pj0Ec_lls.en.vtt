00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
rounded look as you can see this is a

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.990 
rounded look as you can see this is a
3.7<00:03:48.600> inch<00:03:48.720> screen<00:03:49.020> it's<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.590> bigger<00:03:49.800> device<00:03:50.010> but

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
3.7 inch screen it's a bigger device but

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.050 
3.7 inch screen it's a bigger device but
it's<00:03:51.180> not<00:03:51.390> huge<00:03:51.660> either<00:03:51.930> in<00:03:52.290> comparison<00:03:53.060> in

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
it's not huge either in comparison in

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.300 
it's not huge either in comparison in
terms<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.480> thickness<00:03:54.690> well<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.740> is<00:03:55.950> thinner

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
terms of thickness well it is thinner

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.260 
terms of thickness well it is thinner
and<00:04:00.440> now<00:04:01.440> we'll<00:04:01.590> take<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.800> look<00:04:02.040> at<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.270> Nexus

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
and now we'll take a look at the Nexus

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.170 
and now we'll take a look at the Nexus
One<00:04:03.330> compared<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.960> HTC<00:04:04.530> hd2<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:05.970> runs

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
One compared to HTC hd2 this runs

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.960 
One compared to HTC hd2 this runs
windows<00:04:06.540> mobile<00:04:06.810> 6.5<00:04:07.500> with<00:04:07.920> their<00:04:08.160> Sense<00:04:08.640> UI

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
windows mobile 6.5 with their Sense UI

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.660 
windows mobile 6.5 with their Sense UI
and<00:04:09.810> as<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.020> can<00:04:10.170> see<00:04:10.320> this<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.710> 4.3<00:04:11.370> inch

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
and as you can see this is a 4.3 inch

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.790 
and as you can see this is a 4.3 inch
screen<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.270> is<00:04:12.450> absolutely<00:04:13.080> huge<00:04:13.290> also

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
screen so this is absolutely huge also

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.220 
screen so this is absolutely huge also
capacitive<00:04:14.490> so<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.270> is<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.450> much<00:04:16.049> bigger

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
capacitive so this is a much bigger

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.990 
capacitive so this is a much bigger
device<00:04:16.650> probably<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.130> biggest<00:04:17.280> slab<00:04:17.730> design

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
device probably the biggest slab design

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.789 
device probably the biggest slab design

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
nonetheless quite cool thickness is

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.030 
nonetheless quite cool thickness is
about<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.250> same<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.300> two<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.690> these<00:04:24.780> guys

is a little bigger despite obviously
this<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.550> lot<00:05:02.820> less<00:05:02.970> chunky<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.570> little<00:05:04.230> bit

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
this is a lot less chunky a little bit

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:12.640 
this is a lot less chunky a little bit
taller<00:05:06.800> okay<00:05:07.830> nokia<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.640> quite<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> thick<00:05:09.570> phone

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.690 

and<00:05:13.820> then<00:05:14.820> we've<00:05:14.940> got<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.240> iPhone<00:05:15.660> 3GS<00:05:16.700> which

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
and then we've got the iPhone 3GS which

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.330 
and then we've got the iPhone 3GS which
is<00:05:19.790> let<00:05:20.790> me<00:05:20.910> see<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.120> bit<00:05:21.419> bigger<00:05:21.890> in<00:05:22.890> terms<00:05:23.100> of

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
is let me see a bit bigger in terms of

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.640 
is let me see a bit bigger in terms of
thickness<00:05:23.520> they<00:05:24.030> are<00:05:24.270> dead-on<00:05:24.930> pretty

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
thickness they are dead-on pretty

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.270 
thickness they are dead-on pretty
similar<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.700> looks<00:05:26.940> like<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:28.040> Nexus<00:05:29.040> One<00:05:29.070> is

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
similar and looks like the Nexus One is

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.679 
similar and looks like the Nexus One is
actually<00:05:29.940> just<00:05:30.479> a<00:05:30.630> hair<00:05:30.810> thinner<00:05:31.110> though

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.999 

here's<00:05:35.689> the<00:05:35.810> most<00:05:35.960> obvious<00:05:36.409> comparison

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
here's the most obvious comparison

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.749 
here's the most obvious comparison
coming<00:05:37.370> on<00:05:37.520> this<00:05:37.729> is<00:05:37.909> a<00:05:38.710> Motorola<00:05:39.710> Droid<00:05:39.979> they
