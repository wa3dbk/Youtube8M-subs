00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.760
 this is the new volvo v40 big country 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.029
 and that may be something that maybe others 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.609
 you can not do that automatically 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.570
 Park the whole without hands on 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.109
 steering wheel 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.630
 So what do you call premium class what 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:29.079
 So it's different at the new big country 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.369
 compared to the normal 40 of volvo 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.380
 closer to the one the darker 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.750
 front bumper then we have one 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.470
 underrun protection and the side skirts 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.530
 are also very new to come three 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 centimeter more ground clearance being one 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.879
 a little something the side skirts 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.440
 takes away and the seat height is also 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.800
 3 cm higher 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.719
 all-wheel drive is the volvo v40 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.780
 cross country only for the strongest 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.489
 gasoline variant and for the terrain 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.969
 and he is not really so 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.309
 built 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.260
 Volvo has always been big on things 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.949
 safety and technology what is there to it 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.800
 reported 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.840
 pedestrian airbag city safety system rsc 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.290
 rollover protection systems quite normal from 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.630
 passenger decks braking energy recovery 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.150
 speed limiter track maintenance assistant and and 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.820
 and the interior did not fit 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.890
 Everything looks absolutely high quality and is 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.020
 It also looks extremely good and too 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.880
 if there are many buttons on board 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.259
 everything very clearly arranged 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.119
 really nice cockpit with a lot 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.100
 foamed rich plastic parts 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.280
 who wants to can also the fittings 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.610
 customize your own design 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.159
 the 177 hp diesel is a 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.920
 really strong church 400 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.399
 Newton meters click the sweden in 8 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.259
 6 seconds on 100 km h is the landing gear 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.380
 relatively sporty that really has us 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.740
 Surprised and almost total 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.500
 In terms of consumption, we are included 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.189
 5.2 liters according to the test , we were at 6 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.310
 5 to 7 liters with which something fast 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.990
 GasfuÃŸ the six-speed automatic over the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.450
 she is very well taken 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.100
 an absolute space wonder is the big one 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.320
 country not to invent driver and 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.020
 front passenger good place but through the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.209
 sloping tail is the headroom of the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.010
 fondpassage somewhat limited and 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.459
 The freedom from the knees could also be better 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.690
 his 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.970
 the trunk with a 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.760
 of 330 liters 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.019
 not necessarily very big the new 40 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 is not a combo but a 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.700
 lifestyle course but who wants more space 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.700
 must stop one before 60 or 70 euro 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.819
 the cheapest wall 40 cross country 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.940
