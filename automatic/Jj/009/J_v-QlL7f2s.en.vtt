00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 we all take it with history 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 but I say the fault is ours 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.040
 it is obvious that little chair people 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.639
 when I talk about it to the left but 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.639
 what is the right 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.710
 so 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:26.060
 it goes very well left 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.730
 disposed 98th installments of paper sings 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.000
 let's talk about texas we talk about 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.320
 employees who through incentivized outcomes 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.269
 through alignment and through 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.550
 relocations on the net will leave the 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:41.059
 tercas la caripe we have already talked about the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.620
 43 46 employees among the tercas caripe ma 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.780

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.470
 We will read about union moments today 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.790
 together we were saying prediction of 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.620
 temperature time, however, I ask for an invitation 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.949
 unions are certainly a lot 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.609
 clearer with their members 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.140
 target sizing 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.449
 resources have been indicated in 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.160
 test terms not distinguishing between 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.360
 full time and part time this is 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.070
 important 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.200
 the employees charged in posting with 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.000
 tercas are included in the office they were 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.369
 bari 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.600
 the indicated sizing plan 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.530
 will be the subject of possible future 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.810
 evaluations including changes 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.140
 I read you internet shouting inter home

 for planning and control of 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.869
 management 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.450
 less 3 assignment and for human resources 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.899
 the budget administration we have less 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.399

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.280

 there are 46 for the total credit line 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.690
 this is the plan the organization chart of 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.299
 the sizing of the target is given 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.430
 very, very important because it makes 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.380
 make clear the future of 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.720
 planning on our territory 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.730
 meanwhile the European union is 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.739
 investigating state aid to the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.109
 tercas as far as we are concerned 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.760
 soon we will be able to publish 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.350
 we can't get exceptional documents 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.500
 speak immediately but in the coming days 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.990
 what we can say that not everything is 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.020
 as it seems 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.020
