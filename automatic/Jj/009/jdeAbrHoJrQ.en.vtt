00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
label boo and I would just imagine a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
label boo and I would just imagine a
normal<00:00:41.910> label<00:00:42.239> 2<00:00:42.390> switches<00:00:42.690> fall<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:43.050> off

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
normal label 2 switches fall right off

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
normal label 2 switches fall right off
because<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.980> can't<00:00:44.760> imagine<00:00:44.960> using<00:00:46.789> such<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
because I can't imagine using such a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.990 
because I can't imagine using such a
toxic<00:00:48.180> chemical<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.489> label<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.940> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
toxic chemical on to the label and it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.350 
toxic chemical on to the label and it
not<00:00:51.210> coming<00:00:51.420> off<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.590> oh<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.920> goodness<00:00:53.360> still

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
not coming off but oh my goodness still

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
not coming off but oh my goodness still
they're<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:56.059> coming<00:00:57.059> off<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.649> also<00:00:58.649> thought<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
they're not coming off I also thought it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.390

would<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.730> fun<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.329> put<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.840> label<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400
