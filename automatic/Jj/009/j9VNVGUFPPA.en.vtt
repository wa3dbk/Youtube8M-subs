think<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.809> Snyder<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.379> puts<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> pressure

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
think if Snyder just puts the pressure

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
think if Snyder just puts the pressure
and<00:00:44.190> felt<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.760> again<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.149> he<00:00:45.360> did<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and felt like again like he did in the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.110 
and felt like again like he did in the
first<00:00:45.930> half<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.410> finds<00:00:47.190> his<00:00:47.309> market<00:00:47.820> could<00:00:47.969> be

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
first half but finds his market could be

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.830 
first half but finds his market could be
a<00:00:48.149> whole<00:00:48.360> different<00:00:48.390> result<00:00:50.629> both<00:00:51.629> fighters

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
a whole different result both fighters

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.660 
a whole different result both fighters
is<00:00:52.170> trading<00:00:52.620> equal<00:00:52.920> over<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.579> at

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
is trading equal over there look at

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.709 
is trading equal over there look at
schneider<00:00:53.940> though<00:00:54.180> still<00:00:54.449> without

schneider though still without

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
schneider though still without
aggression<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:55.800> he<00:00:55.920> needs<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.219> do

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
