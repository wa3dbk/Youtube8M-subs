probably<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.350> 20<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.890> 30<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.730> didn't

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
probably like 20 or 30 of them I didn't

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.819 
probably like 20 or 30 of them I didn't
actually<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> achievement<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.530> run

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
actually get the achievement on this run

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.380 
actually get the achievement on this run
i<00:00:58.859> had<00:00:59.129> gotten<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.520> earlier<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.210> just

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
i had gotten it earlier and I'm just

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.740 
i had gotten it earlier and I'm just
rerecording<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> guys<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
rerecording it for you guys here and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.640 
rerecording it for you guys here and
like<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.870> said<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.379> done<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.619> one

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
like I said it has to be done in one

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
like I said it has to be done in one
match<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.280> seems<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> could<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.119> hard

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
match which seems like it could be hard

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.870 
match which seems like it could be hard
but<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.720> very<00:01:07.020> very<00:01:07.110> manageable<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
but it is very very manageable if you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
but it is very very manageable if you
actually<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.600> final<00:01:10.110> area<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> clear

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually get to the final area and clear

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
actually get to the final area and clear
out<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.700> least<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.090> few<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> hives<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
out at least a few of the hives in the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
out at least a few of the hives in the
final<00:01:13.200> area<00:01:13.380> you'll<00:01:13.650> probably<00:01:14.070> come<00:01:14.549> across

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
final area you'll probably come across

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.260 
final area you'll probably come across
over<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> hundred<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.500> things<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
over a hundred of these things now as I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
over a hundred of these things now as I
said<00:01:18.330> these<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.780> spawned<00:01:19.259> by<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.680> little

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
said these are spawned by the little

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
said these are spawned by the little
cedar<00:01:20.670> guys<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.780> could<00:01:22.350> theoretically

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
cedar guys now you could theoretically

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.730 
cedar guys now you could theoretically
do<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.490> achievement<00:01:24.360> very<00:01:24.780> easily<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
do this achievement very easily at the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.039 
do this achievement very easily at the
very<00:01:25.979> beginning<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.090> game<00:01:27.330> using<00:01:27.869> only

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
very beginning of the game using only

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
very beginning of the game using only
one<00:01:28.470> cedar<00:01:28.829> that's<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> consistently

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
one cedar that's going to consistently

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.319 
one cedar that's going to consistently
generate<00:01:30.090> more<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> more<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.890> these

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
generate more and more and more of these

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.940 
generate more and more and more of these
however<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.900> quite<00:01:34.110> difficult<00:01:34.439> if

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
however it can get quite difficult if

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
however it can get quite difficult if
you<00:01:35.100> let<00:01:35.310> these<00:01:35.549> things<00:01:35.600> overrun<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.439> make

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you let these things overrun you so make

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
you let these things overrun you so make
sure<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.220> trying<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> boost<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.360> too

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
sure you're not trying to boost it too

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600 
sure you're not trying to boost it too
hard<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> let<00:01:40.740> too<00:01:41.009> many<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
hard because if you let too many of the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
hard because if you let too many of the
Cedars<00:01:42.000> run<00:01:42.270> around<00:01:42.540> wild<00:01:42.990> you'll<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
Cedars run around wild you'll have a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
Cedars run around wild you'll have a
really<00:01:44.460> hard<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:45.270> clearing<00:01:45.990> out

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
really hard time actually clearing out

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.649 
really hard time actually clearing out
