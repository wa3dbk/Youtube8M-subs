00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.199
 for 2014 honda presents the new 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.390
 was xo 701 cosco home basic derivatives 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 dnc 700 is equipped with the box series 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 automatic side and down with 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.300
 his rigid suitcases and his fairing 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.949
 minimalist she is inspired by style 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.890
 biker but rely more on 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.850
 technology only on the vintage spirit 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.829
 accessible to permits to two she herself 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.839
 wants economical and easy to drive 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.409
 combining comfort technologies and 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:54.839
 experience so we are of course a 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.519
 custom with a very low saddle a 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.640
 great customer who returns well to the 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.340
 pilot 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.020
 and advanced foot controls but 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.520
 without exaggeration 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 even the little people can 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.090
 so reach the protection remains 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.790
 minimal to tell the truth it's a little bit 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.760
 as if 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.550
 it ensures a roadster the little one 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.250
 the windbreaker does his duty up to a 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.470
 certain speed but actually 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.830
 will soon be in the pear and already 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.180
 she's still really exploding but 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.180
 that's also the custom spirit 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.300
 side practical aspect we regret a little 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.960
 that the suitcases can not contain 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.960
 a jet helmet 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.150
 for the traffic inter files of course 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.790
 the young suitcases a little bit once 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.370
 that we took the measure of their width 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.920
 no problem 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.210
 Anyway we can also very well 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.010
 remove network we also regret 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.540
 the absence of a center stand since 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.210
 here no strap but a chain to 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.980
 maintain the honda ctx at 700 is 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.930
 equipped with a handlebar parking brake 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.850
 left easy to use and practical 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.620
 there is also a storage space 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.210
 able to host a phone under 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.750
 the hatch that conceals the stopper 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.910
 tank 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.650
 the all-digital dashboard is 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.300
 reveals sufficiently readable and complete 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.200
 so maybe an indicator of 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.840
 average consumption 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.820
 the cti hx700 embeds the box 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.010
 automatic double clutch dct de 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.460
 second generation and dragged on the nc 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460
 500 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.930
 this automatic is very soft 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.020
 some jolts can be sensitive 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.680
 especially during downshifts especially 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.070
 in the sport mode but the whole is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.230
 really very very nice to drive 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.770
 and we quickly get used to not 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.070
 have a clutch lever nest nor the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.430
 speed selector we have three 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:09.210
 modes in full automatic mode 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.210
 a completely manual mode or in 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.370
 automatic the ability to load 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.610
 speeds through the gates 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.170
 left handlebar the drive mode is at 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.520
 book cruising reports 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.550
 show so quickly that we find ourselves in 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.020
 6th at 65 km time the engine accepts without 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.550
 flinching but it's not ideal in 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.800
 city â€‹â€‹or to overtake effectively 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.600
 however a clear listing of the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.070
 gas handle and the system includes 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 that you need more 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.600
 power and retrograde of itself 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.410
 the six-cent line six- cylinder 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.360
 seventy cubic centimeters 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.920
 favors the low and middle couple 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.400
 diet with power and a couple 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.370
 max of 47.5 horses at 6000 250 rpm 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.700
 minute and 69 m hackett 1750 rounds 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.700
 minute 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.210
 this engine will express itself more if we 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.990
 uses the sport mode of the box 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.720
 automatic 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.489
 in this sport mode is speed going up 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.340
 less quickly and one can enjoy 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:29.190
 more of the acceleration and so the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.110
 standardized consumption of 3 58 liters 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.220
 the cent announced by honda should be 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.170
 putting in pipe casting 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.460
 even though we passed it during this 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.390
 try the custom again when the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.750
 suspensions 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.470
 with a very flexible fork 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:51.820
 a rear shock is also 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.230
 flexible without this general place 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.889
 penalizes the handling 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.719
 braking side 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.729
 lips again in the custom 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.190
 the front and back clothes very 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.950
 progressive one's attention 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.740
 Hogweed defense has frequently 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.080
 the back so we will be careful 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.810
 measure the whole especially that there is 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.630
 no braking against 7.7 in August 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.490
 in any case she has more really a 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:25.930
 good maneuverability thanks to 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:26.889
 gravity placed very low well it is 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.639
 time now to try the version 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:34.360
 Maya passengers on the handlebar not good 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.130
 wait, let's settle this chifoumi 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:42.940
 it is said already won to the Mayans 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:43.599
 behind and here we go I played 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.509
 I lost 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:49.539
 so you're high school handlebar that's the 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.940
 saddle is not very thick it's not 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.810
 very long 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:06:00.539
 the handles are wide enough but in 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.610
 rematched back of 6 sentenced arm 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.949
 in short you will have understood the sharing and 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.509
 the Slovak does not have the hard time too much 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:12.190
 long refreshing alternative 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.500
 in the range of test models 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.030
 were accessible and easy the ccx 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.009
 would have deserved a real suitcase and a 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.599
 a bit lower rate knowing that she 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.130
 just take back the old ones 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.130
 engines and ctd nc
