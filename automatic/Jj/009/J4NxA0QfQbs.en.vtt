00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.210 

I

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.220 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.230 

I<00:00:16.130> bet<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.370> a<00:00:17.400> lot<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.610> questions<00:00:18.030> about

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
I bet you have a lot of questions about

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.060 
I bet you have a lot of questions about
the<00:00:18.510> loop<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.290> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the loop so we're going to just have a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.010 
the loop so we're going to just have a
little<00:00:20.279> jam<00:00:20.580> session<00:00:20.610> here<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.480> hopefully

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
little jam session here and hopefully

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.370 
little jam session here and hopefully
we'll<00:00:22.350> answer<00:00:22.500> some<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.860> those<00:00:22.980> questions<00:00:24.380> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
we'll answer some of those questions I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.069 
we'll answer some of those questions I
know<00:00:26.630> you<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:28.640> they<00:00:29.640> let<00:00:29.790> it<00:00:29.910> go<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
know you are there they let it go and

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.010 
know you are there they let it go and
just<00:00:31.140> come<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.619> space<00:00:31.980> much<00:00:32.220> whoa<00:00:32.810> this<00:00:33.810> is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
just come out of space much whoa this is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.120 
just come out of space much whoa this is
amazing<00:00:37.310> that's<00:00:38.310> my<00:00:38.550> ring<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.710> touch<00:00:40.950> my

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
amazing that's my ring I can touch my

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.710 
amazing that's my ring I can touch my
finger<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.630> that<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:45.180> it

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
finger really you see like that and it

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.330 
finger really you see like that and it
dents<00:00:46.130> it's<00:00:47.130> a<00:00:47.310> rather<00:00:47.490> loop<00:00:47.790> no<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:49.070> think<00:00:50.070> it's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
dents it's a rather loop no I think it's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:05.780 
dents it's a rather loop no I think it's
me<00:00:50.720> it's<00:01:02.630> done<00:01:03.630> right<00:01:03.840> back<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.519> totally

hands is made out of magnets and plastic
is<00:01:12.900> made<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.290> metal<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.759> knew<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
is made out of metal and if I knew the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.970 
is made out of metal and if I knew the
magnet<00:01:15.510> here<00:01:15.870> they<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.860> uh<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:18.710> find<00:01:19.710> them

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the same tool and people don't tell me

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.400 
the same tool and people don't tell me
they're<00:02:44.489> even<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.880> clue<00:02:45.239> about<00:02:45.570> how<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.140> do

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
because when you create a miracle it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
because when you create a miracle it
just<00:02:51.330> seemed<00:02:51.510> like<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.500> the
