can select alpha now alpha sounds

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.370 
can select alpha now alpha sounds
dramatic<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.000> essentially<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:13.049> alpha

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
dramatic but essentially what alpha

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
dramatic but essentially what alpha
means<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.799> transparency<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.210> Alpha<00:01:15.630> Channel

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
means is transparency the Alpha Channel

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
means is transparency the Alpha Channel
of<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:18.060> document<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> let's<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:20.729> we're<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:20.939> 90

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
of the document so let's see we're on 90

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.850 
of the document so let's see we're on 90
percent<00:01:21.659> alpha<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> moment<00:01:22.470> I'll<00:01:22.650> slide

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
percent alpha at the moment I'll slide

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
percent alpha at the moment I'll slide
that<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:24.060> zero<00:01:24.299> percent<00:01:24.390> alpha<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.259> will

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that down to zero percent alpha it will

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.460 
that down to zero percent alpha it will
disappear<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> transparent

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
disappear so we now have a transparent

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
disappear so we now have a transparent
symbol<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:29.909> gonna<00:01:30.030> play<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> whole<00:01:30.360> thing

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
so you can see there yep cycles through

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.470 
so you can see there yep cycles through
the<00:02:33.260> colors<00:02:33.560> we<00:02:34.130> tend<00:02:34.400> easing<00:02:34.730> off<00:02:37.330> it'll<00:02:38.330> make

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
the colors we tend easing off it'll make

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.550 
the colors we tend easing off it'll make
that<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.959> more<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.319> smooth<00:02:39.560> transition

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
that a bit more of a smooth transition

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.520 
that a bit more of a smooth transition

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
you can combine alpha and tin effect if

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.070 
you can combine alpha and tin effect if
you<00:02:51.290> want<00:02:51.500> by<00:02:51.740> going<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.160> advanced<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:53.810> gives

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
you the amount of alpha and then your

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.080 
you the amount of alpha and then your
colors<00:03:00.200> as<00:03:00.770> well<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:02.510> can<00:03:02.600> see<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.050> Maureen
