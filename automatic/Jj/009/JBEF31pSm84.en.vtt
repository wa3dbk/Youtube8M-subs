00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
for you just to give you a sense of why

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.150

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.979 

right<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> first<00:00:32.520> question<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.780> long

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
right so the first question is how long

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.630 
right so the first question is how long
have<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.260> ever<00:00:34.440> walked<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.950> 40<00:00:35.250> pounds<00:00:35.399> of

water<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.200> honest<00:00:37.559> answer<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
water and the honest answer to that is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.729 
water and the honest answer to that is
I've<00:00:39.300> actually<00:00:39.600> never<00:00:39.870> walked<00:00:40.140> anywhere<00:00:40.500> with

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
I've actually never walked anywhere with

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.619 
I've actually never walked anywhere with
40<00:00:41.010> pounds<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.370> water<00:00:41.610> when<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> Kenya

pounds<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.320> water<00:00:46.969> that's<00:00:47.969> because<00:00:48.210> I'm<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pounds of water that's because I'm a
