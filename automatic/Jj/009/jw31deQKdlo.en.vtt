00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.190 

to<00:03:15.920> be<00:03:16.070> able<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.520> blend<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.540> music<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.140> the

to be able to blend the music and the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.600 
to be able to blend the music and the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
imagery together through the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.660

cinematography<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:21.070> really<00:03:22.070> fun<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.520> me

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
cinematography is really fun for me

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.400 
cinematography is really fun for me
because<00:03:22.880> that's<00:03:23.360> when<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:24.080> I<00:03:24.110> hear<00:03:24.380> music

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
because that's when I when I hear music

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.820 
because that's when I when I hear music
I'm<00:03:24.890> always<00:03:25.150> visualizing<00:03:26.150> some<00:03:26.420> sort<00:03:26.720> of

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
I'm always visualizing some sort of

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.220 
I'm always visualizing some sort of
imagery<00:03:27.830> whether<00:03:28.070> it's<00:03:28.310> color<00:03:28.610> or<00:03:28.970> mood<00:03:29.360> our

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
imagery whether it's color or mood our

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.620 
imagery whether it's color or mood our
wedding<00:03:30.650> video<00:03:30.880> when<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:31.910> got<00:03:32.210> married<00:03:32.360> was

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
wedding video when I got married was

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.720 
wedding video when I got married was
pretty<00:03:32.960> much<00:03:33.080> just<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.440> document<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.340> event

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
pretty much just a document of the event

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.310 
pretty much just a document of the event
and<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.180> think<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:35.630> that's<00:03:35.720> important<00:03:36.260> to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
and I think that that's important to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.080 
and I think that that's important to
have<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.770> think<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.100> need<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.310> cover<00:03:37.730> those

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
have I think you need to cover those

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.670 
have I think you need to cover those
things<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:38.690> think<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.960> need<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.170> see<00:03:39.410> if<00:03:39.560> it

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
things and I think you need to see if it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.260 
things and I think you need to see if it
you<00:03:39.770> need<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.040> see<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.610> guests<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.150> were

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
you need to see the guests that were

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.060 
you need to see the guests that were
there<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.690> those<00:03:41.870> kinds<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.260> things<00:03:42.440> it's

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070
