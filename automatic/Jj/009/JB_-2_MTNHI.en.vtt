00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Today I will explain how to join two 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.759
 threads of different diameter and prepare a 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.330
 rig well then for we have hung 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.460
 paraninfo also we will explain and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.679
 show how with a practical rings 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.389
 of silicone we're going to get carried away in 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.090
 our rod rigging perfectly 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.090
 ordered the process today is a very knot 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.190
 simple we take a piece of nylon 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.539
 and we are going to join our reel 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.150
 general 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.060
 then as we pretend that there is a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.439
 branch and the length to place our 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.099
 fly what we 're going to do is put 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.099
 parallels 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.360
 a length of 15 to 20 centimeters the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.850
 2011 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.590
 and what we do is simply a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.470
 subject with fingers so you do not 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.430
 undo the water 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.950
 at this time as 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 at 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 in fact we would give it four laps 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.330
 I open to put both fingers to catch 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.330
 the thread that I have left over from the other side 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 at this moment what we do is go 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.210
 closing little by little 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.090
 as you see we have united the two there is no 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.950
 long and we are left in position 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.270
 the long branch in which we are going to fix 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.270
 the fly to the nymph 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.170
 we 're going to be here a couple of nymphs 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.659
 I have the box prepared here 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.280
 or I also review the knot we use 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.280
 to join the nymphs 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.729
 we passed the thread 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.729
 simple 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.500
 subject with the fingers in the simple knot and 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.470
 What I do is go around 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.620
 of the nylon and put the tip 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.110
 by the gaza that has stayed me up 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.520
 in this way a very simple child 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.440
 inheritor 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.120
 and very resistant 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.120
 and by tying the non- metal fly 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.610
 and at the other end we would put another one 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.610
 fly 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.080
 once we mount this many times 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.180
 when we put it in the cane 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.890
 but here we are going around and in 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.710
 Sometimes we are read around 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.470
 the cane around nylon we have 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.030
 a solution practice 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.400
 the market there are these practices 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.710
 silicone rings that although they are 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.600
 invented or designed 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.850
 to hold this is invented to 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.020
 hold make alive can be to put 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.730
 the tail of a fish there and you release it 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.320
 to hold the dances for the tent and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.120
 all this but we have here another 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.900
 new application and what we have done has 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.900
 been placing it in 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.040
 I have shown myself here I have already mounted a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.140
 Rigging on the cane 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.230
 and what we have done has been when riding 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.060
 the cane spend this little girl 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.690
 the little girl as you see 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.810
 small which we hold the nymph 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.400
 and what it is is it moves along the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.090
 length then once we have the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.090
 made rig 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.319
 We take her to her place 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.000
 and it's as simple as when we go to 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.840
 go from one side of the river to another 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.840
 fix it here 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.580
 well we can do all the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.200
 movements that we want that in no 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.180
 time is going to rig the liar 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.430
 cane 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.500
 to get to the river is simply from 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.310
 silicone pulls back the hook 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.310
 and to fish
