00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
confused why I changed it but there's a

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.880 
confused why I changed it but there's a
couple<00:03:33.130> reasons<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:34.990> know<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.680> care

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
couple reasons so you know if you care

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.550 
couple reasons so you know if you care
you<00:03:36.070> can<00:03:36.250> hear<00:03:36.460> them<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:37.020> one<00:03:38.020> of<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.200> reasons

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
you can hear them and one of the reasons

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.470 
you can hear them and one of the reasons
is<00:03:38.770> that<00:03:39.750> okay<00:03:40.750> well<00:03:40.960> long<00:03:41.290> white<00:03:41.680> hair<00:03:41.709> is

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
is that okay well long white hair is

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.110 
is that okay well long white hair is
quite<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.690> feat<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.650> achieve<00:03:45.310> they<00:03:45.940> don't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
quite a feat to achieve they don't

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.220 
quite a feat to achieve they don't
really<00:03:46.360> mix<00:03:46.870> um<00:03:47.620> because<00:03:48.300> white<00:03:49.300> hair<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.959> a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
really mix um because white hair is a

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.510 
really mix um because white hair is a
very<00:03:50.700> dry<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.760> damaged<00:03:52.300> most<00:03:52.840> often<00:03:53.459> at<00:03:54.459> least

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
very dry and damaged most often at least

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.840 
very dry and damaged most often at least
if<00:03:54.880> you're<00:03:54.970> doing<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.300> at<00:03:55.420> home<00:03:55.660> like<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.020> was

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
if you're doing it at home like I was

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.940 
if you're doing it at home like I was
it's<00:03:57.850> almost<00:03:58.480> unavoidable<00:03:58.810> unless<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.709> have

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
it's almost unavoidable unless you have

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.100 
it's almost unavoidable unless you have
naturally<00:04:00.730> really<00:04:01.000> light<00:04:01.330> hair<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.990> begin

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
naturally really light hair to begin

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.110 
naturally really light hair to begin
with<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.590> don't<00:04:02.680> know<00:04:02.860> anyway<00:04:03.490> my<00:04:03.700> hair<00:04:03.940> was

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
with I don't know anyway my hair was

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.660 
with I don't know anyway my hair was
really<00:04:04.480> dry<00:04:04.690> really<00:04:04.990> damaged<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.400> growing

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
really dry really damaged and so growing

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.570 
really dry really damaged and so growing
that<00:04:06.940> long<00:04:07.180> would<00:04:07.510> have<00:04:07.720> been<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.769> just<00:04:09.459> would

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
that long would have been it just would

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.120 
that long would have been it just would
have<00:04:09.610> been<00:04:09.850> dead<00:04:10.510> looking<00:04:10.930> probably<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.830> just

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
have been dead looking probably and just

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.920 
have been dead looking probably and just
say<00:04:12.250> would<00:04:12.400> have<00:04:12.489> taken<00:04:12.700> ages<00:04:13.000> cuz<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:13.720> would

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
say would have taken ages cuz I would

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.800 
say would have taken ages cuz I would
just<00:04:14.650> cutting<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:15.250> don't<00:04:15.489> know<00:04:15.750> anyway<00:04:16.750> so

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
just cutting it I don't know anyway so

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.920 
just cutting it I don't know anyway so
that's<00:04:17.620> one<00:04:17.890> reason<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.549> then<00:04:19.090> another

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
that's one reason and then another

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.260 
that's one reason and then another
reason<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.830> I<00:04:21.519> think<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.910> was<00:04:22.030> more<00:04:22.210> like

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
reason is I think it was more like

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.790 
reason is I think it was more like
something<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.900> needed<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.200> get<00:04:23.410> out<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.680> my

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.540 
up with because it'll be easier for me
to<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:52.780> dye<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:53.169> myself<00:04:53.470> after<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.100> move<00:04:54.400> out

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
to just dye it myself after I move out

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.500 
to just dye it myself after I move out
and<00:04:55.120> stuff<00:04:55.660> so<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.290> plan<00:04:57.250> on<00:04:57.729> growing<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.300> out

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
and stuff so I plan on growing it out

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.140 
and stuff so I plan on growing it out
long<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.770> will<00:04:59.860> be<00:05:00.010> long<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.310> black<00:05:00.610> instead

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
long it will be long and black instead

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.719 
long it will be long and black instead
of<00:05:01.210> long<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.600> white<00:05:02.160> which<00:05:03.160> will<00:05:03.340> be<00:05:03.430> much

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
of long and white which will be much

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.900 
of long and white which will be much
easier<00:05:04.030> for<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.990> um<00:05:05.470> so<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.130> probably<00:05:06.400> won't<00:05:06.610> cut

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
easier for it um so I probably won't cut

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.990 
easier for it um so I probably won't cut
it<00:05:06.940> for<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.210> really<00:05:07.360> long<00:05:07.479> time<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:09.280> at<00:05:09.490> all<00:05:09.520> I

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
it for a really long time like at all I

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.810 
it for a really long time like at all I
don't<00:05:10.750> know<00:05:10.900> we'll<00:05:11.200> see<00:05:11.229> oh<00:05:11.530> by<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.370> way<00:05:12.490> I

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
don't know we'll see oh by the way I
