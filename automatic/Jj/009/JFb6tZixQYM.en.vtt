00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.090
 I have reviewed myself several times today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.310
 the set senate commando superstar 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.559
 It is from 6 to 12 years old 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.720
 suitable 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.390
 suitably the order has 7 5088 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:24.989
 in senate commented you pass costs 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.839
 16 euro 99 and contains four senats 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.630
 commando watch three normal senats 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:36.140
 weeks and a senate commando captain 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.079
 exactly the packaging is whole 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.309
 unspectacular just on the back 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.089
 are still only action 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.379
 pictures and always animated in the picture 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.019
 she 'll look quite right, though 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.050
 somehow then again unnecessary 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.219
 because the set is the only important thing 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.910
 exactly 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.550
 So do not let me look away 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 we also already to the figures so one 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.270
 sees the whole here 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.130
 normal senate command type looks quite 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 I do not recognize it now 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.660
 renovations to the old one but that has 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.070
 regulates not written if the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.520
 new ones are i have the old ones unfortunately 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.830
 no more 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.200
 In any case, this looks almost actually 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.860
 really good we have the times 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.060
 torso head made quite nice 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.520
 print that is probably new and 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 the back is also printed nicely 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.460
 again beautiful red devil and 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.980
 the head is very strained that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.900
 say we make a smile then we come 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.320
 even the captain is something 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.820
 different 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.270
 You can see that at the same time 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.440
 a slightly different weapon 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.550
 Lego has the title of the weapon 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.400
 just in the back this special attitude 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.380
 otherwise has the torso and 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.060
 the legs quite well I think 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.580
 helmet looks really good 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.890
 the torso also has its legs 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.200
 white stripes so a really good 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.520
 successful lego figure on the back 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.340
 the gate is like the other so 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.910
 no change just front but 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.780
 the figure is also really well done 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.620
 Here we have another one 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.140
 normal types and there is so much 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.160
 to the figures so alone because of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.500
 The characters will probably be 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.910
 many have to buy the set because many have 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.550
 already said yes now you can finally 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.530
 then build a nice carl sandburg with 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.540
 a lot of senates then do that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.630
 till now only in two sentences and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:56.730
 that is quite a bit but then 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:59.680
 Come now to this less good one 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.360
 protected in a battle pack as you like 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.410
 I have to say it's a battle pack 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.270
 that is very clear 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.650
 but you would have that protected too 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.820
 Of course, it could do a lot better here 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.550
 of course, is again the house the 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.730
 part or say the main are the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.800
 install just in this rotation conditionally 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.550
 I did not want to know why 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.760
 he did that 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.980
 Anyway, that's not so good now 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.600
 successful 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.040
 but what is still a general one 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.170
 This law is quite normal 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.110
 you have down four-legged the whole 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.580
 are held by this white 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.860
 base down there too, really important 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.780
 is and you can do all those legs 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.640
 Of course, once too high 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.670
 but then you have the very strong 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.090
 Problem that if you have a character of their 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.680
 wants to touch up or if you want this 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.870
 Rocket then wants to shoot down 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.340
 that the whole thing says down and 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.380
 At the end you will be back on the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.989
 Sock ends up as soon as you get there 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.850
 exerting any pressure supports the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.480
 You can figure again on the bottom of the pants 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.459
 So say so, as I said the money 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.160
 is less or less so 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.780
 specially developed otherwise we have 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.280
 no keyboard here anything else 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.280
 Everything is very simple 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.690
 the whole thing is like that said 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.530
 main function is precisely in that one 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.780
 this blaster 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.980
 We can make a shoot 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.170
 Now by putting the back 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.560
 simply turns and shoots the 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.630
 blaster just his six 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.450
 different blaster out and then is 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.030
 he is already empty again 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.930
 yes it is simple yet it matters, it is 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.870
 a brand new one 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.600
 i would definitely go for it 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.000
 because the figure is not really cool 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.980
 So I give a buy recommendation 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.680
 would say as a note against a two 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.790
 minus figures tip are shit 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.430
 So price is a solid 2 - me 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.080
 Hope the review pleased you and 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.080
 See you next time
