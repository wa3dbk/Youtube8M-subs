00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
actually a useful feature when you're

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.320 
actually a useful feature when you're
traveling<00:01:07.010> with<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:07.159> companion<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:07.940> they<00:01:08.090> have

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the galaxy note 3 or the galaxy s4 and I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.870 
the galaxy note 3 or the galaxy s4 and I
think<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.200> feature<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:12.979> update<00:01:13.370> is<00:01:13.400> coming

together<00:01:42.710> while<00:01:43.640> watching<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.090> different

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
together while watching a different

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.700 
together while watching a different
screen<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.810> i<00:01:44.960> think<00:01:45.170> that's<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.409> powerful

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
screen and i think that's a powerful

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.190 
screen and i think that's a powerful
thing<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:46.460> doing<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.299> that's<00:01:47.689> one<00:01:47.960> thing

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
thing to be doing so that's one thing

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.169 
thing to be doing so that's one thing
you<00:01:48.439> could<00:01:48.590> do<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:49.429> could<00:01:49.640> skip<00:01:49.880> two

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
you could do you could skip two

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.090 
you could do you could skip two
different<00:01:50.630> parts<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.929> video<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.590> it'll

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
different parts of the video and it'll

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.550 
different parts of the video and it'll
sync<00:01:52.429> up<00:01:52.609> and<00:01:52.880> there's<00:01:53.600> no<00:01:53.689> problems<00:01:54.380> when

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
sync up and there's no problems when

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.529 
sync up and there's no problems when
syncing<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.159> just<00:01:55.429> works<00:01:55.700> really<00:01:55.969> well<00:01:56.119> you

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
syncing it just works really well you

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.099 
syncing it just works really well you
can<00:01:56.929> actually<00:01:57.109> join<00:01:57.770> these<00:01:58.100> videos<00:01:58.549> together

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
can actually join these videos together

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.310 
can actually join these videos together
just<00:02:00.109> making<00:02:00.439> one<00:02:00.679> large<00:02:00.979> screen<00:02:01.490> here<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.320> i

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
just making one large screen here and i

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.349 
just making one large screen here and i
thought<00:02:03.619> this<00:02:03.679> wouldn't<00:02:04.369> work<00:02:04.490> with<00:02:05.240> the

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
thought this wouldn't work with the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.109 
thought this wouldn't work with the
galaxy<00:02:05.719> s4<00:02:06.109> too<00:02:06.320> well<00:02:06.499> because<00:02:06.740> you<00:02:07.700> know<00:02:07.820> this

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
galaxy s4 too well because you know this

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.580 
galaxy s4 too well because you know this
is<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> different<00:02:08.780> screen<00:02:09.020> size<00:02:09.289> but<00:02:09.560> it's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
is a different screen size but it's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.890 
is a different screen size but it's
doing<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.160> really<00:02:10.340> smart<00:02:10.819> i<00:02:11.030> tried<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.750> with

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
doing it really smart i tried it with

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.410 
doing it really smart i tried it with
two<00:02:12.230> no<00:02:12.680> threes<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.730> know<00:02:13.850> worked<00:02:14.150> well

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
two no threes and you know worked well

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.210 
two no threes and you know worked well
with<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.780> s4<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.410> thought<00:02:15.740> it<00:02:15.890> would<00:02:15.950> probably

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
with the s4 I thought it would probably

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.160 
with the s4 I thought it would probably
be<00:02:16.700> smaller<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.569> I<00:02:17.630> would<00:02:17.780> kind<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.110> just

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
be smaller here and I would kind of just

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.100 
be smaller here and I would kind of just
throw<00:02:18.620> off<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:18.980> whole<00:02:19.220> purpose<00:02:19.819> but<00:02:20.330> it

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
throw off this whole purpose but it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.840 
throw off this whole purpose but it
actually<00:02:21.320> does<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:21.860> really<00:02:21.980> smart<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:22.610> here's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
actually does it really smart now here's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.340 
actually does it really smart now here's
something<00:02:23.180> interesting<00:02:23.330> when<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.020> change

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
something interesting when you change

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.809 
something interesting when you change
the<00:02:24.560> volume<00:02:24.770> on

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
the volume on

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.229 
the volume on
Master<00:02:26.239> device<00:02:26.829> okay<00:02:27.829> you<00:02:27.890> could<00:02:28.099> control<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
Master device okay you could control the

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.239 
Master device okay you could control the
master<00:02:29.659> volume<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.409> could<00:02:30.560> control<00:02:30.769> the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:31.249 
master volume and you could control the

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.819 
master volume and you could control the
volume<00:02:31.430> on<00:02:31.939> the<00:02:32.389> other<00:02:32.569> device<00:02:33.019> as<00:02:33.230> well<00:02:33.260> now

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
volume on the other device as well now

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.530 
volume on the other device as well now
you<00:02:33.889> might<00:02:34.129> be<00:02:34.280> thinking<00:02:34.400> who<00:02:34.909> really<00:02:35.299> wants

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
you might be thinking who really wants

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.089 
you might be thinking who really wants
to<00:02:35.629> do<00:02:35.749> this<00:02:35.780> maybe<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.499> just<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.859> cool

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
to do this maybe it's just a cool

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.149 
to do this maybe it's just a cool
feature<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.700> show<00:02:37.999> people<00:02:38.510> but<00:02:39.290> just<00:02:39.709> watching

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
feature to show people but just watching

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.250 
feature to show people but just watching
this<00:02:40.310> together<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.299> think<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.900> could<00:02:42.079> actually

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
this together I think you could actually

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.009 
this together I think you could actually
have<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> pleasant<00:02:43.069> experience<00:02:43.689> watching<00:02:44.689> a

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
have a pleasant experience watching a

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.690 
have a pleasant experience watching a
video<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.409> a<00:02:45.500> slightly<00:02:45.859> larger<00:02:46.189> screen<00:02:46.670> than

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
video on a slightly larger screen than

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.229 
video on a slightly larger screen than
your<00:02:46.969> smartphone<00:02:47.980> imagine<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.760> had<00:02:49.939> three

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
your smartphone imagine you had three

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.059 
your smartphone imagine you had three
phones<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.810> could<00:02:50.989> definitely<00:02:51.200> take<00:02:51.680> up<00:02:51.889> most

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
phones you could definitely take up most

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.789 
phones you could definitely take up most
of<00:02:52.310> real<00:02:52.579> estate<00:02:52.760> on<00:02:52.969> three<00:02:53.389> phones<00:02:53.689> so<00:02:54.530> let's

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
of real estate on three phones so let's

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.339 
of real estate on three phones so let's
try<00:02:55.579> share<00:02:55.909> music<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.540> time<00:02:56.599> I'm<00:02:56.959> going<00:02:57.200> to

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
try share music this time I'm going to

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.300 
try share music this time I'm going to
share<00:02:57.499> on<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.950> galaxy<00:02:58.340> s4<00:02:58.879> and<00:03:00.129> I'm<00:03:01.129> just

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
share on the galaxy s4 and I'm just

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.059 
share on the galaxy s4 and I'm just
going<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.669> choose<00:03:02.480> one<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.780> these<00:03:03.169> files<00:03:03.650> here

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
going to choose one of these files here

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.429 
going to choose one of these files here
okay<00:03:04.489> you<00:03:04.549> could<00:03:04.669> see<00:03:04.879> i<00:03:05.120> could<00:03:05.689> join<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.260> here

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
okay you could see i could join it here

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.189 
okay you could see i could join it here
and<00:03:06.730> getting<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.939> weird<00:03:08.150> pop-up<00:03:08.629> saying<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.169> I

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:09.199 
and getting a weird pop-up saying that I

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.409 
and getting a weird pop-up saying that I
could<00:03:09.349> use<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.829> NFC<00:03:10.639> features<00:03:11.090> on<00:03:11.269> these

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
could use the NFC features on these

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:16.030 
could use the NFC features on these
devices<00:03:11.659> to<00:03:12.349> position<00:03:12.889> the<00:03:13.040> speakers

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.190 

so<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.150> something<00:03:17.480> interesting<00:03:17.930> there's<00:03:18.140> a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
so this something interesting there's a

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.580 
so this something interesting there's a
play<00:03:18.500> button<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.480> Settings<00:03:20.480> button<00:03:20.689> okay

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
play button and a Settings button okay

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.619 
play button and a Settings button okay
so<00:03:21.650> instead<00:03:22.099> of<00:03:22.159> using<00:03:22.400> NFC<00:03:22.790> could<00:03:23.209> use<00:03:23.420> this

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
so instead of using NFC could use this

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.309 
so instead of using NFC could use this
to<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:24.730> choose<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.790> device<00:03:26.329> that<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:27.019> want

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
to just choose the device that you want

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.080 
to just choose the device that you want
a<00:03:27.379> place<00:03:27.620> in<00:03:27.950> different<00:03:28.340> locations<00:03:28.609> for

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
a place in different locations for

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.149 
a place in different locations for
surround<00:03:29.450> sound<00:03:29.810> when<00:03:30.319> i<00:03:30.349> get<00:03:30.590> my<00:03:30.620> guts<00:03:30.980> you

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
surround sound when i get my guts you

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.949 
surround sound when i get my guts you
know<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.519> updated<00:03:31.969> maybe<00:03:32.150> i'll<00:03:32.329> try<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.599> see<00:03:32.840> if

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
know to updated maybe i'll try to see if

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.839 
know to updated maybe i'll try to see if
i'm<00:03:33.140> really<00:03:33.620> getting<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:34.069> surround<00:03:34.489> sound

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
i'm really getting that surround sound

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:41.320 
i'm really getting that surround sound
let's<00:03:35.659> try<00:03:35.840> share<00:03:36.200> pictures

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:56.980 

I<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:51.560> flip<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.700> next<00:03:52.790> picture<00:03:53.270> on<00:03:55.990> the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
I can flip to the next picture on the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:04.150 
I can flip to the next picture on the
other<00:03:57.200> device<00:03:57.650> what<00:03:58.490> is<00:03:58.610> this<00:04:02.890> some<00:04:03.890> kind<00:04:04.100> of

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.869 
here so I believe you have to have it
installed<00:04:37.550> on<00:04:37.909> both<00:04:38.210> devices<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.580> anyway

installed on both devices so anyway

installed on both devices so anyway
that's<00:04:40.999> a<00:04:41.120> quick<00:04:41.330> look<00:04:41.539> at<00:04:41.689> the<00:04:41.719> group<00:04:42.139> play

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409

that's a quick look at the group play
feature<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:43.360> definitely<00:04:44.360> think<00:04:44.719> the<00:04:44.900> share

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
feature I definitely think the share

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.309 
feature I definitely think the share
video<00:04:45.710> is<00:04:46.039> a<00:04:46.099> great<00:04:46.819> feature<00:04:47.090> can't<00:04:47.960> use<00:04:48.139> it

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
video is a great feature can't use it

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.260 
video is a great feature can't use it
all<00:04:48.469> the<00:04:48.499> time<00:04:48.650> but<00:04:49.009> maybe<00:04:49.189> once<00:04:49.699> in<00:04:49.939> a<00:04:50.060> while

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
all the time but maybe once in a while

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.029 
all the time but maybe once in a while
when<00:04:50.719> you're<00:04:50.930> traveling<00:04:51.529> with<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.680> friend

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
when you're traveling with a friend

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.040 
when you're traveling with a friend
it'll<00:04:52.249> be<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.610> really<00:04:53.210> great<00:04:53.330> feature<00:04:53.629> to<00:04:53.779> have

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
it'll be a really great feature to have

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.529 
it'll be a really great feature to have
as<00:04:54.349> for<00:04:55.219> other<00:04:55.340> features<00:04:55.849> i<00:04:56.029> think<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.330> glade

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
as for other features i think the glade

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.209 
as for other features i think the glade
games<00:04:56.749> and<00:04:56.990> more<00:04:57.169> seems<00:04:57.650> like<00:04:57.830> there's<00:04:58.039> not

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219

games and more seems like there's not
any<00:04:58.490> apps<00:04:58.759> that<00:04:59.060> i<00:04:59.150> could<00:04:59.330> use<00:04:59.479> that<00:04:59.689> with

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
all the internet websites saying that

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.749 
all the internet websites saying that
it's<00:05:14.629> coming<00:05:14.900> sometime<00:05:15.259> in<00:05:15.620> November<00:05:16.159> that

it's coming sometime in November that

it's coming sometime in November that
might<00:05:17.060> be<00:05:17.270> true<00:05:17.629> for<00:05:18.080> some<00:05:18.500> carriers<00:05:19.009> that

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
might be true for some carriers that

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.279 
might be true for some carriers that
push<00:05:19.580> out<00:05:19.759> updates<00:05:19.969> early<00:05:20.659> especially<00:05:20.930> the

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
push out updates early especially the

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.309 
push out updates early especially the
ones<00:05:21.469> in<00:05:21.620> Korea<00:05:22.240> if<00:05:23.240> you're<00:05:23.509> in<00:05:23.629> the<00:05:23.749> US<00:05:24.110> it

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
ones in Korea if you're in the US it

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.809 
ones in Korea if you're in the US it
takes<00:05:24.589> a<00:05:24.680> little<00:05:24.889> bit<00:05:25.069> longer<00:05:25.249> than<00:05:25.610> that<00:05:25.759> I

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
takes a little bit longer than that I

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.089 
takes a little bit longer than that I
think<00:05:25.939> they<00:05:26.240> tend<00:05:26.659> to<00:05:26.749> get<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.259> same<00:05:27.710> build

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
think they tend to get that same build

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.159 
think they tend to get that same build
that<00:05:28.460> Samsung<00:05:28.999> gives<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.509> all<00:05:29.629> the<00:05:29.750> carriers

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
that Samsung gives to all the carriers

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.140 
that Samsung gives to all the carriers
and<00:05:30.500> some<00:05:30.889> carriers<00:05:31.310> take<00:05:31.639> a<00:05:31.669> little<00:05:31.909> longer

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
and some carriers take a little longer

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.390 
and some carriers take a little longer
than<00:05:32.479> others<00:05:32.810> to<00:05:32.839> add<00:05:33.439> their<00:05:33.680> apps<00:05:33.889> to<00:05:34.129> it<00:05:34.279> and
