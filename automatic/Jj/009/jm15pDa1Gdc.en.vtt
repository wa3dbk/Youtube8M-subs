pictures of these things put your eyes
and<00:01:07.330> more<00:01:08.330> specifically<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.440> back<00:01:09.680> of<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
and more specifically in the back of the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.680 
and more specifically in the back of the
eye<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.580> part<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.150> eye<00:01:11.180> called<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
eye is a part of the eye called the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.980 
eye is a part of the eye called the
retina<00:01:12.170> which<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.340> kind<00:01:13.550> of<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.760> film<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.900> a

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
retina which is kind of like film in a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.380 
retina which is kind of like film in a
camera<00:01:15.440> or<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.460> chip<00:01:16.940> in<00:01:17.090> one<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.240> these

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
camera or the chip in one of these

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.270 
camera or the chip in one of these
cameras<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:17.990> records<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.500> images<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.040> sends

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
cameras it records the images and sends

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.710 
cameras it records the images and sends
them<00:01:19.340> on<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.580> your<00:01:19.700> brain<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:21.970> yeah<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.570> that's

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
them on to your brain and yeah so that's

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.660 
them on to your brain and yeah so that's
what<00:01:23.930> i<00:01:23.960> do<00:01:24.050> i<00:01:24.200> take<00:01:24.590> photographs<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.340> people's

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
equipment that we use this is the actual

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.859 
equipment that we use this is the actual
camera<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.119> use<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.360> take<00:01:44.539> photographs

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
camera that we use to take photographs

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.870 
camera that we use to take photographs
inside<00:01:45.649> of<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.830> ice<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.190> called<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.430> fundus

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
inside of the ice is called a fundus

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.460 
inside of the ice is called a fundus
camera<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.190> patient's<00:01:49.610> heads<00:01:49.819> up<00:01:50.060> here

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
camera so the patient's heads up here

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.559 
camera so the patient's heads up here
your<00:01:51.470> eyes<00:01:51.590> here<00:01:52.160> I'm<00:01:53.000> looking<00:01:53.360> for<00:01:53.509> the

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
your eyes here I'm looking for the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.859 
your eyes here I'm looking for the
microscope<00:01:54.140> here<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:55.720> take<00:01:56.720> some

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
microscope here and take some

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.520 
microscope here and take some
photographs<00:01:57.759> such<00:01:58.759> as<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.209> I<00:01:59.569> want<00:02:00.349> to<00:02:00.380> show

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
photographs such as that I want to show

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.109 
photographs such as that I want to show
any<00:02:00.679> patient<00:02:01.130> names<00:02:01.340> for<00:02:01.670> confidentiality

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
any patient names for confidentiality

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.580 
any patient names for confidentiality
reasons

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.160 

so<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.740> setup<00:02:07.509> we<00:02:08.509> can<00:02:08.660> do<00:02:08.780> what<00:02:08.929> we<00:02:08.960> call

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
so this setup we can do what we call

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.600 
so this setup we can do what we call
angiography<00:02:10.000> while<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.180> lights<00:02:11.360> changing

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
angiography while the lights changing

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.370 
angiography while the lights changing
and<00:02:13.610> geography<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.360> back<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.840> eye<00:02:14.870> so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
and geography of the back of the eye so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.770 
and geography of the back of the eye so
we<00:02:15.500> inject<00:02:15.920> some<00:02:16.240> drug<00:02:17.240> called<00:02:17.480> sodium

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
we inject some drug called sodium

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.840 
we inject some drug called sodium
fluorescein<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.650> two<00:02:18.740> patients<00:02:18.920> arms<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.760> it

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
fluorescein in two patients arms and it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.910 
fluorescein in two patients arms and it
travels<00:02:20.590> up<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.650> arm<00:02:23.350> across<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> heart

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
travels up the arm across to the heart

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.440 
travels up the arm across to the heart
through<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.280> lungs<00:02:25.520> up<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.360> eyes<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:29.270> we

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
through the lungs up to the eyes and we

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.180 
through the lungs up to the eyes and we
take<00:02:29.600> photographs<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:31.150> okay<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:33.190> microscope

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
take photographs of okay this microscope

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.530 
take photographs of okay this microscope
here<00:02:34.459> with<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.610> couple<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.910> camera<00:02:35.270> bodies

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
here with a couple of camera bodies

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.870 
here with a couple of camera bodies
attached<00:02:35.920> we<00:02:36.920> used<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.130> photograph<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.610> front

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
attached we used to photograph the front

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.120 
attached we used to photograph the front
of<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> eye<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.709> cornea<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.370> iris<00:02:42.130> anterior

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
of the eye the cornea the iris anterior

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.770 
of the eye the cornea the iris anterior
chamber<00:02:44.680> all<00:02:45.680> sorts<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:45.980> stuff<00:02:46.040> like<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.780> so

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
chamber all sorts of stuff like that so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.960
