00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.830
 Watch this match live in the middle 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.360
 European 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 will begin on our average Russian 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.580
 Moscow time if there is no good 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.650
 you evening about what I understand that considerable 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.410
 part of today's television audience 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.710
 these are the people who are closer 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 there is quite a western Siberian city there 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.300
 which is a football club 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 the volume that takes in this central 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.030
 match of the eighth round of football 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 national league 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.219
 the leader of this revision and the gasman from 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
 orenburg and no sleeve i think thats 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.590
 crowded to the eye because the audience 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.690
 goes and goes and look even the long way 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.329
 illusion pictures of the tribune crammed 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.149
 searches are almost completely clogged up 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.579
 Well, really play teams that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.739
 in our mind must either go out 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 either fight to the last for a ticket 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.870
 premier league and interesting to see what 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.280
 they are today true chela indentation 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.140
 left brow tried to create something and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.510
 flank squad players first 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.580
 Division well there is pogrebnyak pissing 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.409
 which is at the other central podium 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.040
 a new amount of experience dragged football 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.760
 matches can be that she always 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.500
 with the maximum sky in the far strike 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.110
 enjoy happening no one 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:26.230
 I hit a lot of decent hit by 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.990
 7 minutes 00 end of the first half that 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.630
 gasman free kick beat Orenburg 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.700
 It is interesting to allow the gift a little higher without and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.350
 teams played nicely nothing 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.600
 will say the backswing caught 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.070
 again the angular performance of the eighth number 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.990
 just do not serve the ball pitch 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.759
 you fill up well they were formidable 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.850
 rummaged through the arms of the singers 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.850
 could tip the scales 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.390
 Pogrebnyak already left a lot of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 what a sighted translation across the field is still 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.280
 more beautiful vodka temnikova gift 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.310
 Kolomeets now pulls out the goalkeeper 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.989
 after really cool 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.569
 sweeping from see here still 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.209
 began to fall before daws grams fell 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.690
 from the path that scored flies off 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.690
 at school 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.150
 long-range strike is another tough and sheep 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 she flank shifted to center and shot 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.510
 and now it's thirty-five meters 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.510
 at least two root 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.150
 Chess for the bit on my no lost 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.400
 by players individually 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.890
 some separate things can create 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.870
 what will affect a gift from a match 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.950
 temnik in my for the sixth time in 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.080
 this match is trying to wheel 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.250
 blow us mast candlelight 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.220
 makes the picture absolutely visible 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.450
 sent his old mouth it would 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.450
 a bit more dangerous 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.540
 and but through the right edge even with 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.780
 the fact that there is no Bazhenov there for a long time 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.599
 attacks tons you can serve feed 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.560
 convenient finishing off and still was the eighth 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.560
 number of blacksmiths 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.230
 takeaway 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.050
 and all the final whistle tommy with a victory 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.660
 Western Siberia teams beat gasman 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.630
 why are you my most important warm match 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.590
 eighth round and share with him 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.360
 Now the first line in the tournament 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.630
 the table with you was a nickname 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.630
 fool
