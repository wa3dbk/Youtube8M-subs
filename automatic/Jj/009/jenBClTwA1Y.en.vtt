00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:56.000 

city

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.460 

and<00:01:57.120> so<00:01:58.120> you<00:01:58.180> can<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:59.020> do<00:01:59.140> that<00:02:01.320> or<00:02:02.320> you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
and so you can you can do that or you

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.430 
and so you can you can do that or you
could<00:02:02.620> do<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:05.400> or<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:06.790> can<00:02:07.060> in<00:02:08.050> certain

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
could do this or you can in certain

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.000 
could do this or you can in certain
circumstances<00:02:08.770> just<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.520> whole<00:02:09.700> each<00:02:10.090> ought

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.490 

so<00:02:15.010> that's<00:02:15.220> kind<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:16.090> know<00:02:16.290> from<00:02:17.290> fall

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
so that's kind of you know from fall

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.010 
so that's kind of you know from fall
until<00:02:17.710> life<00:02:17.920> specifically<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.940> starting<00:02:19.870> the
