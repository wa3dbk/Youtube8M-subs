just included in the system like with
the<00:02:44.040> ps3<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.880> honestly<00:02:45.560> think<00:02:46.560> made<00:02:46.890> all<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
the ps3 I honestly think made all the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.130 
the ps3 I honestly think made all the
difference<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:48.060> course<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.660> also<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:49.110> that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
difference of course we also know that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.290
