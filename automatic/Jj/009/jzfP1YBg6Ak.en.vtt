00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello, I was recently asked this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.550
 question how to make tomatoes sweeter in this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.830
 video I will try to answer you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
 firstly if you want to get 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 really sweet tomatoes then you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.449
 it is necessary to choose the right grade for 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.580
 growing immediately say that the hybrids 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.490
 for this is not suitable because 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 taste and sugar content they 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.029
 significantly inferior 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.189
 varietal tomato but from tomato varieties 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.829
 most sugary are first 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.860
 queue large sweet fruits they have 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 very poor keeping quality and used 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.390
 as a rule, only fresh them are not 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.250
 promise not canned but they taste 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.170
 excellent 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.940
 of these varieties I most 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 like honey pink honey 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 this is the sweetest of all varieties 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 which I grew also to taste 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 tomatoes 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 affect and feeding I feed though 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.729
 2-3 times over the summer woody tomatoes 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.390
 ash 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.390
 if that is contained in the ashes 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.409
 speeds up the filling of fruits and improves them 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 taste improves sugar content 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.630
 tomatoes on how to do this 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.020
 feeding you can see in the video 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.400
 following the link 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 Well, I would like to note that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.729
 nitrogenous fertilizers are not suitable for 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.299
 fertilizing tomatoes during fruiting 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.720
 as they affect 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.549
 accelerate the growth of the tops and in addition 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.860
 promotes accumulation in tomatoes 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.409
 large amounts of nitrates especially 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 if tomatoes grow in your shaded 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 the place well and finally the third factor which 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.600
 affects the garden 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 flipping the motives is sunshine 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.659
 therefore it is very important to grow tomatoes on 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.239
 well lit places 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.420
 for sure you all know what greenhouses 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.150
 tomatoes by taste especially by 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.400
 sugar content is much lower 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.650
 tomato grown in the open 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.920
 ground because in the greenhouse through 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.390
 covering material gets only 85 from 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.810
 strength 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.209
 95 percent sunshine on this 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.260
