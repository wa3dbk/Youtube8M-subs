there's<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.809> pinch<00:00:39.110> that's<00:00:39.949> where<00:00:40.250> we'll<00:00:40.400> be

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
there's a pinch that's where we'll be

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.460 
there's a pinch that's where we'll be
using<00:00:40.909> a<00:00:41.000> tap<00:00:41.239> down<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.780> release<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.290> pressure

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
using a tap down to release the pressure

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.180 
using a tap down to release the pressure
on<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.699> outside<00:00:44.180> if<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.750> look<00:00:44.900> closely<00:00:45.199> there

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
on the outside if you look closely there

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.549 
on the outside if you look closely there
are<00:00:46.220> crowns<00:00:46.699> and<00:00:47.030> crowns<00:00:48.019> are<00:00:48.260> slightly

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
are crowns and crowns are slightly

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.369 
are crowns and crowns are slightly
skinny<00:00:49.220> lines<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.940> outside<00:00:50.629> edges<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:51.260> the

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
skinny lines on the outside edges of the

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.700 
skinny lines on the outside edges of the
dent<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.800> slightly<00:00:52.370> raise<00:00:52.550> up<00:00:53.290> now<00:00:54.290> why<00:00:54.500> that

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
dent that slightly raise up now why that

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.859 
dent that slightly raise up now why that
happens<00:00:55.309> is<00:00:55.430> because<00:00:55.489> when<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.390> metal<00:00:56.570> gets

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:56.869 
happens is because when the metal gets

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.710 
happens is because when the metal gets
hit<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.409> has<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.280> move<00:00:58.460> somewhere<00:00:58.909> the<00:00:59.360> force

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
hit it has to move somewhere the force

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.500 
hit it has to move somewhere the force
of<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.080> energy<00:01:00.589> goes<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.369> the<00:01:01.670> outside<00:01:02.210> and

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
of the energy goes to the outside and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.869 
of the energy goes to the outside and
buckles<00:01:03.019> up<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.949> that's<00:01:04.100> why<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.460> call<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:04.790> a

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
buckles up so that's why we call it a

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.630 
buckles up so that's why we call it a
crown<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:06.080> very<00:01:06.530> important<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.100> recognize

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
crown it's very important you recognize

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.210 
crown it's very important you recognize
that<00:01:07.689> because<00:01:08.689> if<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.930> never<00:01:09.200> tap<00:01:09.650> those<00:01:09.890> down

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
that because if you never tap those down

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.490 
that because if you never tap those down
you<00:01:10.700> always<00:01:11.180> see<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> slight<00:01:11.750> wave<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.380> you'll

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
you always see a slight wave and you'll

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.469 
you always see a slight wave and you'll
be<00:01:12.619> wondering<00:01:12.979> why<00:01:13.189> you<00:01:13.250> can't<00:01:13.850> get<00:01:14.060> rid<00:01:14.240> of<00:01:14.270> it

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
be wondering why you can't get rid of it

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.410 
be wondering why you can't get rid of it
so<00:01:15.200> you've<00:01:15.380> got<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.860> look<00:01:16.009> outside<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:17.150> make

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
so you've got to look outside to make

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.770 
so you've got to look outside to make
sure<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.320> get<00:01:18.500> those<00:01:18.740> crowns<00:01:19.070> down<00:01:19.630> now<00:01:20.630> I'm

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
sure you get those crowns down now I'm

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.450 
sure you get those crowns down now I'm
not<00:01:20.930> going<00:01:21.079> to<00:01:21.140> tap<00:01:21.380> down<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.710> crowns<00:01:21.950> as<00:01:22.189> of

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
not going to tap down the crowns as of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.920 
not going to tap down the crowns as of
yet<00:01:22.729> I'm<00:01:23.030> actually<00:01:23.299> going<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.600> take<00:01:23.780> some

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
yet I'm actually going to take some

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.680 
yet I'm actually going to take some
pressure<00:01:24.170> off<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.920> crown<00:01:25.190> first<00:01:26.060> I'm<00:01:26.540> going

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
pressure off the crown first I'm going

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.120 
pressure off the crown first I'm going
to<00:01:26.780> start<00:01:26.990> tapping<00:01:27.140> down<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:27.860> we're<00:01:27.980> going

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
to start tapping down then we're going

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.830 
to start tapping down then we're going
to<00:01:28.159> push<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.790> then<00:01:28.850> we'll<00:01:29.180> get<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.570> crowns

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
to push and then we'll get to the crowns

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.730 
to push and then we'll get to the crowns
later<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:31.300> now<00:01:32.300> as<00:01:32.480> for<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.840> tapping<00:01:33.230> down<00:01:33.409> I

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
later on now as for the tapping down I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.770 
later on now as for the tapping down I
prefer<00:01:34.370> to<00:01:34.520> start<00:01:34.730> with<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.000> tap<00:01:35.210> down<00:01:35.510> with<00:01:35.750> a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
prefer to start with the tap down with a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.950 
prefer to start with the tap down with a
softer<00:01:36.350> tip<00:01:36.560> like<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:38.180> tool<00:01:38.479> tip<00:01:38.690> allows

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
softer tip like so this tool tip allows

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.020 
softer tip like so this tool tip allows
me<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.290> tap<00:01:39.500> down<00:01:39.740> without<00:01:39.950> causing<00:01:40.520> mini<00:01:40.700> lows

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
me to tap down without causing mini lows

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.600 
me to tap down without causing mini lows
if<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:42.170> do<00:01:42.229> make<00:01:42.620> a<00:01:42.650> low<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.130> easier<00:01:43.460> to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
if I do make a low it's easier to

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.460 
if I do make a low it's easier to
correct<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.270> push<00:01:44.450> out<00:01:44.659> rather<00:01:44.930> than<00:01:45.080> if<00:01:45.350> I

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
correct and push out rather than if I

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.980 
correct and push out rather than if I
use<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.890> sharper<00:01:46.400> tap<00:01:46.610> down<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.120> created<00:01:47.810> small

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
use a sharper tap down and created small

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.890 
use a sharper tap down and created small
micro<00:01:48.620> lows<00:01:48.940> now<00:01:49.940> don't<00:01:50.120> get<00:01:50.210> discouraged<00:01:50.420> if

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
micro lows now don't get discouraged if

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.390 
micro lows now don't get discouraged if
you<00:01:51.049> can't<00:01:51.080> remove<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.680> pinch<00:01:51.920> all<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.250> way

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
you can't remove the pinch all the way

your objective is to help relieve
pressure<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.460> little<00:01:55.760> at<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> time<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.420> work

another part like the low it's a give
and<00:01:59.540> take<00:01:59.690> technique<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:01.280> helps
