00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.339
 aubin at sea but very happy to be able to achieve 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.339
 this transfer is a boy we follow since 2008 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.329
 percent thanks to a friend% and club who will be looking for pau who lived at this 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.589
 moment in the usa 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.769
 and who had asked us to see his players in this game of 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:21.800
 power 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.720
 and then we had not managed to transfer it from the rhÃ´ne to the price that 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.259
 their performance ask us 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.779
 and then we will continue to follow him to mano with the company here - from the term of 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.050
 his contract and 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.940
 we managed to finalize the deal make them very happy to have it here 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.420
 of a sense employer and it's someone who has 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.190
 khartoum have so it's someone running for minute who is present 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.069
 for 100 th 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.249
 as well in the small games as in the moors in the big matches 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.600
 and especially this American mentality 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 of extremism that we liked a lot and percent and I think it's 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.030
 also percent 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.460
 someone who will be an example at the level of professionalism with young people 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.309
 including a moment for ios 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.930
 rothstein bearing that the players being transferred and who are a little bit more 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 age 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.070
 as it happens to 25 years old is still young we have a lot of very good 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.829
 young players 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.039
 to have players who are an example not just in the field but also 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.140
 off the field 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.110
 apart from the sporting and academic aspect to marketing also the fact of 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.630
 suffer like that in an American market having played American 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.820
 it's a good operation 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.190
 yes I believe that 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.420
 in ec clear that a buyer by this transfer 6% will be known also by the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.549
 mls is everywhere in europe by american football 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.400
 there I think he was so also 24 times international is a little disappointed 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.000
 happy not to have been taken over by the coach for the world cup 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.130
 that was the reason 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.180
 % and I believe that staying too long in the US championship 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.370
 Party 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.290
 the coach has instead chosen players who already play gold europe 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.700
 so he obviously hopes 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.860
 find all its qualities here eneurope p I think maybe but 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.909
 surely afterwards we can do some business maybe 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.600
 interesting with the usa 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.590
 the core already well provided the ground what does it mean that to many 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.390
 departures looming 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.940
 the investigators were busy with some records 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.779
 I will not say the same name 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.669
 it's clear that if we transferred percent and that the sectarian extreme 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.259
 there are others who for them who can leave 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.059
 one represents oneself or property 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.970
 no they are holders 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.980
 I believe there are other kiss kiss players to buy eventually they have returned 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.059
 here the rule holder next year 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 and for which we try to find solutions 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:35.739
 here is the decor
