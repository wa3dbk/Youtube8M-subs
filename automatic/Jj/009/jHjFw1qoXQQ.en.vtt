crossed I will be soon I didn't think

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.699 
crossed I will be soon I didn't think
I'd<00:03:13.450> ever<00:03:13.510> get<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.840> many<00:03:14.020> subs<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.410> start<00:03:14.620> off

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
I'd ever get this many subs to start off

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.400 
I'd ever get this many subs to start off
with<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.340> it's<00:03:16.330> sadly<00:03:16.780> not<00:03:16.990> growing<00:03:17.230> as<00:03:17.380> fast

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
with but it's sadly not growing as fast

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.770 
with but it's sadly not growing as fast
as<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.769> would<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.690> even<00:03:19.690> though<00:03:19.750> i

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
as I would like it to even though i

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.449 
as I would like it to even though i
think<00:03:19.870> if<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> content<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.800> pretty<00:03:21.070> decent

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
think if the content is pretty decent

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.430 
think if the content is pretty decent
but<00:03:21.720> obviously<00:03:22.720> there's<00:03:23.080> about<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.260> gazillion

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
but obviously there's about a gazillion

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.820 
but obviously there's about a gazillion
people<00:03:23.980> now<00:03:24.940> making<00:03:25.420> YouTube<00:03:25.750> videos<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.500> I
