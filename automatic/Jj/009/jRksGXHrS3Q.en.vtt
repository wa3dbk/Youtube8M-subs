00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
the ingredients are well combined you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.589 
the ingredients are well combined you
want<00:02:53.500> your<00:02:53.799> prawn<00:02:54.069> paste<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> nice

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
want your prawn paste to have a nice

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.960 
want your prawn paste to have a nice
gooey<00:02:56.049> texture<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.040> that's<00:02:57.639> a<00:02:57.819> very

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
gooey texture and that's a very

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.409 
gooey texture and that's a very
interesting<00:02:58.269> technique<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.379> get<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.829> is<00:03:00.099> to

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
interesting technique to get that is to

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.110 
interesting technique to get that is to
troll<00:03:01.419> the<00:03:01.750> paste<00:03:02.470> into<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:03.129> bowl<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.730> keeps

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
troll the paste into the bowl and keeps

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.979 
troll the paste into the bowl and keeps
doing<00:03:04.480> that

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
doing that

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.830 
doing that
this<00:03:05.709> helps<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.220> paste<00:03:06.489> becomes<00:03:07.120> more<00:03:07.389> sticky

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
this helps the paste becomes more sticky

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.050 
this helps the paste becomes more sticky
and<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.260> will<00:03:08.469> stick<00:03:08.709> better<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.189> the<00:03:09.549> sugar

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
and it will stick better to the sugar

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.709 
and it will stick better to the sugar
cane<00:03:11.430> after<00:03:12.430> doing<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.849> step<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.510> should

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
cane after doing this step you should

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.050 
cane after doing this step you should
use<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.169> space<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.560> form<00:03:15.189> around<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.790> sugar

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
use the space to form around the sugar

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.110 
use the space to form around the sugar
cane<00:03:16.239> sticks<00:03:16.599> right<00:03:16.810> away<00:03:17.169> otherwise<00:03:18.120> it's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
cane sticks right away otherwise it's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.679
