deep<00:01:50.520> peril<00:01:59.009> and<00:02:00.570> maybe<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.960> cornet<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:10.479> the

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
deep peril and maybe a cornet on the

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.280 
deep peril and maybe a cornet on the
grade<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:12.760> store<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.239> as<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.900> second

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
grade and we store this as the second

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.550 
grade and we store this as the second
then<00:02:17.290> disable<00:02:17.770> set<00:02:18.570> try<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.630> change<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.440> the

then disable set try to change to the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.670 
then disable set try to change to the
first<00:02:20.830> combination<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.840> nothing<00:02:23.260> happens

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
first combination but nothing happens

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.090 
first combination but nothing happens
and<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:25.660> because<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.590> sample<00:02:26.980> set

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
and this is because the sample set

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.410 
and this is because the sample set
creator<00:02:27.489> has<00:02:28.090> opted<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.690> not<00:02:28.840> store<00:02:29.380> invisible

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
creator has opted to not store invisible

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.800 
creator has opted to not store invisible
elements<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.769> combinations<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:34.480> as<00:02:34.780> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
elements in the combinations but as a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.850 
elements in the combinations but as a
user<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.890> override<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.870> by<00:02:37.870> selecting

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
user you can override this by selecting

event and hit some key but it would be

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.830 
event and hit some key but it would be
meaningless<00:03:52.040> unless<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.909> had<00:03:53.060> some<00:03:53.359> way<00:03:53.569> to

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
meaningless unless you had some way to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.569 
meaningless unless you had some way to
differentiate<00:03:54.650> between<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:56.480> manuals<00:03:56.930> and

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
differentiate between the manuals and

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.059 
differentiate between the manuals and
this<00:03:58.579> we<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.030> do<00:03:59.590> by<00:04:00.590> using<00:04:01.519> velocity<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:02.780> that

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
this we can do by using velocity so that

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.119 
this we can do by using velocity so that
from<00:04:04.069> 70<00:04:04.549> m<00:04:04.669> upwards<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.449> will<00:04:06.019> also<00:04:06.319> play<00:04:06.739> on

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
from 70 m upwards it will also play on

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:13.150 
from 70 m upwards it will also play on
the<00:04:07.370> great<00:04:08.709> second<00:04:09.709> touch<00:04:11.620> we<00:04:12.620> do<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.919> same

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
the great second touch we do the same

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:22.790 
the great second touch we do the same
for<00:04:13.489> accompaniment

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.339 

okay<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.789> then<00:04:24.539> we<00:04:24.720> select<00:04:24.930> some<00:04:25.199> stops<00:04:25.710> for

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
okay and then we select some stops for

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.100 
okay and then we select some stops for
the<00:04:28.349> second<00:04:28.860> touch<00:04:29.039> as<00:04:29.370> well<00:04:29.669> we<00:04:30.479> move<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.900> a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
the second touch as well we move it a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.490 
the second touch as well we move it a
little<00:04:31.139> bit<00:04:31.620> here<00:04:31.979> so<00:04:32.240> if<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.389> play<00:04:33.599> softly

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.950 

you<00:04:37.500> will<00:04:37.650> only<00:04:37.919> have<00:04:38.250> on<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:39.180> playing<00:04:39.509> on<00:04:39.810> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
you will only have on the playing on the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.320 
you will only have on the playing on the
main<00:04:40.169> main<00:04:40.889> panel<00:04:41.900> but<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.199> hit<00:04:43.740> hard<00:04:44.490> will

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
main main panel but if you hit hard will

00:04:45.330 --> 00:05:07.090 
main main panel but if you hit hard will
played<00:04:45.629> also<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:50.720> second<00:04:51.720> touch

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.750 

for<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.190> peril<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.990> don't<00:05:09.990> have<00:05:10.350> a

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
for the peril I don't have a

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.160 
for the peril I don't have a
velocity-sensitive<00:05:11.760> pedal<00:05:12.480> board<00:05:12.810> so<00:05:13.140> I

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
velocity-sensitive pedal board so I

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.420 
velocity-sensitive pedal board so I
cannot<00:05:13.820> configure<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:15.120> in<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.450> same<00:05:15.720> way<00:05:16.430> but

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
cannot configure it in the same way but

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.510 
cannot configure it in the same way but
what<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.760> can<00:05:18.060> do<00:05:18.300> is<00:05:18.660> to<00:05:18.990> set<00:05:19.470> only<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.950> part<00:05:20.280> of

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
what I can do is to set only a part of

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.340 
what I can do is to set only a part of
the<00:05:20.640> pedal<00:05:21.270> compass<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:23.600> also<00:05:24.600> go<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.840> the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
the pedal compass to also go to the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
the pedal compass to also go to the
second<00:05:25.950> touch<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:27.140> for<00:05:28.140> this<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.620> will<00:05:30.770> set<00:05:31.770> the

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
second touch and for this I will set the

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.260 
second touch and for this I will set the
lowest<00:05:32.790> octave<00:05:34.160> to<00:05:35.160> have<00:05:35.340> second<00:05:35.760> touch<00:05:35.940> as

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
lowest octave to have second touch as

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.100 
lowest octave to have second touch as
well<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:39.030> will<00:05:39.090> put<00:05:39.630> a<00:05:39.660> bass<00:05:40.500> drum<00:05:40.530> there

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
well and I will put a bass drum there

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.310 
well and I will put a bass drum there
and<00:05:43.110> if<00:05:43.320> I<00:05:43.470> play<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.040> little<00:05:44.220> C<00:05:45.110> then<00:05:46.110> it's

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
and if I play the little C then it's

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.090 
and if I play the little C then it's
only<00:05:46.620> on

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:06:03.240 

the<00:05:51.640> main<00:05:51.850> panel<00:05:52.120> but<00:05:52.480> in<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:53.170> great<00:05:53.470> octave

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.350 

we<00:06:03.850> also<00:06:03.970> have<00:06:04.420> the<00:06:04.600> second<00:06:04.990> touch<00:06:06.120> now<00:06:07.120> we<00:06:07.180> are

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
we also have the second touch now we are

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.690 
we also have the second touch now we are
seeing<00:06:07.720> this<00:06:07.960> feature<00:06:09.060> thanks<00:06:10.060> for<00:06:10.270> watching
