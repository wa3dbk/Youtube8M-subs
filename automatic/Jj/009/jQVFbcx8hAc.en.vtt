 no no 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.270
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.040
 video on this occasion we want to compare 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.210
 the samsung galaxy s2 with the lg 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.860
 optimus 4x hd let's run square in 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:28.609
 both terminals simultaneously 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:30.680
 so you can see the difference of 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:38.300
 first part controlling people a 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:41.290
 3d graphics memory of lg 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.290
 rather faster 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.869
 in this kind of comparison is where 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.440
 really a quad core takes advantage 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.370
 on a boat 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.370
 if you need 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 and 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.860
 As you can see even the Samsung Galaxy S2 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:38.350
 shows everything correctly but the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.350
 shaft speed is clearly superior 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.820
 end with the vote of 4,528 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.170
 points and samsung galaxy s2 has not yet 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.170
 finished performing the test 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.020
 The Samsung Galaxy S2 shows a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.880
 score of 3 thousand 102 points a lady 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.640
 they shared it with that of the heretic but 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.459
 clearly lower is here where as 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 we say it shows the difference of 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.390
 power
