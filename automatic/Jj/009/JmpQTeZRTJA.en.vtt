looking<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.110> connectivity

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
looking at connectivity

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.649 
looking at connectivity
it's<00:02:00.510> something<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.320> future<00:02:01.680> forces

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it's something the future forces

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.580 
it's something the future forces
North<00:02:03.840> America<00:02:04.939> easier<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.439> not

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
North America easier to get out it's not

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.619 
North America easier to get out it's not
as<00:02:07.740> good<00:02:07.979> yeah<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:08.910> spots<00:02:09.179> so

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
as good yeah there are spots so

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.039 
as good yeah there are spots so
something<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.709> would<00:02:10.830> definitely
