don't have to memorize how deep each
individual<00:01:46.680> seed<00:01:46.950> needs<00:01:47.219> to<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.460> planted

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.199 

okay<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> think<00:02:49.810> that's<00:02:50.170> enough<00:02:50.530> there

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.789 

nice<00:02:58.540> now<00:02:59.540> we're<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.810> going<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.049> cover<00:03:00.590> our

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
nice now we're just going to cover our

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.050 
nice now we're just going to cover our
furrows<00:03:01.040> up<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.489> we<00:03:01.549> got<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.760> be<00:03:01.790> careful

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
furrows up but we got to be careful

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.580 
furrows up but we got to be careful
because<00:03:02.329> like<00:03:02.599> you<00:03:02.719> said<00:03:02.959> these<00:03:03.200> things<00:03:03.439> are

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
because like you said these things are

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.649 
because like you said these things are
small<00:03:03.829> we<00:03:03.950> don't<00:03:03.980> need<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.340> lot<00:03:04.819> on<00:03:05.000> top<00:03:05.239> only<00:03:05.629> a

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
small we don't need a lot on top only a

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:17.229 
small we don't need a lot on top only a
little<00:03:05.900> bit<00:03:14.980> you've<00:03:15.980> got<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.430> seeds<00:03:16.819> in<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
little bit you've got the seeds in the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.000 
little bit you've got the seeds in the
ground<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.230> next<00:03:18.500> thing<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:18.709> have<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.829> do

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
ground and the next thing we have to do

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.459 
ground and the next thing we have to do
of<00:03:19.129> course<00:03:19.159> is<00:03:19.519> water<00:03:19.939> it<00:03:20.209> thoroughly<00:03:20.510> we<00:03:21.260> want

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:21.469 
of course is water it thoroughly we want

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.589 
of course is water it thoroughly we want
to<00:03:21.560> make<00:03:21.680> sure<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.280> during<00:03:22.939> the<00:03:23.180> germination

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
to make sure that during the germination

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.649 
to make sure that during the germination
process<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.560> seeds<00:03:24.889> are<00:03:25.280> nice<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.329> moist

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
process the seeds are nice and moist

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.690 
process the seeds are nice and moist
because<00:03:27.379> that's<00:03:27.620> gonna<00:03:27.769> help<00:03:27.950> them<00:03:28.189> germinate

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
because that's gonna help them germinate

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.369 
because that's gonna help them germinate
they<00:03:29.180> need<00:03:29.419> that<00:03:29.629> moisture<00:03:30.079> they're<00:03:30.260> gonna

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
they need that moisture they're gonna

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.159 
they need that moisture they're gonna
have<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.680> soil<00:03:31.159> to<00:03:31.519> seed<00:03:31.819> contact<00:03:32.510> the

have that soil to seed contact the

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.899 
have that soil to seed contact the
onions<00:03:33.590> we'll<00:03:33.799> take<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.069> little<00:03:34.400> bit<00:03:34.609> of<00:03:34.669> time

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
onions we'll take a little bit of time

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.190 
onions we'll take a little bit of time
before<00:03:35.090> they<00:03:35.359> start<00:03:35.419> sprouting<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.079> our

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
before they start sprouting but our

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.020 
before they start sprouting but our
lettuce<00:03:36.409> is<00:03:36.709> within<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.579> week<00:03:37.790> we<00:03:37.970> should

lettuce is within the week we should

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.780 
lettuce is within the week we should
start<00:03:38.389> seeing<00:03:38.569> little<00:03:38.959> green<00:03:39.790> sprouts

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
start seeing little green sprouts

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.690 
start seeing little green sprouts
popping<00:03:41.659> through<00:03:42.099> exactly<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.430> then<00:03:43.519> that

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
popping through exactly and then that

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.179 
popping through exactly and then that
begins<00:03:44.030> West<00:03:44.510> West<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.959> me<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.290> hardest<00:03:45.889> part

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
begins West West to me the hardest part

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.179 
begins West West to me the hardest part
of<00:03:46.459> ATC<00:03:47.359> sowing<00:03:47.840> which<00:03:48.049> comes<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.500> thinning

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
of ATC sowing which comes the thinning

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.459 
of ATC sowing which comes the thinning
part<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:50.060> know<00:03:50.180> we<00:03:50.389> are<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.689> world<00:03:50.959> can't<00:03:51.349> we

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:51.469 
part you know we are the world can't we

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:55.509 
part you know we are the world can't we
all<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:51.680> get<00:03:52.069> along<00:03:52.299> no<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.950> gotta<00:03:55.159> get<00:03:55.400> in

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
all just get along no you gotta get in

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.069 
all just get along no you gotta get in
there<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:55.939> spitting<00:03:56.209> these<00:03:56.389> guys<00:03:56.689> out<00:03:57.049> so

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
there and spitting these guys out so

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.869 
there and spitting these guys out so
you've<00:03:57.799> got<00:03:57.919> to<00:03:58.069> thin<00:03:58.340> them<00:03:58.489> out<00:03:58.579> and

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
you've got to thin them out and

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.670 
you've got to thin them out and
typically<00:03:59.419> we<00:03:59.569> want<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.870> make<00:04:00.019> sure<00:04:00.049> that<00:04:00.349> they

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
typically we want to make sure that they

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.199 
typically we want to make sure that they
have<00:04:00.859> enough<00:04:00.889> space<00:04:01.370> because<00:04:01.729> if<00:04:01.849> you<00:04:01.940> don't

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
have enough space because if you don't

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.789 
have enough space because if you don't
then<00:04:02.419> they<00:04:02.540> won't<00:04:02.750> be<00:04:02.840> able<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.169> grow<00:04:03.470> and

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
then they won't be able to grow and

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.890 
then they won't be able to grow and
become<00:04:04.099> the<00:04:04.430> full<00:04:04.699> size<00:04:05.000> plants<00:04:05.479> that<00:04:05.569> we<00:04:05.690> need

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
become the full size plants that we need

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.539 
become the full size plants that we need
them<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.109> be<00:04:06.229> so<00:04:06.799> we<00:04:06.919> could<00:04:07.040> harvest<00:04:07.250> them<00:04:07.519> and

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
them to be so we could harvest them and

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.819 
them to be so we could harvest them and
get<00:04:07.729> all<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.909> produce<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.269> we<00:04:08.389> want<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.530> for

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
get all the produce that we want so for

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.129 
get all the produce that we want so for
our<00:04:10.069> lettuces<00:04:10.609> we<00:04:10.849> want<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.359> space<00:04:11.750> them<00:04:12.049> out

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
our lettuces we want to space them out

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.189 
our lettuces we want to space them out
about<00:04:12.650> one<00:04:13.040> inch<00:04:13.280> mm-hmm<00:04:14.120> between<00:04:14.540> each<00:04:14.810> plant

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 
about one inch mm-hmm between each plant

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.680 
about one inch mm-hmm between each plant
and<00:04:15.470> when<00:04:16.340> we<00:04:16.519> start<00:04:16.789> thinning<00:04:17.000> them<00:04:17.269> out<00:04:17.419> you

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
and when we start thinning them out you

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.899 
and when we start thinning them out you
know<00:04:17.810> we<00:04:18.049> can<00:04:18.229> take<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.979> put<00:04:19.639> that<00:04:19.669> in

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:19.909 
know we can take that and put that in

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.610 
know we can take that and put that in
the<00:04:20.000> compost<00:04:20.449> bin<00:04:20.510> we<00:04:20.780> don't<00:04:20.930> want<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.440> let

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
the compost bin we don't want to let

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.409 
the compost bin we don't want to let
that<00:04:21.650> go<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.039> waste<00:04:22.130> we<00:04:22.880> can<00:04:23.030> take<00:04:23.240> those

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
that go to waste we can take those

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.620 
that go to waste we can take those
sprouts<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.199> we<00:04:24.770> can<00:04:24.919> also<00:04:25.210> me<00:04:26.210> because<00:04:26.479> I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
sprouts and we can also me because I

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.360 
sprouts and we can also me because I
have<00:04:26.840> chickens<00:04:27.289> I'll<00:04:27.830> give<00:04:28.039> them<00:04:28.099> to<00:04:28.159> my

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
chickens they love little green sprouts

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.860 
chickens they love little green sprouts
right<00:04:30.919> right<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.550> I'll<00:04:32.060> often<00:04:32.389> take<00:04:32.750> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
right right and I'll often take the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.600 
right right and I'll often take the
sprout<00:04:33.139> sometimes<00:04:33.590> you<00:04:34.009> can<00:04:34.190> use<00:04:34.370> them<00:04:34.580> in

sprout sometimes you can use them in
salads<00:04:35.270> or<00:04:35.449> use<00:04:35.599> them<00:04:35.780> on<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> sandwich<00:04:36.229> because
