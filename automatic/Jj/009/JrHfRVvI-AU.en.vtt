the map a lot of the map looks very

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.089 
the map a lot of the map looks very
similar<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.440> will<00:02:49.560> come<00:02:49.680> across<00:02:49.799> this

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
similar but you will come across this

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.069 
similar but you will come across this
very<00:02:50.310> noticeable<00:02:50.849> graveyard<00:02:51.359> area<00:02:51.690> there's

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
really Russian dauber like a little

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.740 
really Russian dauber like a little
teapot<00:02:55.709> which<00:02:55.890> has<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.099> breach<00:02:56.370> behind<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.000> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
teapot which has a breach behind it you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.960 
teapot which has a breach behind it you
breach<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.440> you'll<00:02:58.829> find<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.489> egg<00:02:59.730> it's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
breach that and you'll find the egg it's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.240 
breach that and you'll find the egg it's
a<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.569> well<00:03:00.870> hidden<00:03:01.170> egg<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.680> my<00:03:01.709> opinion

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
a really well hidden egg in my opinion

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.710 
a really well hidden egg in my opinion
and<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.760> actually<00:03:03.030> took<00:03:03.150> quite<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.450> while<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and that actually took quite a while to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.199 
and that actually took quite a while to
find<00:03:04.079> but<00:03:04.319> now<00:03:04.440> you've<00:03:04.620> unlocked<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.129> XP<00:03:05.970> but

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.610 
find but now you've unlocked the XP but
you<00:03:06.269> haven't<00:03:06.450> got<00:03:06.690> yourself<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.109> achievement

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620
