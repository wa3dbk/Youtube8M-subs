00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 you play fifa 15 and have the problem 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.660
 that's just not going to be the new ones 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.950
 troika arrives in fifa 14 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.750
 still rows in the stitches landed 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
 just do not go in anymore 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.660
 I do not have the ball for you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.660
 this tutorial 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.660
 welcome and nice that you 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.630
 turned on hate to a brand new one 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.399
 deeper 15 tutorial and that should be it 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.769
 today a simple but very 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.379
 Effective technology will go in the keeper 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.559
 one against one or conclusion situation 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.239
 in the penalty area we conquer 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.739
 probably already in the scenes in the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.809
 recognized background is that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.699
 secret of this technique a shallow shot 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.329
 with the inside or with the 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.449
 fully spun 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.280
 because through the new parameters 15 hold 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.440
 the perpetrators are half-high and high- key 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.969
 much better even if you already 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.559
 be very close to the opponent's gate 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.359
 with flat conclusions, however, they have 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.800
 a longer way because they only 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.379
 have to dive to keep the ball 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.910
 and if you want to try a foot parade 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.920
 then the good placement helps you 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.929
 a controlled shallow shot on 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.050
 by the goalkeeper not to the ball 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:12.190
 is the cool part of this technique 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.800
 that they are also from a distance 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.800
 still works perfectly fine 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.979
 little fun on the edge people what me 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.689
 of course you want to say that is 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.909
 this technique also the penalty room 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.320
 that is, from the outside 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.460
 you will with such a low shot 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.560
 Do not score 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.210
 The things are just too slow for that 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.770
 I've tagged you the area 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.450
 in my opinion the highest 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.439
 probability of success for one 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.600
 such protection exists 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.369
 and the closer you are the closer the more applies 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.579
 better than your position for such a 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.380
 shot two things are important if you 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.119
 wanted to do a good job 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.679
 First, you have your player like that 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.929
 align that in the same corner 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.189
 he looks at you then he shoots 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.990
 significantly more control over the ball 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.360
 and the shot comes placed and 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.549
 Harder in which corner shoots 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.830
 no matter both long post and short 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.540
 Both work well 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 only if you want to shoot short corner 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.860
 that your angle must not be too late 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.239
 secondly, it is natural 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.890
 Decisive that we only shot 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.840
 He charges a little too flat 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.440
 tip comes the shot button so only 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.870
 shortly 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.209
 I recommend you one to one and a half 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.829
 a maximum of two bars while I'm in the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.630
 background now a few slow motion 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.850
 show the very beautiful how 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.500
 the goalkeepers with the shots 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.750
 bring your pike or even football 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.850
 Guess I do not advise to come to the ball 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.170
 you today's extra tip and indeed 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.120
 you need a flat if you 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.739
 finish with the inside one 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.109
 wanted to perform a cut shot 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.090
 not always the rb key forces you to 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.380
 but if you are with yours 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.959
 Striker already in a very good 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.630
 position close to the goalkeeper then you can 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.859
 you just tap the button briefly 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.079
 and if the player has a good one 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.180
 then he has a value of 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.829
 even a cut shot and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.090
 they are often placed very well 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.099
 and we often 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.989
 but if you are a bit further away 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.670
 from the gate and the death is a piece out 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.010
 comes as well as in the lewandowski scene 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.080
 then I would rather recommend the rb 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.080
 press the button with the button 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.760
 steered to steer past the gate 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.530
 that's it with today's tutorial people 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.330
 I hope you enjoyed it and you 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.900
 makes at least five minutes per 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.910
 game 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.470
 if that should be the case then let 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.910
 a thumbs up around me 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.950
 to support the format 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.319
 that would be glad rejoicing 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.390
