00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:55.920
 chicken livers we go snacks and 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:56.850
 very quickly this is done 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.030
 now we will cut into small 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.210
 pieces and zouk is the separation 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.210
 is just a little cube 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:30.030
 again a mix all the flavors 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.440
 all the aromas of our meats and 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.400
 the seasoning this mixture is so 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.690
 now what am I going to do what 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.910
 I'm going to the film and to the touch it's up to 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.680
 to say that my film will be about food 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.610
 and not on the bowl or the fiv and the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.830
 touch c saf 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.410
 we are going to be well naples draws the 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.290
 preparation that we will get off the film 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.550
 about food and we're fine and pretty 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.130
 for it the least possible air 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.680
 to prevent our preparation from crusting 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.360
 is oxidizing here well we went to 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.370
 12 hours in the refrigerator 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.500
 the terrine spent 12 hours at 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.760
 refrigerator so everything goes movies and 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.320
 to eat 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.320
 the plastic film or not stir a little 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:21.790
 well now I add the egg that 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:28.810
 we did not add at first so we 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:32.139
 okay and now we have nothing left 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:47.860
 more than to put our device which 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:50.530
 flat and terrible matrix but he's going 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:57.400
 have to reverse people well spend 40 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:59.910
 an air bubble underneath so that 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.979
 that the crisis is uniform 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.440
 I put the oven to preheated 200 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.590
 degrees we will cook your terrine 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.020
 to the husband's teeth for about an hour 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.979
 twenty I just have to bake it so 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.900
 for 1h20 if the terrine takes too much 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.790
 colors one see if it crusts too much 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.900
 she quickly becomes brown too fast and 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.370
 well what we will do is we go 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.880
 take a piece of aluminum all 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.460
 simply 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.590
 and then we'll put it over 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.800
 so that cooking is done without 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.720
 that the coloring was accentuated 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.490
 1h28 later are our land is 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.020
 ready so I'll let it cool 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.900
 on a table corner 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.270
 and then when it will be well cooled I 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.400
 would put a refrigerator for a 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.770
 dozen hours 12h02 refrigeration 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.120
 later and well here we are with our 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.820
 terry and she is superb 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.039
 jeans cut a nice slice here on 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.570
 a small slice of bread but there's more 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.570
 to go to the table
