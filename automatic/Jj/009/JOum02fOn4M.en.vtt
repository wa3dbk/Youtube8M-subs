00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.700 
morning but I still ate not really
thrilled<00:02:34.820> prospect<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.530> one

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
thrilled prospect of that but it's one

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.110 
thrilled prospect of that but it's one
of<00:02:36.770> those<00:02:36.860> things<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.460> have<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.880> for

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
of those things that you have to do for

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.540 
of those things that you have to do for
this<00:02:38.180> first<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.600> load<00:02:38.780> days<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.890> these<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.910 
this first to load days the these to
load<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.910> definitely<00:02:41.330> harder<00:02:41.720> than<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.680> last

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
load is definitely harder than the last

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.160 
load is definitely harder than the last
one<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.460> I<00:02:43.520> did<00:02:43.730> because<00:02:44.060> when<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.930> first

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
one that I did because when I first

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.840 
one that I did because when I first
started<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.530> diet<00:02:45.740> I<00:02:46.070> was<00:02:46.460> still<00:02:46.610> addicted
