00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
collision physics this basically has to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.140 
collision physics this basically has to
do<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.379> basically<00:00:16.859> real<00:00:17.160> life<00:00:17.369> hits<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:18.060> you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
do with basically real life hits if you

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.179 
do with basically real life hits if you
guys<00:00:18.300> know<00:00:18.570> NHL<00:00:19.020> 13<00:00:19.050> sometimes<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> hits<00:00:19.980> can

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
guys know NHL 13 sometimes it hits can

guys know NHL 13 sometimes it hits can
be<00:00:20.250> kind<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.550> awkward<00:00:20.670> sometimes<00:00:21.660> will<00:00:21.900> bounce

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
be kind of awkward sometimes will bounce

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
be kind of awkward sometimes will bounce
off<00:00:22.260> each<00:00:22.289> other<00:00:22.619> sometimes<00:00:23.310> crazy<00:00:23.519> stuff

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
off each other sometimes crazy stuff

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.950 
off each other sometimes crazy stuff
will<00:00:23.970> happen<00:00:24.090> if<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.390> guys<00:00:24.510> seen<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.810> video

where you know like guys will just fly
over<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.260> boards<00:00:28.590> obviously<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
over the boards obviously with like the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.279 
over the boards obviously with like the
Hercules<00:00:30.570> check<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.140> there's<00:00:31.260> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
Hercules check and you know there's a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.749 
Hercules check and you know there's a
lot<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.439> crazy<00:00:31.890> stuff<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.130> happens<00:00:32.550> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
lot of crazy stuff that happens so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.310 
lot of crazy stuff that happens so
apparently<00:00:33.510> they're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> try<00:00:34.290> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
apparently they're going to try to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.170 
apparently they're going to try to
refine<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.890> fix<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.760> looking<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> try

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
refine and fix that I was looking to try

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.970 
refine and fix that I was looking to try
to<00:00:36.210> make<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.660> lifelike<00:00:37.050> where<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.620> they

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to make it more lifelike where is they

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
to make it more lifelike where is they
try<00:00:38.040> were<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.760> hit<00:00:38.910> yonder<00:00:39.420> you'd

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
try were to go up and hit yonder you'd

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.479 
try were to go up and hit yonder you'd
always<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> best<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.680> him<00:00:40.800> right<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.070> NHL

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
always get the best of him right now NHL

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.389 
always get the best of him right now NHL
13<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.480> try<00:00:42.719> them<00:00:42.840> i<00:00:42.899> hit<00:00:43.160> gionta<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
13 you know try them i hit gionta and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.190 
13 you know try them i hit gionta and
nothing<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.210> would<00:00:45.480> happen<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:45.989> guess

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
nothing really would happen so I guess

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350 
nothing really would happen so I guess
they're<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> more<00:00:47.219> real<00:00:48.149> life

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
they're going for a more real life

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.760 
they're going for a more real life
experience<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:48.960> checking<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.649> more

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
experience when checking as well as more

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
experience when checking as well as more
of<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> refined<00:00:50.969> checking<00:00:51.899> two<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
of like a refined checking two of that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.139 
of like a refined checking two of that
makes<00:00:52.469> sense<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.370> second<00:00:53.610> thing<00:00:53.699> guys<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
makes sense the second thing guys is the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.610 
makes sense the second thing guys is the
enforcer<00:00:54.660> engine<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.350> cool

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
enforcer engine this is really cool

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.709 
enforcer engine this is really cool
they're<00:00:56.399> using<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> fight<00:00:56.940> night<00:00:57.120> technology

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
they're using the fight night technology

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.790 
they're using the fight night technology
if<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> guys<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.109> know<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
if you guys don't know what that is it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
if you guys don't know what that is it's
actually<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> boxing<00:00:59.820> game<00:01:00.000> made<00:01:00.239> by<00:01:00.270> EA<00:01:00.510> sports

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
actually a boxing game made by EA sports

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.229 
actually a boxing game made by EA sports
it's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> lot<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> fun<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.070> basically<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.120> now

stick there's actually gonna be a little
bit<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.340> strategy<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.270> really

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
bit of strategy to it which is really

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
bit of strategy to it which is really
cool<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.380> excited<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.979> you

cool so opposed to now just playing a
regulator<00:03:45.970> online<00:03:46.299> versus<00:03:46.629> play<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.049> really

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
regulator online versus play and really

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.539 
regulator online versus play and really
not<00:03:47.590> getting<00:03:47.799> much<00:03:47.889> out<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.220> now<00:03:48.370> you're

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
not getting much out of it now you're

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.979

right now I haven't heard anything about
legends<00:04:53.979> that's<00:04:54.340> good<00:04:54.639> I<00:04:55.060> wouldn't<00:04:55.780> mind<00:04:55.930> if

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
legends that's good I wouldn't mind if

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.450 
legends that's good I wouldn't mind if
they<00:04:56.080> bring<00:04:56.289> back<00:04:56.320> legend<00:04:56.860> mode<00:04:57.009> but<00:04:57.250> it's<00:04:57.340> not

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
my favorite mode and I think they could

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.050 
my favorite mode and I think they could
really<00:04:59.320> use<00:04:59.500> some<00:04:59.710> better<00:04:59.979> legends<00:05:00.460> as<00:05:00.759> little

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
really use some better legends as little
