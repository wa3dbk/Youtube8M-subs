00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.110
 so hello everyone right now factory want to take off 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.670
 which the rich never ask 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.670
 with what 's rolling 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 we do high and then we do 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:36.720
 so you need to learn for stability 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.269
 this is the first second you need to be able to 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:44.040
 just slipways enroll personal high 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:51.260
 need to do also lured out not tall 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:55.489
 rpm 1 for the second movement well 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.489
 it is advisable to do at least chapter 3 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.729
 yes it means me at least 1 turn 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.330
 from this I am very similar to the second 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.940
 turnover 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:14.240
 yes that is, we are also turning 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:17.750
 Kazakhstan here is not necessarily 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.150
 now as a transition between the first and second 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.600
 turns the fact is that many of us 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.020
 go both ways and interfere very much 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.940
 strongly at first how to overcome in to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.200
 they did not interfere with cool to do as it were 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.149
 small periscope and sides to the ball 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.660
 jump a little to the right immediately carrying 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.950
 a leg 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.580
 environments that is we do see leg y 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.580
 me right away 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.210
 it turns out on this side 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.460
 as soon as we jumped we were after 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.520
 this answer 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.260
 do the opposite 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.930
 one 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.070
 two means this way do a little 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.990
 easier to 2 breeds without forgetting that we cling 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.820
 even so that is not right if you 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.660
 pick up you have the right that you will 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.100
 second turn is not done here you need 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.370
 the ball exactly catches you so that it 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.950
 turned left 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.650
 further means how to perform means 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.280
 actually second touch just now so 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.810
 video le pen turnover 2 and then on 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.720
 most at the initial stage 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.220
 it turns out and not pick up 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.460
 here I repeat that you need to be able to well 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.120
 do both juice but nonetheless still 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.760
 is important 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.600
 important is the ability to do so and preferably not 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:45.990
 make two so at least some better 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.990
 dangerous here as you can train 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:07.090
 accomplices are very helpful if you 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:09.790
 correctly remains the success the ball should 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.390
 somehow gently touch on and that is, we don't 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.150
 we drink we catch 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.709
 instant prince will give when 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.560
 we will get me that way 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.840
 make 1 turn i'm free and do so 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.530
 last until what come on many when a couple 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.570
 it is better to make the West cling and not 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.950
 can make the last move here 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.400
 as i told 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.140
 so react would like 23 desirable 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.100
 be able to do if all of the above 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.500
 right you do you stay 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.570
 train on how to stabilize this 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.440
 long advice to want all movements 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.989
 slow date 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.570
 the first movement of the mufas between the high 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.090
 you are slow and the card is smoothly up 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.220
 This supply Mike returned the left foot 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:03.360
 gently such that you will get 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.260
 soft go make a decision very 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.050
 quickly so here we will have every time from 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.600
 bad videos we try to do gently and 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.980
 now I will show you once again it seems 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.310
 wrong yes we do begin the first 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.350
 turnover can be made too low for me 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.669
 would make a frame side sometime 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.340
 second unit we can make 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.930
 wrong for this take 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.540
 not necessarily straight leg yes a little bit 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.590
 boils up 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.040
 stop land is nice and without 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.129
 or how much will answer and remove as if 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.429
 we do 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:42.759
 the right will be obtained means further beyond 

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:47.469
 the threshold of movement is 3 2 to 2 touches and this 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:50.469
 if not gently take for 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.899
 Th, so now you do not need to do and the last 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:55.029
 Dasha we will make it the right end 

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:57.279
 hitting the ball here all depends on 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:05:01.629
 approach us bad then you will do 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:05.699
 as if the concert arrives all the date itself 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.699
 23 how can you do something like that 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.370
 so i hope you like this one 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.169
 tutorial i 'm sorry jeff darkness yes 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.470
 so it may not be very visible 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.620
 but I hope that this tutorial was for you 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.090
 useful and you learn how to backup yes 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.680
 don't forget to train with dlna 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.280
 the quantity is a matter of not being very 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.229
