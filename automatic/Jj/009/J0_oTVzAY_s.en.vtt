00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.569
 well here in the studio we have a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.890
 leandro fest today I do not know whether to say that it is 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.570
 argentino is not argentinian we have 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.759
 repeated so many times that today we no longer 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.530
 we will not know for several repeat and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.940
 be Argentine and die Argentine without 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.070
 no problem and when the pride but 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.439
 leandro to tell the whole truth has 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 been a party that Germany promised 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.740
 It was going to be very easy and the truth is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.359
 that although it is true that they are champions 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.769
 of the world and you have to celebrate it has not 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.810
 it was far from being a military walk 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.550
 as many thought yes it is true look 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.790
 before leaving the camera I show you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 a bit like the gesture of our of the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.000
 Germans there when I was with the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.410
 Argentine shirt yesterday turning around 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.210
 here not for the house because it was very 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.370
 respectful the companions but by the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.780
 street was simply a gesture of us 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.490
 let's go over 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.160
 more specifically after that 7 a 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.930
 some who named causes before Brazil 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 that was a 7 to 1 that is given every 100 years 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.800
 but also that Brazil had done 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.900
 many merits to get defeated well 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.210
 remember that Brazil was about 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.700
 to stay out of the world against Chile if 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.190
 that stick if that ball on the crossbar 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.500
 and it goes two centimeters lower too 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.330
 could have been against Colombia in 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.200
 rooms you have to always remember these 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.150
 things outside of the world cup if the goal of 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.550
 yepes he would not have been canceled 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.220
 the role of the referees must be 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.560
 say it too and that's why I think that 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.160
 Brazil was a bit of a mirage taking 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.450
 also note that Germany came from 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.490
 background like not being able to beat 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.590
 Ghana 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.409
 not having to have gone in 5 minutes 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.930
 120 minutes to lengthen to win 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.619
 Algeria and to beat France in a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.060
 opaque super good party with 10 of 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.890
 another side was also Argentina that 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.320
 if we see the first matches in the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.649
 group stage of argentinas if we could 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.310
 say that good Argentina was a team 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.470
 apparently weak but it was growing and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.320
 became another Argentina from 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.509
 of rooms there were also changes 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.830
 forced to change di maría but that 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.170
 it was not noticed so much on the team team 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.780
 it came out morally reinforced also the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.519
 fact that the technical decision of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.440
 take out gago and put the bible gave 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.720
 much more balance to the team that's why 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.819
 the match today was so even and we arrived 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.720
 until 120 minutes and we arrived not 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.180
 spoke in the first person of the plural 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.470
 we arrive yes but in general the truth is 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.640
 that in the end has been in a play of a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.959
 goal where the world cup has been decided 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.430
 after what you say two teams 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.780
 playing football very well there is a 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.030
 play that I would like you to tell us 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.519
 it's especially minute 56 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.500
 no longer and higuaín within the area a 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.610
 play that from the television was seen 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 one way and the referees have 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.920
 interpreted as another very different 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.960
 and no wonder that knows what 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.290
 the images now so that the referees 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.440
 they have two assistants and a fourth apart 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.120
 referee the truth that I do not understand it to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.220
 times because it looked clearly good 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.870
 this is not the play but it will appear in 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.310
 some time if you can not fix my 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.350
 twitter me cabbage and on my twitter I the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.780
 can see is repeated there so that the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.020
 can see is a clear knee in the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.490
 face of higuaín knocks it down the grave of 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.950
 a knees in the face inside the area 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.020
 that was red girlfriend the referee looked for 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.500
 I do not know that the side greeted their 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.400
 companions and such and we in the gallery 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.950
 unfortunately we said it because this 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.920
 it was red so as not to go and get the best 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.620
 archer of the world cup referees 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.480
 they had a lot against the protagonism 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.520
 very well we do not have time for more but 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.530
 tell us that in the end Germany has deserved 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.480
 win cheer already deserves to win if it is 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.000
 winner I played I have one thing for you if 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.450
 I am 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.430
 I have no choice but that this is a 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.230
 very nice german flag I suppose it is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.940
 German is high 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.680
 it's not argentinian yet but let's 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.930
 save and we will respectfully care 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.560
 as it corresponds and well we will wait 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.730
 I wish 94 years to get revenge 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.990
 We will be back in a few minutes and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.340
 we will talk about the German melistas to 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.340
 talk about our German merits and so
