00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
that's that good feel like that about a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.530 
that's that good feel like that about a
loss<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:54.800> wonder<00:00:55.100> why<00:00:55.330> everybody<00:00:56.330> doesn't

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
loss you wonder why everybody doesn't

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.000 
loss you wonder why everybody doesn't
feel<00:00:56.930> like<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.110> don't<00:00:57.320> know<00:00:57.470> do<00:00:57.680> it<00:00:57.800> does

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
feel like I don't know do it does

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.610 
feel like I don't know do it does
everybody<00:00:58.250> feel<00:00:58.430> like<00:00:58.700> that<00:00:58.910> I<00:00:59.320> think<00:01:00.320> you'd

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
everybody feel like that I think you'd

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.110 
everybody feel like that I think you'd
be<00:01:00.740> surprised<00:01:01.220> how<00:01:01.340> many<00:01:01.430> people<00:01:01.730> feel<00:01:02.060> that

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
be surprised how many people feel that

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.689 
be surprised how many people feel that
way<00:01:02.410> we<00:01:03.410> have<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.590> whole<00:01:03.770> locker<00:01:04.040> room<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.519> way

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
way we have a whole locker room that way

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.749 
way we have a whole locker room that way
and<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.600> think<00:01:05.630> that's<00:01:06.080> what<00:01:06.409> that's<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.549> thing

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
and I think that's what that's the thing

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.880 
and I think that's what that's the thing
that<00:01:07.789> hurts<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.780> most<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.200> know<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.530> effort

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
that hurts the most you know the effort

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.730 
that hurts the most you know the effort
that<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.759> you<00:01:11.299> know<00:01:11.329> that<00:01:11.780> guys<00:01:12.020> give<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
that that you know that guys give and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.010 
that that you know that guys give and
you<00:01:12.829> know<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.280> fact<00:01:13.579> that<00:01:13.700> they<00:01:13.939> care<00:01:14.270> it's

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
you know the fact that they care it's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.380 
you know the fact that they care it's
just<00:01:15.289> what<00:01:15.469> we're<00:01:15.799> coming<00:01:16.369> up<00:01:16.490> short<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.149> I

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
just what we're coming up short and I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.819 
just what we're coming up short and I
think<00:01:17.659> that's<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.079> thing<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.530> pains

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
think that's the thing that pains

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.120 
think that's the thing that pains
everybody<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.759> way<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.060> does<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.979> know

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
everybody the way it does and you know

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.620 
everybody the way it does and you know
you<00:01:22.189> mentioned<00:01:22.520> Sheldon<00:01:23.060> Richardson<00:01:23.149> that's

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
you mentioned Sheldon Richardson that's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.539 
you mentioned Sheldon Richardson that's
I<00:01:23.929> think<00:01:24.170> that's<00:01:24.350> just<00:01:24.590> one<00:01:24.799> example<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:25.490> that

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
I think that's just one example of that

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.630 
I think that's just one example of that
so<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.079> player<00:01:27.439> is<00:01:27.590> not<00:01:27.649> executing<00:01:28.490> are

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
so is it the player is not executing are

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.459 
so is it the player is not executing are
they<00:01:28.729> not<00:01:28.909> coached<00:01:29.240> properly<00:01:29.899> because<00:01:30.140> you've

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
they not coached properly because you've

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.469 
they not coached properly because you've
you've<00:01:30.890> said<00:01:31.249> many<00:01:31.429> times<00:01:31.579> on<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.149> air<00:01:32.329> you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
you've said many times on the air you

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.599 
you've said many times on the air you
believe<00:01:32.810> this<00:01:33.020> team<00:01:33.259> has<00:01:33.619> enough<00:01:33.890> talent<00:01:34.249> but

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
believe this team has enough talent but

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.330 
believe this team has enough talent but
11<00:01:35.359> games<00:01:35.600> losing<00:01:36.140> nine<00:01:36.319> of<00:01:36.560> them<00:01:36.710> there<00:01:37.189> been

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.280 
career and throughout mine I've been
able<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.620> find<00:03:31.860> ways<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.570> getting<00:03:33.570> better<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
able to find ways of getting better and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.070 
able to find ways of getting better and
i<00:03:34.470> think<00:03:34.500> that's<00:03:35.270> that's<00:03:36.270> what<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.540> have<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.930> do

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
i think that's that's what I have to do

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.870 
i think that's that's what I have to do

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
the results are saying something else I

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.470 
the results are saying something else I
recognize<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:52.130> but<00:03:53.130> again<00:03:53.580> i'll<00:03:53.730> roll<00:03:54.390> the

guess what i'm asking you Rex is and I
guess<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> coach<00:04:00.120> can't<00:04:00.450> say<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:00.989> maybe

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
guess a coach can't say this but maybe

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.170 
guess a coach can't say this but maybe
the<00:04:01.620> talents<00:04:02.100> not<00:04:02.280> there<00:04:02.580> because<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.970> are<00:04:03.150> a

the talents not there because you are a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.970 
the talents not there because you are a
good<00:04:03.450> coach<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.930> they've<00:04:04.230> lost<00:04:04.410> nine<00:04:04.680> games

good coach and they've lost nine games
and<00:04:05.250> they<00:04:05.340> got<00:04:05.459> embarrassed<00:04:05.760> by<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.120> bills

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390
