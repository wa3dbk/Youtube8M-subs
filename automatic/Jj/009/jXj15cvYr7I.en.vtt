00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
basically the orange start here is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.520

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
exactly why you're looking when there is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
exactly why you're looking when there is
a<00:00:50.160> dot<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.390> called<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
a dot here it's actually called a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
a dot here it's actually called a
fixation<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> run<00:00:53.610> an<00:00:53.760> area

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
fixation so that is when you run an area

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.139 
fixation so that is when you run an area
more<00:00:54.390> than<00:00:54.570> 100<00:00:55.350> millisecond<00:00:55.949> at<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> time<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
more than 100 millisecond at a time and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.240 
more than 100 millisecond at a time and
then<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.920> emotion

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
then you can see here the emotion

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
then you can see here the emotion
responses<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.910> generally<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.629> very

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
the time-lapse you had a standstill for
like<00:01:23.670> 20<00:01:24.090> minutes<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.659> my<00:01:24.810> legs<00:01:25.049> were
