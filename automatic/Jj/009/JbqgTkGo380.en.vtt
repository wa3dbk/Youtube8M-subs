to<00:02:32.530> be<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.739> hot<00:02:32.920> spot<00:02:33.220> where<00:02:33.459> both<00:02:33.790> teams

to be the hot spot where both teams

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.960

about<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.540> jungle<00:02:37.870> map<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.370> big

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
about the jungle map is that it's so big

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.940 
about the jungle map is that it's so big
and<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.780> flags<00:02:41.049> each<00:02:41.379> have<00:02:41.769> their<00:02:41.890> own

and that the flags each have their own

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.400

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
of the medical facility I would

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.289 
of the medical facility I would
deliberately<00:03:02.500> not<00:03:02.620> shoot<00:03:03.310> them<00:03:03.549> because<00:03:04.150> it

deliberately not shoot them because it

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.809 
deliberately not shoot them because it
was<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.750> fun<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:06.069> that<00:03:06.370> gets<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.670> bit<00:03:06.790> boring

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
was so fun if that gets a bit boring

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.640 
was so fun if that gets a bit boring
though<00:03:07.359> you<00:03:07.420> can<00:03:07.660> grab<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> motorbike<00:03:08.410> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
though you can grab a motorbike and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.250 
though you can grab a motorbike and
flank<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.280> enemy<00:03:09.310> by<00:03:10.180> heading<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.780> B<00:03:10.959> flag

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.190 
flank the enemy by heading to the B flag
there<00:03:11.530> are<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.010> many<00:03:12.430> options<00:03:13.209> with<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.840> map

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
there are so many options with this map

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.990 
there are so many options with this map
and<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.500> really<00:03:15.010> couldn't<00:03:15.190> be<00:03:15.340> happier<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:15.819> it

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
and I really couldn't be happier with it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.050 
and I really couldn't be happier with it
I<00:03:16.269> have<00:03:17.019> no<00:03:17.379> gripes<00:03:17.769> with<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.220> map<00:03:18.519> though<00:03:19.030> I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
I have no gripes with this map though I

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.330 
I have no gripes with this map though I
would<00:03:19.450> love<00:03:19.629> to<00:03:19.810> see<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.079> waterfall<00:03:20.410> play<00:03:21.310> a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
would love to see the waterfall play a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.490 
would love to see the waterfall play a
more<00:03:21.609> strategic<00:03:21.910> role<00:03:22.629> rather<00:03:22.930> than<00:03:23.260> just

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
more strategic role rather than just

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.550 
more strategic role rather than just
being<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.040> piece<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.280> scenery<00:03:24.760> as<00:03:25.470> people<00:03:26.470> have

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
being a piece of scenery as people have

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.589 
being a piece of scenery as people have
speculated<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.430> would<00:03:27.549> be<00:03:27.640> awesome<00:03:27.910> if<00:03:28.480> we

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
speculated it would be awesome if we

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.509 
speculated it would be awesome if we
could<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.200> base<00:03:29.440> jump<00:03:29.799> like<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.099> have<00:03:30.250> some

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
could have a base jump like it have some

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.089 
could have a base jump like it have some
sort<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.879> flag<00:03:31.209> or<00:03:31.480> some<00:03:31.660> sort<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.930> spawn<00:03:32.680> up<00:03:32.950> on

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
sort of flag or some sort of spawn up on

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.620 
sort of flag or some sort of spawn up on
top<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.430> waterfall<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.970> could<00:03:34.090> base<00:03:34.299> jump

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
top of the waterfall you could base jump

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.409 
top of the waterfall you could base jump
and<00:03:34.810> take<00:03:35.380> down<00:03:35.620> seif<00:03:36.370> like<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.880> think<00:03:37.269> that

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
and take down seif like I think that

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.720 
and take down seif like I think that
would<00:03:37.569> be<00:03:37.630> awesome<00:03:37.829> but<00:03:38.829> anyway<00:03:39.190> thank<00:03:39.609> you

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
would be awesome but anyway thank you

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.339 
would be awesome but anyway thank you
