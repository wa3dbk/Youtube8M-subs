00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.589
 this is the the e300 once the biggest difference with the d300 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.140
 so that you have a few 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.619
 beats extra or finds a few buttons with a different function 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.160
 the card holder can be opened in a different way, it appears that an extra lock is in front 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.599
 an sd card in addition to compact flash cards also the biggest difference is that 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.279
 you come with the film 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 HD video recording with a photo camera 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.250
 when using the loop you encounter what you need for photography 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.360
 You can use terribly beautiful results while filming this camera 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.410
 for example, you have the option of working with very small depth of field 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 It does take a while for the film to get out of hand 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.620
 there must of course be a large memory card in the camera to be able to 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.850
 filming should be the mirror whipped 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.230
 because otherwise you can not see anything of course you can also not see through it anymore 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.230
 viewfinder but you are on the screen 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.270
 otherwise it is actually all the same as what you are used to during 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.410
 find the shooting cunt without exception focusing by you 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.690
 manually if you photograph by hand or film clips 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.000
 and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.280
 if you use a tripod then you can use autofocus 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.640
 when a film was out of hand, it soon became apparent that the room was not really suitable 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 is to do that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 it is pretty tough especially if you 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.580
 used substantial lenses 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.630
 of static fund that this work is actually much more often 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.930
 On top of that, you also use your hand 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.460
 zoom in submitted 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.400
 free 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.040
 when the rest comes in 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.770
 went knock knock of that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.770
 can continue to disappear 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 That makes it work out of control on a stable 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.070
 these images out of control 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.930
 you also run into a small problem 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.550
 normally with a video camera sitting at the switch to be able to 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.960
 see 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.590
 if you have to do that by hand then sometimes you have to take a pover and that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.869
 don't really make it soma 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.069
 for me as a photographer 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.019
 that is also very personal, I think this camera is certainly not included 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.649
 give added value 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.510
 but i think there is a large group 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.969
 video filmers 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 that get something extra with this camera 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.540
 you have the quality of an SLR camera with the option 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.029
 to make HD video recordings 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.319
 and that combination is very interesting for that group
