what I'm going to show you a little bit
now<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.520> safety<00:00:02.820> because<00:00:03.330> safety<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.840> the

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
now is the safety because safety is the

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.050 
now is the safety because safety is the
number<00:00:04.410> one<00:00:04.440> thing<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.819> need<00:00:05.970> to

understand aside from the mindset when
doing<00:00:08.820> parkour<00:00:09.269> there<00:00:10.110> are<00:00:10.440> different<00:00:10.830> types

doing parkour there are different types

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.770 
doing parkour there are different types
of<00:00:11.190> landing<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.759> rolls<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.330> want<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.660> do

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
of landing and rolls that you want to do

of landing and rolls that you want to do
you<00:00:13.019> want<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.290> learn<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.160> grass<00:00:14.670> on

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
you want to learn it on the grass on

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.560 
you want to learn it on the grass on
gravel<00:00:16.020> cement<00:00:16.710> whatever<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
gravel cement whatever you can do and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.010 
gravel cement whatever you can do and
you<00:00:19.470> want<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.890> try<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.420> as<00:00:21.480> efficiently

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
you want to try and do it as efficiently

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.640 
you want to try and do it as efficiently
as<00:00:22.199> possible<00:00:22.699> another<00:00:23.699> thing<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:25.320> flow

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
as possible another thing is the flow

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.540 
as possible another thing is the flow
with<00:00:26.130> parkour<00:00:27.019> it's<00:00:28.019> not<00:00:28.439> about<00:00:28.800> doing<00:00:29.160> one

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
with parkour it's not about doing one

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.590 
with parkour it's not about doing one
simple<00:00:30.269> movement<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.980> invented<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:33.210> try

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
simple movement it was invented to try

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.459 
simple movement it was invented to try
and<00:00:34.250> do<00:00:35.250> different<00:00:35.850> opposite<00:00:36.630> overcome

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
and do different opposite overcome

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
and do different opposite overcome
different<00:00:37.770> obstacles<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.430> try<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.360> get<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.809> an

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
different obstacles to try to get to an

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.950 
different obstacles to try to get to an
injured<00:00:40.320> person<00:00:40.820> originally<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.719> save

someone<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.440> yourself<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.040> fight-or-flight

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
someone or yourself the fight-or-flight

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.819 
someone or yourself the fight-or-flight
method<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> show<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.620> now

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
method so what I'm going to show you now

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.209 
method so what I'm going to show you now
is<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.219> roll<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.120> important

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
is the roll this is really important

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.260 
is the roll this is really important
there's<00:00:50.219> different<00:00:50.670> techniques<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.090> I'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
there's different techniques but I'll

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.680 
there's different techniques but I'll
show<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:51.750> technique<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.500> today<00:00:53.690> what

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
show you my technique here today what

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
show you my technique here today what
you're<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> practice<00:00:55.860> your

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you're going to do is to practice your

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.590 
you're going to do is to practice your
roll<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:56.969> crash<00:00:57.329> down

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
roll is you're going to just crash down

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.959 
roll is you're going to just crash down
to<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.020> knee<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> use

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to one knee and then you're going to use

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
to one knee and then you're going to use
your<00:01:00.090> hands<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> even<00:01:01.289> roll<00:01:01.559> right

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
your hands and you can even roll right

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.299 
your hands and you can even roll right
on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> side<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.120> your<00:01:03.870> arm<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> most

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
on the side of your arm but the most

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.440 
on the side of your arm but the most
important<00:01:05.790> thing<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> roll<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.299> you're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
important thing in the roll is you're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.050 
important thing in the roll is you're
going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> roll<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.409> shoulder<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
going to roll from one shoulder to the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300 
going to roll from one shoulder to the
opposite<00:01:09.630> hip<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.710> cannot<00:01:10.950> connect

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
opposite hip so that you cannot connect

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.140 
opposite hip so that you cannot connect
any<00:01:11.580> part<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> spine<00:01:13.340> because<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.939> will

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
any part of the spine because this will

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
any part of the spine because this will
cause<00:01:15.299> problems<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:16.020> cement<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.799> grass<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
cause problems on cement on grass and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.320 
cause problems on cement on grass and
other<00:01:17.520> things<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
other things like that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
other things like that
and<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.380> want<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> injure<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.100> spine

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and you do not want to injure your spine
