00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:05.500
 A simple question: Why has our Galaxy been called the Milky Way? 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.160
 The name of our galaxy came directly from the observation. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.140
 Well, our solar system is located on the outskirts of the Milky Way, which makes for a cheerful, 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.100
 moonless night can be seen in the sky an irregular, foggy strip of bright glow interlaced 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.180
 dark stains and streaks, stretching across the sky - maintaining a permanent position among 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.660
 stars and together with the entire sphere taking part in her majestic daily turnover. 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.280
 Observations from different places of the Earth show that this belt crosses the whole sphere of the sky, however it has 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.880
 relatively low brightness and therefore its perception requires good weather conditions, preferably somewhere outside the city. 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.760
 In most Northern Hemisphere countries, the belt is most clearly visible 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.820
 it is late summer and autumn (from June to December), 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.940
 an hour or two after sunset. 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.600
 Then it passes near the zenith and almost perpendicular to the horizon. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 The belt achieves the largest width and maximum brightness in Sagittarius. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.520
 For the ancients, the discussed glow was an inseparable fragment of the sky sphere. 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.560
 Some saw in it a crack in a torn sphere with a sky beyond the sphere of the sky, 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.120
 but in most cultures it was a fragment of the sky - the scene on which the mythological events took place. 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.220
 As you know, the ancients tried to explain things that they do not fully understand by creating myths. 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.260
 The Milky Way is a simple translation of the Greek galaxies, 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.400
 which comes from the word gala meaning milk and was associated with the myth of the born of Hercules. 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 It should be mentioned that not in all regions of the world, our Galaxy is called and was the Milky Way. 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.760
 The Chinese name, the Silver River, is used in East Asia, including Korea and Japan. 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.200
 In Sweden it was called the Winter Road, because the stars in the Milky Way galaxy were used to predict the coming winter. 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.320
