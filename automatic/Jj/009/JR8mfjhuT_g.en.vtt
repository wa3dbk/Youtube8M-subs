00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.570 
this is bigger than a 30 centimeter
expose<00:04:37.520> figure<00:04:37.850> like<00:04:38.750> God's<00:04:39.050> Giants<00:04:39.500> yeah<00:04:40.340> we

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
expose figure like God's Giants yeah we

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.700 
expose figure like God's Giants yeah we
have<00:04:40.670> a<00:04:40.700> yellow<00:04:41.060> raptor<00:04:41.540> right<00:04:41.720> here<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.260> then

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
have a yellow raptor right here and then

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.290 
have a yellow raptor right here and then
we<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.980> a<00:04:43.010> greenish<00:04:43.460> out<00:04:43.760> there<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.120> then<00:04:44.210> we

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
we have a greenish out there and then we

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.810 
we have a greenish out there and then we
have<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.510> light<00:04:44.900> beam<00:04:45.140> that<00:04:45.350> there<00:04:45.700> now<00:04:46.700> if<00:04:46.760> we

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
have a light beam that there now if we

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.100 
have a light beam that there now if we
go<00:04:46.970> down<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.210> see<00:04:49.270> more<00:04:50.270> stuff<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.840> looks<00:04:50.990> like

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
go down we see more stuff it looks like

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.650 
go down we see more stuff it looks like
it's<00:04:51.290> Pteranodon<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.130> a<00:04:52.160> helicopter<00:04:52.660> and

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
it's Pteranodon and a helicopter and

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.330 
it's Pteranodon and a helicopter and
let's<00:04:53.870> how<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:53.990> helicopter<00:04:54.560> has<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.740> shooting

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
let's how the helicopter has a shooting

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.000 
let's how the helicopter has a shooting
thing<00:04:55.580> so<00:04:56.570> this<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.170> probably<00:04:57.590> supposed<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.950> be

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
thing so this is probably supposed to be

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.190 
thing so this is probably supposed to be
enough<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.460> see<00:04:58.669> whenever<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:59.090> Tran<00:04:59.930> Don's

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
enough to see whenever the Tran Don's

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.080 
enough to see whenever the Tran Don's
were<00:05:00.410> like<00:05:00.680> striking<00:05:01.160> on<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> helicopter

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
were like striking on the helicopter

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.260 
were like striking on the helicopter
probably<00:05:02.450> most<00:05:03.380> likely<00:05:03.590> next<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:05.000> an

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
probably most likely next is an

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.110 
probably most likely next is an
incredibly<00:05:06.200> blurry<00:05:06.560> image<00:05:07.070> or<00:05:07.430> blurred<00:05:07.760> image
