a quick trick to do it in a couple of

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.940 
a quick trick to do it in a couple of
seconds<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.170> good<00:00:10.320> thing<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.769> in

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
seconds it's a good thing to have in

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.709 
seconds it's a good thing to have in
your<00:00:10.980> back<00:00:11.190> pocket<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> whole

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
your back pocket so this is the whole

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.970 
your back pocket so this is the whole
exam<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.200> you're<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.469> cover<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
exam and you're going to cover the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.189 
exam and you're going to cover the
medial<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:15.000> honor<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.570> radial<00:00:15.960> nerves

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
medial the honor and the radial nerves

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.609 
medial the honor and the radial nerves
that's<00:00:16.529> c5<00:00:17.039> through<00:00:17.070> t1<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.300> total<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.470> this

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
that's c5 through t1 in total and this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.500 
that's c5 through t1 in total and this
is<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.010> whole<00:00:20.160> exam<00:00:20.460> that's<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.970> right<00:00:21.180> there

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
is the whole exam that's it right there

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.150 
is the whole exam that's it right there
so<00:00:21.630> let's<00:00:21.779> just<00:00:21.900> go<00:00:22.020> through<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.350> quickly<00:00:22.529> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
so let's just go through this quickly so

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.370 
so let's just go through this quickly so
first<00:00:23.730> off<00:00:23.939> let's<00:00:24.240> go<00:00:24.539> through<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> sensory

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
first off let's go through the sensory

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620 
first off let's go through the sensory
nerve<00:00:26.070> distribution<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.910> each<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:27.420> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
nerve distribution of each of these so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.150 
nerve distribution of each of these so
here's<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> median<00:00:28.289> nerve<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> review

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
here's the median nerve just as a review

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.820 
here's the median nerve just as a review
so<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> palmar<00:00:31.170> side<00:00:31.470> in

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so it's going to be the palmar side in

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.280 
so it's going to be the palmar side in
the<00:00:32.250> first<00:00:32.520> second<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:32.910> third<00:00:33.180> digit<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the first second and third digit this is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.930 
the first second and third digit this is
the<00:00:34.380> sensory<00:00:34.739> distribution<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> ulnar

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the sensory distribution of the ulnar

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
the sensory distribution of the ulnar
nerve<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.809> all<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> fifth<00:00:37.350> digit<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
nerve so it's all the fifth digit and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
nerve so it's all the fifth digit and
then<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.100> half<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> fourth<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.750> that's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
then about half of the fourth and that's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.290 
then about half of the fourth and that's
both<00:00:40.140> both<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> dorsal<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> Palmer<00:00:41.879> side

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
both both the dorsal and the Palmer side

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
both both the dorsal and the Palmer side
of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> hand<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.800> lastly<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
of the hand and then lastly we have the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.430 
of the hand and then lastly we have the
sensory<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> radial<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> going

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
sensory of the radial and this is going

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
sensory of the radial and this is going
to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> dorsal<00:00:47.309> side<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> hand

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to be on the dorsal side of the hand

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.029 
to be on the dorsal side of the hand
covers<00:00:48.690> most<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> hand

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
covers most of the back of the hand

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.580 
covers most of the back of the hand
except<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> fifth<00:00:51.600> digit<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
except for the fifth digit which is the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
except for the fifth digit which is the
honor<00:00:52.860> which<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.520> discussed<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
honor which we just discussed now the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840 
honor which we just discussed now the
motor<00:00:54.960> nerve<00:00:55.469> exam<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.309> let's<00:00:56.430> start<00:00:56.610> off<00:00:56.730> with

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
motor nerve exam so let's start off with

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
motor nerve exam so let's start off with
the<00:00:56.969> median<00:00:57.300> nerve<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.079> make<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> ring

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the median nerve have them make a ring

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
the median nerve have them make a ring
with<00:00:58.949> their<00:00:59.219> first<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.969> second<00:01:00.420> finger<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
with their first and second finger and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.000 
with their first and second finger and
you're<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> try<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> break<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> ring<00:01:01.829> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you're going to try to break the ring so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.319 
you're going to try to break the ring so
you<00:01:02.070> tell<00:01:02.250> them<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> hold<00:01:02.609> their<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> try

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you tell them to hold their and you try

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
you tell them to hold their and you try
to<00:01:03.390> break<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> ring<00:01:03.899> apart<00:01:04.170> that'll<00:01:04.860> test<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
to break the ring apart that'll test the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
to break the ring apart that'll test the
median<00:01:05.610> nerve<00:01:05.850> next<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> ulnar

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
median nerve next we have the ulnar

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.570 
median nerve next we have the ulnar
nerve<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.950> you're<00:01:08.189> gonna<00:01:08.280> have

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
nerve and this one you're gonna have

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
nerve and this one you're gonna have
them<00:01:08.909> spread<00:01:09.390> their<00:01:09.420> fingers<00:01:09.840> apart<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
them spread their fingers apart and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
them spread their fingers apart and
you're<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> abduct<00:01:11.580> against

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you're going to abduct against

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.520 
you're going to abduct against
resistance<00:01:12.600> you're<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> try<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> close

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
resistance you're going to try to close

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.750 
resistance you're going to try to close
it<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> you're<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> tell<00:01:14.280> them<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> hold

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it and you're going to tell them to hold

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.640 
it and you're going to tell them to hold
it<00:01:14.939> hold<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.080> try<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> close

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it hold it and have them try to close

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
it hold it and have them try to close
their<00:01:16.830> hand<00:01:16.860> against<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> last<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.720> have

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
their hand against you and last we have

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.300 
their hand against you and last we have
the<00:01:18.869> radial<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> be

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the radial and this is going to be

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.149 
the radial and this is going to be
dorsiflexion<00:01:21.210> against<00:01:22.140> resistance<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.830> one

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
dorsiflexion against resistance and one

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.530 
dorsiflexion against resistance and one
other<00:01:23.250> way<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> remember<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
other way to remember that one is you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.270 
other way to remember that one is you
think<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> radial<00:01:25.259> nerve<00:01:25.409> palsy<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:26.040> wrist

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
think of radial nerve palsy is wrist

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
think of radial nerve palsy is wrist
drop<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.509> an<00:01:27.600> examination

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
drop so here you can see an examination

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
drop so here you can see an examination
is<00:01:28.380> trying<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> dorsiflex<00:01:29.280> their<00:01:29.460> hand<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
is trying to dorsiflex their hand and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
is trying to dorsiflex their hand and
they're<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.090> able<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> radial

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
they're not able to and that's a radial

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
they're not able to and that's a radial
nerve<00:01:31.979> palsy<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:33.000> here's<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.420> last<00:01:33.540> little

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
nerve palsy now here's one last little

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.690 
nerve palsy now here's one last little
trick<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.320> actually<00:01:34.740> make<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> these

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
trick you can actually make all of these

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.210 
trick you can actually make all of these
three<00:01:35.970> movements<00:01:36.150> into<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.110> motion<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.860> test

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
three movements into one motion to test

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.800 
three movements into one motion to test
all<00:01:38.400> three<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> nerves<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.630> have

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
all three of the nerves so if you have

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
all three of the nerves so if you have
them<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.130> okay<00:01:41.520> sign<00:01:41.850> then

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
them do you kind of okay sign then

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780 
them do you kind of okay sign then
spread<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> third<00:01:43.470> fourth<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:43.979> fifth<00:01:44.100> apart

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
spread the third fourth and fifth apart

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.149 
spread the third fourth and fifth apart
and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.930> dorsiflex<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.799> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and then have them dorsiflex up that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.889 
and then have them dorsiflex up that
actually<00:01:47.430> tests<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.479> right<00:01:48.720> here

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
actually tests all of them so right here

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.420 
actually tests all of them so right here
we<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> median<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> kind

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
we have the median right that's the kind

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.580 
we have the median right that's the kind
of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> okay<00:01:50.939> sign<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.049> them<00:01:52.259> spread

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
of the okay sign you have them spread

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
of the okay sign you have them spread
their<00:01:52.619> fingers<00:01:53.009> apart<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> ulnar<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
their fingers apart that's the ulnar and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.630 
their fingers apart that's the ulnar and
then<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.020> Dorsey<00:01:55.500> flex<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
then if they Dorsey flex up that's the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.100 
then if they Dorsey flex up that's the
radio<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.360> them<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.930> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
radio so if you have them just do that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200 
radio so if you have them just do that
one<00:01:58.500> motion<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.219> actually<00:01:59.579> tests<00:01:59.820> all<00:01:59.939> three

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
one motion that actually tests all three

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.179 
one motion that actually tests all three
even<00:02:00.719> better<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.290> here's<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.920> free<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
even better so here's just this free to

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.520 
even better so here's just this free to
remember<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.450> kind<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.899> okay<00:02:04.290> sign

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
remember the kind of the okay sign

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.350 
remember the kind of the okay sign
breaks<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.159> ring<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.880> medial<00:02:06.210> nerve

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
breaks the ring that's the medial nerve

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.999 
breaks the ring that's the medial nerve
spread<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> fingers<00:02:07.200> apart<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
spread the fingers apart that's the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.490 
spread the fingers apart that's the
honor<00:02:08.220> nerve<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.300> basically<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
honor nerve and then basically what I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.089 
honor nerve and then basically what I
call<00:02:10.679> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> stop<00:02:11.280> sign<00:02:11.550> or

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
call kind of a stop sign or

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.559 
call kind of a stop sign or
dorsiflexed<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.939> hand<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
dorsiflexed a in the hand that's the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.839 
dorsiflexed a in the hand that's the
radio<00:02:13.959> or<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.799> can<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.159> them<00:02:15.280> all<00:02:15.489> at<00:02:15.670> once

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
radio or you can do them all at once

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.699 
radio or you can do them all at once
with<00:02:16.269> this<00:02:16.420> motion<00:02:16.659> so<00:02:17.079> that's<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.409> wrap<00:02:17.560> in

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
with this motion so that's the wrap in

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.470 
with this motion so that's the wrap in
your<00:02:17.859> hand<00:02:18.280> exam<00:02:18.609> and<00:02:18.849> here's<00:02:19.299> some
