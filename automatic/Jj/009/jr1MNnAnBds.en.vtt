00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.309 

so<00:00:00.179> today<00:00:00.450> we're<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.840> be<00:00:00.900> building<00:00:01.170> the

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
so today we're going to be building the

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.949 
so today we're going to be building the
simple<00:00:01.740> and<00:00:01.860> quick<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.429> shoe<00:00:03.120> rack<00:00:03.360> it's<00:00:03.689> very

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
simple and quick a shoe rack it's very

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.840 
simple and quick a shoe rack it's very
easy<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.319> build<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.950> can<00:00:04.980> use<00:00:05.250> scrap<00:00:05.549> wood<00:00:05.730> to

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
easy to build you can use scrap wood to

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.980 
easy to build you can use scrap wood to
do<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.420> can<00:00:06.509> go<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> whatever

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
do it and you can go to whatever

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.990 
do it and you can go to whatever
dimensions<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.770> want<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.550> that's<00:00:08.700> going<00:00:08.910> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
dimensions you want so that's going to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.630 
dimensions you want so that's going to
shop<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.630> start<00:00:09.870> them

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.880 

why<00:00:19.120> did<00:00:19.390> was<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:19.780> is<00:00:19.900> cause<00:00:20.170> tree<00:00:20.560> of<00:00:20.710> these

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
why did was it is cause tree of these

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.850 
why did was it is cause tree of these
blocks<00:00:21.250> for<00:00:21.820> each<00:00:21.850> side<00:00:22.360> of<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.260> pieces<00:00:23.680> near

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
blocks for each side of the pieces near

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.090 
blocks for each side of the pieces near
the<00:00:23.950> way<00:00:24.100> I'd<00:00:24.310> recommend<00:00:24.850> assembler<00:00:25.600> as<00:00:26.100> first

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
the way I'd recommend assembler as first

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.340 
the way I'd recommend assembler as first
of<00:00:27.250> all<00:00:27.340> I'll<00:00:27.430> just<00:00:27.460> get<00:00:27.790> your<00:00:27.970> four<00:00:28.540> corner<00:00:29.080> so

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
of all I'll just get your four corner so

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.010 
of all I'll just get your four corner so
get<00:00:29.770> your<00:00:29.980> two<00:00:30.130> pieces<00:00:30.310> screw<00:00:31.270> either<00:00:31.540> end<00:00:31.810> and

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
get your two pieces screw either end and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.690 
get your two pieces screw either end and
then<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.590> can<00:00:32.740> just<00:00:32.890> separate<00:00:33.400> the<00:00:33.520> gap

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
then you can just separate the gap

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.340 
then you can just separate the gap
between<00:00:33.910> them<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.330> make<00:00:34.720> sure<00:00:34.750> to<00:00:35.020> square

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
between them and make sure to square

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.560 
between them and make sure to square
another<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.950> just<00:00:36.270> really<00:00:37.270> make<00:00:37.420> sure

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
another and just really make sure

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.820 
another and just really make sure
they're<00:00:37.720> flat<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.080> bottom<00:00:38.350> numbers<00:00:38.650> using

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
they're flat the bottom numbers using

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.260 
they're flat the bottom numbers using
our<00:00:39.100> piece<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.430> wood<00:00:39.550> here<00:00:39.790> just<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.090> make<00:00:40.239> sure

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
our piece of wood here just to make sure

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.330 
our piece of wood here just to make sure
and<00:00:40.900> just<00:00:41.230> do<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:41.800> then<00:00:41.920> just<00:00:41.950> screw

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
and just do that and then just screw

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.740 
and just do that and then just screw
them<00:00:42.460> all<00:00:42.610> in<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.059> can<00:00:43.210> use<00:00:43.360> glue<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:43.720> can

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
them all in and you can use glue you can

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.290 
them all in and you can use glue you can
use<00:00:43.900> nails<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:45.370> could<00:00:45.550> crack<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:45.820> if<00:00:46.030> you<00:00:46.120> want

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
use nails you could crack it if you want

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.400 
use nails you could crack it if you want
to<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.570> can<00:00:46.690> do<00:00:46.780> loads<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.110> different<00:00:47.230> things

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
to you can do loads of different things

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.799 
to you can do loads of different things
but<00:00:47.770> it's<00:00:47.950> just<00:00:48.100> what<00:00:48.309> I'm<00:00:48.370> doing<00:00:48.910> it's<00:00:49.180> just<00:00:49.660> a

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
but it's just what I'm doing it's just a

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.390 
but it's just what I'm doing it's just a
simple<00:00:50.170> project<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.770> I'm<00:00:50.860> keeping<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.310> as

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
simple project so I'm keeping it as

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.980 
simple project so I'm keeping it as
simple<00:00:51.670> as<00:00:51.820> possible<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.329> one<00:00:52.510> I've<00:00:52.660> already

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
simple as possible the one I've already

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.740 
simple as possible the one I've already
completed<00:00:53.230> is<00:00:53.590> underneath<00:00:54.040> then<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.090> side<00:00:55.329> so

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
completed is underneath then the side so

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.900 
completed is underneath then the side so
now<00:00:55.960> we've<00:00:56.200> done<00:00:56.410> is<00:00:56.500> I've<00:00:56.620> clamped<00:00:56.829> two<00:00:57.130> ends

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
now we've done is I've clamped two ends

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.490 
now we've done is I've clamped two ends
up<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.270> then<00:00:58.360> just<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.660> middles<00:00:58.989> are<00:00:59.200> sitting

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
up and then just the middles are sitting

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.260 
up and then just the middles are sitting
here<00:00:59.530> I'm<00:01:00.220> I'm<00:01:00.400> good<00:01:00.579> just<00:01:00.610> with<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.030> next

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
here I'm I'm good just with the next

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.729 
here I'm I'm good just with the next
piece<00:01:01.390> on<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.900> to<00:01:01.989> make<00:01:02.110> sure<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.380> exact

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
piece on just to make sure the exact

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.280 
piece on just to make sure the exact
same<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.730> probably<00:01:03.880> just<00:01:04.089> clean<00:01:04.390> up<00:01:04.420> both

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
same and I probably just clean up both

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.350 
same and I probably just clean up both
of<00:01:05.320> these<00:01:05.530> sides<00:01:05.860> at<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.340> ends<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.850> my<00:01:07.030> table

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
of these sides at the ends on my table

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.820 
of these sides at the ends on my table
saw<00:01:07.509> once<00:01:07.720> I'm<00:01:07.869> done<00:01:08.020> just<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.320> make<00:01:08.380> sure<00:01:08.649> the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
saw once I'm done just to make sure the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.530 
saw once I'm done just to make sure the
ends<00:01:09.070> are<00:01:09.160> flat<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.460> everything<00:01:09.700> so<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.450> can

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
ends are flat and everything so you can

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.969 
ends are flat and everything so you can
actually<00:01:10.690> leave<00:01:10.990> these<00:01:11.259> long<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:11.770> steady

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
actually leave these long and steady

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.680 
actually leave these long and steady
wider<00:01:12.369> than<00:01:12.610> cutting<00:01:12.850> them<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.060> length<00:01:13.210> and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
wider than cutting them to length and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.050 
wider than cutting them to length and
then<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.649> cut<00:01:14.830> them<00:01:15.009> haffley<00:01:15.430> of<00:01:15.520> assembly

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
then just cut them haffley of assembly

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:24.969 
then just cut them haffley of assembly
that<00:01:16.300> might<00:01:16.509> actually<00:01:16.630> be<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.899> bit<00:01:17.050> easier

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.070 

the<00:01:25.369> way<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.520> recommend<00:01:25.790> assembling<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.750> is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
the way I recommend assembling this is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.890 
the way I recommend assembling this is
do<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> slap<00:01:28.280> at<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.490> top<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.299> two<00:01:29.509> wide

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
do a slap at the top and the two wide

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.870 
do a slap at the top and the two wide
ones<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.470> bottom<00:01:30.619> nice<00:01:31.250> enough<00:01:31.520> put<00:01:31.759> them

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
ones on the bottom nice enough put them

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.039 
ones on the bottom nice enough put them
on<00:01:32.000> there<00:01:32.180> I'm<00:01:32.270> keeping<00:01:32.570> this<00:01:32.659> one<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.869> bit

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
on there I'm keeping this one a bit

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.170 
on there I'm keeping this one a bit
shorter<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.130> then<00:01:34.580> just<00:01:34.759> fill<00:01:34.939> in<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.060> rest

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
shorter and then just fill in the rest

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.420 
shorter and then just fill in the rest
start<00:01:35.990> from<00:01:36.110> your<00:01:36.259> bottom<00:01:36.439> unlock<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.280> whale

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
start from your bottom unlock the whale

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.820 
start from your bottom unlock the whale
because<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.360> way<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:39.140> won't<00:01:39.320> be<00:01:39.470> one<00:01:39.619> matter

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
because that way you won't be one matter

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.529 
because that way you won't be one matter

project<00:01:47.509> I<00:01:47.960> didn't<00:01:48.380> actually<00:01:48.560> sign<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.039> piece

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
project I didn't actually sign the piece

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.190 
project I didn't actually sign the piece
at<00:01:49.520> all<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.909> just<00:01:50.240> kind<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.810> kind<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.080> rough

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
at all I just kind of to kind of rough

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.929 
at all I just kind of to kind of rough
and<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.500> think<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.710> was<00:01:51.860> kind<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.100> nice<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:52.549> to

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
and I think it was kind of nice but to

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.279 
and I think it was kind of nice but to
be<00:01:53.060> honest<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.330> is<00:01:53.479> just<00:01:53.840> due<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.140> my

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
be honest that is just due to my

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.440 
be honest that is just due to my
laziness<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:55.430> painting<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:55.970> great<00:01:56.180> in<00:01:56.330> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
laziness but painting is great in the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.910 
laziness but painting is great in the
sense<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.140> could<00:01:57.259> use<00:01:57.619> three<00:01:57.830> different

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
sense that I could use three different

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.279 
sense that I could use three different
types<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.490> wood<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.690> all<00:01:59.869> came<00:02:00.080> together

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
types of wood and it all came together

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.930 
types of wood and it all came together
grandma<00:02:00.950> all<00:02:01.069> looks<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.369> same

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
grandma all looks the same

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.760 
grandma all looks the same
usually<00:02:02.390> I'm<00:02:02.479> not<00:02:02.509> much<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.319> person<00:02:03.649> for

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
usually I'm not much of a person for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.649 
usually I'm not much of a person for
paint<00:02:03.979> wood<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:04.580> in<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.789> case<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.240> all<00:02:05.420> was

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
paint wood but in this case it all was

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.270 
paint wood but in this case it all was
the<00:02:05.869> right<00:02:06.229> solution<00:02:06.380> because<00:02:06.920> they<00:02:07.009> had<00:02:07.130> to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
the right solution because they had to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.279 
the right solution because they had to
use<00:02:07.399> up<00:02:07.429> some<00:02:07.789> scrap<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.750> hope<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.019> enjoyed

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
use up some scrap so I hope you enjoyed
