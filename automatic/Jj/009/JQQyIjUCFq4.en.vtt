so that's all we do at first
then<00:00:34.840> we<00:00:35.620> got<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:35.860> go<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:35.980> view

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
then we got to go to view

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.730 
then we got to go to view

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.760 

then<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.720> minimize<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.380> make<00:01:07.620> sure

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
then we have to minimize this make sure

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.910 
then we have to minimize this make sure
you<00:01:07.860> minimize<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.560> we<00:01:10.560> need<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you minimize this because we need this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.720 
you minimize this because we need this
for<00:01:11.100> later<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.700> yeah

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
for later this yeah

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.990 
for later this yeah
just<00:01:14.330> drag<00:01:14.570> this<00:01:14.660> over<00:01:14.810> here

plane<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:37.040> have<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.310> track<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:37.790> down

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
plane we have to track this down

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.700 
plane we have to track this down
nice<00:01:39.650> pad<00:01:39.950> okay<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.180> is<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.360> cool<00:01:42.110> part<00:01:42.140> you

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
nice pad okay this is the cool part you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.780 
nice pad okay this is the cool part you
have<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.890> go<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.070> subdivide<00:01:43.580> then

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
have to go to subdivide then

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.300 
have to go to subdivide then
that

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.590 
that
so<00:01:46.970> click<00:01:47.299> subdivide<00:01:47.899> twice

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.050 

up<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.320> shape<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.860> around<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.820> car

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
up to do is shape it around the car

up to do is shape it around the car
doesn't<00:01:53.900> have<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.080> be<00:01:54.200> perfect

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.460 
doesn't have to be perfect
it's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.530 

but<00:01:58.830> it's<00:01:58.980> just<00:01:59.190> all

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.609 

tutorial<00:02:04.440> so

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.870 

how<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.159> a<00:02:09.310> trace<00:02:09.670> this

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
how to a trace this

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.400 
how to a trace this
make<00:02:12.450> sure<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.720> don't<00:02:12.900> get<00:02:12.990> any<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.260> these

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
make sure you don't get any of these

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
make sure you don't get any of these
shadow<00:02:13.770> type<00:02:14.100> things<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.580> who<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.330> other

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
shadow type things so who the other

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:38.020 
shadow type things so who the other
dad's<00:02:15.750> dad<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.260> make<00:02:16.380> sure<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.270 

so<00:02:38.630> what<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.810> could<00:02:38.930> do<00:02:39.020> for<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.350> part<00:02:39.620> we

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
so what we could do for this part we

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.990 
so what we could do for this part we
select<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:40.940> tool<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:42.370> line<00:02:43.370> tool<00:02:43.790> right

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
select this tool the line tool right

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.809 
select this tool the line tool right
here

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
here

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.849 
here
and<00:02:45.420> then<00:02:45.719> we<00:02:46.579> right<00:02:47.579> click<00:02:47.909> on<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.659> line<00:02:48.930> must

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
and then we right click on a line must

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.250 
and then we right click on a line must
be<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:50.670> extrude<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.019> makes

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
be and then extrude this so that makes

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.800 
be and then extrude this so that makes
like<00:02:52.530> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.380 

subdivide<00:03:01.810> subdivide

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
subdivide subdivide

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.000 
subdivide subdivide
speak<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.200> then<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.830> select

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
speak like this then you have to select

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.980 
speak like this then you have to select
a<00:03:05.220> dot<00:03:05.430> tool<00:03:05.670> again<00:03:06.560> select<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.830> rich<00:03:08.520> g

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
a dot tool again select that rich g

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.870 
a dot tool again select that rich g
doesn't<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.800> be<00:03:10.920> perfect<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.760> could

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
doesn't have to be perfect so it could

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.280 
doesn't have to be perfect so it could
cover<00:03:12.060> some<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.450> wheel<00:03:12.630> up

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
cover some of the wheel up
