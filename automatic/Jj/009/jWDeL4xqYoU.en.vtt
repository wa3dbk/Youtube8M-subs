taking a picture of your students as a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880 
taking a picture of your students as a
class<00:01:39.030> maybe<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> sign<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.650> made

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
class maybe with a sign that they made

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.370 
class maybe with a sign that they made
maybe<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.659> would<00:01:42.810> look<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:43.200> nice

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
maybe not but that would look very nice

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.149 
maybe not but that would look very nice
on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> cover<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.729> bake<00:01:45.030> sale<00:01:45.299> flyer<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
on the cover of the bake sale flyer and

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.889 
on the cover of the bake sale flyer and
then<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.430> also<00:01:47.939> thought<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> might<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> nice

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
then I also thought it might be a nice

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
then I also thought it might be a nice
idea<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> secondary<00:01:50.280> picture<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
idea to have a secondary picture and the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.530 
idea to have a secondary picture and the
secondary<00:01:51.390> picture<00:01:51.869> could<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:53.540> picture

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
secondary picture could be a picture

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.139 
secondary picture could be a picture
that<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> take<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.040> website<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that you take from the website of the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.530 
that you take from the website of the
NAM<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.840> nonprofit<00:01:58.619> organization<00:01:59.540> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
NAM the nonprofit organization that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.620 
NAM the nonprofit organization that
might<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> nice<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.590> nice<00:02:02.299> addition<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
might be a nice a nice addition to the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.900 
might be a nice a nice addition to the
flyer<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.619> okay<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.190> let's<00:02:08.550> start

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
flyer so that's it okay so let's start

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.040 
flyer so that's it okay so let's start
with

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
with

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.980 
with
you<00:02:10.200> actually<00:02:10.740> format<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.580> flyer<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.360> think

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you actually format this flyer I think

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.890 
you actually format this flyer I think
it's<00:02:13.140> probably<00:02:13.410> best<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.540> change

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's probably best if you if we change

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.780 
it's probably best if you if we change
this<00:02:16.230> flyer<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.920> make<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.280> little<00:02:17.430> bit<00:02:17.610> more
