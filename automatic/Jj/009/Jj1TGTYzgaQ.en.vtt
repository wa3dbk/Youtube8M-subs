00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
everybody I'm da mix makes me DIY calm

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.110 
everybody I'm da mix makes me DIY calm
in<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.920> video<00:00:11.250> let<00:00:11.430> me<00:00:11.520> show<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.760> how<00:00:12.059> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
in this video let me show you how to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.529 
in this video let me show you how to
replace<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.200> regular<00:00:14.100> 3-way<00:00:14.820> switch<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
replace a regular 3-way switch the

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.859 
replace a regular 3-way switch the
regular<00:00:15.870> table<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.770> light<00:00:17.280> in<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.840> to<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
regular table for the light in here to a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.980 
regular table for the light in here to a
dimmable<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.550> basically<00:00:21.360> it's<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.900> to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
dimmable one is basically it's going to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.050 
dimmable one is basically it's going to
be<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.380> same<00:00:22.619> way<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.790> know<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
be the same way you know it's a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.240 
be the same way you know it's a
three-way<00:00:24.450> so<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.870> have<00:00:25.020> two<00:00:25.710> two<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.040> these

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
three-way so we do have two two of these

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.590 
three-way so we do have two two of these
switches<00:00:26.520> one<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.120> other<00:00:27.210> side<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.450> the

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
switches one on the other side of the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.360 
switches one on the other side of the
room<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.020> this<00:00:28.200> side<00:00:28.260> room<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.220> one

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
room on this side room but it's one

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.400 
room on this side room but it's one
we're<00:00:29.550> only<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> make<00:00:30.180> this<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.260> is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
we're only going to make this one is

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
we're only going to make this one is
dimmable<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.920> now<00:00:32.160> both<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.300> there<00:00:33.750> are

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
dimmable and now both of them there are

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.010 
dimmable and now both of them there are
switches<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.870> do<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
switches out there that you can do that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.210 
switches out there that you can do that
with<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.980> honestly<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.789> pass<00:00:39.030> experience

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
with but honestly in pass experience

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.220 
with but honestly in pass experience
they<00:00:41.220> don't<00:00:41.370> work<00:00:41.520> together<00:00:41.700> too<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.150> as<00:00:43.020> far

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
they don't work together too well as far

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.620 
they don't work together too well as far
as<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> dimming<00:00:43.740> goes<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> experience

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
as the dimming goes of what I experience

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.050 
as the dimming goes of what I experience
so<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.500> oh<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.400> only<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> didn't

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
so I'm like oh the only one I didn't

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.130 
so I'm like oh the only one I didn't
light<00:00:48.150> how<00:00:48.270> many<00:00:48.450> times<00:00:48.630> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.900> to<00:00:48.930> dim<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
light how many times you want to dim it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560 
light how many times you want to dim it
you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.470> so<00:00:50.460> we're<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.450> we

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you know so we're going to do this we

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.150 
you know so we're going to do this we
take<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.170> apart<00:00:52.649> I'm<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.100> show

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
take this one apart I'm going to show

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.950 
take this one apart I'm going to show
you<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.310> to<00:00:53.340> wire<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.000> although<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.810> would

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you how to wire it although you would

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.160 
you how to wire it although you would
think<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.350> wired<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.100> same<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.110> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
think it's wired the same and it kind of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.799 
think it's wired the same and it kind of
is<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.130> looks<00:00:59.309> really<00:01:00.210> different<00:01:00.360> so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
is but it looks really different so

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:11.570 
is but it looks really different so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
got the Italian make sure the electric

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649 
got the Italian make sure the electric
is<00:01:16.440> off<00:01:16.650> hopefully<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> didn't<00:01:17.760> get<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.270> far

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
is off hopefully you didn't get this far

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.320 
is off hopefully you didn't get this far
and<00:01:19.049> learn<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> logic<00:01:20.130> still<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and learn that the logic still on so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.520 
and learn that the logic still on so
make<00:01:21.510> sure<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.720> turn<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:21.930> electric<00:01:22.320> off

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
make sure you turn the electric off

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.930 
make sure you turn the electric off
definitely<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.250> something<00:01:23.520> played<00:01:23.760> you

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
definitely not something played you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
don't want to get shot makes you do

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.730 
don't want to get shot makes you do
funky<00:01:26.190> things<00:01:26.490> okay<00:01:26.880> anyway<00:01:27.690> so<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
funky things okay anyway so here the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.300 
funky things okay anyway so here the
wine

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
wine

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490 
wine
now<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.450> one's<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:30.960> complicated

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
now this one's not as complicated

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
now this one's not as complicated
looking<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.640> said<00:01:32.880> there's<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
looking because like said there's a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.130 
looking because like said there's a
couple<00:01:33.330> different<00:01:33.690> ways<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.900> doing<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
couple different ways of doing a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
couple different ways of doing a
three-way<00:01:34.470> switch<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> don't<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.580> lot

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
three-way switch so you don't have a lot

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.850 
three-way switch so you don't have a lot
of<00:01:35.820> wire<00:01:36.060> stuffed<00:01:36.510> in<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.560> have

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of wire stuffed in here but we do have

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.630 
of wire stuffed in here but we do have
our<00:01:38.280> three<00:01:39.240> wire<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.900> our<00:01:40.170> ground<00:01:40.640> white

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
our three wire which is our ground white

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.410 
our three wire which is our ground white
wire<00:01:41.850> red<00:01:42.180> wire

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
wire red wire

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.410 
wire red wire
the<00:01:42.780> black<00:01:42.990> wire<00:01:43.520> translated<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:44.670> two

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the black wire translated our two

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
the black wire translated our two
travelers<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.860> other<00:01:47.100> words<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.400> common

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
travelers and in other words a common

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.630 
travelers and in other words a common
now<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> switch<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.650> a<00:01:49.770> black<00:01:50.130> screw

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
now in this switch we have a black screw

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.120 
now in this switch we have a black screw
now<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.570> doing<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> 3-way<00:01:52.290> 4-way<00:01:52.650> circus

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
now are we doing a 3-way 4-way circus

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.850 
now are we doing a 3-way 4-way circus
the<00:01:53.549> black<00:01:53.790> screw<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:55.080> important<00:01:55.740> okay

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the black screw is very important okay

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
the black screw is very important okay
that's<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.970> one<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> pay<00:01:57.600> attention
