00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
pretty quickly after that too I think

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.069 
pretty quickly after that too I think
there's<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> fifth<00:00:51.719> batt<00:00:51.870> back

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
there's going to be a fifth batt back

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.060 
there's going to be a fifth batt back
i've<00:00:52.199> always<00:00:52.469> thought<00:00:52.500> there's<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> be

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
i've always thought there's going to be

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
i've always thought there's going to be
a<00:00:53.129> fifth<00:00:53.340> map<00:00:53.550> pack<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.910> black<00:00:54.090> ops<00:00:54.239> 2<00:00:54.449> because

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
a fifth map pack for black ops 2 because

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.049 
a fifth map pack for black ops 2 because
it's<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> coding<00:00:55.620> block<00:00:56.129> ups<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's in the coding block ups to the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's in the coding block ups to the
fifth<00:00:57.300> map<00:00:57.510> pack<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.050> there<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> i<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
fifth map pack is there so i think that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
fifth map pack is there so i think that
there<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.160> fifth<00:01:02.460> map<00:01:02.670> pack<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
there will be a fifth map pack will it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
there will be a fifth map pack will it
be<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.400> could<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.580> be

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
be this I don't know they could just be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330 
be this I don't know they could just be
kind<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.060> trolling<00:01:06.420> us<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.869> teasing<00:01:07.200> us<00:01:07.590> saying

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340

more zombie or related tweets so could
it<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> fifth<00:01:20.580> map<00:01:20.880> pack<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:23.040> are

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it be a fifth map pack if it is what are

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.080 
it be a fifth map pack if it is what are
we<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> see<00:01:24.030> now<00:01:25.340> excavation<00:01:26.340> sounds

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
we going to see now excavation sounds

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
we going to see now excavation sounds
like<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> zombie<00:01:27.930> map<00:01:28.110> pack<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.560> me<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
like a zombie map pack to me like the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
like a zombie map pack to me like the
excavation<00:01:30.329> site<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:30.960> origins<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> know

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
excavation site from origins you know

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
excavation site from origins you know
something<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> sounds<00:01:33.780> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
something like that but it sounds like

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.060 
something like that but it sounds like
it<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.200> off<00:01:34.650> along<00:01:35.220> zombies<00:01:35.700> map<00:01:35.909> packs<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.450> me

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
it all off along zombies map packs in me

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
it all off along zombies map packs in me
but<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:38.640> thinking<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> would<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
but what I'm thinking it would be it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.859 
but what I'm thinking it would be it
would<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.740> new<00:01:40.950> map<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.549> four<00:01:42.090> classic

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
would be a one new map and four classic

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.940 
would be a one new map and four classic
maps<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.530> fan<00:01:44.220> favorite<00:01:44.759> maps<00:01:45.149> remade<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.259> it's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
maps or fan favorite maps remade or it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.639 
maps or fan favorite maps remade or it's
going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.479> big<00:01:48.810> or<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.170> full

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
going to be one really big or like full

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
going to be one really big or like full
scale<00:01:49.920> map<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> usually<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.810> for

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
scale map that I usually do and then for

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340 
scale map that I usually do and then for
kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> smaller<00:01:53.329> smaller<00:01:54.329> maps<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.079> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
kind of smaller smaller maps that are in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.280 
kind of smaller smaller maps that are in
such<00:01:55.680> aren't<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> scale<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.689> die<00:01:57.960> rise

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
such aren't to the scale like die rise
