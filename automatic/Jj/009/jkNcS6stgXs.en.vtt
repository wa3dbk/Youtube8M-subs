00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Sport and leisure is now on the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.210
 agenda love spectators and sports 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.280
 Of course, it's a broad one 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.889
 There are already some concepts for some 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.420
 a very simple walk around the house 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.710
 around for the next sport begins 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.109
 actually only at a half marathon 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 distance and thus there are 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.800
 of course the different ones 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.480
 Approaches to sport 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.580
 But should I say it all the way 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 simple everyday things like mine 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.519
 from the walk to the baker or the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.650
 play with the kids on one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.539
 playground is already without further ado 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.369
 sport to be called as well 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.170
 you also burn calories 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.000
 They also move to bring them 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.989
 course according to your cycle 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.149
 on front man 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.920
 the question is just how monitored you are 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.210
 something like you can actually say 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.890
 if I'm playing with it right now 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.090
 I have children on the playground 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.280
 now so many calories 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 consumed or the way to the baker has 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 me by myself 500 or by myself 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.649
 1200 steps have now been made for that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.449
 for several years already this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.280
 Famous fitness bracelets love 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.930
 spectators and I know that many of them 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.910
 already thought about them 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.859
 just maybe the everyday life maybe 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.780
 also the sports activities if 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.470
 to make you really athlete club 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.479

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.299
 only catch such devices sometimes so 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.369
 even at 60 70 80 euro something 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.680
 you want to have good is fast too 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 ever arrived at just 120 euros 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.549
 Now we would like to have you here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.350

 Location is your sleeping rhythm 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.119
 Great to monitor so you can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.590
 can look at the next day 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.759
 why you are fit or why you are 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.320
 maybe even after an eight-hour 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.610
 Maybe not sleep like that 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.710
 Rested is how you look at that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 maybe we hoped in advance 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 you have this fitness evening all the way 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.700
 daily routine of our colleague sabine 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.750
 integrated and we are happy to be able to do that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.060
 take a look 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 because sport actually begins, so to speak 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750
 already when they get up in the morning and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.460
 Here we see how our colleague 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.600
 Then sabine yourself the bracelet 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.100
 creates or 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 she has it here already at night 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.520
 the sleep monitoring with it 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.680
 and syncs the whole course 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 even with your smartphone for a while 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.649
 better monitoring I Lose 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 the same also show again 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.340
 and now we see normal here 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.380
 Everyday things, of course, prepare that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.489
 of course, of course, too 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.679
 quite normal others 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.110
 Everyday items such as the game with 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.730
 the children's housework and of course 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.510
 also the sport like what here very nice 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.280
 to be able to see 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.810
 and the nice thing is with our fitness 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.610
 bracelet you can completely 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.410
 sets individual goals 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.599
 that means they say mine 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.860
 personal goal would be after me 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.260
 not done anything for a while now 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.810
 just have ten or even times 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.970
 12,000 steps a day to do that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.769
 Of course you can reach it in such a way 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.810
 fitness bracelet quite easy in his 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.730
 Integrate everyday and believe me 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.650
 We are equally satisfied with our colleague 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.930
 sabine they too will be in the evening 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.700
 if you simply set your daily goal 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.530
 that may have been achieved in the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.299
 first week of a series of 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.130
 maybe 10,000 maybe 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.750
 you are in the second week then too 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.250
 again something fitter a little better 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.540
 come into the step so that you then 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.030
 Maybe now I want to say 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.920
 Make 15,000 steps a day and you 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.260
 You will notice that when the bracelet 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.870
 in the evening then actually 98 of me 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.639
 percent only indicates your day's goal 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.900
 you will be so motivated that you 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.609
 to the emergency again the dog 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.889
 grab him once around the block 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.049
 move to 100 percent 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.730
 the beauty is this fitness bracelet 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.650
 is actually a simultaneous one too 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.900
 monitor for your pulse rate and that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.030
 means when you activate the bracelet 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.519
 and you can always wear yours 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.350
 just try pulse frequency 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.510
 that simply means the fingers right 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.980
 and left on this sensor on it and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.560
 then you have permanent monitoring 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.670
 your actual pulse rate but me 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.290
 I am now a bit faster direction 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.079
 run studio I'm here now 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.450
 almost 95 beats per minute 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.530
 yes, especially in sports this would 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.970
 probably a little further 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.920
 they are going up now 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.579
 always the chance to just go 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.319
 monitor 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.700
 in which pulse range are you? 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.590
 actually moving in the very normal 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.900
 everyday and of course also at 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.639
 their sporting activities too closely 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.410
 And of course, to the exact 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.359
 Control of progress consists of them 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.330
 here a free application one 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.370
 app for smartphones available 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.870
 and here you can always have your goals 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.370
 the step taken for the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.770
 Consumed calories throughout the day 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.660
 distributed excellent reading but what 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.980
 It's also fantastic 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.170
 I would like to show them very briefly 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.390
 is actually sleep monitoring 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.070
 that means you can also put the bracelet in 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.570
 Wear the night and this bracelet 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.100
 accordingly measures the so 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.350
 possibilities or 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.150
 the fashion of her stars ob 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.710
 have wallowed in each other often 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.390
 turned from one side to the other 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.190
 or just relax 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.990
 Slept through and so you know 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.670
 Of course, the next morning with one 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.350
 Look if the sleep was satisfying 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.760
 or of course they know why they are 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.290
 maybe after eight hours 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.060
 Sleep is not quite as fit as it is 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.250
 actually wanted to be the good fitness 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.210
 but is less than 60 euros with us 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.890
 the px 37 56 and 569 to have and will 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.580
 definitely more relaxed in everyday life 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.580
 let shape
