00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.929
 well cda that of engine magazines we are 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.389
 on board bad share we go to 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.590
 see infotainment fact that just 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.010
 for this part dedicated more to the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.580
 music and the cd and this dedicated port 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.199
 to navigation and to the department 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.470
 multimedia a little strange this 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.740
 division does not make us crazy too 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.710
 because on the dashboard of the car not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.140
 we have no information whatsoever 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.250
 is replicated in the car trip 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 nor is the multimedia part on the other hand 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 steering wheel 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.370
 the left side dedicated to audio 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.660
 then raise to raise lower the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.010
 volume the levers are pressed behind the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.789
 steering wheel can be switched off 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.370
 the infotainment receive or lower one 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.460
 call and change stations as well as i 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.940
 music tracks and change the mode 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.000
 but back on the bridge on 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.890
 7 inch display is controlled with 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.549
 these four buttons below 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.920
 dedicated to the delicate menu navigator 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.680
 general and as you wish we can also 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.729
 read the movies here is the first flaw that 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.939
 I found the infotainment system 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 the beam of me when we light the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.280
 lights the deal automatically lowers the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.600
 brightness but for example there are 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.159
 situations in which we must turn on 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.840
 the lights that we don't want this 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.500
 it should happen automatically 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.439
 click with your finger on this one 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 part that on this button for 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.299
 exclude the navigation mirage is v3 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.790
 even movie films that are re-produced 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.810
 institutions also produce products from 3 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.540
 usb stick usb stick which is mail 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.399
 here in the glove compartment at the bottom 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.200
 not very comfortable but let's say one 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.960
 once strung we should no longer for 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 to fiddle with the USB key in addition to 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.930
 that there is the auxiliary entrance for the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.159
 analog sources and some separation 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.290
 of the plants we see it right 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.660
 reading them 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.560
 ep 3 because if I click here I read 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.410
 the sd of memory that is placed here or 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.140
 the usb disk while the other three that 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.570
 are present on the CD that I have 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.150
 entered the command instead from the menu here 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.220
 of the radio in short, we must do 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.980
 a little bit the habit sometimes there is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.090
 confuses on which key which key to press 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.350
 as for the videos they come 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.870
 read let's go back with this 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.950
 button movies are also read to you 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.209
 i dvx I'll show you right away 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.180
 only works when the car is stationary 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.270
 because when we move then appears 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.440
 a screen that tells us we need to 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.130
 stop just to view the DVD 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.980
 or the dvx you see very well the dvd not 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.220
 are supported and I repeat only i 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.350
 avi file had to go back to the menu 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.030
 navigation to see how it works 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.410
 the navigator navigator that works 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.470
 we have not had enough 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.600
 problems of sorts if not sometimes 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.489
 when entering destinations 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.610
 for example we have included a course like 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.820
 at number 4 and the navigator has not 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.780
 acknowledged the address you see 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.150
 impossible to calculate the route 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.950
 strange does not know why probably in 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.660
 course as numbers are not mapped 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.170
 we only had to run the course 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.880
 as at that point the navigator has us 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:36.140
 course routed yes 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.769
 can still como 4 course selected 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.080
 you can enter points of interest 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.299
 intermediate in this case there is not 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.830
 even calculates the address and the 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.019
 destination to course as no 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.180
 ask me how come every now and then 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.730
 sometimes it happens 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.709
 in the browser settings it is 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.650
 can activate the alarm on 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.109
 exceeding the speed limit e 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.939
 activate manual mode or 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.870
 automatic with regard to colors 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:08.150
 of the map then with day and night a 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.430
 navigator who once passed this 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.959
 impasse of address insertion 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.370
 that sometimes brings us problems 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.310
 quietly I liked to do too 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.500
 I have experienced intelligent states 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.660
 a lot before doing this 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.759
 this review always from this 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.199
 display it is possible to control not 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.740
 command but display 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.930
 air conditioner settings 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.150
 in addition to seeing the trip computer with i 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.400
 parameters of the journey we can then 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.410
 set some parameters as well 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.720
 system update but instead 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:48.650
 let's get the part below that the more 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:51.440
 musical radio with favorite stations 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.240
 memorize the possibilities to combine 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.789
 a bluetooth phone and in this case 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.889
 you listen to music in streaming not you 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.830
 can command from steering wheel controls or 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:08.870
 from the car radio you need to send in push e 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.940
 the music from your mobile phone, what 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.060
 that works the bluetooth and the change 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.940
 of the tracks through the steering wheel as far as 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.060
 regards the menu of the car radio with 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.270
 sees we can equalize or modify i 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.159
 various car radio parameters playing 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.370
 really very very well I do it to you 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.370
 feel immediately let's go into an in an mp3 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.979
 take a random 3 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.370
 here is if you load them p3 and the loaded from 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.960
 mac titles with the front point that 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.040
 they should actually be hidden 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.410
 see and 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.930
 in the list of small songs 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.930
 especially for those who upload music from m 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.370
 chevrolet 26 we hear it right away 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.530
 from the stereo system because at low 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.690
 powerful deep even at maximum volume 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.990
 therefore it does not distort an audio quality 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:14.730
 really very very good for a system 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:19.020
 very complex but also infotainment 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:23.070
 very complicated to manage just for 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:26.700
 this separation between the parties 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:30.000
 last treat reverse when the 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.510
 we insert on the display there appears 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.830
 the back image with a camera 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.390
 which really picks up very well from 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.250
 look here we look at the license plate e 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.230
 the bumper of the car then a 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.790
 very large wide angle excuse the game 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.280
 of words that allows us to do 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.850
 millimeter parking also present of 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.850
 parking sensors
