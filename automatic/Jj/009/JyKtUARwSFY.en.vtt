00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.100 
never get super super smooth and one of
the<00:02:04.110> reasons<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> overwork

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
the reasons is that if you overwork

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.199 
the reasons is that if you overwork
dairy-free<00:02:07.110> margarine<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.009> I'm<00:02:08.849> afraid

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
dairy-free margarine is I'm afraid

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
dairy-free margarine is I'm afraid
starts<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> go<00:02:09.810> into<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.140> liquidy<00:02:10.649> form

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
starts to go into that liquidy form

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.620 
starts to go into that liquidy form
again<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
again it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.020 
again it
loose<00:02:11.780> its<00:02:12.560> structure<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.640> don't<00:02:13.820> want

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
loose its structure and you don't want

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.400 
loose its structure and you don't want
that<00:02:14.180> for<00:02:14.240> icing<00:02:14.750> because<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.050> need<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
that for icing because you need the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.490 
that for icing because you need the
support<00:02:15.590> for<00:02:16.010> icing<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.970> very<00:02:17.870> mind<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.410> you

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
support for icing so very mind that you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.070 
support for icing so very mind that you
may<00:02:18.650> not<00:02:18.830> get<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> smoothest<00:02:20.510> icing<00:02:21.050> that

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
may not get but the smoothest icing that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.870 
may not get but the smoothest icing that
you<00:02:21.320> want<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.980> would<00:02:22.160> with<00:02:22.340> normal<00:02:22.640> butter

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you want as you would with normal butter

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.030 
you want as you would with normal butter
because<00:02:23.510> it's<00:02:23.780> more<00:02:23.930> tolerant<00:02:24.440> butter<00:02:24.740> than

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
because it's more tolerant butter than

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.120 
because it's more tolerant butter than
the<00:02:25.430> dairy-free<00:02:25.670> marjorine<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.290> put<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.010> in

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
the dairy-free marjorine so I put it in

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.250 
the dairy-free marjorine so I put it in
there<00:02:28.370> as<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.150> see<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:29.780> looks<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.230> bit

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
there as you can see it just looks a bit

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.700 
there as you can see it just looks a bit
of<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.500> mess<00:02:30.710> now<00:02:31.190> keep<00:02:31.490> on<00:02:31.670> breaking<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
of a mess now keep on breaking the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.980 
of a mess now keep on breaking the
margarine<00:02:33.710> with<00:02:34.160> their<00:02:34.430> spoon<00:02:34.880> into<00:02:35.750> little

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
margarine with their spoon into little

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.620 
margarine with their spoon into little
bits<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.440> keep<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.800> mixing<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.340> in<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:37.700> for<00:02:38.600> a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
bits and keep on mixing it in and for a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.570 
bits and keep on mixing it in and for a
while<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.230> will<00:02:39.440> appear<00:02:39.950> as<00:02:40.070> if<00:02:40.190> nothing<00:02:40.550> is

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
while it will appear as if nothing is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.180 
while it will appear as if nothing is
happening<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.390> then<00:02:41.960> suddenly<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.560> icing

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
happening and then suddenly the icing

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.370 
happening and then suddenly the icing
will<00:02:43.460> come<00:02:43.670> together<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.020> I'm<00:02:45.110> going<00:02:45.320> to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
will come together and so I'm going to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.080 
will come together and so I'm going to
bring<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.040> camera<00:02:46.580> over<00:02:46.610> for<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.330> closer<00:02:47.960> look

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
bring the camera over for a closer look

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.750 
bring the camera over for a closer look
you<00:02:50.090> keep<00:02:50.330> on<00:02:50.540> mixing<00:02:50.960> eventually<00:02:51.950> they<00:02:52.610> will

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
you keep on mixing eventually they will

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.100 
you keep on mixing eventually they will
look<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.660> rubble<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.470> then<00:02:55.310> slowly<00:02:56.110> the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
look like rubble and then slowly the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.760 
look like rubble and then slowly the
marjorine<00:02:57.620> will<00:02:57.860> start<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:59.140> get<00:03:00.140> softened<00:03:00.440> and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
marjorine will start to get softened and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.850 
marjorine will start to get softened and
soften<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.340> be<00:03:02.330> able<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.570> mix<00:03:02.900> properly<00:03:03.200> and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
soften and be able to mix properly and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.090 
soften and be able to mix properly and
you<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.430> now<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.440> it's<00:03:06.440> not<00:03:06.710> far<00:03:07.010> away

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
you can see now that it's not far away

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.810 
you can see now that it's not far away
from<00:03:07.520> being<00:03:07.790> icing<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.440> keep<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.970> using

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
from being icing so just keep on using

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.140 
from being icing so just keep on using
they<00:03:13.820> go<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.600> now<00:03:14.840> it's<00:03:15.550> getting<00:03:16.550> into<00:03:16.730> icing

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
they go and now it's getting into icing

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.210 
they go and now it's getting into icing
at<00:03:17.300> this<00:03:17.480> point<00:03:17.780> I'm<00:03:18.020> going<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.440> get<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> whisk<00:03:18.920> a

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
at this point I'm going to get a whisk a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.110 
at this point I'm going to get a whisk a
balloon<00:03:19.700> whisk<00:03:20.830> so<00:03:21.830> now<00:03:22.100> I've<00:03:22.250> changed<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.820> a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
balloon whisk so now I've changed to a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.000 
balloon whisk so now I've changed to a
balloon<00:03:23.510> whisk<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.230> I'm<00:03:24.410> going<00:03:24.710> to<00:03:24.800> use<00:03:24.980> a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
balloon whisk and I'm going to use a

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.460 
balloon whisk and I'm going to use a
little<00:03:25.220> bit<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.490> brute<00:03:25.880> force<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.810> get

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
little bit of brute force just to get

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:40.589 
little bit of brute force just to get
everything<00:03:27.770> going

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.449 

and<00:03:41.599> that's<00:03:41.780> it

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
and that's it

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.890 
and that's it
icing<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.580> ready<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:46.280> for<00:03:46.610> piping<00:03:47.420> now

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
icing is ready and really for piping now

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.500 
icing is ready and really for piping now
before<00:03:48.590> starting<00:03:49.159> to<00:03:49.370> pipe<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:49.909> would<00:03:50.209> put<00:03:50.390> it

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
before starting to pipe I would put it

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.509 
before starting to pipe I would put it
back<00:03:50.659> in<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.019> fridge<00:03:51.260> for<00:03:51.650> half<00:03:52.040> an<00:03:52.250> hour<00:03:52.340> just

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
back in the fridge for half an hour just

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.550 
back in the fridge for half an hour just
to<00:03:52.790> cool<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.120> down<00:03:53.150> again<00:03:53.659> and<00:03:53.989> you'll<00:03:54.349> get<00:03:54.500> a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
to cool it down again and you'll get a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.550 
to cool it down again and you'll get a
better<00:03:54.829> piping<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:56.299> know<00:03:56.720> decoration<00:03:57.260> on<00:03:57.500> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
better piping you know decoration on the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.460 
better piping you know decoration on the
nozzles<00:03:58.280> if<00:03:58.549> it's<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.120> little<00:03:59.239> bit<00:03:59.390> colder<00:03:59.840> so

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
nozzles if it's a little bit colder so

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.170 
nozzles if it's a little bit colder so
cover<00:04:01.129> it<00:04:01.220> up<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.610> put<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:01.790> in<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:01.940> fridge<00:04:02.120> for

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
cover it up and put it in the fridge for

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.000 
cover it up and put it in the fridge for
half<00:04:02.480> an<00:04:02.690> hour<00:04:02.810> at<00:04:02.989> least<00:04:03.140> before<00:04:03.440> actually
