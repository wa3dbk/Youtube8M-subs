00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to be in this storyline so this is the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.040 
to be in this storyline so this is the
third<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.390> final<00:00:47.300> mission<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.480> guess<00:00:48.870> we'll

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
third and final mission I guess we'll

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.260 
third and final mission I guess we'll
call<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.890> second<00:00:50.370> part<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> paper

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.920 
call it in the second part of the paper
trail<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.969> guess<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.719> us

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
trail so from for now I guess it's us

trail so from for now I guess it's us
waiting<00:00:55.550> until<00:00:56.550> next<00:00:56.730> week<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:58.379> kind<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
waiting until next week so it's kind of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.029

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.359 
that's going to open the replayability
of<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> game<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.180> wide<00:01:19.140> open<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.950> I've<00:01:20.159> said

in the past so basically where this
takes<00:01:23.159> us<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.549> right<00:01:23.820> over<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.360> into<00:01:24.860> back

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
takes us is right over here into back

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
takes us is right over here into back
into<00:01:25.890> Eugene's<00:01:26.880> lair<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.619> gonna

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
into Eugene's lair so I'm just gonna

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
into Eugene's lair so I'm just gonna
keep<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.460> short<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.939> sweet<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.479> possible

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
keep this as short and sweet as possible

00:01:31.049 --> 00:02:10.910 
keep this as short and sweet as possible
and<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.470> ahead<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.950> cut<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:33.150> there

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:26.160 

that'll<00:02:11.490> be<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> clue<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:11.940> this

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:50.559 

okay

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.130 

and<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.650> does<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:52.280> seems<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:52.969> the<00:02:53.239> kind

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
and that does it it seems like the kind

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.699 
and that does it it seems like the kind
of<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.379> third<00:02:54.680> missions<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.609> these<00:02:55.819> parts<00:02:56.329> are

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
of the third missions in these parts are

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.140 
of the third missions in these parts are
pretty<00:02:57.709> short<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.640> sweet

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
pretty short and sweet

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.890 
pretty short and sweet
typically<00:02:59.480> thus<00:03:00.230> far<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.150> once<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.359> get<00:03:02.569> back

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
typically thus far so once we get back

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.660 
typically thus far so once we get back
to<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:05.060> online<00:03:05.299> paper<00:03:06.290> trail<00:03:06.709> we've

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
to the online paper trail we've

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.399 
to the online paper trail we've
obviously<00:03:07.909> got<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.390> evidence<00:03:08.659> from<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
obviously got the evidence from the

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.309 
obviously got the evidence from the
scene<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.680> we<00:03:10.189> have<00:03:10.400> collected<00:03:11.120> which<00:03:11.989> is
