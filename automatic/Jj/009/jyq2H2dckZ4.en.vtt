 peter jackson matsuura 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.069

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:16.029
 on a camera is a goal of dilma was insufficient 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.150
 We will have work 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.279
 the cheese 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.300
 I had them 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.019
 Brazilian 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.319

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.419
 chamakh here 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.769
 nobody 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.769
 barack obama had the focus here is just 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.100
 I accept 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.370
 I think these actors enough 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 by the way 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 and landmarks although the line that stayed ricky is not that I have name 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
 art 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 Now we work. 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 in the middle of which only on the other side 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.680
 such effectiveness 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.150
 in fact he will stay we will have an open mind 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 in the chapel that was a girl my daughter lives in 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 scoreboard 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.750
 the capital 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.320
 now we are the 2nd of December 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.220
 the lawsuit 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 after a cardiac decade 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.020
 yes and so it will depend on the white house 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.460
 critical and public 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 Kaia Kanepi is incredible 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 and on the other side too 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.810
 that's what I too 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.570
 nor to comment that it does not hurt 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.689
 now in synthesis 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.839
 you'll get fat 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.789
 the high segment in this line 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.789
 they practiced 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.579
 let's go then wasted 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.579
 even because it gives you a kiss 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.699
 4 which go kart 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.809
 and now we're coming down the crew of serginho that we jet pilots 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.589
 I think it's in this environment that we are already outdated 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.009
 good 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.009
 it fits the banks 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.699
 what does this mean that three of them 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:12.849
 that 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.239
 two of them pain 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.299
 You have to go said in Kabul. 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.159
 this adjustment will not work 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.159
 we will charge you a departure date 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.639
 it is the other on the other hand 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.939
 the category 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.299
 arrives work 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.779
 is open because we lose 500 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.779
 no keyboard 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.099
 he is the guy 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.509
 the oab we caught idol in corinthians 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.789
 I was calm, I gave birth alone. 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.599
 a brt double of the current 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.769
 should fall in which deaths 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.189
 It will look just like France. 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.220
 We expect him to staple us by the year. 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.389
 we might have to ensure colder - the helicopter 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.309
 the taag 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.279
 the boy is concerned 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.199
 paper helicopter 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.199
 it is very easy to make this paper cut 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.800
 Aunt, I miss you 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.059
 A very cool tip. 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:55.740
 I remarked that the building the building is who dictates laws of nature if released shot 

00:04:55.739 --> 00:05:00.399
 a girlfriend cocktail there will go up prices should fall goes up by 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.259
 world so goes but calm there 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.550
 to an agreement to know who will leave the 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.550
 It's really cool to do the tie-break. 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.319
 who knows next year 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.499
 in the tie toss 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:17.339
 to see that she 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.839
 Our hypothesis is to be quiet. 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.400
 the third basket south 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.009
 at dinner 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.550
 the singer 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.550
 when I get played in piracaia 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.199
 marta suplicy 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.620
 Let's focus on 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.070
 goals with the high price even found
