tape<00:02:31.959> here<00:02:33.299> turn<00:02:34.299> it<00:02:34.330> around<00:02:34.540> put<00:02:36.750> some<00:02:37.750> tape

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
tape here turn it around put some tape

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.759 
tape here turn it around put some tape
here<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.569> same<00:02:40.810> thing<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:41.260> maybe<00:02:41.380> put

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
here and the same thing and maybe put

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.410 
here and the same thing and maybe put
another<00:02:42.180> strip<00:02:43.180> here<00:02:44.790> maybe<00:02:45.790> one<00:02:45.970> more<00:02:46.120> strip

another strip here maybe one more strip

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.000 
another strip here maybe one more strip
here<00:02:46.799> then<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:47.829> result<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.709> card

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
here then that result is the card

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.490 
here then that result is the card
becomes<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.910> long<00:02:52.239> card<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:56.110> example<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:58.500> can

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
becomes a long card for example I can

but from the front
it<00:03:32.530> might<00:03:32.739> take<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.250> little<00:03:33.370> knack<00:03:35.610> you'll
