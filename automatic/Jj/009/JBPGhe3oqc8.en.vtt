the<00:00:20.279> first<00:00:20.490> question<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.630> to

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the first question is I would like to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.450 
the first question is I would like to
see<00:00:21.900> bombs<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.710> Jets<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.279> give<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
see bombs on the Jets it would give a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.340 
see bombs on the Jets it would give a
whole<00:00:23.820> new<00:00:23.850> perspective<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> game<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
whole new perspective on the game and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.929 
whole new perspective on the game and
Jets<00:00:25.650> would<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.130> more<00:00:26.340> effective<00:00:26.430> against

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Jets would be more effective against

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.109 
Jets would be more effective against
infantry<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.570> battlefield<00:00:28.260> 1943<00:00:28.849> planes<00:00:29.849> had

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119

bombs<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.900> really<00:00:31.230> liked<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:31.949> are

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

your<00:00:32.219> thoughts<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.899> I'm<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:34.170> actually

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
your thoughts on this I'm not actually

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.819 
your thoughts on this I'm not actually
sure<00:00:34.710> y<00:00:35.489> dice<00:00:35.910> didn't<00:00:36.540> add<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.840> bombs<00:00:37.320> into

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
sure y dice didn't add the bombs into

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
sure y dice didn't add the bombs into
battle<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.160> three<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> know<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> players

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
battle for three I know a lot of players

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
battle for three I know a lot of players
liked<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> battlefield<00:00:40.379> 2<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.160> did

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
liked it in battlefield 2 I really did

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
liked it in battlefield 2 I really did
not<00:00:41.309> play<00:00:41.670> battlefield<00:00:42.210> 1943<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> can't

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
not play battlefield 1943 so I can't

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
not play battlefield 1943 so I can't
really<00:00:44.190> speak<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.180> game<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.050> i

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
really speak for that game but i

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.619 
really speak for that game but i
remember<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.500> battlefield<00:00:47.070> 2i<00:00:47.730> thought<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
remember in battlefield 2i thought that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.090 
remember in battlefield 2i thought that
the<00:00:48.750> jets<00:00:49.020> were<00:00:49.170> pretty<00:00:49.350> overpowered<00:00:49.590> they

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the jets were pretty overpowered they

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
the jets were pretty overpowered they
would<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.000> could<00:00:51.149> dominate<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.660> guy<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
would you could dominate this guy if you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.350 
would you could dominate this guy if you
are<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> good<00:00:52.469> pilot<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> knew<00:00:54.180> how<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
are a good pilot and if you knew how to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.970 
are a good pilot and if you knew how to
bomb<00:00:54.629> effectively<00:00:55.289> which<00:00:55.680> didn't<00:00:55.949> really

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
bomb effectively which didn't really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.430 
bomb effectively which didn't really
take<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> whole<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.149> figure<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
take a lot a whole lot to figure out you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.830 
take a lot a whole lot to figure out you
could<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.010> destroy<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.359> lot<00:01:00.780> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
could just destroy and get a lot of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
could just destroy and get a lot of
kills<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> ground<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.340> lot<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.520> people

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
kills on the ground and a lot of people

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.250 
kills on the ground and a lot of people
who<00:01:03.149> were<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> top<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> scoreboard

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
who were at the top of the scoreboard

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
who were at the top of the scoreboard
were<00:01:05.159> players<00:01:05.640> who<00:01:05.909> were<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> jets<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
were players who were in the jets and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
were players who were in the jets and
they<00:01:06.990> were<00:01:07.049> ace<00:01:07.290> pilots<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> think

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
they were ace pilots and so I think

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.219 
they were ace pilots and so I think
probably<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> main<00:01:09.750> reasons<00:01:10.110> why

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
probably one of the main reasons why

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440 
probably one of the main reasons why
dice<00:01:10.560> didn't<00:01:11.130> add<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.460> into<00:01:11.700> battlefield<00:01:12.240> 3

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
dice didn't add it into battlefield 3

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.080 
dice didn't add it into battlefield 3
was<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> reason<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> if

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
was because of that reason is that if

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
was because of that reason is that if
you<00:01:15.210> became<00:01:15.659> an<00:01:15.960> amazing<00:01:16.380> pilot<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.890> could

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you became an amazing pilot you could

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.330 
you became an amazing pilot you could
just<00:01:17.189> absolutely<00:01:17.909> destroy<00:01:18.600> everyone<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
just absolutely destroy everyone and I

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
just absolutely destroy everyone and I
know<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.540> Jets<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.930> really

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
know right now that the Jets are really

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
know right now that the Jets are really
only<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:23.220> taking<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.790> other<00:01:23.970> jets<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
only for taking out other jets and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
only for taking out other jets and
helicopters<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:25.830> every<00:01:25.979> once<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
helicopters and then every once in a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
helicopters and then every once in a
while<00:01:26.460> taking<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.030> tanks<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> have

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
while taking out tanks when you have

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600 
while taking out tanks when you have
that<00:01:28.320> opportunity<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that opportunity you have like that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.359 
that opportunity you have like that
breathing<00:01:30.119> room<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> dynamic<00:01:32.280> I

breathing room and I like that dynamic I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.399 
breathing room and I like that dynamic I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
think it's good but I do i do know that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
effective against that type of those

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.740 
effective against that type of those
type<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> players<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:42.119> exactly<00:01:42.540> sure

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
type of players so I'm not exactly sure

like i said y dice hasn't added it into

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.870 
like i said y dice hasn't added it into
battlefield<00:01:45.960> 3<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> maybe<00:01:47.070> they'll<00:01:47.310> add<00:01:47.460> into

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
battlefield 3 and maybe they'll add into

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
battlefield 3 and maybe they'll add into
battlefield<00:01:48.240> throw<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> battlefield<00:01:49.049> 4

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
battlefield throw in the battlefield 4

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.399 
battlefield throw in the battlefield 4
i'm<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.829> sure<00:01:50.159> i<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:51.509> maybe<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:52.229> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
i'm not sure i just maybe think that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.870 
i'm not sure i just maybe think that
they<00:01:52.560> thought<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.549> too

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
they thought it was a little too

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.030 
they thought it was a little too
powerful<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> previous<00:01:55.110> titles<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.799> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
powerful in the previous titles and so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
powerful in the previous titles and so
they<00:01:56.159> didn't<00:01:56.399> want<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.479> in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
they didn't want to have it in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.749 
they didn't want to have it in
battlefield<00:01:58.020> 3<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.799> next<00:01:59.130> question<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.490> do

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
battlefield 3 the next question is do

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.700 
battlefield 3 the next question is do
you<00:01:59.820> think<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.420> bad<00:02:00.750> move<00:02:01.079> by<00:02:01.380> diced

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710

even<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> actually<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.810> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
even out I know I actually think that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.960 
even out I know I actually think that
this<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.470> effective<00:02:11.069> marketing<00:02:11.340> tactics

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
this is just effective marketing tactics

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.010 
this is just effective marketing tactics
so<00:02:12.180> they've<00:02:12.330> already<00:02:12.510> gotten<00:02:12.780> about<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
so they've already gotten about a

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
so they've already gotten about a
million

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
million

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410 
million
people<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.130> buy<00:02:14.280> battlefield<00:02:14.580> premium<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
people to buy battlefield premium and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.960 
people to buy battlefield premium and
I'm<00:02:15.750> sure<00:02:15.900> sales<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.650> premium<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.700> dropped

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
I'm sure sales on premium have dropped

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.370 
I'm sure sales on premium have dropped
significantly<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:18.900> they<00:02:19.050> want<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
significantly so now they want to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.530 
significantly so now they want to

honestly<00:03:06.540> don't<00:03:06.989> think<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.530> going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.890> be

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
honestly don't think that's going to be

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.030 
honestly don't think that's going to be
the<00:03:08.160> case<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.670> dice<00:03:08.970> NEA<00:03:09.750> has<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.200> lot<00:03:10.739> of

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
the case that dice NEA has a lot of

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.009 
the case that dice NEA has a lot of
different<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.730> lot<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.090> developers<00:03:12.540> working<00:03:12.780> on

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
different a lot of developers working on

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.020 
different a lot of developers working on
different<00:03:13.230> titles<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.980> focusing<00:03:14.940> on

different titles and focusing on
different<00:03:15.180> games<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.260> that's<00:03:16.620> not

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
different games and so I know that's not

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.979 
different games and so I know that's not
going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.489> case<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.480> see<00:03:18.690> why

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
going to be the case but I can see why

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.930 
going to be the case but I can see why
people<00:03:19.440> would<00:03:19.470> be<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.829> little<00:03:20.070> upset<00:03:20.310> by<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
people would be a little upset by that

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.750 
people would be a little upset by that

battlefield 3 and I've been discovering
a<00:03:27.060> few<00:03:27.360> interesting<00:03:27.900> tricks<00:03:28.230> my<00:03:28.829> question<00:03:29.310> is

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
a few interesting tricks my question is

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.090 
a few interesting tricks my question is
whether<00:03:29.970> using<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.660> recon<00:03:31.110> class<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.650> place<00:03:31.890> a

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
whether using a recon class to place a

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.400 
whether using a recon class to place a
spawn<00:03:32.459> beacon<00:03:32.730> behind<00:03:33.329> enemy<00:03:33.510> lines<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:34.170> a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
spawn beacon behind enemy lines is a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.250 
spawn beacon behind enemy lines is a
wrong<00:03:34.860> thing<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.610> while<00:03:36.269> I'm<00:03:36.540> able<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.959> rack

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
wrong thing to do while I'm able to rack

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.259 
wrong thing to do while I'm able to rack
up<00:03:37.290> plenty<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.890> kills<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.370> help<00:03:38.549> burn<00:03:38.820> tickets

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
up plenty of kills and help burn tickets

up plenty of kills and help burn tickets
I<00:03:39.390> feel<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:40.019> this<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.320> almost<00:03:40.620> like<00:03:40.769> spawn

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
I feel like this is almost like spawn

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.420 
I feel like this is almost like spawn
camping<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.720> method<00:03:43.049> morally<00:03:43.890> wrong<00:03:44.100> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
camping is this method morally wrong I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.310 
camping is this method morally wrong I
know<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.269> think<00:03:45.510> what<00:03:45.780> you're<00:03:45.930> doing<00:03:45.959> is

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
know I think what you're doing is

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.500 
know I think what you're doing is
absolutely<00:03:46.980> fine<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.310> there<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.910> no<00:03:48.090> reason

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
absolutely fine and there is no reason

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.789 
absolutely fine and there is no reason
for<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> worry<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.170> what<00:03:49.620> you're<00:03:49.769> doing

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
for you to worry that what you're doing

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.099 
for you to worry that what you're doing
is<00:03:50.160> morally<00:03:50.790> wrong<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.359> mean<00:03:51.660> first<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:52.019> all

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
is morally wrong I mean first of all

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.900 
is morally wrong I mean first of all
it's<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.410> game<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.920> whatever<00:03:53.250> you're<00:03:53.430> doing<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
it's a game so whatever you're doing is

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.509 
it's a game so whatever you're doing is
probably<00:03:54.359> fine<00:03:54.660> but<00:03:55.440> not<00:03:55.530> only<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.769> but<00:03:56.130> if

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
probably fine but not only that but if

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.220 
probably fine but not only that but if
you<00:03:56.700> are<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> recon<00:03:57.390> player<00:03:57.630> you're<00:03:57.959> getting

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
you are a recon player you're getting

you are a recon player you're getting
behind<00:03:58.380> enemy<00:03:58.769> lines<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.370> you're<00:03:59.549> allowing

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
behind enemy lines and you're allowing

there respond beacon like off in the

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
die which never usually happens because

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.990 
die which never usually happens because
they're<00:04:19.320> about<00:04:19.470> 5,000<00:04:20.310> meters<00:04:20.579> away<00:04:20.700> from<00:04:20.820> the

they're about 5,000 meters away from the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
objective they can spawn back on that

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
objective they can spawn back on that
and<00:04:23.159> then<00:04:23.550> sit<00:04:23.880> sit<00:04:24.419> back<00:04:24.630> down<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.140> continue

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
you can hopefully you're not just doing

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.710 
you can hopefully you're not just doing
that<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.030> you're<00:04:51.120> trying<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.330> get<00:04:51.450> onto<00:04:51.630> the

objective<00:04:52.110> like<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.470> said<00:04:52.740> but<00:04:53.220> even<00:04:53.340> if<00:04:53.580> you're

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
objective like I said but even if you're

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.460 
objective like I said but even if you're
just<00:04:54.090> doing<00:04:54.390> that<00:04:54.690> you're<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.080> trying<00:04:55.380> to

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
just doing that you're just trying to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.200

down the enemy teams tickets I still

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.160 
down the enemy teams tickets I still
think<00:04:59.730> that's<00:05:00.060> fine<00:05:00.300> because<00:05:00.570> like<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.110> said

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
think that's fine because like I said

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.930 
think that's fine because like I said
you're<00:05:01.620> you're<00:05:01.950> behind<00:05:02.160> enemy<00:05:02.370> lines<00:05:02.490> you're

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
you're you're behind enemy lines you're

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.210 
you're you're behind enemy lines you're
