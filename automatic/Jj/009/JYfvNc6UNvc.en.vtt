 Kazakh border in all this let's talk 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.200
 With political analyst Alexander minute ring he 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.680
 It leaves us with a direct link 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.820
 studio zones to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:00.809

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.619
 Russian leaders of different levels 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 why is there such a squall 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.750
 diplomatic reaction our view it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.640
 some really something 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.490
 he is a very sensitive question for 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.470
 Kazakh authorities such statements 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.720
 sounded unofficially true level and 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.570
 before they simply did not pay 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:38.240
 attention but the precedent of Crimea, we understand 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.479
 already a completely different situation and here on 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.990
 such probros energy release disease in 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.210
 Omsk region has the longest 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.590
 pidgey draws a border 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.259
 kilometers of Kazakhstan 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.660
 we have such already be the same turned off 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.600
 one misunderstanding can tell more in 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.950
 January of this year when on the banner 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.630
 Our official site appeared 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 the subject of the Russian Federation do not have anyone 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.340
 he school supports economic 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:14.540
 relations elite Tikhomirov by his order 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.290
 Russian Federation absolutely also 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.810
 the same size banner was where 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.519
 it began by the way 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.790
 speaking buryatia republic of kazakhstan 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.220
 outrage among neighbors was huge 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.670
 I had to explain for a long time just to 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.220
 identify and economic partners 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.860
 most of all trade and he is very modestly 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.350
 Kazakhstan trades a lot so here 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.120
 so carelessly to say the least female 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.170
 top of bullets and orcs 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.110
 but the statement that cities is the answer is 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.280
 there his turn and said that after 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.100
 rhino challengers 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.510
 I just wanted to clarify and it comes and 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.190
 that is, the reaction is associated with 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.400
 Crimean events as far as 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.780
 Kazakhstan know so it was fashionable before 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.810
 talk about 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.020
 about Kazakh about the idea of ​​Kazakhstan 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.590
 underbelly when talked about about 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.569
 combining possible some potions 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.080
 lands and members of the Soviet 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.430
 Union as far as now in Kazakhstan 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.380
 we feel restless 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.380
 quietly because russia did not give 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.920
 cause for such concern with us as 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.920
 would talk 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.760
 maybe on the cardboard 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.170
 nutritional level can world with historians 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.769

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.830
 stop 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.110
 like a flight to the border of Kazakhstan 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.140
 delicately and power accordingly or 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.400

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.860
 passport then a delicate matter 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.709
 my eastern saying is soldered 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.280

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.640
 pickle on along urban youth 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.989
 the boundaries for these were set during 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.380
 believe many and desire 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.050
 warrior our neighbors can challenge this 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.430
 Kazakhstan and you know what the first

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:15.789
 high level and even top notch 

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:19.569
