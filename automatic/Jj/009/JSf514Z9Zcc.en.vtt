harvest leaves you'll notice that like

harvest leaves you'll notice that like
most<00:01:03.600> plants<00:01:04.019> most<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> young<00:01:04.920> leaves

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
most plants most of the young leaves

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.640 
most plants most of the young leaves
will<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.270> middle<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> plant<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
will be in the middle of the plant and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.880 
will be in the middle of the plant and
you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> leave<00:01:08.400> those<00:01:08.700> alone<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
you can kind of leave those alone and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
you can kind of leave those alone and
don't<00:01:10.890> harvest<00:01:11.340> any<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> leaves<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.090> are

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
don't harvest any of the leaves that are

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.830 
don't harvest any of the leaves that are
dry<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.260> woody<00:01:14.210> because<00:01:15.210> those<00:01:15.390> won't<00:01:15.630> taste

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
dry or woody because those won't taste

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.149 
dry or woody because those won't taste
as<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> sometimes<00:01:16.560> they'll<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
as good and sometimes they'll be a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.730 
as good and sometimes they'll be a
little<00:01:17.520> bit<00:01:17.729> bitter<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.720> want<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> take<00:01:19.530> off

little bit bitter so I want to take off

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.910 
little bit bitter so I want to take off
some<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.340> branches<00:01:21.080> here<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.560> have

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
some of these branches here that have

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060 
some of these branches here that have
some<00:01:23.720> mature<00:01:24.720> leaves<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.320> them<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.650> well<00:01:25.860> as

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070

some mature leaves on them as well as
some<00:01:26.280> younger<00:01:26.549> leaves<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.110> chop<00:01:28.380> those

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I happen to be using my sage for same

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
I happen to be using my sage for same
thing<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.189> tricolor<00:01:38.189> sage<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.070> like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
thing on the tricolor sage here and like

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
thing on the tricolor sage here and like
most<00:01:41.369> herbs<00:01:41.610> especially<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.659> them

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
most herbs especially if you have them

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.649 
most herbs especially if you have them
in<00:01:43.020> pots<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.369> good<00:01:44.579> idea<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.360> snip

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
in pots it's a really good idea to snip

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.190 
in pots it's a really good idea to snip
a<00:01:45.780> little<00:01:45.810> bit<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.680> several<00:01:47.399> sides<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.329> if

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
a little bit from several sides or if

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.920 
a little bit from several sides or if
you<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.560> several<00:01:49.860> varieties<00:01:50.369> growing<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you have several varieties growing you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.350 
you have several varieties growing you
can<00:01:52.200> take<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> little<00:01:53.040> bit<00:01:53.220> off<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.549> each<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
can take a little bit off of each and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.609 
can take a little bit off of each and
then<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.290> there's<00:01:55.470> any

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
then that way you can see if there's any

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.209 
then that way you can see if there's any
taste<00:01:56.009> difference<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.790> smell<00:01:57.090> difference

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
taste difference or smell difference

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.880 
taste difference or smell difference
sage<00:01:59.219> also<00:01:59.460> grows<00:01:59.909> wild<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.259> hills<00:02:01.710> in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
sage also grows wild in the hills in

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.440 
sage also grows wild in the hills in
Southern<00:02:02.159> California<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.000> lot<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> people

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
Southern California so a lot of people

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.100 
Southern California so a lot of people
will<00:02:03.780> harvest<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.740> well<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.750> winter

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
will harvest that as well in the winter

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.130 
will harvest that as well in the winter
time<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.160> sage<00:02:08.429> will<00:02:08.700> start<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.239> die<00:02:09.450> back<00:02:09.780> but

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
time the sage will start to die back but

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.370 
time the sage will start to die back but
it'll<00:02:10.379> come<00:02:10.649> back<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> spring
