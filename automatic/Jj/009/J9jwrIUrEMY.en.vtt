00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 it should still show you today how 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.319
 you are flirting and so are you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.030
 trophy dragon slayer will receive something 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.550
 this concludes a mission chris 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.799
 Therefore, mission is never 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.109
 missed here you see it the state 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.830
 as a webcam is quite terrible 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.830
 and then you see the beautiful captain 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.619
 and in this fight so first here so 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.830
 Smaller again every pose exaggerated 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.930
 rigoletta shelf yes the beginning I will 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.790
 tell you first kills everything you so 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.630
 if possible out of the cover 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.640
 you can already see 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 I'm just trying wildly 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 to run that does not work 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.410
 believe me this will not work you see 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.840
 Just die like me 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.039
 pointlessly betrays you know, try you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.870
 then revive somehow 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.030
 that is what you are looking for cover first 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.430
 to seek and kill everything but first 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.640
 Captain, you will look the same 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.800
 try to shoot breaks now he is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.500
 just too far away it should be 34 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.510
 and that's why first kill everything 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.040
 she finds it in your environment with it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 the whole little stuff is already gone 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.320
 annoying klepping so that the whole small 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.500
 map is gone and you are sure 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.330
 could be pretty easy from now on 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.729
 The little way is then you can 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 concentrate less on captain nimble 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.590
 I think that should come a few 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.470
 opponent but that takes only was against 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 First of all I say provoke is up 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 he comes and that's why he comes here 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.740
 for the first time after two opponents that we 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.840
 really relaxed here 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.100
 as you know, the much time wanted to let 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.860
 I'm going to follow you today 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 you see here that was already here 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.689
 That's just the best strategy 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.189
 yes, that's the first of all 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.860
 first tip I wait now first time 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.149
 is over shortly before I 22 each 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.009
 I could have increased this together 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.070
 but now it's over 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.340
 but it is not over yet try it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.020
 simply dress with a grenade 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.960
 since I'm in public like you see 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.270
 how do i go the baloise as soon as he does 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 dead is you change your weapon since you 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.700
 See, you do not arrive 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.440
 and these were the ones you see anyway 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 there you can jump away your forces 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.740
 At least victoria is coming so change 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 you to the 2 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.510
 of the sniper will the income 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.210
 You see, and there he was open for so long 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 until said Steve Waterman becomes aggressive 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.050
 have you achieved that goal 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.080
 step down and come to you 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.880
 yes this aggressive raid mode is 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.500
 so far dangerous but I have there too 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.570
 a small weapon recommendation for you 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 which one shortly before gets so here plays 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.070
 myself shortly before pretty cool and strong 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.430
 weapon and this is this one 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.410
 small teeth which now comes two wild ones 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.820
 Animals would have caught up with the gates like that 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.110
 some opponents kills where I though 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.240
 better to chill a bit and relax 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.190
 they all just from behind the border 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.500
 you want to go to these gates now 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.660
 and there the opponents I could have there 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.180
 her really really cool here 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.620
 weapons recover those weapons finds the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.360
 also here directly behind where the tons 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.340
 that is not a big request 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.870
 after the or something like liked to come shortly 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.270
 cash collected because we want to think 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.530
 and you can not find the weapons in 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.070
 this cheap toilet but in this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.020
 monster used toilet left here in so 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.710
 small animal two very beautiful 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.180
 There are three felt the bar would like it in the 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.500
 further fight history you see that now 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.630
 really from all over the floor 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.700
 somehow fire comes and you really 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.080
 We have to be careful 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.330
 Do not just look for you like me 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.950
 is indeed initially make sun also looks 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.480
 behind you and can otherwise 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.250
 just always on these types 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.200
 banner with your weapon just has it 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.730
 What keeps the best draws on 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.530
 the head that mostly relatively easy 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.360
 and her husband so far exists the life 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.250
 small safe if you have fear can 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.470
 the battles until you survive yes that is 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.360
 no general tip as these creatures 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.430
 let's save your life , I'll tell you 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.560
 if you should die yes as I said 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.450
 can also watch yet herforder 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.270
 any time is that you celebrate now red 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.210
 or something and yes his guesses are yes 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.100
 I know because you should try out 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.450
 Mainz but the experts relatively quickly 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.850
 as soon as they hit the ground 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.500
 yes, but then should be relatively fast 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.390
 this should not be a problem 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.600
 that's your back from me such 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.600
 center
