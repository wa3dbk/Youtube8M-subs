00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
so there's this really cool method of

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.259 
so there's this really cool method of
knitting<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.230> round<00:00:07.460> where<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.639> use<00:00:08.880> two

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
knitting in the round where you use two

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.720 
knitting in the round where you use two
different<00:00:09.660> circular<00:00:10.410> needles<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.950> love<00:00:11.490> this

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
different circular needles I love this

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.940 
different circular needles I love this
method<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.719> how<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> first<00:00:13.259> learned<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.769> knit

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
method it's how I first learned to knit

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.450 
method it's how I first learned to knit
socks<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.639> I'm<00:00:15.389> very<00:00:15.660> fond<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.460> some

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
socks and I'm very fond of it some

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.830 
socks and I'm very fond of it some
people<00:00:17.490> think<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:17.940> simpler<00:00:18.300> than<00:00:18.480> Magic

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
people think it's simpler than Magic

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.810 
people think it's simpler than Magic
Loop<00:00:18.990> some<00:00:19.439> people<00:00:19.680> don't<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.580> great

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
Loop some people don't but it's great

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.150 
Loop some people don't but it's great
for<00:00:21.060> knitting<00:00:21.240> any<00:00:21.630> diameter<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.010> use

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
for knitting any diameter you can use

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
for knitting any diameter you can use
this<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.580> tiny<00:00:24.240> diameters<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:24.990> large

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
this for tiny diameters or large

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.349 
this for tiny diameters or large
diameters<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> I'll<00:00:26.580> show<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.820> how<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.240> works

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
diameters and I'll show you how it works

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.050 
diameters and I'll show you how it works
so<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.800> intimidated<00:00:29.039> by<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.580> sort<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
so don't be intimidated by this sort of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
so don't be intimidated by this sort of
spider<00:00:30.449> web<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.840> things<00:00:31.109> hanging<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:31.650> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
spider web of things hanging down this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.770 
spider web of things hanging down this
is<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.579> tail<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.940> my<00:00:32.969> work<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
is just the tail of my work and this is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.840 
is just the tail of my work and this is
the<00:00:33.870> working<00:00:34.170> yarn<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.340> two

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the working yarn and then I have two

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.400 
the working yarn and then I have two
different<00:00:36.090> circulars<00:00:36.719> which<00:00:36.930> I'll<00:00:37.050> hold<00:00:37.260> out

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
different circulars which I'll hold out

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.760 
different circulars which I'll hold out
parallel<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.780> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.680> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
parallel here for you and I think that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
parallel here for you and I think that
it's<00:00:40.920> really<00:00:41.129> helpful<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> use<00:00:41.910> two<00:00:42.239> needles

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
it's really helpful to use two needles

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
it's really helpful to use two needles
that<00:00:42.719> look<00:00:42.989> different<00:00:43.500> from<00:00:43.680> each<00:00:43.800> other<00:00:43.920> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that look different from each other so

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.240 
that look different from each other so
I've<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:44.910> two<00:00:45.660> bamboos<00:00:46.260> size<00:00:46.590> five<00:00:46.920> needles

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
I've got two bamboos size five needles

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.420 
I've got two bamboos size five needles
but<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.149> has<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:49.140> darker<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> bronze

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
but one has a darker kind of bronze

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.880 
but one has a darker kind of bronze
colored<00:00:50.910> cord<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.870> other<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
colored cord and the other one has a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.279 
colored cord and the other one has a
translucent<00:00:53.760> cord<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.840> different

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
translucent cord and they are different

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.459 
translucent cord and they are different
lengths<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.199> mind

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
lengths as you can see so in my mind

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
lengths as you can see so in my mind
I've<00:00:58.649> got<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.280> long<00:00:59.489> dark<00:00:59.820> needle<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
I've got the long dark needle and the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.740 
I've got the long dark needle and the
short<00:01:00.719> see-through<00:01:01.199> needle<00:01:01.879> I'm<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> be

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
short see-through needle I'm going to be

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.609 
short see-through needle I'm going to be
working<00:01:04.110> across<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.280> front<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> work<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
working across the front of the work and

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.260 
working across the front of the work and
then<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.100> other<00:01:08.310> side<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> work<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.210> I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
then the other side of the work and I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
then the other side of the work and I
don't<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> get<00:01:09.930> too<00:01:10.110> hung<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.409> on

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
don't want you to get too hung up on

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
don't want you to get too hung up on
front<00:01:11.040> side<00:01:11.220> back<00:01:11.640> side<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.659> switch

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
front side back side because they switch

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
front side back side because they switch
every<00:01:13.290> time<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.799> I'll<00:01:13.890> say<00:01:14.159> presenting<00:01:15.090> side

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
every time but I'll say presenting side

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
every time but I'll say presenting side
and<00:01:15.689> other<00:01:15.960> side<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:16.979> gonna<00:01:17.100> work<00:01:17.310> across

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and other side so I'm gonna work across

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.700 
and other side so I'm gonna work across
here<00:01:18.229> then<00:01:19.229> across<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.820> across<00:01:21.090> here

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
here then across here then across here

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.620 
here then across here then across here
spirally<00:01:22.710> sort<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> helix<00:01:24.060> around<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
spirally sort of like a helix around and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
spirally sort of like a helix around and
around<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.990> around<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.159> would<00:01:26.220> with

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
around and around just like I would with

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.960 
around and around just like I would with
a<00:01:27.270> shorter<00:01:28.080> circular<00:01:28.530> needle<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.579> here's<00:01:29.820> how

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
a shorter circular needle so here's how

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510 
a shorter circular needle so here's how
to<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.500> kind<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.680> Magic<00:01:32.159> Loop<00:01:32.280> I'm

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
to do it kind of like Magic Loop I'm

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.580 
to do it kind of like Magic Loop I'm
going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> push<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:35.009> front<00:01:35.280> needle<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.820> so

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
going to push the the front needle in so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
going to push the the front needle in so
this<00:01:37.759> side<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> work<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this side of the of the work this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.249 
this side of the of the work this
presenting<00:01:41.100> side<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.939> work<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
presenting side of my work is on and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
presenting side of my work is on and
will<00:01:43.380> always<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.549> darker<00:01:45.210> cable<00:01:45.570> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
will always be on the darker cable so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.499 
will always be on the darker cable so
this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.590> fun<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.909> side<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.149> always

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
this is fun because this side is always

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
this is fun because this side is always
on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> darker<00:01:48.930> cable<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.530> side<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.799> always

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on the darker cable this side is always

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.109 
on the darker cable this side is always
on<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> lighter<00:01:50.340> cable<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:50.970> never

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
on the lighter cable they will never

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
on the lighter cable they will never
switch<00:01:51.450> unless<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> following<00:01:53.460> part

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
switch unless you do the following part

and<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.860> working<00:02:14.070> on<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.460> side

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and I know I'm working on this side

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.420 
and I know I'm working on this side
because<00:02:15.480> my<00:02:15.630> working<00:02:16.050> yarn<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.560> coming<00:02:16.740> from

because my working yarn is coming from

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.240 
because my working yarn is coming from
the<00:02:17.550> stitch<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:17.880> behind<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.960> one<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.860> of

the stitch just behind this one so of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.070 
the stitch just behind this one so of
course<00:02:20.670> working<00:02:20.970> across<00:02:21.300> here<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
course working across here this is the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.050 
course working across here this is the
last<00:02:22.320> stitch<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.770> worked<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.880> tell

last stitch I worked then I can tell

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.970 
last stitch I worked then I can tell
because<00:02:24.450> that's<00:02:24.630> where<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:24.900> yarn<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.350> which

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
because that's where my yarn is which

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.100 
because that's where my yarn is which
means<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.120> next<00:02:27.480> stitch<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.870> needs

means this is the next stitch that needs

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.160 
means this is the next stitch that needs

back<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:35.850> I'm<00:03:35.910> gonna<00:03:36.060> turn<00:03:37.130> now<00:03:38.130> it's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
back to it so I'm gonna turn now it's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.130 
back to it so I'm gonna turn now it's
time<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.550> do<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.790> same<00:03:39.000> thing<00:03:39.330> on<00:03:39.570> my<00:03:39.870> new

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
time to do the same thing on my new

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.710 
time to do the same thing on my new
presenting<00:03:40.830> side<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.910> side<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.360> always

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
presenting side this side is always

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.110 
presenting side this side is always
going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.050> live<00:03:43.320> on<00:03:43.620> my<00:03:44.190> translucent<00:03:44.670> needle

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
going to live on my translucent needle

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.780 
going to live on my translucent needle
so<00:03:45.630> it's<00:03:45.810> great<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.500> find<00:03:46.740> two<00:03:46.980> very<00:03:47.310> different

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
so it's great to find two very different

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.920 
so it's great to find two very different
looking<00:03:48.180> needles<00:03:48.510> but<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.530> same<00:03:49.830> diameter

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
looking needles but in the same diameter

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.750 
looking needles but in the same diameter
so<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.140> won't<00:03:52.410> get<00:03:52.620> easily<00:03:53.250> confused

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
so that you won't get easily confused

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.850 
so that you won't get easily confused
you<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:54.330> quickly<00:03:54.630> grab<00:03:54.990> it<00:03:55.500> only<00:03:55.620> takes

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
you can just quickly grab it only takes

kind of snug in together you don't have
to<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.870> could<00:04:28.990> certainly<00:04:29.230> work<00:04:29.650> with<00:04:29.680> your

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
to you could certainly work with your

to you could certainly work with your
fingers<00:04:30.280> inside<00:04:31.050> but<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.080> just<00:04:32.320> work<00:04:32.500> with

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
fingers inside but I just work with

fingers inside but I just work with
holding<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.310> together<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.210> I'm<00:04:34.300> going<00:04:34.420> to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
holding it together so I'm going to

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.480 
holding it together so I'm going to
insert<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:34.990> yarn<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:35.500> because<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.310> is<00:04:36.460> a

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
insert my yarn and because this is a

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.730 
insert my yarn and because this is a
knit<00:04:36.730> stitch<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:37.330> know<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.960> my<00:04:38.080> yarn<00:04:38.320> has<00:04:38.590> to

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
knit stitch I know that my yarn has to

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.250 
knit stitch I know that my yarn has to
be<00:04:38.920> behind<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.910> needle<00:04:40.240> but<00:04:40.750> if<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:40.960> was<00:04:41.110> going

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
be behind the needle but if I was going

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.710 
be behind the needle but if I was going
to<00:04:41.350> purl<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.950> would<00:04:42.820> want<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.120> yarn<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.360> be<00:04:43.540> in

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
to purl I would want the yarn to be in

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.360 
to purl I would want the yarn to be in
front<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.320> needle<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.010> can<00:04:45.130> wrap

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
front of the needle so that it can wrap

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.700 
front of the needle so that it can wrap
the<00:04:45.580> right<00:04:45.730> way<00:04:45.910> when<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:46.990> mess<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.380> up<00:04:47.440> you

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
the right way when you mess that up you

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.680 
the right way when you mess that up you
end<00:04:47.890> up<00:04:48.010> getting<00:04:48.130> yarn<00:04:48.580> overs<00:04:48.940> accidentally

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
end up getting yarn overs accidentally

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.420 
end up getting yarn overs accidentally
between<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:50.740> just<00:04:51.130> comes<00:04:51.310> with

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
between and that just comes with

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.730 
between and that just comes with
practice<00:04:51.930> inserting<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.050> needle<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.470> making

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
practice inserting the needle and making

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.080 
practice inserting the needle and making
sure<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.040> yarn<00:04:54.250> is<00:04:54.430> right<00:04:54.670> where<00:04:54.820> you<00:04:54.910> need<00:04:55.060> it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
sure the yarn is right where you need it

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.460 
sure the yarn is right where you need it
to<00:04:55.180> be

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
to be

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.650 
to be
every<00:04:56.470> so<00:04:56.620> often<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.190> will<00:04:57.430> capture<00:04:58.030> your

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
every so often you will capture your

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.710 
every so often you will capture your
yarn<00:04:59.260> in<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.830> cable<00:05:00.160> it's<00:05:00.790> really<00:05:01.210> simple<00:05:01.450> to

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
yarn in the cable it's really simple to

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.320 
yarn in the cable it's really simple to
just<00:05:01.930> take<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.620> out<00:05:02.910> so<00:05:03.910> I'm<00:05:04.000> gonna<00:05:04.120> work

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
cable because I'm done with that side

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.580 
cable because I'm done with that side
now<00:05:27.550> and<00:05:27.850> then<00:05:28.300> go<00:05:28.420> back<00:05:28.720> to<00:05:28.750> this<00:05:29.020> side<00:05:29.290> and

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
now and then go back to this side and

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.070 
now and then go back to this side and
repeat<00:05:30.460> so<00:05:31.330> what<00:05:31.510> you're<00:05:31.630> doing<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:31.960> you're

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
repeat so what you're doing is you're

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.320 
repeat so what you're doing is you're
working<00:05:32.230> around<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.100> around<00:05:33.160> front<00:05:34.030> back

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
working around and around front back

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.260 
working around and around front back
front<00:05:34.360> back<00:05:34.990> front<00:05:35.050> back<00:05:35.620> as<00:05:35.920> you<00:05:36.550> helix<00:05:37.030> up

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
front back front back as you helix up

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.680 
front back front back as you helix up
and<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:38.260> should<00:05:39.100> have<00:05:39.310> absolutely<00:05:39.940> no<00:05:40.300> mark

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and you should have absolutely no mark

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.180 
and you should have absolutely no mark
of<00:05:41.650> where<00:05:42.010> the<00:05:42.160> needles<00:05:42.460> join<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.860> is<00:05:45.070> how

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
of where the needles join so that is how

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.050 
of where the needles join so that is how
to<00:05:45.250> work<00:05:45.490> with<00:05:45.670> two<00:05:45.940> circular<00:05:46.660> needles
