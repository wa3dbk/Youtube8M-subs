00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.429 
using a marker that shows up well on my
fabric<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.090> tracing<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> outside<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
fabric and tracing the outside of the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
fabric and tracing the outside of the
vest<00:01:37.680> ignoring<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> bottom<00:01:38.939> edge<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
vest ignoring the bottom edge because I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.679 
vest ignoring the bottom edge because I
am<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.840> make<00:01:39.990> mine<00:01:40.229> longer<00:01:40.680> than<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.100> vest

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
am gonna make mine longer than this vest

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.149 
am gonna make mine longer than this vest
you're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> need<00:01:43.110> two<00:01:43.380> full<00:01:43.680> outlines

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you're going to need two full outlines

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520 
you're going to need two full outlines
like<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.970> traced<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.079> scooted

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
like this so I traced one and I scooted

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.120 
like this so I traced one and I scooted
it<00:01:46.680> over<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:47.310> tracing<00:01:47.610> another<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:49.130> if

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it over and I'm tracing another one if

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
it over and I'm tracing another one if
your<00:01:50.399> fur<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.880> thin<00:01:51.149> enough<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.930> fold

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
your fur is thin enough you can fold

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
your fur is thin enough you can fold
over<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.649> fabric<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> avoid<00:01:53.700> having<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
over your fabric to avoid having to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.179 
over your fabric to avoid having to
trace<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.630> multiple<00:01:55.020> times<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.619> my<00:01:55.799> fur<00:01:56.009> was

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
trace it multiple times but my fur was

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.020 
trace it multiple times but my fur was
too<00:01:56.369> thick<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.240> did<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:57.869> layer

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
too thick so I just did it in one layer

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.940 
too thick so I just did it in one layer
after<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.080> you're<00:02:00.230> gonna<00:02:00.290> cut<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:00.710> both<00:02:00.920> of

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
after that you're gonna cut out both of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.860 
after that you're gonna cut out both of
your<00:02:01.220> outlines<00:02:01.670> being<00:02:02.060> careful<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.690> make

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
your outlines being careful to make

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.080 
your outlines being careful to make
smooth<00:02:03.380> straight<00:02:03.950> cuts<00:02:04.310> because<00:02:04.670> you're<00:02:04.970> not

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
smooth straight cuts because you're not

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.390 
smooth straight cuts because you're not
going<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.660> folding<00:02:06.080> over<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.380> edges<00:02:06.890> to

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
going to be folding over the edges to

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.889 
going to be folding over the edges to
create<00:02:07.550> clean<00:02:08.000> edges<00:02:08.210> with<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.690> sewing

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
create clean edges with the sewing

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.540 
create clean edges with the sewing
machine<00:02:09.259> you're<00:02:09.740> just<00:02:09.979> going<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.310> leave<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
machine you're just going to leave the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.640 
machine you're just going to leave the
edges<00:02:10.820> as<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.240> cut<00:02:11.480> them<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.140> make<00:02:12.350> sure<00:02:12.380> you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
edges as you cut them so make sure you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.590 
edges as you cut them so make sure you
cut<00:02:12.860> them<00:02:13.040> low<00:02:13.250> when<00:02:14.030> you're<00:02:14.120> done<00:02:14.330> cutting

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
cut them low when you're done cutting

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.900 
cut them low when you're done cutting
both<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.200> them<00:02:15.320> should<00:02:15.530> look<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.010> so

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
both of them should look like this so

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.190 
both of them should look like this so
now<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.390> your<00:02:17.570> front<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.020> your<00:02:18.080> back

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
now you have your front and your back

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.020 
now you have your front and your back
piece<00:02:18.740> you're<00:02:19.040> gonna<00:02:19.190> take<00:02:19.400> your<00:02:19.520> front<00:02:19.820> piece

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
piece you're gonna take your front piece

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.030 
piece you're gonna take your front piece
and<00:02:20.240> cut<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.510> directly<00:02:21.110> down<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.560> center<00:02:21.860> like

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
and cut it directly down the center like

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.400 
and cut it directly down the center like
this<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.330> create<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.660> front<00:02:23.990> opening

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
this this will create the front opening

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.650 
this this will create the front opening
of<00:02:24.560> your<00:02:24.590> best<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.090> where<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.360> can<00:02:26.480> add

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
then that's it I lost the footage for

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.670 
then that's it I lost the footage for
this<00:02:41.330> part<00:02:41.660> but<00:02:41.870> basically<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.440> just

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
this part but basically you just

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.680 
this part but basically you just
sandwich<00:02:43.040> your<00:02:43.340> vest<00:02:43.580> together<00:02:44.000> as<00:02:44.270> if<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.570> was

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
sandwich your vest together as if it was

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.590 
sandwich your vest together as if it was
a<00:02:44.720> full<00:02:45.110> inside-out<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.010> as<00:02:46.670> always<00:02:47.330> make

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
a full inside-out this as always make

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.060 
a full inside-out this as always make
sure<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.810> when<00:02:48.110> you're<00:02:48.290> sewing<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.860> have

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
sure that when you're sewing you have

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.100 
sure that when you're sewing you have
your<00:02:49.250> fabric<00:02:49.459> right<00:02:49.850> sides<00:02:50.209> together<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.959> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
your fabric right sides together so it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.360 
your fabric right sides together so it
looks<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:51.440> you're<00:02:51.590> selling<00:02:51.950> on<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.220> wrong

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.250 
looks like you're selling on the wrong
side<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:53.270> way<00:02:53.420> when<00:02:53.570> you<00:02:53.690> flip<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:53.959> right

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
side that way when you flip it right

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.930 
side that way when you flip it right
your<00:02:54.530> seams<00:02:54.830> will<00:02:55.010> be<00:02:55.130> on<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> inside<00:02:55.700> not
