that these are high quality air
regulators<00:01:01.239> very<00:01:02.239> very<00:01:02.570> nice<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.100> can

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
regulators very very nice and you can

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.520 
regulators very very nice and you can
also<00:01:04.309> pick<00:01:04.670> these<00:01:04.910> water<00:01:05.720> filters<00:01:06.110> up<00:01:06.259> if<00:01:06.380> you

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
also pick these water filters up if you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.740 
also pick these water filters up if you
want<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.090> see<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.360> quality

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
want to but you can just see the quality

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.410 
want to but you can just see the quality
of<00:01:08.899> these<00:01:08.990> guns<00:01:09.319> very<00:01:09.679> very<00:01:10.069> nice<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
of these guns very very nice and the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.999 
of these guns very very nice and the
only<00:01:11.569> difference<00:01:11.810> between<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.500> high<00:01:12.619> volume

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
only difference between the high volume

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.620 
only difference between the high volume
low<00:01:13.039> pressure<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.819> low<00:01:14.000> volume<00:01:14.450> low

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
low pressure and the low volume low

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.230 
low pressure and the low volume low
pressure<00:01:14.660> is<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.130> amount<00:01:16.369> of<00:01:16.459> holes<00:01:16.759> here<00:01:17.209> in

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
pressure is the amount of holes here in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.630 
pressure is the amount of holes here in
the<00:01:17.539> air<00:01:17.660> cap<00:01:17.899> okay<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:18.830> if<00:01:19.009> it's<00:01:19.160> a<00:01:19.220> low<00:01:19.369> volume

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
the air cap okay so if it's a low volume

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.100 
the air cap okay so if it's a low volume
low<00:01:19.880> pressure<00:01:19.910> you<00:01:20.330> can<00:01:20.450> have<00:01:20.599> little<00:01:20.810> less

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
low pressure you can have little less

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.330 
low pressure you can have little less
holes<00:01:21.380> in<00:01:21.590> here<00:01:21.740> if<00:01:21.830> it's<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.009> high<00:01:22.130> volume

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
holes in here if it's a high volume

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.949 
holes in here if it's a high volume
pressure<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:22.940> can<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.119> more<00:01:23.420> holes<00:01:23.599> in<00:01:23.810> here

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:23.959 
pressure you can have more holes in here

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.710 
pressure you can have more holes in here
that's<00:01:24.590> about<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.069> alright<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.970> specs<00:01:26.450> on

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
that's about it alright so the specs on

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.550 
that's about it alright so the specs on

very very high quality gun you got the
little

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
little

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.430 
little
gripping<00:02:17.060> area<00:02:17.630> right<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.170> when<00:02:18.410> you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
gripping area right here so when you

I<00:02:21.020> love<00:02:21.560> spring<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> spray<00:02:22.520> gun<00:02:22.700> now<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
I love spring with the spray gun now the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.480 
I love spring with the spray gun now the
low<00:02:23.690> volume<00:02:24.200> low<00:02:24.410> pressure<00:02:24.440> version<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.340> this

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
low volume low pressure version of this

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.220 
low volume low pressure version of this
spray<00:02:25.820> gun<00:02:26.060> basically<00:02:26.930> uses<00:02:27.710> 8<00:02:27.920> CFM<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:28.970> 29<00:02:29.600> psi

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
spray gun basically uses 8 CFM at 29 psi

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.860 
spray gun basically uses 8 CFM at 29 psi
so<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> little<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.010> less<00:02:31.190> volume<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> same

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
so a little bit less volume but the same

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.380 
so a little bit less volume but the same
spring<00:02:33.200> pressures<00:02:33.590> at<00:02:33.740> 29<00:02:34.160> psi<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.030> you

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
spring pressures at 29 psi and you

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.210 
spring pressures at 29 psi and you
basically<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:35.930> get<00:02:36.170> another<00:02:36.470> nozzle<00:02:36.980> cap

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
basically just get another nozzle cap

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.130 
basically just get another nozzle cap
