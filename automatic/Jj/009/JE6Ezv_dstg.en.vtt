00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.440
 [Music] 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.900
 the premise is based on that read counter 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.000
 travels to the past in order to gather a 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.310

 of time itself but let's be honest to 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.010
 unless you are a heartfelt desire 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.290
 counter and sabah bands that sound more 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.510
 as an eccentric clothing brand that a 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.309
 two comic book characters that's why 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.800
 we have created a summary of the stories 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.649
 of these characters let's start with rap 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.290
 counter rap is the son of booster gold 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.450
 a hero from the 25th century rip 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.430
 being a time traveler has dedicated 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.410
 his life to maintain continuity in the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.539
 time without alteration and has worked 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.090
 both with buster ghost and with others 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.710
 heroes to fulfill their mission now 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.649
 let's talk about the antagonist of the saga 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.950
 band al sabah originally a Cro-Magnon 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.530
 in the prehistoric era athlete band it 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.330
 found with a meteorite this stone what 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.250
 would bathe with extreme radiation that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.150
 would give particularly two skills 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.860
 a supreme intelligence 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.350
 watching the history of humanity pass 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.360
 in front of his walking eyes he would use his 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.070
 longevity and great intelligence for 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.350
 interfere with the most powerful men 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.270
 of the earth always in order to 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.920
 control the destiny of humanity 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.260
 in this series the legend of tomorrow 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.140
 it seems that more than control seeks the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.600
 total annihilation now we go with the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.430
 main equipment ato 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.210
 this character played by brandon 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.860
 rush if the same as 'superman returns' 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.930
 I'm sorry it made Tom very sleepy 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.390
 they had already left before in the series of 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.700
 harvey flash also known as king 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.830
 palmer in the comics reid acquires his 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.780
 powers after joining pieces of a star 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.600
 dwarf with a lens with which 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.340
 shrink to tiny size 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.680
 later I would add a belt this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.750
 skill if it's weird I know it and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.970
 although many may say that atom is 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.130
 a plagiarism of armand I remind you that and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.910
 man is the plagiarism of atom since this was 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.400
 created in 1961 a year before advanced 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.500

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.790
 eccentric genius with a great fortune 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.840
 which uses its technological development among 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.910
 other things for 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.920
 create a suit that reduces it to sizes 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.620
 microscopic to fight 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.780
 white crime that annabi originally 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.209
 the comics this character is a villain 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.250
 of black caner and the eternal love of green 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.620

 cannabis is played by katie lots 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.900
 based on the character of black canon and 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.660
 also known as solange this girl 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.940
 He was reborn in the Lazarus well and although 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.590
 fight as a heroine the well may have 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.049
 left affected by what his 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 personality tends to that of a villain 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.650
 has great battle skills and 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.930
 is a fierce warrior captures with lions 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.880

 most known villains of the corridor 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.560
 scarlet lion nart was a thief 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.750
 that would be learned by neighborhood snark 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.060
 would create a hatred for barry and when leaving 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.160
 the jail would create a weapon that could 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.069
 make the atoms stop moving 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.379
 reaching the absolute zero now known 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.150
 as cat and code is a character that 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.220
 even when I've played villain and 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.290
 formed the robe gallery villains of 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.299

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.040
 the world lurks the world has always managed 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.900
 define yourself as

 police that will have a life criminal the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.200
 would steal and use a chronic pistol 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.299
 freezing bone to commit 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.989
 misdeeds although like the comics 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.790
 we wait for the redemption of leonard snap 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.010
 heatwave member of the royal air and the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.109

 fire that even came to light in 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.639
 flames to his own house would grow and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.040
 would become a fire-eater in a circus 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.230
 but his madness would lead him to burn 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.510
 circus also inspired by captan coll 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.539
 and the road micro would look for a flamethrower 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.250
 and it would become hit web in the series 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.769

 melt anything just like 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.020
 capture cold heat wave apparently 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:31.479
 will redeem as a hero or antihero 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.759
 Holger will have sounders or hacker is a 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.590
 character not so unknown that even 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.720

 who becomes an expert in 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.430
 mechanics is speculated by its history that 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.350
 it could be sidewalk but given that 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.630
 Sabedor will appear in the new tapes 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.450
 of vis and comics the character could be 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.610
 static shock or a totally new one you 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.670

 this character is composed of two 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.900
 people ron redmond and the teacher 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.820
 Martin stain within the comics this 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.070
 alias has been used by several 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.410
 carriers but the classics have always 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.630
 been roddick and martins train during a 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.950
 nuclear rum and martÃ­n accident 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.650
 would merge in a month 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.840
 with rum and controlling the body and kingfisher 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.240

 This ere has the ability to fly and 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.310
 to atomically manipulate anything 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.650
 giving it the ability to be intangible and 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.840
 of manipulating the energy in the series the 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.820
 story of comics does not vary much anymore 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.370
 that an accident also worked and 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.530
 redmond played by Rommel call 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.360
 Einstein played by Victor Garber 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.610
 the accident accelerator 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.500
 particles would join us but unlike 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.900
 of the comics these two can be 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.200
 separate to have normal lives and not 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.030
 have to go to the bathroom together and well that 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.580
 has been all for this occasion and if 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.130
 prepare their characters for a new 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.050
 adventure and now you're ready with the guide 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.480
 of main characters that will have 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.090
 this series this was a video by mister 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.660
 x are in the top comics we are in 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.660
 the next 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.409
 hello friends of the top games thanks for 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.120
 watch this video and well I'm here to 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.590
 introduce someone to you 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.340
 they thought it was imaginary that they did not 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.440
 there was 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.120
 his name is the question and it is a part 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.129
 essential here in the top comics because no 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.080
 could see no video if he does not 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.849
 it helped write the scripts so 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.979
 I leave you with him so I can explain a 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.940
 little of how the videos are made here in 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:08.800
 the top comics 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.750
 hello friends top comics I hope you know 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.520
 find out well I'm in question and 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.259
 basically I am the person in charge of 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.000
 make the first version of the 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.229
 scripts we use in the top comics 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.300
 before you start writing the script 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.340
 investigated about curious facts and 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.349
 specific details of the subject something that 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.289
 I like to do is read or reread comics 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:28.060
 related to that subject generally 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:30.550
 in this way I find a panorama 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.349
 clear and I define what course I want to follow 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.150
 the script after having finished and 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:36.639
 corrected version sent the 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.740
 I work for Mr. X , he prints the magic 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.599
 characteristic of the top comics that has 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.400
 been everything I hope to see you in a next 

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:46.030
 opportunity says goodbye to you 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:08:01.020
 friendly neighbor of question until soon 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:08:01.020
