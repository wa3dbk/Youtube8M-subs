when we were thinking you know all the
way<00:00:39.410> through<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.830> we<00:00:40.460> wanted<00:00:40.670> everything<00:00:41.030> to

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
way through it we wanted everything to

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.819 
way through it we wanted everything to
be<00:00:41.420> unique<00:00:41.900> and<00:00:42.110> one-of-a-kind

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
our big thing is the wall behind me of

our big thing is the wall behind me of
the<00:00:45.470> zebra<00:00:45.770> wood<00:00:45.920> we<00:00:46.760> really<00:00:47.000> wanted<00:00:47.270> to

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
the zebra wood we really wanted to

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.139 
the zebra wood we really wanted to
incorporate<00:00:48.110> that<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.590> then<00:00:48.770> we<00:00:48.860> have<00:00:49.010> a

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
incorporate that and then we have a

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.040 
incorporate that and then we have a
lighter

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
lighter

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.900

maple flooring to kind of bring some

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.569 
maple flooring to kind of bring some
more<00:00:53.270> light<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.600> since<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:53.989> ceiling<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.579> so

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
more light and since the ceiling is so

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.760 
more light and since the ceiling is so
dark<00:00:55.850> with<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.480> tear<00:00:56.660> drop<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.440> that's<00:00:57.649> what

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
dark with the tear drop so that's what

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.760 
dark with the tear drop so that's what
we<00:00:57.890> did<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:59.420> know<00:00:59.450> we<00:01:00.079> got<00:01:00.290> it<00:01:00.440> all<00:01:00.559> on

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
we did and you know we got it all on

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.740 
we did and you know we got it all on
paper<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.129> you<00:01:01.489> know<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.090> quotes<00:01:02.360> all<00:01:02.600> that
