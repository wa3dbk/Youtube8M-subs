00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.200 

look<00:00:00.420> here<00:00:01.110> are<00:00:01.319> two<00:00:01.500> blinking<00:00:02.010> dots<00:00:02.280> but<00:00:02.970> are

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
look here are two blinking dots but are

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.700 
look here are two blinking dots but are
they<00:00:03.389> alternating<00:00:04.259> or<00:00:04.470> blinking<00:00:04.920> together<00:00:06.710> so

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
they alternating or blinking together so

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.440 
they alternating or blinking together so
they<00:00:07.859> look<00:00:08.069> like<00:00:08.099> they're<00:00:08.429> alternating<00:00:08.790> but

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
they look like they're alternating but

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.959 
they look like they're alternating but
wife<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.870> told<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.530> were<00:00:10.650> wrong<00:00:10.889> would<00:00:11.820> you

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
wife I told you you were wrong would you

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.870 
wife I told you you were wrong would you
be<00:00:12.120> surprised<00:00:12.980> they<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.009> actually<00:00:14.670> blinking

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
be surprised they are actually blinking

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.230 
be surprised they are actually blinking
together<00:00:15.740> if<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.010> take<00:00:17.190> away<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.640> backgrounds

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
together if we take away the backgrounds

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.240 
together if we take away the backgrounds
to<00:00:18.359> each<00:00:18.480> circle<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.220> are

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
to each circle we can see that they are

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.109 
to each circle we can see that they are
blinking<00:00:20.880> together<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.340> video<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.789> all

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
blinking together so this video is all

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.050 
blinking together so this video is all
about<00:00:24.420> time<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.980> why<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.550> seems<00:00:26.910> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
about time what it is why it seems to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
about time what it is why it seems to
fly<00:00:27.300> by<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.840> sometimes<00:00:28.470> why<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.800> seems<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
fly by and sometimes why it seems to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.780 
fly by and sometimes why it seems to
stand<00:00:29.580> still<00:00:30.109> now<00:00:31.109> time<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.009> most<00:00:32.279> definitely

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
stand still now time is most definitely

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.330 
stand still now time is most definitely
not<00:00:33.030> fixed<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> constant<00:00:34.020> rate<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.860> faster

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
not fixed at a constant rate the faster

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760 
not fixed at a constant rate the faster
you<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.700> slower<00:00:36.120> time<00:00:36.570> goes<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.380> called

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you go the slower time goes is called

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.360 
you go the slower time goes is called
time<00:00:38.129> dilation<00:00:39.079> also<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.590> clock<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
time dilation also in the clock the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
time dilation also in the clock the
hours<00:00:41.760> minutes<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.300> seconds<00:00:42.870> they're<00:00:43.170> all

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
hours minutes and seconds they're all

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.580 
hours minutes and seconds they're all
man-made<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:45.450> met<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.840> an<00:00:46.170> alien<00:00:46.559> race

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
man-made if we met up with an alien race

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.920 
man-made if we met up with an alien race
is<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.489> unlikely<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.660> measure

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
is very unlikely that they will measure

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.430 
is very unlikely that they will measure
time<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> asked<00:00:51.870> Google<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
time like we do so I asked Google to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.700 
time like we do so I asked Google to
define<00:00:52.860> time<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.270> said<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.989> indefinite

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
define time and it said the indefinite

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189 
define time and it said the indefinite
continued<00:00:56.340> process<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.059> existence<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
continued process of existence and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.819 
continued process of existence and
events<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.579> past<00:00:59.820> present<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> future

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
events in the past present and future

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.830 
events in the past present and future
regarded<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> whole

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
regarded as a whole

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
regarded as a whole
this<00:01:03.840> means<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.260> time<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.830> an<00:01:04.979> object<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.850> an

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this means that time is an object or an

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.780 
this means that time is an object or an
event<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.500> past<00:01:07.770> present<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> future

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.690 

time<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.119> our<00:01:12.270> fourth<00:01:12.659> dimension<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> 3d

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
time is our fourth dimension it is a 3d

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.260 
time is our fourth dimension it is a 3d
object<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.720> exists<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.860> technically<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.759> 3d

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
object as it exists so technically a 3d

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
object as it exists so technically a 3d
object<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> 4d<00:01:19.320> object<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.220> 2d<00:01:20.640> drawing

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
object is a 4d object and a 2d drawing

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.749 
object is a 4d object and a 2d drawing
is<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> 3d<00:01:22.200> drawing<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.770> depends<00:01:23.670> on

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is actually a 3d drawing just depends on

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.429 
is actually a 3d drawing just depends on
whether<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.000> used<00:01:24.270> our<00:01:24.479> fourth<00:01:24.750> dimension

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
whether we used our fourth dimension

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.620 
whether we used our fourth dimension
when<00:01:25.590> describing<00:01:26.009> an<00:01:26.400> object<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.420> usually

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
when describing an object but we usually

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.090 
when describing an object but we usually
don't<00:01:29.930> let's<00:01:30.930> look<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.320> those<00:01:31.439> blinking<00:01:31.860> dots

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
don't let's look at those blinking dots

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.810 
don't let's look at those blinking dots
again<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:34.110> make<00:01:34.259> sense<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.799> these<00:01:34.890> events<00:01:35.430> your

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
again to make sense of these events your

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.240 
again to make sense of these events your
brain<00:01:36.150> warps<00:01:36.780> time<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.590> take<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.130> all

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
brain warps time so it can take in all

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.640 
brain warps time so it can take in all
the<00:01:38.369> detail<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> needs

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
the detail it needs

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
the detail it needs
unfortunately<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.890> gives<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> false

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
unfortunately this gives you a false

effect called the oddball effect and it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.190 
effect called the oddball effect and it
affects<00:01:49.409> about<00:01:49.649> 70%<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> people<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.020> when

affects about 70% of people this is when

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
affects about 70% of people this is when
something<00:01:52.619> strange<00:01:52.950> happens<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.880> brain

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
something strange happens your brain

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.569 
something strange happens your brain
devotes<00:01:54.600> more<00:01:54.840> neuron<00:01:55.409> resources<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
devotes more neuron resources to it and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.030 
devotes more neuron resources to it and
it<00:01:56.850> feels<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.360> saw<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:57.899> longer<00:01:58.140> so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it feels like you saw it for longer so

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.280 
it feels like you saw it for longer so
let's<00:01:59.189> play<00:01:59.460> another<00:01:59.579> game<00:02:00.030> we're<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
let's play another game we're going to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.219 
let's play another game we're going to
look<00:02:01.469> at<00:02:01.619> who's<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.159> judging<00:02:02.399> time<00:02:03.229> what

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
look at who's good at judging time what

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.929 
look at who's good at judging time what
I'm<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> counter<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
I'm going to do is have a counter that

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.820 
I'm going to do is have a counter that
counts<00:02:06.210> from<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.110> ten

and count to ten in your head then we

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:25.800 
and count to ten in your head then we
can<00:02:12.430> compare<00:02:12.820> okay<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.070> go

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810

two seconds out and if you were out

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.570 
two seconds out and if you were out
don't<00:02:34.250> worry<00:02:34.459> it's<00:02:34.819> not<00:02:35.090> about<00:02:35.390> after<00:02:35.750> all

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
don't worry it's not about after all

don't worry it's not about after all
your<00:02:37.580> brain<00:02:37.850> can<00:02:38.180> warp<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.840> slow<00:02:39.050> down<00:02:39.230> time

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
your brain can warp and slow down time

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.800 
your brain can warp and slow down time
when<00:02:39.860> something<00:02:40.100> important<00:02:40.670> happens<00:02:41.090> for

when something important happens for

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.690 
when something important happens for
example<00:02:42.290> when<00:02:42.440> driving<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.250> car<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.580> front

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
example when driving the car in front

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.880 
example when driving the car in front
you<00:02:43.940> brake<00:02:44.240> suddenly<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.020> put<00:02:45.590> your<00:02:45.680> foot

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
you brake suddenly and you put your foot

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.190 
you brake suddenly and you put your foot
on<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> brake<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.700> should<00:02:47.660> note<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.870> it's<00:02:48.170> not

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
on the brake I should note that it's not

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.770 
on the brake I should note that it's not
actually<00:02:48.740> slowing<00:02:49.160> down<00:02:49.280> time<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.450> feels

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
actually slowing down time it just feels

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.059 
actually slowing down time it just feels
like<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:53.050> there<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.170> something<00:02:54.560> else<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.830> can

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
like it there is something else that can

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.729 
like it there is something else that can
affect<00:02:55.400> time<00:02:55.670> or<00:02:55.940> at<00:02:56.090> least<00:02:56.270> seem<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.780> have<00:02:57.560> you

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
affect time or at least seem to have you

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.650 
affect time or at least seem to have you
ever<00:02:57.830> had<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.220> when<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.430> look<00:02:58.670> up<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:59.030> clock<00:02:59.420> and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
ever had it when you look up a clock and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.449 
ever had it when you look up a clock and
it<00:02:59.720> doesn't<00:03:00.050> seem<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.440> move<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.220> then<00:03:01.310> when

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
it doesn't seem to move and then when

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.920 
it doesn't seem to move and then when
you<00:03:01.580> look<00:03:01.730> back<00:03:01.910> at<00:03:02.090> your<00:03:02.209> work<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.630> sort<00:03:02.900> of

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
you look back at your work you sort of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.390 
you look back at your work you sort of
realize<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.650> think<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.100> might<00:03:04.250> be

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
realize and think that it might be

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.550 
realize and think that it might be
broken<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.910> when<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.690> look<00:03:05.900> again<00:03:06.230> you

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
broken and when you look again you

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.040 
broken and when you look again you
realize<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:06.920> everything's<00:03:07.489> fine<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.900> is

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
realize that everything's fine this is

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.840 
realize that everything's fine this is
what<00:03:09.230> happens<00:03:09.650> when<00:03:09.800> your<00:03:09.950> eyes<00:03:10.160> move<00:03:10.489> quickly

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
what happens when your eyes move quickly

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.780 
what happens when your eyes move quickly
so<00:03:11.209> here's<00:03:12.170> an<00:03:12.320> experiment<00:03:12.680> look<00:03:13.519> in<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
so here's an experiment look in the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.360 
so here's an experiment look in the
mirror<00:03:14.140> look<00:03:15.140> at<00:03:15.320> one<00:03:15.590> eye<00:03:15.620> doesn't<00:03:16.250> matter

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
mirror look at one eye doesn't matter

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.160 
mirror look at one eye doesn't matter
which<00:03:16.610> one<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.239> if<00:03:17.330> you're<00:03:17.480> having<00:03:17.690> trouble

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
which one but if you're having trouble

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.610 
which one but if you're having trouble
choosing<00:03:18.410> pick<00:03:19.190> your<00:03:19.340> left<00:03:19.550> one<00:03:20.290> now<00:03:21.290> quickly

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
choosing pick your left one now quickly

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.130 
choosing pick your left one now quickly
move<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.250> other<00:03:22.430> eye<00:03:22.459> did<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.600> see<00:03:23.900> your

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
move to the other eye did you see your

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.300 
move to the other eye did you see your
eyes<00:03:24.350> move<00:03:25.989> this<00:03:26.989> is<00:03:27.170> because<00:03:27.590> when<00:03:27.980> your<00:03:28.100> eyes

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
eyes move this is because when your eyes

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.509 
eyes move this is because when your eyes
move<00:03:28.640> quickly<00:03:28.970> your<00:03:29.360> vision<00:03:29.750> goes<00:03:29.930> blurry

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
move quickly your vision goes blurry

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.979 
move quickly your vision goes blurry
what<00:03:31.519> your<00:03:31.670> brain<00:03:31.880> does<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:32.450> little<00:03:32.870> bit

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
what your brain does in that little bit

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.780 
what your brain does in that little bit
of<00:03:33.110> lag<00:03:33.290> between<00:03:33.530> your<00:03:33.860> eyes<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.430> back<00:03:34.610> of

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
of lag between your eyes and the back of

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.759 
of lag between your eyes and the back of
your<00:03:34.850> brain<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.840> cuts<00:03:36.110> out<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.380> blurry

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
your brain is it cuts out the blurry

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.009 
your brain is it cuts out the blurry
bits<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.459> replaces<00:03:38.269> them<00:03:38.450> with<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.690> frame<00:03:38.989> of

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
bits and replaces them with the frame of

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.340 
bits and replaces them with the frame of
the<00:03:39.290> image<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.340> are<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:40.700> looking<00:03:40.940> at

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
the image that you are now looking at

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.810 
the image that you are now looking at
this<00:03:42.350> means<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:42.920> actually<00:03:43.400> look<00:03:43.610> at

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
this means that you actually look at

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.050 
this means that you actually look at
still<00:03:44.180> image<00:03:44.510> for<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.780> few<00:03:45.019> nanoseconds<00:03:46.060> this

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
still image for a few nanoseconds this

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.580 
still image for a few nanoseconds this
means<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.540> when<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.840> look<00:03:48.019> at<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.290> clock

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
means that when you look at that clock

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.740 
means that when you look at that clock
that<00:03:49.130> second<00:03:49.640> actually<00:03:50.060> lasts<00:03:50.390> slightly

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that second actually lasts slightly

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.199 
that second actually lasts slightly
longer<00:03:50.959> than<00:03:51.110> all<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.500> other<00:03:51.650> seconds<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:53.060> in

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
longer than all the other seconds but in

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.479 
longer than all the other seconds but in
reality<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:54.320> lasts<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.650> same<00:03:54.920> as<00:03:55.070> every<00:03:55.459> other

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
reality it lasts the same as every other

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.199 
reality it lasts the same as every other
second<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:58.190> amount<00:03:58.400> of<00:03:58.459> information<00:03:58.700> coming

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
second the amount of information coming

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.880 
second the amount of information coming
into<00:03:59.329> your<00:03:59.510> brain<00:03:59.810> can<00:04:00.079> actually<00:04:00.500> change<00:04:00.739> how

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
into your brain can actually change how

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.430 
into your brain can actually change how
it<00:04:01.040> feels<00:04:01.310> if<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:02.360> comes<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.840> at<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:02.989> constant

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
it feels if it comes in at a constant

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.160 
it feels if it comes in at a constant
rate<00:04:03.739> everything<00:04:04.430> will<00:04:04.730> be<00:04:04.850> fine<00:04:05.060> but<00:04:05.390> if<00:04:06.019> it

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
rate everything will be fine but if it

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.289
