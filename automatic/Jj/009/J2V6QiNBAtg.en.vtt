00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.270 

now<00:01:33.520> as<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.270> said<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.600> minute<00:01:34.840> ago<00:01:35.069> the<00:01:36.069> wings

animate<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:41.020> wings<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.649> that<00:01:41.859> will<00:01:41.979> look

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
animate the wings and that will look

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.279 
animate the wings and that will look
sick<00:01:45.090> even<00:01:46.090> though<00:01:46.179> you<00:01:46.270> can<00:01:46.420> jump<00:01:46.630> in<00:01:46.840> kind<00:01:47.109> of

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
sick even though you can jump in kind of

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:54.389 
sick even though you can jump in kind of
a<00:01:47.500> magic<00:01:47.939> way<00:01:49.170> he<00:01:50.170> fell<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.799> last<00:01:54.069> mod<00:01:54.369> of

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
a magic way he fell now the last mod of

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.319 
a magic way he fell now the last mod of
the<00:01:54.700> video<00:01:54.969> is<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.810> vampire<00:01:55.990> hunter<00:01:56.799> hammer

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the video is the vampire hunter hammer

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.999 
the video is the vampire hunter hammer
even<00:01:58.329> though<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.659> isn't<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.140> more<00:01:59.439> special

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
even though this isn't the more special

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.910 
even though this isn't the more special
since<00:02:00.909> he's<00:02:01.179> basically<00:02:01.689> vampire<00:02:02.259> royal<00:02:02.590> armor

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
since he's basically vampire royal armor

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.169 
since he's basically vampire royal armor
with<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.219> few<00:02:03.429> adjustments<00:02:04.379> of<00:02:05.379> the<00:02:05.829> stats<00:02:06.179> but

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
with a few adjustments of the stats but

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.389 
with a few adjustments of the stats but
I<00:02:07.450> still<00:02:07.719> think<00:02:07.989> the<00:02:08.410> combination<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:09.099> gear

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
I still think the combination of gear

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.000 
I still think the combination of gear
still<00:02:10.149> looks<00:02:10.360> kind<00:02:10.599> of<00:02:10.690> cool<00:02:10.899> especially<00:02:11.890> with

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
still looks kind of cool especially with

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 
still looks kind of cool especially with
the<00:02:12.099> dying<00:02:12.310> guild<00:02:12.549> crossbow<00:02:13.030> from<00:02:13.690> an<00:02:13.810> earlier

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the dying guild crossbow from an earlier

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.670 
the dying guild crossbow from an earlier
video<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:16.209> who<00:02:16.360> knows<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.989> actual<00:02:17.110> model

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
video but who knows the actual model

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.210 
video but who knows the actual model
might<00:02:18.010> change<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.019> still<00:02:20.349> very

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
might change this this is still very

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.720 
might change this this is still very
fresh<00:02:21.549> on<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.090> workshop<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.530> hopefully<00:02:24.220> it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
fresh on the workshop so hopefully it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.690 
fresh on the workshop so hopefully it
will<00:02:24.819> get<00:02:24.970> changed<00:02:25.209> or<00:02:25.690> graded<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.709> we'll<00:02:27.519> see

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
will get changed or graded and we'll see

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.479 
will get changed or graded and we'll see
some<00:02:27.940> really<00:02:28.450> sick<00:02:28.780> vampire<00:02:29.190> haunting<00:02:30.190> armor

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
some really sick vampire haunting armor

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.339 
some really sick vampire haunting armor
even<00:02:31.120> though<00:02:31.239> personally<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.870> think<00:02:32.019> this

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
even though personally I think this

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.309 
even though personally I think this
looks<00:02:32.590> awesome<00:02:32.859> as<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.780> yeah<00:02:34.959> it's

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
looks awesome as it is but yeah it's

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.530 
looks awesome as it is but yeah it's
very<00:02:35.470> simplistic<00:02:35.889> not<00:02:36.700> much<00:02:36.880> done<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.329> at

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
very simplistic not much done to it at

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.949 
very simplistic not much done to it at
all<00:02:37.750> but<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:39.370> could<00:02:39.730> be<00:02:39.849> something<00:02:40.060> great<00:02:40.420> even
