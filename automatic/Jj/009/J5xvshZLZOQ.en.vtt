00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
playing it at it's a pretty annoying to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.820 
playing it at it's a pretty annoying to
be<00:02:34.150> honest<00:02:34.660> also<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.470> want<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.680> use

somebody<00:02:36.160> else's<00:02:36.370> resources<00:02:36.970> say<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.150> don't

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
somebody else's resources say you don't

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.150 
somebody else's resources say you don't
want<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.900> your<00:02:38.050> own<00:02:38.110> property<00:02:38.709> they<00:02:39.100> can

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
want to have your own property they can

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.310 
want to have your own property they can
actually<00:02:39.520> tax<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.600> what<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.900> do<00:02:41.140> on

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
actually tax you for what you do on

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.600 
actually tax you for what you do on
their<00:02:41.650> property<00:02:42.040> which<00:02:42.190> i<00:02:42.280> think<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.520> really

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
their property which i think is really

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.250 
their property which i think is really
interesting<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.240> if<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.480> do<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> property

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
interesting so if you do have a property

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.600 
interesting so if you do have a property
and<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.380> have<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.740> very<00:02:44.860> popular<00:02:45.430> place

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
and you have it in a very popular place

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.910 
and you have it in a very popular place
a<00:02:45.940> very<00:02:46.270> high-risk<00:02:46.780> place<00:02:47.140> then<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.800> can

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
a very high-risk place then you can

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.229 
a very high-risk place then you can
actually<00:02:48.010> tax<00:02:48.340> people<00:02:48.580> very<00:02:48.880> well<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.180> you

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
actually tax people very well and you

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.150 
actually tax people very well and you
can<00:02:49.360> probably<00:02:49.570> make<00:02:49.900> money<00:02:50.170> from<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.620> so

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
can probably make money from that so

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.890 
can probably make money from that so
it's<00:02:51.400> very<00:02:51.610> high<00:02:51.850> risk<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.450> at<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> same<00:02:52.720> time

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
it's very high risk but at the same time

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.840 
it's very high risk but at the same time
high<00:02:53.140> reward<00:02:53.530> gameplay<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:54.400> takes<00:02:54.640> a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
high reward gameplay it just takes a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.150 
high reward gameplay it just takes a
long<00:02:55.150> time<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.810> takes<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.080> lot<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.290> momentum<00:02:56.620> to

long time it takes a lot of momentum to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.100 
long time it takes a lot of momentum to
actually<00:02:57.459> build<00:02:57.700> up<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.060> get<00:02:58.450> into<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.870> part

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
actually build up and get into that part

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.510 
actually build up and get into that part
of<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.260> game<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.650> fact<00:02:59.830> I<00:03:00.040> don't<00:03:00.160> have<00:03:00.310> any

because it took me days and days just to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.850 
because it took me days and days just to
get<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.959> point<00:03:05.140> where<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> probably<00:03:05.560> could

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
get to the point where I probably could

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.330 
get to the point where I probably could
PvP<00:03:06.340> well<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.820> then<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:08.050> just<00:03:08.410> died<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:09.040> just

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
PvP well and then I just died it just

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.460 
PvP well and then I just died it just
there's<00:03:09.520> absolutely<00:03:09.700> tragic<00:03:10.360> now<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.930> do<00:03:11.320> have

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
there's absolutely tragic now I do have

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.960 
there's absolutely tragic now I do have

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
nowhere near as mechanical as I was want

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.070 
nowhere near as mechanical as I was want
it<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.580> be<00:03:15.730> as<00:03:15.880> what<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.090> imagined<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.959> be

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
it to be as what I imagined it to be

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.190 
it to be as what I imagined it to be
because<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:17.980> game<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.400> be<00:03:18.430> played<00:03:18.580> on

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
because this game can be played on

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.259 
because this game can be played on

tablets on Mac on anything I think it is
a<00:03:22.299> good<00:03:22.480> game<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:22.930> just<00:03:23.170> not<00:03:23.320> very

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
a good game it's just not very

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.199 
a good game it's just not very

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
can actually kite mobs around however

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.270 
can actually kite mobs around however
with<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:34.900> control<00:03:35.380> scheme<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.769> would<00:03:35.920> expect

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
with this control scheme I would expect

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.039 
with this control scheme I would expect
to<00:03:36.400> be<00:03:36.610> able<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.820> do<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.600> can't<00:03:37.870> I

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
to be able to do that and I can't I

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.570 
to be able to do that and I can't I
cannot<00:03:38.320> kite<00:03:38.620> mobs<00:03:38.860> around<00:03:39.040> mobs<00:03:39.370> are

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
cannot kite mobs around mobs are

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.490 
cannot kite mobs around mobs are
actually<00:03:39.880> faster<00:03:40.299> than<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.780> they<00:03:41.350> will

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
actually faster than you and they will

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.259 
actually faster than you and they will
consistently<00:03:42.100> hit<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.579> over<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.000> over<00:03:43.060> again

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
consistently hit you over and over again

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.780 
consistently hit you over and over again
so<00:03:43.510> basically<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.380> game<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.829> tank<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.579> spank

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
so basically the game is tank and spank

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.819 
so basically the game is tank and spank
and<00:03:46.150> this<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.450> really<00:03:46.660> tragic<00:03:46.870> because<00:03:47.530> that

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
and this is really tragic because that

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.259 
and this is really tragic because that
kind<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.040> means<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.250> same<00:03:48.459> thing<00:03:48.489> for<00:03:48.790> PvP

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
kind of means the same thing for PvP

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.120 
kind of means the same thing for PvP
well<00:03:49.810> there's<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.230> little<00:03:50.410> bit<00:03:50.530> more<00:03:50.620> give<00:03:51.100> and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
well there's a little bit more give and

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.009 
well there's a little bit more give and
take<00:03:51.400> with<00:03:51.579> PvP<00:03:52.000> because<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.720> slow

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
take with PvP because you can slow

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.360 
take with PvP because you can slow
people<00:03:53.200> down<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.739> do<00:03:53.799> different<00:03:53.920> things<00:03:54.220> and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
people down and do different things and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.949 
people down and do different things and
you<00:03:54.459> can<00:03:54.579> have<00:03:54.610> different<00:03:54.880> sort<00:03:55.150> of<00:03:55.239> macros<00:03:55.660> in

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
you can have different sort of macros in

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.840 
you can have different sort of macros in
between<00:03:56.440> your<00:03:56.950> different<00:03:57.040> players<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.700> can

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
between your different players you can

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.640 
between your different players you can
have<00:03:58.329> sort<00:03:58.570> of<00:03:58.660> flanking<00:03:59.110> routes<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.500> blah

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
have sort of flanking routes and blah

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.030

other<00:04:00.220> PvP<00:04:00.760> strategies<00:04:01.269> it's<00:04:01.720> still<00:04:02.049> not<00:04:02.290> as

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
other PvP strategies it's still not as

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.470 
other PvP strategies it's still not as
mechanical<00:04:03.040> or<00:04:03.130> in-depth<00:04:03.579> as<00:04:03.730> other<00:04:04.150> action

mechanical or in-depth as other action
RPGs<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.140> it's<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.380> little<00:04:05.590> bit<00:04:05.680> disappointing

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
RPGs and it's a little bit disappointing

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.920 
RPGs and it's a little bit disappointing
because<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:06.760> really<00:04:06.940> simple<00:04:07.299> it<00:04:07.540> does<00:04:07.720> run

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
because it is really simple it does run

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.690 
because it is really simple it does run
very<00:04:08.230> well<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:08.890> would<00:04:08.980> expect<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.579> to

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
very well and I just would expect it to

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.670 
very well and I just would expect it to
have<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.390> sort<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.720> level<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.110> mechanics

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
have that sort of level of mechanics

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.830 
have that sort of level of mechanics
since<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.370> top-down<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.420> would<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:13.780> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
since it is top-down so I would like to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.420 
since it is top-down so I would like to

feels<00:05:48.970> like<00:05:49.120> you're<00:05:49.240> just<00:05:49.300> farming<00:05:49.750> trash<00:05:50.140> and

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
feels like you're just farming trash and

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.380 
feels like you're just farming trash and
it's<00:05:51.130> a<00:05:51.190> little<00:05:51.400> bit<00:05:51.490> tragic<00:05:51.700> because<00:05:52.150> it

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
it's a little bit tragic because it

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.330 
it's a little bit tragic because it
games<00:05:52.600> like<00:05:52.780> runescape<00:05:53.320> which<00:05:53.710> are<00:05:53.890> old<00:05:54.100> and

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
games like runescape which are old and

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.750

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
I still have honestly better mechanics

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.820 
I still have honestly better mechanics
way<00:05:57.700> deeper<00:05:58.150> systems<00:05:58.570> and<00:05:58.870> even<00:05:59.590> though<00:05:59.740> you

real-time buildings and everything it

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.040 
real-time buildings and everything it

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
still has more to do and it still

still has more to do and it still
actually<00:06:08.229> has<00:06:08.530> a<00:06:08.560> more<00:06:08.860> competitive<00:06:09.160> scene

actually has a more competitive scene
this<00:06:10.300> game<00:06:10.660> it's<00:06:10.990> promising<00:06:11.740> a<00:06:11.830> whole<00:06:11.979> lot<00:06:12.160> of

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
this game it's promising a whole lot of

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.100 
this game it's promising a whole lot of
things<00:06:12.520> but<00:06:12.789> its<00:06:12.880> overall<00:06:13.000> game<00:06:13.389> feel<00:06:13.750> isn't

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
things but its overall game feel isn't

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.570 
things but its overall game feel isn't
following<00:06:14.620> through<00:06:14.889> with<00:06:14.919> that<00:06:15.070> and<00:06:15.190> it<00:06:15.430> is

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
following through with that and it is

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.760 
following through with that and it is
alpha<00:06:16.090> so<00:06:16.539> they<00:06:16.720> can<00:06:16.930> still<00:06:17.229> tweak<00:06:17.440> some

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
alpha so they can still tweak some

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.379 
alpha so they can still tweak some
numbers<00:06:18.070> and<00:06:18.250> tweak<00:06:18.490> some<00:06:18.789> of<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.940> game<00:06:19.120> feel

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
numbers and tweak some of the game feel

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.360 
numbers and tweak some of the game feel
but<00:06:19.840> once<00:06:19.990> it<00:06:20.080> hits<00:06:20.229> beta<00:06:20.530> there's<00:06:21.070> not<00:06:21.250> gonna

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
but once it hits beta there's not gonna

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.520 
but once it hits beta there's not gonna
be<00:06:21.460> much<00:06:21.669> that<00:06:21.910> it<00:06:22.030> can<00:06:22.180> change<00:06:22.419> so<00:06:23.020> right<00:06:23.380> now

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
be much that it can change so right now

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.170 
be much that it can change so right now
I<00:06:23.560> still<00:06:23.770> have<00:06:24.160> high<00:06:24.400> hopes<00:06:24.639> so<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.030> game

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
I still have high hopes so the game

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.670 
I still have high hopes so the game
doesn't<00:06:25.539> really<00:06:25.690> need<00:06:25.870> much<00:06:25.990> optimization

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
doesn't really need much optimization

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.820 
doesn't really need much optimization
the<00:06:26.919> art<00:06:27.130> style<00:06:27.310> is<00:06:27.780> fantastic<00:06:28.780> the<00:06:29.169> audio<00:06:29.620> is

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
the art style is fantastic the audio is

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.560 
the art style is fantastic the audio is
really<00:06:30.070> good<00:06:30.400> too<00:06:30.550> I<00:06:30.639> didn't<00:06:30.880> notice<00:06:31.090> any<00:06:31.300> sort

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
really good too I didn't notice any sort

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.270 
really good too I didn't notice any sort
of<00:06:31.630> hiccups<00:06:32.020> I<00:06:32.169> cannot<00:06:32.410> even<00:06:32.680> comment<00:06:33.039> on<00:06:33.130> it

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
of hiccups I cannot even comment on it

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.650 
of hiccups I cannot even comment on it
it<00:06:33.400> is<00:06:33.430> just<00:06:33.550> really<00:06:33.850> fantastic<00:06:33.970> but<00:06:34.419> I<00:06:34.479> can

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
it is just really fantastic but I can

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.210 
it is just really fantastic but I can
say<00:06:34.900> though<00:06:35.110> that<00:06:35.289> the<00:06:35.560> game<00:06:35.680> takes<00:06:35.710> a<00:06:36.010> long

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
say though that the game takes a long

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.740 
say though that the game takes a long
time<00:06:36.250> to<00:06:36.520> get<00:06:36.729> into<00:06:36.880> so<00:06:37.330> for<00:06:37.479> my<00:06:37.570> first

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
time to get into so for my first

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.110 
time to get into so for my first
impressions<00:06:38.289> I<00:06:38.380> have<00:06:38.500> to<00:06:38.590> say<00:06:38.770> that<00:06:39.250> I'm<00:06:39.760> just

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
impressions I have to say that I'm just

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.159 
impressions I have to say that I'm just
optimistic<00:06:40.659> about<00:06:40.780> it

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
optimistic about it

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.170 
optimistic about it

around<00:06:47.080> cuz<00:06:47.349> I<00:06:47.409> think<00:06:47.620> it<00:06:47.740> could<00:06:47.919> be<00:06:47.949> a<00:06:48.069> really
