00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 beautiful picture 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 but also the intricate plot is good 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.679
 seasoned with thick atmosphere and full 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.679
 immersive gameplay 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.110
 in September 2014 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.489
 the game went on sale and every then with 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.469
 eagerly awaited the debut 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.750
 project studios could personally 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.090
 Do make sure really for 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 you are not puppies Peter damn it turned out 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.030
 such as her conceived adrian hmil age 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 we have to play for the mysterious 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.620
 a detective sex prosero who possesses 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 paranormal abilities he can 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.240
 see the past associated with certain 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.500
 items and events this particular 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.390
 feature will be key 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.430
 investigation toolkit 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.500
 mysterious occurrences in 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.259
 a small mountain town of red greek 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 Eloy found all the evidence will help 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.520
 restore events 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.520
 melting in the right order all the elements 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 chronology 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.810
 Paul Propero got in mysteriously 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.729
 a letter from a boy it's on comes fred 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.400
 greek files and immediately faced with 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:38.500
 utter solitude around not a soul 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.479
 only the rustle of leaves and the groans of the wind first 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.060
 what the player is facing is misunderstanding 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.650
 what is required of him and what is happening 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.150
 around 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.350
 developers are not in a hurry to explain 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.570
 gameplay principle 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.640
 leaving the player to guess 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.830
 self generally game puzzles and 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.500
 puzzles are simple but pretty 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.720
 entertaining and deciding their player opens 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.740
 new pieces of history occurred with 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.590
 Python Karcher 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.170
 and his family and less white spots 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.380
 stays in the plot all the more shocking 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.080
 intriguing he becomes a player not 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.010
 lead by hand on key events 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.260
 providing complete freedom for 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.480
 research but here lies two 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.520
 sides of the coin on one side 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 quite easy to miss any of 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.019
 important elements that will not allow 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.260
 eventually get to the finals and find out what 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.330
 what happened to the boy on the other 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.709
 developers motivate the player 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.470
 studies suggesting peeking 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.290
 every corner in search of hidden time and this 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.680
 one of the most important details for women is one 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.680
 damn 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.290
 the game world is simply gorgeous graphics 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.660
 without exaggeration is amazing 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.269
 developers used technology 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.400
 photogrammetry allows to impose 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.069
 digital based textures 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.709
 snapshots of real objects for this 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.750
 the studio filmed a terabyte and stuff in 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.810
 Polish Croco Mountain Range 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.060
 which formed the basis of textures for playing 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 the result was an excellent picture 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.989
 incredible beauty 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.380
 dense and thick grass covered with moss 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.360
 stone slopes autumn forest and the usual 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.519
 exterior elements don't just look 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.040
 true but even better than in 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.569
 real life 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.980
 complements the superb visual look and 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.620
 no less high-quality sound 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.540
 accompanying music from the game is 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.000
 the desire to listen even hello 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.099
 passing in-game sounds 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.590
 create a unique and disturbing 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.430
 mysterious ambien took and not puppies 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.650
 petting ter ter 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.870
 I want to go back to see again 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.700
 local beauty and touch tan 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.579
 but in the gameplay plan there are a number of points 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.069
 which are somewhat annoying 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.989
 so the probability of missing a riddle or 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.970
 does not solve the puzzle makes the player 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.489
 return to the passed location and 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.190
 re- search the county in search of 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.260
 and along with the fact that the player does not know the strength 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.480
 riddles he solved and if else 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.370
 unsolved mysteries in certain 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.260
 moment there may be a situation in 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.040
 which he simply won't know what 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.040
 do next 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.380
 really at the end awaits you gorgeous 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.959
 the final which leaves fruitful 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.850
 three hours for not thinking 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.310
 successful passage may seem 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.290
 too short a time given to us for 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.790
 dating and history in vienna 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.979
 puppies we carry curtir 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.770
 but fighting game duration is longer 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.840
 the player would probably just be bored or 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.289
 completely confused what to do 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.930
 farther 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.680
 and the game would not work so what 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.680
 she is now 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.840
 reviewer rating 8 out of 10
