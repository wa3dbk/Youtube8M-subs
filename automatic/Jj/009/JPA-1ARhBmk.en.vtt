00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 heart of the state are quite large 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.860
 I'll show you this is my hand 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.870
 four fingers and also quite deep 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 yes, and these are dirty with chocolate 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.559
 click here and you have us directly at 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.690
 video where we explain it done then 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.090
 for the filling of the liqueur in this 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.120
 case pitcher in is also rum there 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.410
 very good or the bass something not 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.090
 make the mixture too fluid then 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.570
 so something cream or liquid a 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.250
 creamy liqueur there then this does not me 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 I remember how nutella is called rasi 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.470
 the nutella and then 6 silva what if the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 liquefy liquefy the compound too 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 add cocoa 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.140
 here there is no quantity because in 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.360
 primis depends on how many chocolates 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.009
 you will never always play with a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.619
 spoon of nutella which you will add 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.950
 half a spoon then in proportion 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.350
 one and a half instead if you don't like them 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 too many spirits the buoy do not use the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.920
 Nutella 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.369
 but if you like just an inkling usatene 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 a quarter of the amount of nutella is 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.689
 if too much liquid to get it to take 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.310
 a little bitter cocoa if bitter cocoa 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.939
 to disturb because it becomes too much 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.380
 amarostico uses cocoa from the viz 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.580
 had alternatives exist alternatives 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.350
 they exist you can put it into play 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.350
 what I would like very good then 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.240
 we proceed to the preparation 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.820
 first of all with a brush that 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.000
 used only for cooking mi 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:06.310
 I recommend only for the kitchen 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 brushed with chocolate 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.770
 on the bottom of the pan the chocolate in 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.620
 question is the chocolate we have 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.400
 fulfilled on the tempering video 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.610
 of chocolate this will brush it 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:30.610
 so you should make sure that you don't 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:33.720
 form the bubbles on the edge on 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:40.240
 little heart surface 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:44.410
 ok it's time we also pass the brush 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.360
 on the edges on all edges and a job 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.370
 which must however be done to a certain one 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.769
 speed because we have to prevent the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.190
 chocolate meanwhile solidify 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.150
 too much this traffic 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.370
 of course for stuffed chocolates 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.150
 for chocolates instead they are not 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.790
 stuffed it is not necessary to make the edges e 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.760
 all this work 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.239
 ok after giving a first wall 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.060
 so we say chocolate what we have to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.910
 let's take a clean spoon e 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.810
 we pour in a modest amount of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.580
 chocolate 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.790
 in practice, chocolate should not 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.050
 arrive even in half but must a little 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.260
 cover the chocolate very well must 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:38.260
 let's form a first substrate 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:41.410
 so move the perfect spoon into 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.900
 this way then move veil col 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:50.049
 spoon with a spoon 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:53.019
 what you are using ok 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.880
 done that we put to cool i 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:00.800
 our chocolates print 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.840
 but to have done this work so 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.190
 that all the bubbles there are 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.040
 inside are pushed outwards into 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.930
 fridge there indeed let it cool to 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.760
 room temperature we do 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.330
 solidify the chocolate at a temperature 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.780
 environment 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.209
 but in the meantime we prepare the filling 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.640
 to prepare our filling for i 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.870
 our chocolates we take states 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.530
 nutella is a tablespoon of bicerin 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:35.570
 good the bicerin good olimpia thanks 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:39.350
 unfortunately, the vice lin is ending 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:44.150
 well he did nothing white that's how much 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.920
 we mix the whole as the compound 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.950
 it didn't turn out to be too liquid indeed 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.230
 rather thick I will reach it with cocoa 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.760
 bitter in sweet cocoa and now 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.820
 let's proceed with the main one 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.160
 at this point we pour the mixture one 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.160
 bosh bag with a round spout 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.550
 ok 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.950
 we close our head we do 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.950
 go down all the content 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.880
 ok 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:29.470
 we take our chocolates in that 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:34.900
 meanwhile they have learned mostly and 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:37.500
 we pour the contents of the bag 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.500
 porsche leaving a margin enough 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.500
 large 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:02.790
 very well then we take up the 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:08.960
 chocolate and fill it up for 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.960
 pour your chocolate ni 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:32.340
 so let's arrange with the spoon 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.290
 good chocolate without too much limestone 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:40.710
 I recommend it 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.710
 ok now let's wait for it to cool down 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.099
 good chocolates 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.219

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:11.560
 and with love they take it all back 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:14.080
