RC car paint the inside and then peel

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.920 
RC car paint the inside and then peel
the<00:02:32.489> outside<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.030> won't<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.269> any<00:02:33.510> overspray

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.090 
on the outside at all that's how these
canopies<00:02:36.209> were<00:02:36.239> made

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
canopies were made

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.329 
canopies were made
hope<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.220> liked<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.400> thanks<00:02:38.910> for<00:02:38.940> watching
