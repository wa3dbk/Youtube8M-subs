00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:05.310
 Our task is to determine the percentages, quantity and base. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.640
 They ask us: 150 is 25% of what number? 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.187
 In other words, 25% on any number - 

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:20.117
 let's color 25% in yellow. 

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:26.280
 25% on any number 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.680
 is equal to 150. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.207
 Thus, rates are easily noticed. We have 25% here. 

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:44.257
 So that's the percentage. 

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:47.750
 And we multiply the percentages on some basis. 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.840
 So here is the foundation. 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.293
 We obtain that the percentages multiplied by the base, 

00:00:54.293 --> 00:01:03.183
 gives us some quantity. 

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:05.800
 You can try to calculate it in mind. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.537
 It is generally said that 25% of any number 

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:11.467
 is equal to 150. 

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.443
 To make it easier to write this as 

00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:18.233
 0.25, which is the same as 25%. 

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:23.117
 0.25 by any number 

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:25.957
 is equal to 150. 

00:01:25.957 --> 00:01:28.427
 It would be interesting to think about this number 

00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:31.407
 must be greater than or less than 150. 

00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:33.897
 If we take only 25% of this figure, 

00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:36.320
 if we take 25/100 of it ... 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.663
 That is, if we take 1/4 of this number, 

00:01:38.663 --> 00:01:41.373
 because so many are 25/100 or 25% 

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:43.007
 we will get 150. 

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:45.452
 So this number must be greater than 150. 

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:48.797
 In fact it must be 4 times greater than 150. 

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:51.473
 To determine what the number is ultimately, 

00:01:51.473 --> 00:01:53.367
 we can multiply ... 

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:56.807
 Since the left and right sides are equal, 

00:01:56.807 --> 00:02:00.270
 to resolve it, we can multiply both sides by 4. 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.067
 If we say, "Look, we have some value here, 

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:04.727
 which we will multiply by 4. " 

00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:06.380
 To maintain equality, 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.703
 we need to multiply by 150 by 4. 

00:02:08.703 --> 00:02:12.187
 4 by 0.25 or 4 by 25%, 

00:02:12.187 --> 00:02:15.447
 or 4 by 1/4, is equal to 1. 

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:17.517
 This will be just 1. 

00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:20.750
 And we get that number equal to 150 at 4. 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.833
 Or equals 600. 

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:24.059
 And that's logical. 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.129
 25% of 600 is 150. 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.640
 1/4 of 600 is 150.
