for the first time their first

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.459 
for the first time their first
impression<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.850> they<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> me<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.840> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
impression that they get of me is this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.470 
impression that they get of me is this
guy<00:00:34.770> who<00:00:34.829> over<00:00:35.399> extends<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.239> dies

guy who over extends and then dies

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
guy who over extends and then dies
because<00:00:36.870> he<00:00:37.050> forgot<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> order<00:00:37.739> something<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
because he forgot to order something it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.530 
because he forgot to order something it
always<00:00:38.489> sucks<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:38.969> something<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
always sucks when something like that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
always sucks when something like that
happens<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.559> honest<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.100> don't<00:00:41.340> really

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
happens but to be honest I don't really

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180 
happens but to be honest I don't really
think<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.390> care<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.079> much<00:00:43.320> about<00:00:43.829> losing

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
think I care all that much about losing

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
think I care all that much about losing
anymore<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.660> am<00:00:45.840> okay<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.289> losing<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
anymore I really am okay with losing I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.100 
anymore I really am okay with losing I
play<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.640> fun<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> win<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
play for fun not to win I think that's a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.139 
play for fun not to win I think that's a
pretty<00:00:49.260> big<00:00:49.440> reason<00:00:49.860> why<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> rarely<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:50.940> on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
pretty big reason why I rarely go on

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.090 
pretty big reason why I rarely go on
tilts<00:00:51.600> why<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.780> never<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.379> hate<00:00:52.649> League<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
tilts why I never really hate League of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.439 
tilts why I never really hate League of
Legends<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.610> why<00:00:53.760> I've<00:00:53.879> been<00:00:54.059> playing<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.420> for

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
Legends and why I've been playing it for

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.010 
Legends and why I've been playing it for
so<00:00:54.750> long

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so long

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.020 
so long
we<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.559> losing<00:00:56.039> streaks<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.610> periods

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
we all have losing streaks or periods

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
we all have losing streaks or periods
where<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.510> don't<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.320> sometimes

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
where we just don't do well sometimes

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
where we just don't do well sometimes
it's<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.789> go<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.149> tilt<00:01:00.449> sometimes

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it's because we go on tilt sometimes

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
it's because we go on tilt sometimes
it's<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.440> bad<00:01:01.620> luck<00:01:01.649> I've<00:01:02.129> made<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.550> two<00:01:02.730> or

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it's just bad luck I've made like two or

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
it's just bad luck I've made like two or
three<00:01:02.910> videos<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> past<00:01:03.809> about<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.619> on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

tilts and about losing streaks and all
this<00:01:07.020> stuff<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.560> people<00:01:08.460> still<00:01:08.670> ask<00:01:08.850> me<00:01:09.090> all

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this stuff but people still ask me all

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
this stuff but people still ask me all
the<00:01:09.360> time<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.340> what<00:01:11.340> do<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> do

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the time you actually what do you do

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
the time you actually what do you do
when<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> losing<00:01:13.229> streak<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.650> when

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
when you go on a losing streak or when

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.080 
when you go on a losing streak or when
you<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> streak<00:01:14.520> where<00:01:14.760> you're<00:01:14.939> just

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you have a streak where you're just

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.609 
you have a streak where you're just
playing<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.570> badly<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> can't<00:01:16.380> seem

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
playing really badly and you can't seem

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.289 
playing really badly and you can't seem
to<00:01:16.650> fix<00:01:16.950> anything<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.610> honest<00:01:17.880> taking<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to fix anything to be honest taking a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.760 
to fix anything to be honest taking a
break<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.810> probably<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> best<00:01:19.439> thing<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
break it's probably the best thing you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
break it's probably the best thing you
can<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.130> whether<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
can do whether it's like going for a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.910 
can do whether it's like going for a
walk<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.200> clear<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.560> head<00:01:22.619> or

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
walk just to clear your head or

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.380 
walk just to clear your head or
something<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
something but if you really do want to
