00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 this time we have this Nokia 100 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.569
 that arrives because it does not read the sim card and the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.010
 we have inserted let's turn on the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.680
 phone 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.990
 although this is already a common fault 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.790
 that many colleagues already know how to solve 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.640
 however I will explain some that 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.770
 are starting or some user that in 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.170
 Some area has no one to repair it 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.700
 in this case they show us to be destiny 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.320
 even if they have dallas chat in the face 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.080
 it was past after rich receives 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.200
 humidity this we are going to try to 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.200
 to show 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.430
 and you can analyze what it has 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.030
 all the complete components there 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.280
 its capacitor has its capacitor 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.770
 always bring a series of four 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.860
 resistors and a capacitor is with 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.980
 that resistance that 4.7 me here is 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.260
 doing about 100 years and 50 or more and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.390
 has the values 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.400
 let's take those values ​​I have a pin 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.780
 ccm 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.470
 let's take here the values ​​of the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.470
 first resistance 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.090
 there we see 4 points 69 kilos 4.7 the 2nd 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:24.020
 98 years a next but more the third 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.780
 98 years and the last 46 years 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.690
 approximately 50 men this 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.900
 resistance 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.540
 since in here 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.190
 these first three can be cleaned if 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 they are not I can make a jumper and not 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.200
 have problem the last one would have to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.080
 replace it with a resistance of 4.7 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.090
 almost no I do not worth the tape in this case 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.340
 it's not the problem because of the resistance 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.440
 all are fine then that follows 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.240
 continues to measure what is almost always 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.730
 It occurs after a phone is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.520
 suffer humidity or sulfate and is that 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.710
 lines this as it indicates that this 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.770
 image that we are going to see here find in 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770
 Google 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.930
 there in google we have written insert but 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.630
 that a hundred this image has come out and 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.950
 when then we want it here expand 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.950
 so you can see it 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 then we can analyze something these are 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:23.819
 the continuities of electro of the sina 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.859
 here it indicates what point has contact 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.349
 each of them must pass to the other 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.450
 side the continuity of this side of 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.459
 move here and follow this last point of 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.560
 try to follow until you get to this other 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.930
 resistance that is up here like 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.349
 As indicated, each image has to pass 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.099
 until the resistance here the only one that goes 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.870
 to get here also happens here but 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.730
 it is yellow then if it comes to this 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.519
 side of the resistance because it does not happen to the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.010
 another side because it's 4.7 here and it's not 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.819
 is to make it look like you are from 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 100 ohms and 50 years that if you leave it 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.620
 move aside the line that is 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.319
 receiving this if it passes directly here 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.689
 what's wrong I have a fault it turns out 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.180
 that the line of the xlii without falling is 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.069
 reaching up to this resistance happens to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.130
 another side the resistance but here in 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.340
 this point that circle that you see 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.890
 that is a circle that is a point the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.710
 last visible point of the track here 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.510
 already internal travels below and arrives 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.220
 to the center where I should arrive by 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.560
 example in this case it would come to that this 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.970
 resistance then that the failure that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.120
 we have is this 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.310
 the fault that I have in my house is this the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.290
 line arrives here very well happens that 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.830
 resistance of 100 men passes to the other 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.480
 side and here was lost from here to last 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.360
 visible point is not having 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.670
 continuity like I would zero I tried 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.610
 continuity is to place the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.660
 Multimeter 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.460
 here we have throwing needles for example I 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.460
 I'm going to prove continuity of this point 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.260
 here has continuity to the line 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.709
 it should pass internally through the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.330
 resistance in this case 100 men 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.750
 arrives at this last test point and 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.910
 then here's this little wheel as you can see from the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.630
 resistance of the knee to the circle 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.700
 this has continuity in this case not 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.580
 and although this client have told him that 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.290
 this cell phone had no solution 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.420
 we have to get another home because 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.420
 they cleaned it they checked it they found 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.780
 nothing the fault is in that here in this 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.970
 point the humidity damages that pizza and let yourself 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.000
 continue between the resistance and this 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.800
 point I'm going to scrape here I'm going to scrape 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.080
 this point and I'm going to make a jumper 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.990
 here here and the phone would have to 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.090
 function 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.390
 as I have identified fails 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.300
 I'm just going to the farc 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.030
 I'm going to raze this point already knowing 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.930
 that what is causing is not 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.930
 having continuity 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.979
 here accept at this point 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.979
 to 5 plus 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.550
 where I want to work there 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.550
 now we just apply weird 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.610
 we already have almost another point 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.350
 if it is not able to stretch it by 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.750
 get there 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.550
 you can see there 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.550
 and they already have practice for 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.890
 it stretches from saná be 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.470
 There, for example , you can do it if you do not 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.840
 do a jumper is the least now 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.760
 the track has continuity which already 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.120
 I should read the sim card, so let's go 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.120
 it is right 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.319
 I should read it 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.820
 them doing it does not tell us insert 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:20.220
 without but they already have a signal there we see 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.020
 the work we have done to be able 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.419
 solve a fault that in another local 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.860
 they had said they had no solution for 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.919
 lack of some knowledge soon 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.840
 but I share it with you so that you do not 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.220
 let go to your jobs helpful arauca
