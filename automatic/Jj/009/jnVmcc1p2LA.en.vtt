00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.830
 What I'm going to do is install the stage 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.830
 back of the motherboard 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.400
 go in this part notice that here is the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.789
 top of the box 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.179
 we were a little published 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.300
 and always make sure before installing 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:30.789
 your motherboard to put these Latinas 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.780
 it is very easy always these holes 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.780
 little ones that see here are the holes of 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.590
 audio and they are the ones that go closest to the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.930
 parts of the pci ports to the exits 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 from pci 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.840
 this puts pressure in there 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.690
 you simply place it 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.690
 and when it's located, they put pressure on it 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.720
 to bet 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.120
 and it is already 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.790
 now let's proceed to 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.900
 install the motherboard that like them 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.690
 had shown before I already had 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.370
 I like to assemble what is 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.470
 the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:25.250
 heat sink and ram memory 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.470
 because once I 'm in the case it's like 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.550
 very complicated to do all the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.630
 operations 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.630
 over here I have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.180
 around here I have same new art 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.820
 what is unasur for word station 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.520
 and I have it 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.820
 then you have to look for guidance 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.440
 to this 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.180
 look for there are or inputs and outputs 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.409
 Y 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.530
 those are going to go 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.020
 upwards 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.990
 normal that we have enough space 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.950
 because it 's going down it's pretty big 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.909
 this is a vor that the size is called s 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.330
 s &amp; p 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.740
 which is like an extend 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.210
 to extend 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.650
 I do not remember exactly but 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.750
 notice that there he entered and with all the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.430
 space that this box has 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.040
 what was left here 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.439
 it was almost nothing to notice, the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.799
 lower fans of the rave in 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:39.760
 three and at once the heatsink starts 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.700
 of heat does not act nh 14 that is 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.340
 taking the air here is taking it 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.940
 towards the top so we were 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.460
 good with the air flow 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.410
 is pulling hot air towards 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.220
 above the hot air remember the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.870
 less dense and tends to climb 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.350
 then now since we have our 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.510
 motherboard installed here what's 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.460
 what to do is make sure to secure it with 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.010
 screws 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.920
 that depending on the socket they will be 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.740
 different for example here they always go to 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.350
 go about three for each line 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.640
 in this motherboard we have four 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.870
 lines in the x art 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.790
 normally there are three lines and in the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.640
 micro ate x 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.799
 there are also usually three lines in this 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.450
 but they are smaller so just 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.450
 they arrive until this part
