 that the pussycat instructed a new video on 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.340

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.230
 watch dogs internet and good as 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.169
 you are seeing we are going here to a 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.450
 secluded site of the city of chicago and 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.050
 as you can see there is a robot a kind of 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 robotic scorpion or whatever you want 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.940
 call it and good is a remote area 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.570
 as I have done in the city and as you see 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.559
 a little shabby a kind of base and 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.800
 good if you know who the character is 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.469
 type 1 of watch docs as this one let's say 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.090
 that is your base your base forgiveness and in one 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.989
 of the trailers of white sox it comes out 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.230
 here that there is a small war between 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.600
 bandits and type 1 and good that is 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.310
 basically from lc and well then one of 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 the strikes are these that you are seeing 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.729
 in which right now 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.280
 you see here a horse with metal music 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.649
 super cool and good this is not the only 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 interest but now as you will see more 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.750
 go ahead as I told you the robot that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 there's more you can activate from 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.039
 unlocking then achievements and missions like this 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.210
 Good thing once there are 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.210
 deactivated then I can 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.010
 show them what they do 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.409
 soon be here throws fire and 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.990
 others and then here you see the cameras that 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.430
 we have to monitor the area and few 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.020
 things more so nothing agree I leave 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.390

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.360
 it can be done without having barely passed 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.040
 many things in the game and that's so 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.909
