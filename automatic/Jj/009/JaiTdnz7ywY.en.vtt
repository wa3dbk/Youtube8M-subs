00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
- honey chatter that was only one for

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.800 
- honey chatter that was only one for
some<00:00:22.130> reason<00:00:22.480> maybe<00:00:23.480> that<00:00:23.690> was<00:00:23.780> my<00:00:25.810> reverse

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
some reason maybe that was my reverse

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
lighting projection they do fit in these

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.030 
lighting projection they do fit in these
I<00:00:35.840> tried<00:00:36.350> them<00:00:36.470> out<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:36.740> other<00:00:36.890> day<00:00:37.960> oh<00:00:38.980> as<00:00:39.980> you

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
I tried them out the other day oh as you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.690 
I tried them out the other day oh as you
can<00:00:40.220> see<00:00:40.370> I<00:00:40.400> do<00:00:40.520> have<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.079> load<00:00:42.079> resistor

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
can see I do have the load resistor

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.800 
can see I do have the load resistor
about<00:00:44.350> six<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.470> them<00:00:45.680> for<00:00:46.489> like<00:00:46.790> 24<00:00:47.210> or<00:00:47.450> 25

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
about six of them for like 24 or 25

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.810 
about six of them for like 24 or 25
dollars<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:49.190> would<00:00:49.310> have<00:00:49.430> been<00:00:49.550> cheaper<00:00:49.700> to

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
dollars it would have been cheaper to

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.710 
dollars it would have been cheaper to
get<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.829> flasher<00:00:51.829> relay<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.899> I<00:00:53.899> I<00:00:55.720> haven't

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
get the flasher relay but I I haven't

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.080 
get the flasher relay but I I haven't
looked<00:00:56.989> more<00:00:57.290> into<00:00:57.460> how<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.489> actually<00:00:58.640> hook

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
looked more into how to actually hook

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.250 
looked more into how to actually hook
that<00:00:59.329> up<00:00:59.390> or<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:01.690> want<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.780> say<00:01:02.899> it's<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
that up or I want to say it's in the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.300 
that up or I want to say it's in the
driver<00:01:03.590> side<00:01:05.770> fuse<00:01:06.770> box

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
driver side fuse box

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.879 
driver side fuse box
but<00:01:07.999> I<00:01:08.030> actually<00:01:08.479> haven't<00:01:08.840> looked<00:01:09.439> at<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.740> and

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:09.889 
but I actually haven't looked at it and

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:12.069 
but I actually haven't looked at it and
I<00:01:10.639> already<00:01:10.969> have<00:01:11.179> these<00:01:11.299> ordered<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:11.840> I<00:01:11.869> was

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
I already have these ordered so I was

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.699 
I already have these ordered so I was
like<00:01:12.229> go<00:01:12.710> ahead<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:12.920> use<00:01:13.039> them<00:01:14.499> right<00:01:15.499> here's

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
like go ahead and use them right here's

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:21.249 
like go ahead and use them right here's
a<00:01:15.829> splice<00:01:18.249> basically<00:01:19.359> two<00:01:20.359> of<00:01:20.389> these<00:01:20.630> for<00:01:21.139> each

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
a splice basically two of these for each

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.340 
a splice basically two of these for each
one<00:01:21.590> each<00:01:22.310> wire<00:01:25.719> it's<00:01:26.719> gonna<00:01:26.840> go<00:01:27.079> to<00:01:27.139> the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
one each wire it's gonna go to the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.239 
one each wire it's gonna go to the
yellow<00:01:27.709> and<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.909> black<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:30.170> brown<00:01:30.380> should<00:01:31.009> be

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
yellow and the black the brown should be

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:37.510 
yellow and the black the brown should be
the<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:34.119> it's<00:01:35.119> like<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.420> constant<00:01:36.310> it's<00:01:37.310> not

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
the the it's like the constant it's not

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.269 
the the it's like the constant it's not
the<00:01:37.670> turn<00:01:37.909> signal<00:01:38.299> voltage<00:01:38.889> turn<00:01:39.889> signal

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:40.279 
the turn signal voltage turn signal

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:43.690 
the turn signal voltage turn signal
voltage<00:01:40.609> should<00:01:40.759> be<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.029> yellow<00:01:41.209> wire<00:01:42.639> as<00:01:43.639> you

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
voltage should be the yellow wire as you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.190 
voltage should be the yellow wire as you
can<00:01:43.849> see<00:01:43.969> I'm<00:01:44.029> on<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.179> really<00:01:44.359> dirty<00:01:44.659> foot<00:01:44.990> I'm

up and show you guys the finished
product<00:02:00.560> oh<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.649> tested<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.340> whole

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
product oh the I tested the the whole

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.480 
product oh the I tested the the whole
hypo<00:02:05.090> flash<00:02:05.299> thing<00:02:05.599> yeah<00:02:06.409> this<00:02:06.829> it's<00:02:07.369> because

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
hypo flash thing yeah this it's because

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.880 
hypo flash thing yeah this it's because
these<00:02:07.849> produce<00:02:08.119> such<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> or<00:02:09.170> they<00:02:09.409> work<00:02:09.619> all

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
these produce such a or they work all

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.880 
these produce such a or they work all
such<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.659> low<00:02:11.659> power<00:02:11.959> that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
such of a low power that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.630 
such of a low power that
your<00:02:13.640> computer<00:02:14.090> reads<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.600> as<00:02:14.750> being<00:02:15.319> as<00:02:16.040> your

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
your computer reads it as being as your

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.400 
your computer reads it as being as your
stock<00:02:16.880> Bowl<00:02:17.120> being<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:20.140> there<00:02:21.140> being<00:02:21.350> a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
stock Bowl being like there being a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.050 
stock Bowl being like there being a
problem<00:02:21.560> with<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:24.370> that's<00:02:25.370> why<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.700> hyper

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
problem with it so that's why the hyper

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.380 
problem with it so that's why the hyper
flash<00:02:26.330> occurs<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:28.520> will<00:02:28.670> no<00:02:28.819> longer<00:02:28.850> occur

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
flash occurs it will no longer occur

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.270 
flash occurs it will no longer occur
once<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.720> hook<00:02:29.870> up<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.110> resistor<00:02:30.650> resistors

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
once I hook up the resistor resistors

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.949 
once I hook up the resistor resistors
gonna<00:02:31.430> make<00:02:31.670> your<00:02:31.970> computer<00:02:32.330> thank<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:32.780> oh

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
gonna make your computer thank that oh

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.770 
gonna make your computer thank that oh
the<00:02:33.709> bulbs<00:02:34.010> actin<00:02:34.400> normal<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:37.600> let's<00:02:38.600> not

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
the bulbs actin normal so let's not

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.750 
the bulbs actin normal so let's not
produce<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.170> hyper<00:02:39.350> flash<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.040> then<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.610> just

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
produce a hyper flash and then it just

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.120 
produce a hyper flash and then it just
flashes<00:02:41.120> normal<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.780> was<00:02:42.500> also<00:02:42.770> looking<00:02:42.980> at

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
flashes normal I was also looking at

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.080 
flashes normal I was also looking at
sequential<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:45.770> go<00:02:45.920> off<00:02:46.160> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
sequential so this one would go off and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.410 
sequential so this one would go off and
then<00:02:47.209> this<00:02:47.420> one<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:50.000> pretty<00:02:50.180> interesting

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
then this one it's pretty interesting

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.860 
then this one it's pretty interesting
reading<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.959> stuff<00:02:51.200> seeing<00:02:52.070> how<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.280> works

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
reading that stuff seeing how it works

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.940 
reading that stuff seeing how it works
all<00:02:53.870> right<00:02:54.050> well<00:02:54.230> I'll<00:02:54.290> post<00:02:54.530> another<00:02:54.620> video

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
all right well I'll post another video

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.890 
all right well I'll post another video
once<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.760> have<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.239> all<00:02:56.390> together

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
once I have this all together

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.310 
once I have this all together
oh<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:58.570> took<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.660> apart<00:02:59.870> with<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.100 

stupid<00:03:03.320> focus

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
all right well it's a stroke screw it's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:21.600 
all right well it's a stroke screw it's
a<00:03:14.880> sizes<00:03:15.880> 15<00:03:16.270> on<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:20.010> alright<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.070> I'm<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.400> my

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
a sizes 15 on it alright so I'm in my

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.760 
a sizes 15 on it alright so I'm in my
storage<00:03:21.940> unit<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.570> basically<00:03:22.840> what<00:03:23.650> I've

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
storage unit and basically what I've

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.800 
storage unit and basically what I've
done<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:25.620> some<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.740> these<00:03:26.860> are<00:03:27.070> LEDs<00:03:27.510> only<00:03:28.510> one

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
done is some of these are LEDs only one

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.110 
done is some of these are LEDs only one
is<00:03:29.170> actually<00:03:29.740> well<00:03:30.100> three<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.460> these<00:03:30.580> are<00:03:30.760> LEDs

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
is actually well three of these are LEDs

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.480 
is actually well three of these are LEDs
only<00:03:31.450> one<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.780> um<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.790> stock<00:03:34.420> bulb<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:36.190> I'm

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
only one is um the stock bulb and I'm

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.410 
only one is um the stock bulb and I'm
just<00:03:36.700> showing<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:37.890> guys<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.910> guys<00:03:40.060> surprised

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
just showing you guys you guys surprised

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.640 
just showing you guys you guys surprised
out<00:03:40.660> which<00:03:40.870> one<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.260> is

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.699 

alright<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.120> clearly<00:03:46.120> three<00:03:46.810> are<00:03:47.140> brighter

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
alright so clearly three are brighter

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.949 
alright so clearly three are brighter
than<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.250> one<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:51.850> one<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.390> course<00:03:52.420> being

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
than the one this one of course being

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.010 
than the one this one of course being
the<00:03:53.220> stock<00:03:54.220> bulb<00:03:55.890> these<00:03:56.890> being<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.780> LEDs<00:03:58.780> as

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
the stock bulb these being the LEDs as

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.830 
the stock bulb these being the LEDs as
well<00:03:59.200> as<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.470> one<00:03:59.650> over<00:03:59.920> there<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.840> these

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
well as that one over there and these

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.970 
well as that one over there and these
LEDs<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.530> got<00:04:02.740> off<00:04:02.860> eBay<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:07.470> don't<00:04:08.470> remember<00:04:08.740> how

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
LEDs I got off eBay I don't remember how

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.500 
LEDs I got off eBay I don't remember how
much<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.280> paid<00:04:09.310> for<00:04:09.700> them<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.910> want<00:04:10.240> to<00:04:10.300> say

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
much I paid for them I want to say

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.110 
much I paid for them I want to say
there's<00:04:10.720> probably<00:04:10.980> 30<00:04:11.980> for<00:04:12.370> two<00:04:12.550> or<00:04:12.820> something

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
there's probably 30 for two or something

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:21.930 
there's probably 30 for two or something
like<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.769> they're<00:04:17.580> they<00:04:18.580> are<00:04:20.549> similar<00:04:21.549> to

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
like that they're they are similar to

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.430 
like that they're they are similar to
these<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:22.870> have<00:04:22.960> in<00:04:23.320> my<00:04:25.050> for<00:04:26.050> my<00:04:26.169> reverse

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
these that I have in my for my reverse

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.980 
these that I have in my for my reverse
lights<00:04:27.030> except<00:04:28.030> these<00:04:28.150> are<00:04:28.330> 30<00:04:28.510> watt<00:04:28.690> these

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
lights except these are 30 watt these

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.270 
lights except these are 30 watt these
are<00:04:29.169> 60<00:04:30.660> these<00:04:31.660> only<00:04:31.960> contain<00:04:32.350> one<00:04:32.380> LED<00:04:33.100> on

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
are 60 these only contain one LED on

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.630 
are 60 these only contain one LED on
around<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:34.330> each<00:04:34.570> side<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.470> for<00:04:35.950> going<00:04:36.520> all

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
around on each side so for going all

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.030 
around on each side so for going all
around<00:04:36.760> this<00:04:37.480> one<00:04:37.690> contains<00:04:38.080> two<00:04:38.410> on<00:04:38.830> each

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
around this one contains two on each

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.170 
around this one contains two on each
side<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.340> eight<00:04:42.960> 360<00:04:43.960> degree<00:04:44.560> lighting

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
in contact with the ground wire so I'm

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.350 
in contact with the ground wire so I'm
gonna<00:06:00.430> try<00:06:01.430> it<00:06:01.490> again<00:06:01.610> and<00:06:02.830> I'll<00:06:03.830> post<00:06:04.360> video

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
gonna try it again and I'll post video

they<00:07:00.650> weren't<00:07:00.860> cutting<00:07:01.159> through<00:07:01.430> the<00:07:01.520> wire<00:07:01.729> so

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
they weren't cutting through the wire so

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.149 
they weren't cutting through the wire so
I<00:07:02.090> had<00:07:02.180> to<00:07:02.300> cut<00:07:02.449> the<00:07:02.569> wire<00:07:02.719> a<00:07:03.289> little<00:07:03.860> bit<00:07:03.949> of<00:07:04.039> it

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:04.159 
I had to cut the wire a little bit of it

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.050 
I had to cut the wire a little bit of it
myself<00:07:04.310> to<00:07:04.759> expose<00:07:05.090> the<00:07:05.270> wire<00:07:05.509> I'd<00:07:06.229> cut<00:07:06.650> the

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
myself to expose the wire I'd cut the

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.719 
myself to expose the wire I'd cut the
plastic<00:07:08.060> that<00:07:08.180> is<00:07:08.330> to<00:07:08.479> get<00:07:08.780> to<00:07:08.840> the<00:07:08.900> wire

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
plastic that is to get to the wire

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.950 
plastic that is to get to the wire
they're<00:07:10.729> working<00:07:11.090> now<00:07:11.120> I'm<00:07:11.419> just<00:07:11.569> gonna<00:07:11.689> mount
