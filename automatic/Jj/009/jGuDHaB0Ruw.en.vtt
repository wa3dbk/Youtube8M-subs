00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
four nil that was odd i think is our

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500 
four nil that was odd i think is our
highest<00:02:34.620> defeat<00:02:35.130> I'm<00:02:35.730> not<00:02:35.820> sure<00:02:35.910> our<00:02:36.180> record

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
highest defeat I'm not sure our record

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.370 
highest defeat I'm not sure our record
is<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.750> moment<00:02:36.960> think<00:02:37.080> we've<00:02:37.170> got<00:02:37.260> like

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
is at the moment think we've got like

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.620 
is at the moment think we've got like
four<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:37.650> five<00:02:37.710> wins<00:02:38.130> two<00:02:38.520> losses<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.540> not

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
four or five wins two losses so it's not

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.480 
four or five wins two losses so it's not
too<00:02:39.810> bad<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.560> got<00:02:40.710> all<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.040> gotta<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.280> try

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
too bad you got all you gotta do is try

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.970 
too bad you got all you gotta do is try
and<00:02:41.520> win<00:02:41.970> more<00:02:42.180> games<00:02:42.300> than<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.630> lose<00:02:42.980> anyway

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
and win more games than you lose anyway

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.560 
and win more games than you lose anyway
we<00:02:44.070> didn't<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> change<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.670> squad<00:02:44.970> and

we didn't have to change the squad and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.060 
we didn't have to change the squad and
we<00:02:45.660> jumped<00:02:45.930> into<00:02:46.080> our<00:02:46.350> final<00:02:46.830> game<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:46.950> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480

vertige went through it got a little bit
lucky<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.530> think<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.770> goal<00:03:07.920> was<00:03:07.950> deflected<00:03:08.550> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
then that made it one nil and then this

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.590 
then that made it one nil and then this

then made it six all we got saved down
and<00:04:56.070> you're<00:04:56.190> probably<00:04:56.280> thinking<00:04:56.520> no<00:04:56.730> he's

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and you're probably thinking no he's

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.760 
and you're probably thinking no he's
missed<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.450> penalty<00:04:57.570> don't<00:04:58.020> worry<00:04:58.170> but<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.590> do

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
missed a penalty don't worry but I do

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.890 
missed a penalty don't worry but I do
actually<00:04:59.070> end<00:04:59.520> up<00:04:59.820> sliding<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.300> that<00:05:00.450> all<00:05:00.600> the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
actually end up sliding it that all the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.570 
actually end up sliding it that all the
pressure<00:05:01.140> is<00:05:01.290> on<00:05:01.380> me<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.560> thought<00:05:01.800> I've<00:05:02.010> missed

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
pressure is on me I thought I've missed

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.430 
pressure is on me I thought I've missed
two<00:05:02.790> or<00:05:02.880> three<00:05:03.120> penalties<00:05:04.020> already<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.410> I

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
two or three penalties already so I

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.960 
two or three penalties already so I
really<00:05:04.860> really<00:05:05.100> do<00:05:05.220> need<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.430> slot<00:05:05.670> this<00:05:05.790> one

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
really really do need to slot this one

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.550 
really really do need to slot this one
and<00:05:06.180> thankfully<00:05:06.840> i<00:05:07.050> think<00:05:07.230> it<00:05:07.320> was<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.440> the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
and thankfully i think it was in the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.950 
and thankfully i think it was in the
bowler<00:05:07.770> who<00:05:08.010> had<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.220> best<00:05:08.400> party<00:05:08.520> stats

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
bowler who had the best party stats

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.720 
bowler who had the best party stats

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
steps up smashed it in sort of the top

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.100 
steps up smashed it in sort of the top

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
show you now if you put it that position

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.440 
show you now if you put it that position
there<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.540> the<00:05:16.200> keeper<00:05:16.380> dives<00:05:16.710> right<00:05:16.830> then<00:05:17.820> you

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
there if the keeper dives right then you

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.760 
there if the keeper dives right then you
can't<00:05:18.720> get<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:18.960> if<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.170> dive<00:05:19.440> straight

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
can't get it and if you dive straight

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.220 
can't get it and if you dive straight
then<00:05:20.100> you<00:05:20.160> can't<00:05:20.340> get<00:05:20.460> any<00:05:20.580> way<00:05:20.730> then<00:05:21.420> in<00:05:21.750> the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
then you can't get any way then in the

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.470 
then you can't get any way then in the
90th<00:05:22.830> minute<00:05:23.010> be<00:05:23.490> Straub<00:05:23.880> running<00:05:24.240> down<00:05:24.360> the

90th minute be Straub running down the
wing<00:05:24.630> can<00:05:24.930> you<00:05:24.990> make<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.320> 76<00:05:25.830> I<00:05:26.040> thought<00:05:26.220> why

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
wing can you make it 76 I thought why

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.730 
wing can you make it 76 I thought why
not<00:05:26.460> have<00:05:26.730> a<00:05:26.760> crack<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.240> he<00:05:27.330> absolutely

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
not have a crack and he absolutely

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.470 
not have a crack and he absolutely
smashes<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.890> top<00:05:29.160> corner<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.120> was<00:05:30.270> going

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
smashes it top corner and I was going

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.300 
smashes it top corner and I was going
absolutely<00:05:30.690> ballistic<00:05:31.230> at<00:05:31.500> this<00:05:31.620> point<00:05:31.860> this

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
absolutely ballistic at this point this

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.620 
absolutely ballistic at this point this
is<00:05:32.370> probably<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.730> greatest<00:05:32.910> comeback<00:05:33.420> the

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
is probably the greatest comeback the

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.590 
is probably the greatest comeback the
world<00:05:33.810> has<00:05:33.930> ever<00:05:34.050> seen<00:05:34.460> 76<00:05:35.460> we<00:05:35.610> were<00:05:35.640> like<00:05:35.850> to
