the last episode and with a pkp pecheneg
actually<00:00:54.749> it<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.499> pretty<00:00:55.649> easy<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.420> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
actually it was pretty easy actually so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.359 
actually it was pretty easy actually so
I'm<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.229> in<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.129> just

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
I'm like in see right here I just

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.219 
I'm like in see right here I just
actually<00:00:59.819> joined<00:01:00.299> the<00:01:00.420> game<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> saw<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
actually joined the game and I saw the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.009 
actually joined the game and I saw the
Basel<00:01:01.559> heli<00:01:01.799> pilot<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.449> was<00:01:03.449> pretty<00:01:03.719> easy

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
Basel heli pilot and was pretty easy

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.760 
Basel heli pilot and was pretty easy
actually<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.769> him<00:01:04.859> out<00:01:05.039> um<00:01:06.200> I've<00:01:07.200> tried<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
actually to get him out um I've tried it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.120 
actually to get him out um I've tried it
in<00:01:07.890> another<00:01:08.250> game<00:01:08.609> before<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.799> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> got

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
in another game before but I kind of got

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.899 
in another game before but I kind of got
unlucky<00:01:11.579> because<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:13.020> pilot<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.909> flying

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
unlucky because the pilot was flying

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.959 
unlucky because the pilot was flying
like<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.780> safe<00:01:16.109> route<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.740> he<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.369> always<00:01:17.579> up

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
like the safe route and he was always up

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.899 
like the safe route and he was always up
in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.240> air<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.659> too<00:01:18.719> high<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.670> kind<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
in the air way too high so that kind of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
in the air way too high so that kind of
sucked<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> won't<00:01:21.840> try<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.259> herself

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
sucked but if you won't try for herself

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.319 
sucked but if you won't try for herself
and<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.159> you're<00:01:23.189> using<00:01:23.429> a<00:01:23.640> light<00:01:23.850> machine<00:01:24.119> gun

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
and if you're using a light machine gun

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.209 
and if you're using a light machine gun
the<00:01:24.509> bipod<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.320> beneficial<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
the bipod is really beneficial for that

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.999 
the bipod is really beneficial for that
so<00:01:26.609> I<00:01:27.079> could<00:01:28.079> definitely<00:01:28.229> recommend<00:01:29.009> using<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
so I could definitely recommend using it

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.889 
so I could definitely recommend using it
like<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.039> said<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.280> certainly<00:01:32.670> had<00:01:33.149> no<00:01:33.179> like

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
like I said I certainly had no like

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.380 
like I said I certainly had no like
opportunity<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> show<00:01:34.859> to<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.130> guys<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
opportunity to show to you guys but and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
opportunity to show to you guys but and
like<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> said<00:01:37.170> bipod<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.249> help<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> lot

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
like I said bipod will help you a lot

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
like I said bipod will help you a lot
and<00:01:39.179> the<00:01:39.420> initial<00:01:39.749> recoil<00:01:40.140> might<00:01:40.409> kick<00:01:40.679> you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and the initial recoil might kick you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
and the initial recoil might kick you
off<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.249> after<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.119> were<00:01:42.329> pretty

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
off but after that you were pretty

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
off but after that you were pretty
you'll<00:01:43.469> have<00:01:43.679> a<00:01:43.710> pretty<00:01:44.069> easy<00:01:44.249> time<00:01:44.460> staying

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you'll have a pretty easy time staying

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.599 
you'll have a pretty easy time staying
on<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:44.969> target<00:01:45.179> and<00:01:45.710> snakes<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:47.009> compiled<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
on the target and snakes like compiled a

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.940 
on the target and snakes like compiled a
lot<00:01:47.759> easier<00:01:47.969> I<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> minimum<00:01:49.409> damage<00:01:49.619> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
lot easier I think the minimum damage of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.999 
lot easier I think the minimum damage of
the<00:01:49.979> pkp<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:51.210> 20<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:51.960> 22<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> will

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the pkp is about 20 or 22 so you will

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.750 
the pkp is about 20 or 22 so you will
have<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.729> put<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.240> five<00:01:54.569> shots

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
have to put down five shots

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.900 
have to put down five shots
in<00:01:56.450> order<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.690> kill<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.020> pilot<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:58.070> rate

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
in order to kill the pilot and the rate
