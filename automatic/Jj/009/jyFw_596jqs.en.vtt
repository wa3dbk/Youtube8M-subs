the<00:01:28.030> sackboy<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.570> everything<00:01:28.870> feels<00:01:29.440> just

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
like normal doesn't feel any different I

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.030 
like normal doesn't feel any different I
think<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.110> makes<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.470> this<00:01:32.620> can<00:01:32.799> be<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:32.979> really

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
think that makes it this can be a really

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.820 
think that makes it this can be a really
good<00:01:33.460> job<00:01:33.700> making<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.930> onto<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.260> PS<00:01:35.620> Vita

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
good job making it onto the PS Vita

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.850 
good job making it onto the PS Vita
because<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.549> isn't<00:01:36.790> made<00:01:36.970> by<00:01:37.000> Media<00:01:37.510> Molecule

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
because it isn't made by Media Molecule

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.310 
because it isn't made by Media Molecule

whatever color you choose but you can
actually<00:01:52.150> push<00:01:52.540> up<00:01:52.690> these<00:01:52.810> blocks<00:01:53.170> by<00:01:53.440> sliding

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
actually push up these blocks by sliding

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.980 
actually push up these blocks by sliding
your<00:01:54.430> finger<00:01:54.760> on<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.909> back<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.390> pushing<00:01:55.869> up

your finger on the back and pushing up
like<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.790> think<00:01:58.450> they<00:01:58.990> have<00:01:59.020> done<00:01:59.380> a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
like that and I think they have done a

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.679 
like that and I think they have done a
great<00:01:59.710> job<00:01:59.860> actually<00:02:00.250> optimizing<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.210> ps3<00:02:01.600> as

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
great job actually optimizing the ps3 as

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.320 
great job actually optimizing the ps3 as
