00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.329
 then first of all we must have a very small ball + 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.189
 or in any case of the color with which we wish to make our horse 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.109
 shovel we have to split perfectly in half 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.489
 penny a part of the whale will serve us to make the horse of the earring a 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.509
 right and jump the horse of the victims left and then 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.019
 two equal parts in short 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.740
 now what we have to do as the first dancer 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 the dawn of the aurors as if they were sent but always keeping it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.570
 quite high so in theory 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.949
 last exam of elements amount 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.890
 and then slowly we begin a form of addiction 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.610
 a little bit s 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 now the upper part crushes month 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.940
 so in this way 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.390
 while the central part left it quite tales of these shit 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.410
 this year 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 the same thing we do for the necklace I was joking 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.680
 there is the queue what will then be the tail 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.239
 because I love you so 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.170
 at this point we start to get it right 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.200
 the give them 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.500
 a shape with a little more piggyback 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.180
 so here we will do it 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.690
 and then I try to 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.580
 to fold 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300
 in this way 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.300
 as if it were the face of a duck 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.710
 tail 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.590
 of our horse will be this then thins a little 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.180
 full 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.250
 because in any case it will be a tapered tail, this is just a sketch of the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.250
 our 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.610
 horse 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.150
 &amp; amp 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.240
 last exam a bit 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 forward 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.250
 Patras 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.150
 very stylized 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.420
 we have to get a hook 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.659
 because the mitad be hooked because otherwise later when we finish the Russian 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.040
 Ignazio and as usual, share passerby 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.460
 tonight all so now 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.649
 battery of my gazette I did before 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.649
 now I insert malatesta 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.979
 trying not to do damage 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.959
 here it is 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.919
 and then I continue to do the same job, I have to model it 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.269
 then to make it model it appoint my friend's touch 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.609
 teases teeth 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:36.499
 then 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.539
 I press it a little I had to do that 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.539
 believe the curvature of the 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.729
 here you are sorry 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.779
 of the horse 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.319
 water from the air in an instant 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.579
 in short, you must try to give it 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.959
 a shape as similar as possible 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 the face of a duck fiat 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.889
 it has a semicircle for the belly and a spaghetti to make the tail 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.970
 imagine these things put together and then the rest will come from if and why one 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.860
 Once you give these shapes then a hand shaping them trying to understand 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:20.309
 the right way vieron let's say to position them 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.749
 we will be able to pay for the form that must be 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.309
 found this here 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:32.209
 but then our envelope has now given that it is not a duck cuts the final part 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:32.559
 of the 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.469
 the master 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.469
 hotmail account 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.119
 the arena - art. 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.179
 now we have to switch to the decorations 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.619
 and I will make decorations with a purple 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.619
 connery glitter that is very soft 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.169
 and then what I will do I will say 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.199
 lie 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.799
 if so called the seahorse 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.069
 so brando this purple beast on the table 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.339
 mechanically I request a shape 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.339
 to the trapeze 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.429
 if you cross a triangle now it will become a trapezoid 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.989
 then I leave the final part 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.989
 crushed one for you - help 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.860
 the part that went so flat here has become practically a 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.599
 triangle of terror in the trapeze 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.599
 but they have it that way 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.419
 here it is 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.689
 di resta bormac 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.669
 now those little help 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.120
 anna bearer more evident and crushed 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.349
 this part 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.349
 to the trapeze 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.050
 the seahorse is to be placed 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.699
 well now let's take so many tiny purple balls 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.069
 in stadiums jamo the way on which on all ours 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.120
 seahorse then 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.319
 now we put them slowly 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.319
 so 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.499
 and then the holes and oar 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:30.729
 precisely with a toothpick 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.339
 then 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.339
 I don't have one 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.559
 and then the hole 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.790
 I make houses for you in all the other areas I filled the whole horse 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.120
 marine with these balls pitted 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.720
 place it 3 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.610
 of a different size on the head a large a medium one small 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.940
 now with the burello toothpick the spaces plug the balls and balls made 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.400
 et toi finally with a cutter 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.419
 drawing 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.599
 the pine cones 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:05.629
 then 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.629
 I do the tai chi this way 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:16.779
 kasia carrageenan however the idea of ​​fins 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:18.310
 at the end 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.349
 I'll put a black ball in here 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.059
 to make eye with white dot 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:27.550
 and then mass seahorse will be over bye
