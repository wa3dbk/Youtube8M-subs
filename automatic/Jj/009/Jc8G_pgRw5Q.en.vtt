00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.950
 easy fast and refreshing I've 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.450

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.910
 simply some ideas some containers 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.200
 similar to this one for our drinks 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.480
 let's use different 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.110
 combinations of fruits I use the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.490
 next to give first I used 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.160
 raspberries and lemon 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.440

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.230
 pineapple and mint you can use the 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.350
 aromatic leaves that you want for example 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.280
 metal for all these drinks we are going to 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.059

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.700
 sugar or any type of sweetener 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.500
