00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
be used for the african-american skin

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.399 
be used for the african-american skin
tone<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.700> cause<00:01:24.409> more

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
tone because it can cause more

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.280 
tone because it can cause more
hyperpigmentation<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.729> plus<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.540> stimulates

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
hyperpigmentation a plus it stimulates

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.149 
hyperpigmentation a plus it stimulates
collagen

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.420 

so<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> helps<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.659> fine<00:01:33.899> lines<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.619> pores<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so it helps with fine lines and pores I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.240 
so it helps with fine lines and pores I
know<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> sure<00:01:36.719> thing<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.289> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
know that this is a sure thing and that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
know that this is a sure thing and that
one<00:01:38.430> she<00:01:38.640> does<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> procedure<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:40.350> will

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
one she does the procedure they will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.969 
one she does the procedure they will
begin<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.979> fade<00:01:41.220> right<00:01:41.700> away<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
begin to fade right away and that if I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
begin to fade right away and that if I

and<00:01:49.679> after<00:01:50.399> photos<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.539> takes<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> three

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and after photos it takes two to three

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.559 
and after photos it takes two to three
weeks<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.799> full<00:01:53.100> results<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.299> brown

weeks for full results and the brown

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.960 
weeks for full results and the brown
spots<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> look<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.710> little<00:01:55.740> darker<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> then
