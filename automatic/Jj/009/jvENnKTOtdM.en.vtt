00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
recognize that this lick will sound

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.790 
recognize that this lick will sound
great<00:00:57.280> over<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.300> a7<00:00:58.960> but<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.170> won't<00:00:59.379> sound<00:00:59.649> so

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
great over the a7 but it won't sound so

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.040 
great over the a7 but it won't sound so
good<00:01:00.070> over<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.370> d7<00:01:00.910> because<00:01:01.660> you're<00:01:01.809> playing

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
good over the d7 because you're playing

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.070
