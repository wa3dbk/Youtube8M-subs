stockinette<00:01:05.760> stitch<00:01:05.939> which<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> standard

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
stockinette stitch which is the standard

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.980 
stockinette stitch which is the standard
knit<00:01:08.130> stitch<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.330> sweaters<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
knit stitch that you see on sweaters and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.929 
knit stitch that you see on sweaters and
so<00:01:12.990> basically<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.760> your

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so basically from now on in your

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.510 
so basically from now on in your
stockinette<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.439> pearl<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> stay

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
stockinette the pearl is going to stay

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.480 
stockinette the pearl is going to stay
the<00:01:17.759> same<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.650> then<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.830> will<00:01:20.070> stay<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> same

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the same and then it will stay the same

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
the same and then it will stay the same
but<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.240> knit<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.869> knitting<00:01:22.080> from

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
but the knit will be knitting from

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.719 
but the knit will be knitting from
behind<00:01:23.360> rather<00:01:24.360> than<00:01:24.720> from<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> front<00:01:25.799> so

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
behind rather than from the front so

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.840 
behind rather than from the front so
when<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.150> flip<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.259> pattern<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> flip

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
when I flip the pattern here when I flip

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.030 
when I flip the pattern here when I flip

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.290 
take it off and there and you can see
how<00:02:08.350> fast<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:08.830> can<00:02:09.039> get<00:02:09.310> let<00:02:09.910> me<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.149> my

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
how fast this can get let me get my

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.530 
how fast this can get let me get my
speed<00:02:10.600> up<00:02:10.750> here<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.850> get<00:02:12.970> very<00:02:13.030> fast

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
speed up here so this can get very fast

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.320 
speed up here so this can get very fast
and<00:02:13.930> easy<00:02:14.230> which<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.490> whole<00:02:15.700> reason<00:02:15.730> for

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
and easy which is the whole reason for

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.730 
and easy which is the whole reason for
doing<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.570> method<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.170> knitting<00:02:17.560> because

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
doing this method of knitting because

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.620 
doing this method of knitting because
you're<00:02:18.190> not<00:02:18.340> twisting<00:02:18.940> anything

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
you're not twisting anything

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.560 
you're not twisting anything
the<00:02:20.020> usual<00:02:20.740> continental<00:02:21.310> purl<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:22.030> something

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
the usual continental purl is something

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.890 
the usual continental purl is something
like<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:24.270> okay<00:02:25.410> which<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:27.570> again<00:02:28.570> I'm<00:02:28.720> not

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
like that okay which is again I'm not

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.480 
like that okay which is again I'm not
used<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.230> doing<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.650> but<00:02:29.860> it's<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.160> lot<00:02:30.340> more

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
used to doing it but it's a lot more

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.699 
used to doing it but it's a lot more
complicated<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:32.140> not<00:02:32.320> nearly<00:02:32.590> as

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
complicated and it's not nearly as

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.480 
complicated and it's not nearly as
efficient<00:02:34.290> I'll<00:02:35.290> show<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.860> advantage<00:02:36.370> of

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
efficient I'll show you the advantage of

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
efficient I'll show you the advantage of
that<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.120> second<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:41.459> again<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.510> would

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
that in a second but there again I would

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.920 
that in a second but there again I would
not<00:02:43.540> want<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.050> do<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.470> for<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> whole<00:02:45.459> sweater

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
not want to do this for a whole sweater

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.170 
not want to do this for a whole sweater
but<00:02:46.930> okay<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.800> I'm<00:02:47.890> gonna<00:02:48.040> turn<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.459> work<00:02:48.640> now

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
but okay so I'm gonna turn the work now

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.229 
but okay so I'm gonna turn the work now
what<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.200> purling<00:02:50.860> does<00:02:51.160> is<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:52.120> it

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
what what that purling does is that it

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.690 
what what that purling does is that it
keeps<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.380> stitches<00:02:53.830> oriented<00:02:54.459> in<00:02:54.610> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
keeps the the stitches oriented in the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.270 
keeps the the stitches oriented in the
same<00:02:54.760> direction<00:02:54.970> all<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.540> time<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.650> with

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
same direction all the time so that with

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.250 
same direction all the time so that with
that<00:02:57.519> men<00:02:57.790> method<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.420> continental<00:02:58.840> knitting

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
that men method of continental knitting

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.800 
that men method of continental knitting
you're<00:03:00.070> always<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.000> be<00:03:01.090> knitting<00:03:01.450> from

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
you're always going to be knitting from

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.509 
you're always going to be knitting from
the<00:03:01.930> front<00:03:02.260> okay

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
the front okay

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.880 
the front okay
which<00:03:03.940> also<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.510> very<00:03:04.750> easy<00:03:05.080> in<00:03:05.500> from<00:03:05.739> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
which also is very easy in from the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.240 
which also is very easy in from the
bottom<00:03:06.070> around<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.510> come<00:03:07.900> back<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.769> these<00:03:08.980> are

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
bottom around and come back so these are

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.789 
bottom around and come back so these are
the<00:03:09.430> stitches<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.360> did<00:03:10.690> with<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.019> usual

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
the stitches that I did with that usual

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.970 
the stitches that I did with that usual
Continental<00:03:12.459> purl<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.380> they're<00:03:14.380> knit<00:03:14.769> from

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
Continental purl and they're knit from

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.550 
Continental purl and they're knit from
the<00:03:15.100> front<00:03:15.430> once<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.420> get<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.959> stitches<00:03:17.410> I

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
the front once you get to the stitches I

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.789 
the front once you get to the stitches I
did<00:03:17.799> with<00:03:18.010> my<00:03:18.250> purling<00:03:18.880> they<00:03:19.690> are<00:03:19.959> reversed

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
did with my purling they are reversed

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.370 
did with my purling they are reversed
with<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.790> higher<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.600> leading<00:03:22.989> edge<00:03:23.140> is

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
with the higher the leading edge is

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.530 
with the higher the leading edge is
higher<00:03:23.650> back<00:03:24.040> here<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:25.060> you're<00:03:25.209> going<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.390> be

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
higher back here so you're going to be

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.509 
higher back here so you're going to be
knitting<00:03:25.780> from<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.200> back<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.739> that's<00:03:27.250> really

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
knitting from the back and that's really

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.620 
knitting from the back and that's really
the<00:03:27.760> difference<00:03:27.880> between<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.630> two<00:03:28.810> methods

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
the difference between the two methods

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.870 
the difference between the two methods
again<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.660> think<00:03:31.959> this<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:33.549> know<00:03:33.579> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
again I think this is you know the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.720 
again I think this is you know the
purling<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.079> thing<00:03:35.380> that's<00:03:35.590> faster<00:03:36.310> with

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
purling is the thing that's faster with

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.479 
purling is the thing that's faster with
this<00:03:36.940> method<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.660> makes<00:03:38.320> it<00:03:38.530> worth<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:39.070> doing

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
this method and makes it worth it doing

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.020 
this method and makes it worth it doing
this<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.470> know<00:03:41.920> whether<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.579> knit

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
this and and you know whether to knit

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.880 
this and and you know whether to knit
from<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.480> front<00:03:43.720> or<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.900> back<00:03:44.019> on<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:44.620> row

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
from the front or the back on this row

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.910 
from the front or the back on this row
based<00:03:45.640> on<00:03:45.940> whether<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.110> leading<00:03:47.470> edge<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.769> the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
based on whether the leading edge of the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.660 
based on whether the leading edge of the
stitch<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.400> higher<00:03:48.730> here<00:03:49.450> or<00:03:49.870> as<00:03:50.530> we<00:03:51.070> see<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.549> a

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
stitch is higher here or as we see in a

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.430 
stitch is higher here or as we see in a
second<00:03:53.640> higher<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:57.690> I'm<00:03:58.690> trying<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.110> do<00:03:59.290> this

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
second higher on I'm trying to do this

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.360 
second higher on I'm trying to do this
quick<00:03:59.880> because<00:04:00.880> I<00:04:01.209> don't<00:04:01.360> know<00:04:01.480> how<00:04:01.630> long<00:04:01.840> my

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
quick because I don't know how long my

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.360 
quick because I don't know how long my
camera<00:04:03.370> will<00:04:03.549> last<00:04:03.910> okay<00:04:04.860> here<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:06.220> that

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
camera will last okay here you see that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.410 
camera will last okay here you see that
the<00:04:06.519> stitch<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:06.940> higher<00:04:07.680> in<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:09.190> front<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:10.209> if

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
the stitch is higher in the front so if

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.180 
the stitch is higher in the front so if
you<00:04:10.540> wanted<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.930> knit<00:04:11.290> this<00:04:11.500> row<00:04:11.769> you'd<00:04:12.040> be

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
you wanted to knit this row you'd be

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.280 
you wanted to knit this row you'd be
going<00:04:12.340> like<00:04:12.699> that<00:04:12.970> I'm<00:04:13.209> pearl<00:04:13.660> this<00:04:13.840> row<00:04:13.989> sorry

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
going like that I'm pearl this row sorry

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.310 
going like that I'm pearl this row sorry
you'd<00:04:14.949> be<00:04:15.100> going<00:04:15.250> like<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:15.609> or

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
you'd be going like that or

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.980 
you'd be going like that or
on<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.590> front<00:04:16.890> around<00:04:17.520> the<00:04:17.730> top<00:04:17.970> but<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:18.840> you

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:18.990 
on the front around the top but if you
