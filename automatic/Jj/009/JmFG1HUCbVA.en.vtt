00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
using the rode videomic is I don't have

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.250 
using the rode videomic is I don't have

audio and video are recorded at the same

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.260 
audio and video are recorded at the same
time<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.250> wanted<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.120> this

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
time if I this if I wanted to use this

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.380 
time if I this if I wanted to use this
mic<00:00:33.480> I'd<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.309> dub<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.610> audio<00:00:35.640> over<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
mic I'd have to dub the audio over and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
mic I'd have to dub the audio over and
that<00:00:36.450> takes<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> lot<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.930> extra<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.890> we're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that takes a lot of extra time so we're

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.310 
that takes a lot of extra time so we're
going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:38.910> ahead<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.120> unbox<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.050> really

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
going to go ahead and unbox this really

going to go ahead and unbox this really
quickly<00:00:40.559> hook<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.690> check<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
quickly hook it up in and check out the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
quickly hook it up in and check out the
audio<00:00:43.079> difference<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.160> again<00:00:44.430> right<00:00:44.610> now

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
audio difference so again right now

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.340 
audio difference so again right now
we're<00:00:44.940> using<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.450> built-in<00:00:45.840> mic<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
we're using the built-in mic on the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.069 
we're using the built-in mic on the
camera<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.460> let's<00:00:47.640> go<00:00:47.789> ahead<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> unbox<00:00:48.750> this

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
camera so let's go ahead and unbox this

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:59.389 
camera so let's go ahead and unbox this
real<00:00:49.350> quickly<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:55.190> sticker<00:00:58.399> 10

real quickly so you get a sticker 10
year<00:00:59.579> warranty<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:02.430> course<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:03.030> your

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
year warranty and of course just your

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.469 
year warranty and of course just your
basic<00:01:03.539> manual<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.549> then<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.820> microphone

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
basic manual and then the microphone

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
basic manual and then the microphone
itself<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> basically<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
itself and this is basically what it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.630 
itself and this is basically what it
looks<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> I'm<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.189> hook<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
looks like so I'm going to hook it up to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.260 
looks like so I'm going to hook it up to
the<00:01:20.759> camera<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:22.729> finish<00:01:23.729> doing<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the camera and then finish doing a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.850 
the camera and then finish doing a
second<00:01:24.630> part<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> recording<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
second part of the recording to see the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.310 
second part of the recording to see the
difference<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> audio<00:01:27.000> quality<00:01:27.320> again

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
difference on the audio quality again

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.740 
difference on the audio quality again
I'm<00:01:28.439> using<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.979> built-in<00:01:29.460> microphone<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
I'm using the built-in microphone on the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.890 
I'm using the built-in microphone on the
canon<00:01:31.229> t2i<00:01:31.520> want<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> hook<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.299> check

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
canon t2i want to hook this up and check

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
canon t2i want to hook this up and check
out<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> difference<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.490> ok

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
out the difference so be right back ok

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
out the difference so be right back ok
so<00:01:36.479> I've<00:01:36.659> got<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> rode<00:01:37.500> videomic<00:01:37.549> hooked<00:01:38.549> up

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
so I've got the rode videomic hooked up

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.210 
so I've got the rode videomic hooked up
to<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> camera

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.940 

and<00:01:42.970> as<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.510> can<00:01:43.660> tell<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.050> audio<00:01:44.320> quality<00:01:44.380> is

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
and as you can tell the audio quality is

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.060 
and as you can tell the audio quality is
much<00:01:45.490> much<00:01:46.390> better<00:01:46.600> than<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.020> audio<00:01:48.010> quality

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
much much better than the audio quality

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.340 
much much better than the audio quality
from<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.760> pick<00:01:48.970> up<00:01:49.120> on<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.810> camera<00:01:50.230> itself

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
from the pick up on the camera itself

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.370 
from the pick up on the camera itself
and<00:01:51.070> again<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.240> nice<00:01:53.110> thing<00:01:53.320> about

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
and again the the nice thing about

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.460 
and again the the nice thing about
having<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:54.100> microphone<00:01:55.170> attached<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.380> the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
having the microphone attached to the

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.680 
having the microphone attached to the
camera<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:57.700> capturing<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.270> audio<00:01:58.300> in

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
camera is it's capturing the audio in

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.630 
camera is it's capturing the audio in
the<00:01:58.750> video<00:01:58.990> at<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.290> same<00:01:59.500> time<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.460> don't

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
the video at the same time you don't

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.240 
the video at the same time you don't
have<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.940> do<00:02:01.090> any<00:02:01.300> overdubbing<00:02:01.950> or<00:02:02.950> any

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
have to do any overdubbing or any

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.270 
have to do any overdubbing or any
editing<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.090> audio<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.590> that's<00:02:05.920> a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
editing of the audio so that that's a

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.109 
editing of the audio so that that's a
real<00:02:06.640> big<00:02:06.880> time-saver<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:08.259> audio<00:02:08.890> quality

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
real big time-saver the audio quality

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.660 
real big time-saver the audio quality
isn't<00:02:10.119> quite<00:02:10.390> as<00:02:10.600> good<00:02:10.869> as<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.310> pick<00:02:12.310> up<00:02:12.460> mike

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
isn't quite as good as a pick up mike

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.910 
isn't quite as good as a pick up mike
like<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.150> snowball<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.560> blue<00:02:14.709> snowball

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
like the snowball the blue snowball

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.150 
like the snowball the blue snowball
microphone<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:17.050> far<00:02:17.470> superior<00:02:17.740> than

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
microphone but it is far superior than

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.330 
microphone but it is far superior than
the<00:02:19.080> microphone<00:02:20.080> built<00:02:20.260> into<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.560> camera<00:02:20.800> so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
the microphone built into the camera so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.949 
the microphone built into the camera so
