00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:08.469
 lesson new delhi school is still being treated 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.059
 times in detail and speed up the 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.869
 slow 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.869
 slow and fast 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 we do that 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.300
 in 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.580
 1 meter 50 to 2 meters in height 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 and I understand that we are the one 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.439
 accelerate lever quickly 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.190
 and slow down again and the whole thing 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.950
 without going big or too 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.400
 fall 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.960
 yes I do not know my would be the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.570
 speeding said through the floor 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 next to the nose are ten meters in the 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.540
 air and then we want somehow 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.380
 slow down 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.380
 that is not meant 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.720
 we fly 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.720
 quickly the nose up and pitch away 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.270
 At the same time we deliver degraded we catch 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.460
 with kitsch 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.460
 the heli again because he wants to 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.480
 soil by sinking because of the buoyancy 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.890
 the speed is missing 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.890
 did the whole thing from the right 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.730
 as close to us as possible we come with 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.730
 pace 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.430
 the nose high 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.450
 he knows this right in front of my nose 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.450
 was not so optimal 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.950
 they come up with daddy 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.560
 at the same time take bitch off and on 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.450
 standstill 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.080
 lie pitch to hold the height 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.620
 and hover on the spot 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.880
 so again from the right 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.880
 not exactly in front of my nose 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.880
 so 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.590
 nose up 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.219
 With 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.219
 and from 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.229
 speed nose away 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.229
 intercept 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.600
 with a lot of tempo she that a bit 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.330
 more dangerous 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.200
 nose up at the same time aims and intercept 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.200
 when the color goes 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.790
 so that's a very nice exercise 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.010
 also 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.549
 to initiate a brisk landing 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.549
 thought 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.000
 deceleration arrive high 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.120
 with control and already we are sitting on the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.120
 ground 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.210
 the mistakes you can make are 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.210
 the following 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.099
 at the 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.099
 accelerate 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.070
 you have to take the nose down 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.900
 if you do not have enough pitch 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.810
 the heli says down 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.900
 dangerously close to the ground 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.720
 that means lowering our nose and pitch 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.630
 give to accelerate one must 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.980
 move forward with the lever 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.980
 and then the height remains 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.840
 and the other way round when braking it is called 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.580
 take the nose high and pitch 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.770
 withdraw 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.840
 and only when the sinking begins with 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.840
 pitch to initiate the float 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.200
 So that was the lesson number 9 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.530
 lesson 10 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.280
 handle that 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.600
 wait for our flying machine 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.930
 I want to go for the movie now 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.780
 change a heli disassemble 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.599
 but after your nine flown so far 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.420
 lessons it's high time the heli 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.250
 take apart and all parts 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.459
 There was security 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.109
 there are some hefty stickers 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.439
 screwing will loosen up alone 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.290
 the vibration in flight and different 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.480
 parts also wear out 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.290
 The please is in the tenth lesson 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.120
 cool off the parts 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.400
 check accordingly and if the heli 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.739
 reassembled checked and flight 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.410
 we'll see you in lesson 11 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.900
 and can there the test flight 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.590
 make 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.590
 bye see you
