00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
this map you will be dominated if you

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.450 
this map you will be dominated if you
use<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.360> grinder<00:05:12.710> okay<00:05:13.710> so<00:05:13.770> now<00:05:14.040> we've<00:05:14.190> lost

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460

the<00:05:14.730> checkout<00:05:15.210> area<00:05:15.480> and<00:05:15.870> we're<00:05:16.650> jumping

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
the checkout area and we're jumping

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.490 
the checkout area and we're jumping
ahead<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.610> we're<00:05:18.210> gonna<00:05:18.360> try<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.050> take<00:05:19.290> it

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
ahead and we're gonna try and take it

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.980 
ahead and we're gonna try and take it
back<00:05:19.740> so<00:05:20.550> this<00:05:20.910> is<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.150> opposite<00:05:21.630> under<00:05:21.870> the

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
back so this is the opposite under the

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.300 
map you can see the high point across
the<00:05:24.360> way<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:25.080> we're<00:05:25.890> going<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.040> get<00:05:26.220> the

the way and we're going to get the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.210 
the way and we're going to get the
