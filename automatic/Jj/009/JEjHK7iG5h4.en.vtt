00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
not acceptable I think I know that I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
not acceptable I think I know that I
know<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.189> sort<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> popularities<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
know that sort of popularities and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
know that sort of popularities and
everything<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.619> sort<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> Star<00:01:26.340> Trek

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
everything but in this sort of Star Trek

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.039 
everything but in this sort of Star Trek
versus<00:01:26.880> Star<00:01:27.060> Wars<00:01:27.240> thing<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
versus Star Wars thing and I think I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.390 
versus Star Wars thing and I think I
would<00:01:28.259> say<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.979> case<00:01:29.100> anyone's

really frothing at the mouth we do both
love<00:01:31.170> both<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.610> our

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
love both but we just have our

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.440 
love both but we just have our
preferences<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:34.220> what<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.579> disagree

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
with it what I would say is it if you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
with it what I would say is it if you
look<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> popularity<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.220> both

they<00:02:10.440> are<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.739> space<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.610> it'll<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.120> do

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
they are in space so it'll have to do

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.970 
they are in space so it'll have to do
and<00:02:12.750> that's<00:02:12.870> what<00:02:12.989> Star<00:02:13.230> Trek<00:02:13.260> is

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980

I don't really understand that see why

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.920 
I don't really understand that see why
the<00:02:35.910> rest<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.269> them<00:02:36.360> are<00:02:36.480> there<00:02:36.599> should<00:02:36.900> just

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the rest of them are there should just

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.100 
the rest of them are there should just
be<00:02:37.050> data<00:02:37.319> just<00:02:37.530> flying<00:02:37.739> around<00:02:38.959> sorting<00:02:39.959> out

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110

the problems I don't really understand

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.430 
the problems I don't really understand
why<00:02:41.580> even<00:02:41.940> needs<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.269> spaceship<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.260> kind

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
why even needs a spaceship or that kind

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.869 
why even needs a spaceship or that kind
of<00:02:43.470> thing<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:43.830> anyway<00:02:43.950> an<00:02:44.549> all-powerful

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
of thing but anyway an all-powerful

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.120

robot who can do things on his own

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.820 
robot who can do things on his own
that's<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.000> that's<00:02:48.120> data<00:02:48.420> yeah<00:02:48.870> again<00:02:49.560> it's

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
that's so that's data yeah again it's

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.410 
that's so that's data yeah again it's
like<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.069> utopian<00:02:50.549> society<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.209> yeah

it's cool but like it's not much fun to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.800 
it's cool but like it's not much fun to
watch<00:02:53.250> you've<00:02:53.790> got<00:02:53.970> see-through<00:02:54.390> utopia

every one of us but like so c-3po and

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.650 
every one of us but like so c-3po and
r2d2<00:03:04.680> are<00:03:05.190> perhaps<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.030> greatest<00:03:06.209> on-screen

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
r2d2 are perhaps the greatest on-screen

r2d2 are perhaps the greatest on-screen
robots<00:03:06.989> ever<00:03:07.170> yes<00:03:08.010> they<00:03:08.220> are<00:03:08.250> I've<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.510> ran

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
robots ever yes they are I've just ran

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.240 
robots ever yes they are I've just ran
through<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.989> data<00:03:10.170> banks<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.709> yes<00:03:11.040> they<00:03:11.220> are

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
through the data banks and yes they are

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.240 
through the data banks and yes they are
so<00:03:11.940> c-3po<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:13.049> right<00:03:13.319> because<00:03:13.500> he<00:03:13.920> provides

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so c-3po is right because he provides

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.740 
so c-3po is right because he provides
like<00:03:14.549> comic<00:03:14.849> relief<00:03:15.090> without<00:03:15.299> being<00:03:15.480> annoying

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
think so I don't think I could think any

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.070 
think so I don't think I could think any
lower<00:05:41.849> or<00:05:42.029> Star<00:05:42.360> Wars<00:05:42.389> so<00:05:42.689> I<00:05:42.750> think<00:05:42.839> you've

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
lower or Star Wars so I think you've

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.179 
lower or Star Wars so I think you've
done<00:05:43.259> you've<00:05:43.500> done<00:05:43.529> a<00:05:43.649> pretty<00:05:43.740> good<00:05:43.949> job<00:05:44.039> I

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.189 
done you've done a pretty good job I

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.260 
done you've done a pretty good job I
quite<00:05:44.339> like<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.580> way<00:05:44.669> I<00:05:44.699> didn't<00:05:44.939> have<00:05:45.029> to<00:05:45.120> say

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
quite like the way I didn't have to say

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.700 
quite like the way I didn't have to say
very<00:05:45.479> much<00:05:45.509> and<00:05:45.779> you<00:05:45.839> just<00:05:46.020> eventually<00:05:46.229> start

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
very much and you just eventually start

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.899 
very much and you just eventually start
arguing<00:05:47.039> your<00:05:47.189> way<00:05:47.310> around<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.759> so<00:05:47.819> I'll

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
arguing your way around and so I'll

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.950 
arguing your way around and so I'll
actually<00:05:48.270> start<00:05:50.089> okay<00:05:51.089> so<00:05:51.149> my<00:05:51.419> conclusion<00:05:51.870> is

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
actually start okay so my conclusion is

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.490 
actually start okay so my conclusion is
yeah

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
yeah

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.519 
yeah
Star<00:05:52.949> Wars<00:05:52.979> is<00:05:53.339> more<00:05:53.939> exciting<00:05:54.389> Star<00:05:55.080> Trek<00:05:55.349> is

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
Star Wars is more exciting Star Trek is

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.409 
Star Wars is more exciting Star Trek is
probably<00:05:56.279> on<00:05:56.399> the<00:05:56.490> whole<00:05:56.669> sort<00:05:57.120> of<00:05:57.240> like<00:05:57.389> a

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
probably on the whole sort of like a

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.269 
probably on the whole sort of like a
better<00:05:57.779> geek<00:05:58.169> culture<00:05:58.409> thing<00:05:58.860> because<00:05:59.129> it's

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
better geek culture thing because it's

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.279 
better geek culture thing because it's
more<00:05:59.399> complete<00:05:59.819> and<00:06:00.479> it's<00:06:00.839> easier<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.139> imagine

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
more complete and it's easier to imagine

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.749 
more complete and it's easier to imagine
yourself<00:06:01.529> in<00:06:01.889> because<00:06:02.219> it's<00:06:02.339> a<00:06:02.430> little<00:06:02.580> bit

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
yourself in because it's a little bit

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.510 
yourself in because it's a little bit
mundane<00:06:02.969> just<00:06:03.689> like<00:06:03.839> real<00:06:04.020> life<00:06:04.310> that's<00:06:05.310> where

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
mundane just like real life that's where

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.980 
mundane just like real life that's where
that's<00:06:05.580> my<00:06:05.789> final<00:06:06.089> position<00:06:06.210> that's<00:06:06.810> true

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
that's my final position that's true

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.029 
that's my final position that's true
that's<00:06:07.229> do<00:06:07.319> I<00:06:07.379> think<00:06:07.439> that<00:06:07.620> makes<00:06:07.740> sense<00:06:07.770> we

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
that's do I think that makes sense we

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.519 
that's do I think that makes sense we
agreed<00:06:08.310> away<00:06:08.610> I<00:06:08.669> think<00:06:08.819> we<00:06:08.879> really<00:06:09.120> can't<00:06:09.529> okay

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:10.529 
agreed away I think we really can't okay

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.939 
agreed away I think we really can't okay
