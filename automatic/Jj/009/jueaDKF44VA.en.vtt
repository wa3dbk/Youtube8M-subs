00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
to replenish the fuel that will run your

to replenish the fuel that will run your
fridge<00:00:53.780> there<00:00:54.620> are<00:00:54.739> two<00:00:54.949> types<00:00:55.219> of<00:00:55.399> fridges

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
fridge there are two types of fridges

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.970 
fridge there are two types of fridges
available<00:00:56.239> there's<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:57.289> compressor<00:00:57.679> type

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
available there's the compressor type

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.709 
available there's the compressor type
and<00:00:58.249> that's<00:00:58.909> similar<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.359> the<00:00:59.449> one<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.690> have

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
and that's similar to the one you have

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.319 
and that's similar to the one you have
at<00:00:59.960> home<00:01:00.199> then<00:01:00.440> runs<00:01:00.649> off<00:01:00.800> 12<00:01:01.190> volt<00:01:01.429> and<00:01:01.579> 240

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
at home then runs off 12 volt and 240

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.780 
at home then runs off 12 volt and 240
and<00:01:02.510> then<00:01:03.409> there's<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.739> three-way<00:01:04.129> type<00:01:04.400> that

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
and then there's the three-way type that

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.499 
and then there's the three-way type that
runs<00:01:05.000> off<00:01:05.150> gas<00:01:05.649> 240<00:01:06.649> and<00:01:06.829> 12<00:01:07.310> volt<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:08.299> call

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
runs off gas 240 and 12 volt and we call

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.960 
runs off gas 240 and 12 volt and we call
them<00:01:08.720> absorption<00:01:09.530> technology<00:01:09.979> they<00:01:10.700> throw

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
them absorption technology they throw

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.300 
them absorption technology they throw
you<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.180> fridge<00:01:11.509> or<00:01:11.720> absorption<00:01:12.110> fridge<00:01:12.619> is

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
you a fridge or absorption fridge is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.850 
you a fridge or absorption fridge is
very<00:01:13.610> energy<00:01:14.119> efficient<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.659> silent<00:01:15.290> because

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
very energy efficient and silent because

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.280 
very energy efficient and silent because
it<00:01:16.130> uses<00:01:16.340> heat<00:01:16.759> to<00:01:16.939> extract<00:01:17.390> ammonia<00:01:17.810> gas<00:01:18.049> from

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
it uses heat to extract ammonia gas from

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.770 
it uses heat to extract ammonia gas from
water<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.729> pushed<00:01:19.969> around<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.390> system

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
water that is pushed around the system

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.039 
water that is pushed around the system
and<00:01:20.990> that's<00:01:21.409> what<00:01:21.680> cools<00:01:21.979> down<00:01:22.130> your<00:01:22.490> fridge

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
and that's what cools down your fridge

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.740 
and that's what cools down your fridge
now<00:01:24.049> this<00:01:24.229> process<00:01:24.500> can<00:01:24.740> be<00:01:24.979> fired<00:01:25.310> by<00:01:25.490> gas<00:01:25.790> 240

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
now this process can be fired by gas 240

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.319 
now this process can be fired by gas 240
or<00:01:26.899> 12-volt<00:01:27.560> now<00:01:28.399> when<00:01:28.549> you're<00:01:28.670> running<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.030> 12

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
or 12-volt now when you're running on 12

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.149 
or 12-volt now when you're running on 12
volt<00:01:29.600> you're<00:01:30.049> actually<00:01:30.380> using<00:01:30.770> your<00:01:30.799> car's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
volt you're actually using your car's

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.520 
volt you're actually using your car's
engine<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.149> you're<00:01:32.390> using<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.869> excess<00:01:33.259> fuel

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
engine so you're using the excess fuel

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.830 
engine so you're using the excess fuel
from<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.130> alternator<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.149> it's<00:01:35.299> very<00:01:35.479> energy

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
from your alternator so it's very energy

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.569 
from your alternator so it's very energy
efficient<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.229> way<00:01:36.350> as<00:01:36.560> well<00:01:36.770> now<00:01:37.310> if<00:01:37.430> you're

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
efficient that way as well now if you're

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.029 
efficient that way as well now if you're
out<00:01:37.610> in<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.789> bush<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.270> you're<00:01:38.360> using<00:01:38.719> gas<00:01:39.039> 1/9

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
out in the bush and you're using gas 1/9

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.010 
out in the bush and you're using gas 1/9
kilo<00:01:40.430> gas<00:01:40.670> cylinder<00:01:41.149> should<00:01:41.390> last<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.899> at

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
kilo gas cylinder should last you at

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.469 
kilo gas cylinder should last you at
least<00:01:42.079> 18<00:01:42.619> days<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.700> let's<00:01:43.880> look<00:01:44.030> at<00:01:44.149> three<00:01:44.360> way

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
least 18 days so let's look at three way

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.029 
least 18 days so let's look at three way
fridges<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.869> little<00:01:45.170> closer<00:01:45.409> I've<00:01:45.710> got<00:01:46.009> a

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
fridges a little closer I've got a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.800 
fridges a little closer I've got a
standard<00:01:46.520> one<00:01:46.700> installed<00:01:47.149> in<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.390> Caravan

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
standard one installed in this Caravan

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.639 
standard one installed in this Caravan
here<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:48.259> we'll<00:01:48.409> start<00:01:48.649> with<00:01:48.829> that<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:51.500> is

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
here so we'll start with that this is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.230 
here so we'll start with that this is
the<00:01:51.799> standard<00:01:52.219> fridge<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:52.939> means<00:01:53.119> you

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
the standard fridge that means you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.810
