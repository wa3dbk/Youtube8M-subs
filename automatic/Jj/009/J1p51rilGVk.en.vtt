talk<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> application<00:00:19.439> itself<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.220> is

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
talk about the application itself it is

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.650 
talk about the application itself it is
in<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> App<00:00:20.640> Store<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:20.910> check<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.180> lucid

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
in the App Store you can check out lucid

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.300 
in the App Store you can check out lucid
dreamer<00:00:21.930> without<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.439> E<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.590> dreamer<00:00:23.070> so

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
dreamer without the E and dreamer so

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.880

dream or you can see the dream are and
then<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.539> timer<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:27.960> basically<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.439> works

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
then it is a timer so basically it works

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.929 
then it is a timer so basically it works
and<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and this is this is a you know a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
and this is this is a you know a
scientific<00:00:30.449> proven<00:00:30.869> method<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
scientific proven method in to that of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.760 
scientific proven method in to that of
inducing<00:00:32.790> lucid<00:00:33.149> dreams<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
inducing lucid dreams so you know it's a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.930 
inducing lucid dreams so you know it's a
proven<00:00:34.950> method<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.370> works<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.670> basically

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
proven method that works and basically

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.639 
proven method that works and basically
in<00:00:36.180> its<00:00:36.570> simplest<00:00:36.840> formative<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
in its simplest formative it's a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.619 
in its simplest formative it's a
three-stage<00:00:38.190> alarm<00:00:38.489> system<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.329> basically

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
three-stage alarm system so basically

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
three-stage alarm system so basically
step<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.559> tap<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.040> new<00:00:41.160> button<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
step one you tap the new button in the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
step one you tap the new button in the
top<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:41.760> step<00:00:42.210> two<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.420> said<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> time<00:00:42.989> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
top right step two you said the time you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.920 
top right step two you said the time you
want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> sleep<00:00:43.739> step<00:00:44.640> three<00:00:45.090> alarms

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
want to go to sleep step three alarms

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
want to go to sleep step three alarms
will<00:00:46.230> start<00:00:46.559> six<00:00:47.010> hours<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> sleep<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
will start six hours of sleep at the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.560 
will start six hours of sleep at the
time<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.570> rim<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:49.079> REM<00:00:49.440> REM<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.550> your<00:00:51.329> your

dreaming<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.579> basically<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
dreaming is basically in that where you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
dreaming is basically in that where you
can<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.740> realize<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.219> you're

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
can can you you you realize that you're

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.069 
can can you you you realize that you're
in<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.909> dream<00:01:57.149> state<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.930> can

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
in a dream state and that you can

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
in a dream state and that you can
control<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.340> take<00:02:00.030> over

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
control and you know take over

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149 
control and you know take over
essentially<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.439> got<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.920> dreaming

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
essentially what you got your dreaming

essentially what you got your dreaming
so<00:02:02.369> these<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:03.060> things<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.360> there's<00:02:03.570> been

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
tons of studies in and all that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.039 
tons of studies in and all that
basically<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> dreamer<00:02:06.360> realizes

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
basically it's when the dreamer realizes

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.169 
basically it's when the dreamer realizes
that<00:02:07.079> he<00:02:07.469> or<00:02:07.560> she<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.740> dreaming<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:09.030> kind
