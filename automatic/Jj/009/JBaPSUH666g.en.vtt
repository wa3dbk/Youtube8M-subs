 Point is this, bibi 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.790
 ready after that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 remembering that 70 as administrator 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 in the sesi you also feel excluded 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.860
 that's it 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.430
 let's try quietly 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.599
 this here 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.599
 have to wait 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.749
 I even think it's one of the websites that also gave the tip had information 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.509
 You meet while the career here 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.039
 was 7 thousand 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.379
 you need punishment 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
 in the face response 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.129
 Maybe you're copying in the second part. 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.719
 Christmas, let's go over, I do not know why. 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.569
 but since you did 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.549
 100% 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.189
 task accomplished with a friend 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.239
 in the pool veredarh 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.029
 but anyway 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.489
 Then after that I wrote the wedding night. 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.629
 Those 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.459
 two commands 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 he is the fifth beginning besser with a whole 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.559

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.139

 What are you doing here? 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.499

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.979
 et 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.269

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.499
 bought it 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.829

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.689
 it will cost you nothing beauty 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.849
 this means 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.789
 I'm sure that being said continuity 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.789
 who has judgment 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.949

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.650
 it's a picture 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.719
 of the duel 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.080
 other than a video 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.080
 program that explained 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:44.770
 I brought it 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.770
 together in studies that actually 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.270
