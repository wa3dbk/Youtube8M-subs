alright we're going to show you how to

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.459 
alright we're going to show you how to
use<00:00:13.040> buddy<00:00:13.760> rhodes<00:00:14.120> curing<00:00:14.630> polymer<00:00:15.170> and

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
use buddy rhodes curing polymer and

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.640 
use buddy rhodes curing polymer and
glass<00:00:15.770> fiber<00:00:16.330> in<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.510> mixed<00:00:17.869> project<00:00:18.470> that

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
glass fiber in a mixed project that

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.460 
glass fiber in a mixed project that
we're<00:00:18.800> doing<00:00:19.010> a<00:00:19.250> press<00:00:19.550> project<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.200> first

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
we're doing a press project so the first

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.890 
we're doing a press project so the first
thing<00:00:21.560> Matt's<00:00:21.890> doing<00:00:22.220> is<00:00:22.880> he's<00:00:23.180> pouring<00:00:23.540> in

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
thing Matt's doing is he's pouring in

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.859 
thing Matt's doing is he's pouring in
the<00:00:24.140> two-pound<00:00:25.009> packet<00:00:25.610> of<00:00:25.700> color<00:00:25.970> pigment

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.470 

we've<00:00:29.869> also<00:00:30.130> pre-measured<00:00:31.130> our<00:00:31.250> water<00:00:31.550> we've

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
we've also pre-measured our water we've

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.660 
we've also pre-measured our water we've
got<00:00:32.750> about<00:00:32.930> eight<00:00:33.320> quarts<00:00:33.739> of<00:00:33.860> water<00:00:33.920> in<00:00:34.489> the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
got about eight quarts of water in the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.410 
got about eight quarts of water in the
water<00:00:34.820> bucket<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:36.230> we've<00:00:36.500> got<00:00:36.790> 72<00:00:37.790> ounces<00:00:38.239> of

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
water bucket and we've got 72 ounces of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.450 
water bucket and we've got 72 ounces of
the<00:00:38.510> curing<00:00:38.899> polymer<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.190> next<00:00:40.340> thing

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
the curing polymer so the next thing

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.190 
the curing polymer so the next thing
we're<00:00:40.670> doing<00:00:40.700> is<00:00:41.000> adding<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.480> water<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:42.050> the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
we're doing is adding the water to the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.440 
we're doing is adding the water to the
pigment<00:00:44.740> we<00:00:45.740> now<00:00:45.920> take<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.460> curing<00:00:46.910> polymer

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
pigment we now take the curing polymer

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.380 
pigment we now take the curing polymer
and<00:00:47.720> again<00:00:47.930> 72<00:00:48.590> ounces<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:49.100> polymer<00:00:49.610> we're

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
and again 72 ounces of polymer we're

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.950 
and again 72 ounces of polymer we're
adding<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.200> mix<00:00:55.360> mats<00:00:56.360> now<00:00:56.660> going<00:00:56.900> to

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
adding that to the mix mats now going to

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:15.239 
adding that to the mix mats now going to
mix<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:57.500> up<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:57.920> get<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.160> all<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:58.610> first

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:18.300 

the<00:01:16.249> next<00:01:16.549> thing<00:01:16.700> we're<00:01:16.819> going<00:01:16.999> to<00:01:17.119> do<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.689> add

170 pound bag of the buddy rhodes

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:25.510 
170 pound bag of the buddy rhodes
counter<00:01:22.009> mix<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.859> ultimately<00:01:24.859> we're<00:01:25.280> mixing

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
counter mix and ultimately we're mixing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:44.290 
counter mix and ultimately we're mixing
two<00:01:26.000> bags<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.569> mixer<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.229> this<00:01:27.380> project

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.180 

so<00:01:45.050> Matt's<00:01:45.290> now<00:01:45.560> going<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.860> take<00:01:46.040> the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
so Matt's now going to take the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.250 
so Matt's now going to take the
hand-held<00:01:46.640> mixer<00:01:46.910> with<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.330> mortar<00:01:47.780> paddle

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
hand-held mixer with the mortar paddle

00:01:48.260 --> 00:02:17.180 
hand-held mixer with the mortar paddle
we're<00:01:48.770> going<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.980> mix<00:01:49.160> up<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.520> first<00:01:49.790> bag

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.890 

because<00:02:18.190> we've<00:02:18.370> only<00:02:18.580> got<00:02:18.790> one<00:02:19.120> bag<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.750> there

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
because we've only got one bag in there

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.420 
because we've only got one bag in there
you<00:02:20.019> can<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.739> real<00:02:20.950> soupy

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
you can see it's a real soupy

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.160 
you can see it's a real soupy
consistency<00:02:21.610> now<00:02:22.450> we're<00:02:22.599> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.750> add<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
consistency now we're going to add the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.040 
consistency now we're going to add the
set<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.769> second<00:02:24.220> bag<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:25.269> we're<00:02:25.569> going<00:02:25.870> for

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
set the second bag and we're going for

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:48.780 
set the second bag and we're going for
that<00:02:26.170> press<00:02:26.620> cookie<00:02:27.280> dough<00:02:27.459> consistency

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.240 

so<00:02:49.420> again<00:02:49.719> to<00:02:49.870> repeat<00:02:50.290> what<00:02:50.349> we<00:02:50.560> got<00:02:50.799> now<00:02:50.829> we've

dry pigment 72 ounces of the polymer in
about<00:02:59.469> eight<00:02:59.680> quarts<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.159> the<00:03:00.280> law

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.280 

now<00:03:14.330> at<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:14.540> point<00:03:14.750> we're<00:03:14.960> going<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.140> add<00:03:15.260> a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
now at this point we're going to add a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.720 
now at this point we're going to add a
little<00:03:15.500> water<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:18.280> remember<00:03:19.280> we're<00:03:19.460> going

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
little water and remember we're going

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.090 
little water and remember we're going
for<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.000> cookie<00:03:20.540> dough<00:03:20.570> like<00:03:21.050> consistency<00:03:21.590> we

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
for a cookie dough like consistency we

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:49.370 
for a cookie dough like consistency we
don't<00:03:22.280> want<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.490> too<00:03:22.730> wet

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:18.569 

little<00:03:50.380> bit<00:03:50.530> more

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.680 

okay<00:04:19.579> now<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:21.070> final<00:04:22.070> step<00:04:22.280> once<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.210> get

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
okay now the final step once and I get

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.840 
okay now the final step once and I get
this<00:04:23.930> all<00:04:24.110> mixed<00:04:24.139> up<00:04:24.680> if<00:04:24.919> we're<00:04:25.070> going<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.310> take

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
this all mixed up if we're going to take

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.939 
this all mixed up if we're going to take
the<00:04:26.690> one-pound<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.880> glass<00:04:29.300> fibers<00:04:30.050> and

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
the one-pound of the glass fibers and

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.860 
the one-pound of the glass fibers and
that's<00:04:31.100> at<00:04:31.250> about<00:04:31.460> four<00:04:31.790> quarts<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.300> fiber<00:04:32.600> and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
that's at about four quarts of fiber and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.020 
that's at about four quarts of fiber and
we're<00:04:32.990> going<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.169> add

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.390 

okay<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.090> we're<00:04:41.449> ready<00:04:41.600> for<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> fibers<00:04:42.500> now

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
okay so we're ready for the fibers now

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.999 
okay so we're ready for the fibers now

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.130 

at<00:06:08.400> this<00:06:08.610> point<00:06:08.880> we're<00:06:09.120> ready<00:06:09.300> to<00:06:09.390> go<00:06:09.660> Matt's

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
at this point we're ready to go Matt's

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.550 
at this point we're ready to go Matt's
going<00:06:10.410> to<00:06:10.470> hand<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.890> concrete<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.550> Joshua<00:06:12.150> and

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
going to hand the concrete to Joshua and

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.560 
going to hand the concrete to Joshua and
we're<00:06:13.560> making<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:14.040> very<00:06:14.340> large<00:06:14.670> planter<00:06:15.390> with

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
we're making a very large planter with

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.590 
we're making a very large planter with
this<00:06:15.780> mix<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.890> that's<00:06:17.520> really<00:06:17.760> how<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.060> use

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
this mix and that's really how you use

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.850 
this mix and that's really how you use
the<00:06:19.560> glass<00:06:19.950> fibers<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.880> curing<00:06:21.270> polymer<00:06:21.860> when

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
the glass fibers the curing polymer when

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.130 
the glass fibers the curing polymer when
doing<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.340> press<00:06:23.610> technique<00:06:23.970> and<00:06:24.420> this<00:06:24.930> is<00:06:25.110> a

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
doing a press technique and this is a

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.800 
doing a press technique and this is a
formula<00:06:25.500> for<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.890> face<00:06:26.220> coat<00:06:26.580> so<00:06:27.330> as<00:06:27.570> you<00:06:27.690> can

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
formula for the face coat so as you can

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.780 
formula for the face coat so as you can
see<00:06:28.050> Josh<00:06:28.380> was<00:06:28.650> now<00:06:28.830> going<00:06:29.130> to<00:06:29.340> work<00:06:29.520> and

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
see Josh was now going to work and

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:39.920 
see Josh was now going to work and
that's<00:06:30.390> it

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.990
