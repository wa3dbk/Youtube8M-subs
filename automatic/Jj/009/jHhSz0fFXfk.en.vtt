which is the nicest shape of the a3 a
hatchback<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> find<00:00:46.050> our<00:00:46.170> hatchback

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
hatchback I think to find our hatchback

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470 
hatchback I think to find our hatchback
looks<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.829> little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:47.160> kind<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.760> weird<00:00:48.180> in

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
looks a little bit kind of weird in

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.709 
looks a little bit kind of weird in
places<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.649> saloon<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.360> scores

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
places but the saloon that have scores

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.430 
places but the saloon that have scores
and<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.289> convertible<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> looks<00:00:53.670> even<00:00:53.910> better

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
and in convertible it looks even better

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.200 
and in convertible it looks even better
but<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:55.890> absolutely<00:00:56.640> perfect<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
but all is not absolutely perfect in the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.939 
but all is not absolutely perfect in the
world<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.539> Audi<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> Cabriolet<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
world of Audi with this Cabriolet and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:26.110 
world of Audi with this Cabriolet and
it's<00:00:59.640> down<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> engine

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.620 

this<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:26.930> diesel-powered<00:01:27.910> now<00:01:28.910> ordinarily<00:01:29.450> I

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
this is diesel-powered now ordinarily I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.150 
this is diesel-powered now ordinarily I
wouldn't<00:01:29.870> be<00:01:30.050> thinking<00:01:30.320> much<00:01:30.470> about<00:01:30.500> diesel

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
wouldn't be thinking much about diesel

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.830 
wouldn't be thinking much about diesel
as<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.370> whether<00:01:31.550> it's<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.730> problem<00:01:31.970> or<00:01:32.270> not<00:01:32.450> you

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
as to whether it's a problem or not you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.780 
as to whether it's a problem or not you
know<00:01:32.990> these<00:01:33.410> diseases<00:01:33.860> go<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.370> seek<00:01:34.670> an

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
know these diseases go to seek an

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.260 
know these diseases go to seek an
article<00:01:35.180> that's<00:01:35.300> clean<00:01:35.600> these<00:01:35.870> days

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
article that's clean these days

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.240 
article that's clean these days
but<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.420> problem<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.710> doesn't<00:01:39.890> suit

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
but the problem is that doesn't suit

convertible is kind of a state of mind
really<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> DSG<00:01:59.780> box<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.590> well

the birds singing hear that the breeze
blowing<00:04:21.739> through<00:04:22.010> trees<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.640> hear<00:04:22.910> are<00:04:23.060> their

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
blowing through trees you hear are their

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.240 
blowing through trees you hear are their
cars<00:04:23.540> you<00:04:23.870> hear<00:04:24.110> lots<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.560> things<00:04:24.620> happening

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
cars you hear lots of things happening

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.880 
cars you hear lots of things happening
around<00:04:25.400> you<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:26.780> that's<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.080> point<00:04:27.350> if<00:04:27.680> you

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
around you and that's the point if you

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.950 
around you and that's the point if you
hear<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.430> all<00:04:28.610> you're<00:04:29.120> going<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.570> hear<00:04:29.780> that

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
hear it all you're going to hear that

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.570 
hear it all you're going to hear that
diesel<00:04:30.410> engine<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.800> whole<00:04:31.010> time<00:04:31.250> too

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
diesel engine the whole time too

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.760 
diesel engine the whole time too
thus<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.450> big<00:04:33.630> problem<00:04:34.050> with<00:04:34.170> convertibles

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
thus the big problem with convertibles

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.940 
thus the big problem with convertibles
has<00:04:35.070> always<00:04:35.370> been<00:04:35.760> scuttled<00:04:36.570> shake<00:04:36.990> only<00:04:37.830> to

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
has always been scuttled shake only to

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.700 
has always been scuttled shake only to
explain<00:04:38.220> my<00:04:38.370> Scottish<00:04:38.640> egg<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:40.380> basically

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
explain my Scottish egg is so basically

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.190 
explain my Scottish egg is so basically
the<00:04:40.920> roof<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.460> your<00:04:41.490> car<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.360> part<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:43.020> the

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
the roof of your car is part of the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.800 
the roof of your car is part of the
structural<00:04:43.830> integrity<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.910> whole<00:04:45.120> car<00:04:45.510> so

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
structural integrity of the whole car so

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.050 
structural integrity of the whole car so
this<00:04:46.020> bit<00:04:46.290> here<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.860> connected<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.880> back

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
this bit here is connected to the back

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.350 
this bit here is connected to the back
of<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.330> car<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:49.200> by<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.470> roof<00:04:49.770> okay<00:04:50.370> now<00:04:51.180> what

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
of the car to by the roof okay now what

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.150 
of the car to by the roof okay now what
happens<00:04:51.690> is<00:04:51.810> when<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.200> remove<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.890> piece

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
happens is when you remove this piece

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.060 
happens is when you remove this piece
you've<00:04:53.910> got<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.120> problem<00:04:54.890> you've<00:04:55.890> got<00:04:56.040> a

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
you've got a problem you've got a

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.590 
you've got a problem you've got a
problem<00:04:56.490> in<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.880> chassis<00:04:57.360> underneath

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
problem in that the chassis underneath

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.400 
problem in that the chassis underneath
is<00:04:57.960> now<00:04:58.140> carrying<00:04:58.770> all<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.700> load<00:04:59.730> of<00:05:00.410> actually

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
is now carrying all the load of actually

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.100 
is now carrying all the load of actually
driving<00:05:01.770> car<00:05:02.340> so<00:05:02.610> it's<00:05:02.760> actually<00:05:03.030> flexing<00:05:03.930> as

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
driving car so it's actually flexing as

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.040 
driving car so it's actually flexing as
it<00:05:04.230> goes<00:05:04.410> along<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.860> road<00:05:05.420> now<00:05:06.420> to<00:05:06.480> combat

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
it goes along the road now to combat

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.290 
it goes along the road now to combat
that<00:05:07.290> now<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.620> also<00:05:07.770> means<00:05:08.100> in<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.670> crash<00:05:09.000> test

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
that now it also means in a crash test

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.900 
that now it also means in a crash test
that<00:05:09.990> energy<00:05:10.470> is<00:05:10.620> not<00:05:10.800> dissipated<00:05:10.860> down<00:05:11.700> the

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
that energy is not dissipated down the

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.330 
that energy is not dissipated down the
roof<00:05:12.120> where<00:05:12.420> it<00:05:12.510> would<00:05:12.720> normally<00:05:12.960> be<00:05:13.230> in<00:05:13.740> most

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
roof where it would normally be in most

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.600 
roof where it would normally be in most
cars<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:16.050> problem<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.560> have<00:05:16.770> then<00:05:17.130> is<00:05:17.400> that

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
cars the problem you have then is that

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.760 
cars the problem you have then is that
you<00:05:17.730> have<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:18.060> strengthen<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.720> floor<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.470> so

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
you have to strengthen the floor and so

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.920 
you have to strengthen the floor and so
what<00:05:19.920> I<00:05:20.010> have<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.340> do<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.670> put<00:05:20.880> rather<00:05:21.540> large

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
what I have to do is put rather large

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.100 
what I have to do is put rather large
girders<00:05:22.680> along<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.250> bottom<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.700> car

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
girders along the bottom of the car

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
girders along the bottom of the car
allowing<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.230> chassis<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.650> be<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.890> bit

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
allowing the chassis to be a bit

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.910 
allowing the chassis to be a bit
stronger<00:05:26.640> at<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.240> bottom<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:28.050> carry<00:05:28.380> more<00:05:28.770> of

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
stronger at the bottom to carry more of

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.040 
stronger at the bottom to carry more of
the<00:05:29.040> kind<00:05:29.250> of<00:05:29.310> ways<00:05:29.670> of<00:05:29.970> turning<00:05:30.360> in<00:05:30.450> corners

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
the kind of ways of turning in corners

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.350 
the kind of ways of turning in corners
now<00:05:31.530> out<00:05:31.770> he's<00:05:31.950> done<00:05:32.100> a<00:05:32.160> bloody<00:05:32.460> good<00:05:32.700> job<00:05:32.880> here

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
now out he's done a bloody good job here

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.360 
now out he's done a bloody good job here
you<00:05:33.390> can<00:05:33.660> very<00:05:33.840> rarely<00:05:34.230> feel<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:35.010> Scottish

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
you can very rarely feel the Scottish

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.400 
you can very rarely feel the Scottish
ache<00:05:35.580> is<00:05:35.760> it<00:05:35.880> driving<00:05:36.210> along<00:05:36.450> but<00:05:36.780> it<00:05:36.900> is<00:05:37.050> still

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
ache is it driving along but it is still

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.010 
ache is it driving along but it is still
there<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.670> that's<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:39.090> problem<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.600> nature

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
there and that's the problem the nature

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.800 
there and that's the problem the nature
of<00:05:40.170> driving<00:05:41.040> in<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.310> convertible

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
of driving in a convertible

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.110 
of driving in a convertible
and<00:05:43.230> that<00:05:43.410> when<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.650> roof<00:05:43.800> is<00:05:44.040> down<00:05:44.310> you<00:05:44.820> start

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
and that when the roof is down you start

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.940 
and that when the roof is down you start
to<00:05:45.240> feel<00:05:45.420> more<00:05:45.530> vibration<00:05:46.530> you<00:05:46.710> might<00:05:46.860> even

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
to feel more vibration you might even

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.730 
to feel more vibration you might even
see<00:05:47.310> it<00:05:47.430> in<00:05:47.550> my<00:05:47.670> cameras<00:05:48.180> well<00:05:48.420> more<00:05:48.960> vibration

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
see it in my cameras well more vibration

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.280 
see it in my cameras well more vibration
is<00:05:49.889> driving<00:05:50.340> on<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.580> road<00:05:50.790> not<00:05:51.600> a<00:05:51.660> big<00:05:51.960> deal

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
is driving on the road not a big deal

is driving on the road not a big deal
most<00:05:52.620> people<00:05:52.980> say<00:05:53.160> but<00:05:53.370> you<00:05:53.669> know<00:05:53.820> at<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.150> same

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
most people say but you know at the same

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.920 
most people say but you know at the same
time<00:05:54.630> it<00:05:54.900> can<00:05:55.020> become<00:05:55.320> annoying<00:05:56.419> on<00:05:57.419> a<00:05:57.480> warm

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930

time it can become annoying on a warm
summer's<00:05:58.560> day<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.040> there's<00:05:59.160> absolutely

summer's day and there's absolutely

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.400 
summer's day and there's absolutely
nothing<00:05:59.850> like<00:06:00.120> a<00:06:00.180> convertible<00:06:00.840> when<00:06:01.050> it's<00:06:01.200> 8

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
nothing like a convertible when it's 8

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.860 
nothing like a convertible when it's 8
degrees<00:06:01.590> out<00:06:02.040> that's<00:06:02.310> early<00:06:02.669> morning<00:06:03.060> well<00:06:03.540> it

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
degrees out that's early morning well it

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.140 
degrees out that's early morning well it
is<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.080> little<00:06:04.410> bit<00:06:04.530> chilly<00:06:04.710> in<00:06:04.950> here<00:06:05.060> so<00:06:06.060> what

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
is a little bit chilly in here so what

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150 
is a little bit chilly in here so what
we<00:06:06.240> do<00:06:06.419> is<00:06:06.630> we<00:06:06.810> pull<00:06:07.050> over<00:06:07.290> up<00:06:07.560> the<00:06:07.680> road<00:06:07.830> here

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
we do is we pull over up the road here
