00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.930
 to the last part of the theme of the season 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.299
 Although prediction for the Bundesliga are 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.410
 we reached stormers today 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.970
 have actually made it 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.400
 maybe more video out too 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.560
 cuddle or just before 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.330
 17 o'clock 30 thought to me hey come the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.029
 millionth of that makes it again 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.990
 the forwards for tonight had 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.699
 of course, I had already the 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.290
 player made ready but wanted now 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.780
 I'll do a live comment today 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.000
 of course for you now because he gives me that 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.949
 Definitely worth it since I want to 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.030
 ask a question in advance 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.860
 After the league has to be natural 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.180
 Another league is coming and I would like to 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.800
 of you know which league he as 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.010
 Next would like to have the series a 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.110
 spanish league the barclay or the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.809
 I just said that because I spool 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.670
 air needs bitter but what the heck 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.379
 By the way, no confusion with the wii with 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.620
 asked on skype on facebook or 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:06.190
 under the video that the sgn fcx ultimate 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.560
 is just about her spam I think 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.869
 also a team of the year so a team of 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.390
 season and that is just for fun 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.009
 that does not matter that's easy 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.610
 just as prepared as he gets y 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.380
 back to the real thing you guys 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.119
 he still wants to ask, he realizes a lot today 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.770
 to write in the comments I have 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.990
 of course, only four players now 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.690
 for the storm at the start and that is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.740
 my question is there at the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.599
 passive funds consistently determined 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.789
 Predicting certain regulations 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.860
 and there are French German 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.310
 Italian Spanish league two each 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.720
 player from it in the silver and bronze 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.819
 silver and gold bronze only one 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.470
 but with bronze silver and gold 6 off 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.429
 english leagues i mean goodbye 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.899
 I can do that with bronze and silver 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.880
 to a certain extent understand because there is 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.550
 but the four English leagues stop 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.319
 you can find that with the gold team too 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.209
 passive from consistently justified 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.929
 because I think that even if one after 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:04.149
 the niger market expert with premier 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.170
 league the best league in the world is that 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.650
 anyway the bundesliga and also the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.480
 league as we should get and or 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.170
 at least the Bundesliga 4 and the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.280
 premier league just to record her 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.780
 You already know what I mean think 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.660
 because I honestly think that's the case 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.310
 stark, barclays does not differ 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.010
 from the bundesliga window of course 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.060
 much more 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.440
 We're definitely starting now 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.420
 two minutes slower comes to the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.490
 storm and there we have as 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.260
 umpire who should his robert there 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.280
 lewandowski and mario mandzukic me 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.810
 do not think you have much to do 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.910
 Both say superior season played 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.360
 both have 17 high I believe 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.500
 now even 18 degrees against 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.650
 but I met Brunswick 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.230
 not changed does not matter now has 29 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.230
 games and 18 goals 6 templates and 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.940
 lewandowski now has 29 games 30 seats 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.060
 gates and twelve templates two yellow 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.350
 cards for lewandowski 50 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.850
 I think you do not have to go further 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.130
 talk about it lewandowski will his 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.780
 she definitely has to get it and you 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.130
 is always looking for the easy because 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.270
 both much too good fourth constant 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.120
 We played the gates 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.470
 have and both plus 6 980 at mandzukic 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.910
 and 29 Lewandovsky 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.980
 even though I honestly try 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.010
 not as busy as was still 53 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.100
 ratings and he is looking for or rather 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.080
 but the 90 but well meant that one 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.330
 Search has earned 380 and then you can 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.500
 there is nothing to do so look at everyone 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.430
 fall off my two top strikers 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.260
 Of course, write again in the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.360
 comments we would like to storm though 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.340
 Do not do it before I explain myself 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.110
 I why I have put down again 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.880
 or do not forget that and easy 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.950
 write your opinion but kept it 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.330
 would never have said about it because there was 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.250
 then in the last video as I suspect 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.090
 of course, had irritations especially 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.849
 almost alone 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.769
 or halt even anything yet 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.780
 Definitely something to do with the 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.920
 tribe players get under sap 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.769
 we have max kruse and adrian ramos 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.300
 adrian ramos I think with one of the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.940
 best striker of the league goes to 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.709
 bvb is extremely dangerous 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.140
 human being in the front in it Kopfballstark so 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.819
 strong as it is on 90 ps comes to 780 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.950
 I've gotten in shape before 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.120
 really had no idea 89 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.040
 only thought hey come the highest 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.739
 newspaper four from the pictured map 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.959
 because it has to be 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.359
 In any case , he resisted in 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.829
 29 play 16 goals and seven assists 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.810
 made three yellow cards 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.660
 I think there you can understand 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.970
 why go in there 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.840
 so I'll be the hertha fans 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.850
 can satisfy 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.080
 to the striker and now do not let you 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.330
 irritate again 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.760
 neither Obermann is a striker of the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.389
 right midfielder and rome was 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.250
 still finds better and the good 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.600
 the third is the team offensive must 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.080
 be consistent in it 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.860
 Most consistency means he will definitely 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.910
 be in shape but not in the north 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.190
 consistent him too that time one 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.840
 first next wednesday head no 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.430
 I did not forget you 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.710
 I wanted to go back for a second 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.300
 have mentioned a little bit there though 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.520
 you could really get involved with it 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.460
 See there is max kruse because there 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.139
 always seen very good values from 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.479
 the statistics but I could 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.250
 shinji okazaki also introduces 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.300
 I could not imagine that it 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.560
 a 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.750
 re- own player that is 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.490
 Okazaki would become your gold and that 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.960
 but it is better to max kruse but 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.060
 somehow not because I like it 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.449
 Operative as a sailor because max kruse 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.729
 but I do not know okazaki 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.490
 or kruse, I see it very far ahead 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.319
 and otherwise I have no idea about violence 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.970
 not otherwise I have now I think 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:37.379
 not so many towering strikers I 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.699
 my good lasogga was special 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.800
 It did not hurt that long either 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.970
 I fully reckon falling today 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.080
 come back is because is the 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.240
 this economically especially great 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.849
 played huntelaar too little played the 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.699
 Tarot player over jack and underdog 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.229
 you have to have a say and kießling you can 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.520
 he does not say he deserves that but he has 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.199
 played too weak today 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.039
 At least you can, of course 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.479
 Also everyone likes to comment 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.590
 Write if you feel that too 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.969
 company again next time 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.080
 Write me everything that I am in the beginning 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.729
 also said in the comments 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.930
 which league he likes with the 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.379
 So balance server is so many players 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.870
 what do I have exactly what 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:12.389
 players had made a storm there 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.960
 I have something with me but you are 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.770
 know or hope again brand 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.880
 I was bad then I would be 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.620
 of course, but a positive rating 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.690
 before a link to the andy roddick or 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.130
 microsoft credit or ps credit 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.419
 needs in the video description could 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.529
 protect me but the friend on 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.940
 facebook is lying in the video 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.590
 also describes tobi my 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.389
 protégés drop by policy 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.740
 Definitely also and we are first of all 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.659
 again as I said I would be around 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.990
 beautiful rest evening until the next 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.319
 times 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.319
 pure skin
