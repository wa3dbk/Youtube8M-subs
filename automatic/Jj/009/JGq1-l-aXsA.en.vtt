00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
hair which is really nice but I think I

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.420

straight I shouldn't have expected that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.660 
straight I shouldn't have expected that
because<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:46.820> not<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.650> Japanese

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
because it's not a Japanese

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.610 
because it's not a Japanese
straightening<00:02:49.959> treatment<00:02:50.959> it's<00:02:51.080> it's<00:02:51.290> more

I<00:03:27.829> think<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.190> was<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> big<00:03:28.579> reason<00:03:28.790> for<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.360> and

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
I think that was a big reason for it and

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.240 
I think that was a big reason for it and
that<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:29.989> using<00:03:30.200> heat<00:03:30.769> tamer<00:03:31.040> spray

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
that I was using heat tamer spray

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.370 
that I was using heat tamer spray
recently<00:03:32.120> I've<00:03:32.209> been<00:03:32.360> loving<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.780> stuff<00:03:33.110> so

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
recently I've been loving that stuff so

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.340 
recently I've been loving that stuff so
um<00:03:34.360> yeah<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:35.660> what<00:03:35.750> my<00:03:35.870> hair<00:03:35.989> looks<00:03:36.230> like

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
um yeah this is what my hair looks like

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.740 
um yeah this is what my hair looks like
blow<00:03:36.709> dry<00:03:37.010> with<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.459> my<00:03:37.579> fingers<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.420> it's

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
blow dry with just my fingers and it's

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.770 
blow dry with just my fingers and it's
still<00:03:39.290> really<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:40.180> feel<00:03:41.180> like<00:03:41.239> it's<00:03:41.540> still

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
still really I feel like it's still

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.330 
still really I feel like it's still
really<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.230> not<00:03:42.380> completely<00:03:42.769> like<00:03:43.070> washed

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
really it's not completely like washed

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.720 
really it's not completely like washed
out<00:03:43.670> or<00:03:43.850> anything<00:03:44.060> but<00:03:45.049> um<00:03:45.519> because<00:03:46.519> if<00:03:46.610> my

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
out or anything but um because if my

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.039 
out or anything but um because if my
hair<00:03:46.940> didn't<00:03:47.269> used<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.450> look<00:03:47.570> like<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:47.870> when

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
hair didn't used to look like this when

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.500 
hair didn't used to look like this when
I<00:03:48.110> just<00:03:48.350> blow<00:03:48.829> dried<00:03:49.100> it<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.910> when<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.239> air

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
I just blow dried it so and when I air

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.240 
I just blow dried it so and when I air
dry<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:51.110> just<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.380> little<00:03:51.560> bit<00:03:51.860> fuller

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
dry it's just a little bit fuller

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.800 
dry it's just a little bit fuller
because<00:03:52.610> when<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:52.910> blow-dry<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.390> you're<00:03:53.570> kind

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
because when you blow-dry it you're kind

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.569 
because when you blow-dry it you're kind
of<00:03:53.930> weighing<00:03:54.320> it<00:03:54.560> down<00:03:54.590> but<00:03:55.100> with<00:03:55.250> when<00:03:55.459> it's

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
of weighing it down but with when it's

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.520 
of weighing it down but with when it's
air<00:03:55.760> dried<00:03:56.000> it's<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.180> little<00:03:56.390> bit<00:03:56.510> fuller<00:03:56.720> some

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
air dried it's a little bit fuller some

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.229 
air dried it's a little bit fuller some
of<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.709> downsides<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.459> would<00:03:58.579> say<00:03:58.730> about<00:03:58.940> this

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
of the downsides I would say about this

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.020 
of the downsides I would say about this
treatment<00:03:59.780> are<00:03:59.959> maybe<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:01.100> made<00:04:01.489> my<00:04:01.700> hair

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
treatment are maybe that it made my hair

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.620 
treatment are maybe that it made my hair
greasy<00:04:02.630> periodically<00:04:03.350> um<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:05.329> think<00:04:05.540> the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
greasy periodically um and I think the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.180 
greasy periodically um and I think the
shampoo<00:04:06.079> and<00:04:06.200> conditioner<00:04:06.230> had<00:04:06.829> something<00:04:07.100> to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
shampoo and conditioner had something to

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.259 
shampoo and conditioner had something to
do<00:04:07.250> with<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.459> because<00:04:07.549> you<00:04:07.700> use<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.850> shampoo<00:04:08.030> and

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
do with it because you use a shampoo and

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.940 
do with it because you use a shampoo and
conditioner<00:04:08.750> with<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.049> treatment<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:09.590> it

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
conditioner with this treatment so it

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.150 
conditioner with this treatment so it
was<00:04:10.070> kind<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.579> making<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.870> really<00:04:12.260> oily<00:04:12.530> ran<00:04:13.040> it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
was kind of making it really oily ran it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.220 
was kind of making it really oily ran it
like<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.370> dry<00:04:13.700> my<00:04:13.910> hair<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:14.480> still<00:04:14.930> looked

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
like I dry my hair and it still looked

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.580 
like I dry my hair and it still looked
wet<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.700> kind<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:18.229> could<00:04:18.410> have<00:04:18.500> been

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
wet so that kind of that could have been

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.140 
wet so that kind of that could have been
my<00:04:18.859> hair<00:04:19.220> doing<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.700> though<00:04:19.880> because<00:04:19.940> my

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
my hair doing that though because my

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.430 
my hair doing that though because my
hair<00:04:20.329> does<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:20.660> but<00:04:20.840> something<00:04:21.109> in<00:04:21.349> the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
hair does that but something in the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.610 
hair does that but something in the
treatment<00:04:21.680> makes<00:04:21.979> it<00:04:22.099> really<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:23.870> me<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.349> so

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
treatment makes it really for me and so

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.660 
treatment makes it really for me and so
that<00:04:25.070> was<00:04:25.220> kind<00:04:25.430> of<00:04:25.460> a

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
that was kind of a

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.910 
that was kind of a
outside<00:04:26.060> another<00:04:26.870> downside<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.590> it's

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
outside another downside is that it's

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.700 
outside another downside is that it's
really<00:04:28.100> expensive<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:29.380> deciding<00:04:30.380> if<00:04:30.530> it's

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
really expensive and deciding if it's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.880 
really expensive and deciding if it's
worth<00:04:30.920> it<00:04:31.130> for<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.530> don't<00:04:33.530> think<00:04:33.740> I'll

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
worth it for you so I don't think I'll

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.680 
worth it for you so I don't think I'll
be<00:04:34.040> doing<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.730> treatment<00:04:35.270> again<00:04:35.480> just

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
be doing the treatment again just

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.350 
be doing the treatment again just
because<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:35.990> missed<00:04:36.350> my<00:04:36.590> natural<00:04:37.490> curls<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.180> so

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
because I missed my natural curls and so

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.390 
because I missed my natural curls and so
I'm<00:04:38.480> trying<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.810> let<00:04:38.960> them<00:04:39.140> grow<00:04:39.950> back<00:04:40.160> out

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
I'm trying to let them grow back out

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.670 
I'm trying to let them grow back out
again<00:04:40.730> but<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.480> would<00:04:42.050> recommend<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.650> for

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
again but I would recommend it for

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.490 
again but I would recommend it for
someone<00:04:43.040> who<00:04:43.340> has<00:04:43.520> really<00:04:44.090> full<00:04:44.720> frizzy<00:04:45.470> hair

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
someone who has really full frizzy hair

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.340 
someone who has really full frizzy hair
and<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:46.310> like<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.210> takes<00:04:47.570> you<00:04:47.720> so<00:04:47.750> long<00:04:48.200> to

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
and just like it takes you so long to

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.990 
and just like it takes you so long to
get<00:04:48.500> ready<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:48.830> don't<00:04:49.130> think<00:04:49.280> if<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.550> have<00:04:49.700> thin

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
get ready I don't think if you have thin

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.270 
get ready I don't think if you have thin
or<00:04:50.150> medium<00:04:50.510> hair<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.200> it's<00:04:51.560> just<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.830> little

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
or medium hair and it's just a little

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.970 
or medium hair and it's just a little
bit<00:04:52.490> like<00:04:52.790> it's<00:04:52.970> wavy<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:54.230> you<00:04:54.380> should<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.800> it

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
bit like it's wavy that you should do it

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.350 
bit like it's wavy that you should do it
this<00:04:55.130> is<00:04:55.190> mainly<00:04:55.670> for<00:04:55.850> people<00:04:56.000> who<00:04:56.240> have

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
this is mainly for people who have

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.770 
this is mainly for people who have
really<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:56.780> think<00:04:56.900> frizzy<00:04:57.590> hair

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
really I think frizzy hair

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.570 
really I think frizzy hair
uncontrollable<00:04:59.780> curls<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:01.190> just<00:05:01.370> want

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
uncontrollable curls that you just want

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.030 
uncontrollable curls that you just want
softened<00:05:02.360> because<00:05:03.110> you're<00:05:03.440> not<00:05:03.560> your<00:05:03.770> hair<00:05:03.980> is

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
softened because you're not your hair is

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.440 
softened because you're not your hair is
not<00:05:04.190> going<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.430> be<00:05:04.520> completely<00:05:04.970> transformed

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
not going to be completely transformed

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.150
