00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
when you put it in a low range now this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
when you put it in a low range now this
truck<00:00:15.650> is<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.950> to<00:00:17.070> spend<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.580> lot<00:00:18.360> of<00:00:18.720> time

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and low range when we're giving our

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.250 
and low range when we're giving our
tours<00:00:21.950> but<00:00:22.950> I<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.220> no<00:00:23.460> need<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.060> no<00:00:24.570> want<00:00:24.960> of

tours but I have no need and no want of
the<00:00:25.860> front<00:00:26.130> axle<00:00:26.550> pulling<00:00:27.270> so<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.500> I'm<00:00:28.650> gonna

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the front axle pulling so what I'm gonna

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.250 
the front axle pulling so what I'm gonna
do<00:00:29.040> is<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> disable<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.900> which<00:00:31.110> is

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
do is I'm going to disable that which is

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
do is I'm going to disable that which is
very<00:00:31.399> simple<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> do

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
very simple to do

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.020 
very simple to do
it's<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.840> washer<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.969> here

it's that washer you can see right here

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
it's that washer you can see right here
as<00:00:37.280> that<00:00:38.280> shaft<00:00:38.609> moves<00:00:38.969> back<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.749> flips<00:00:40.679> it<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
as that shaft moves back it flips it and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.579 
as that shaft moves back it flips it and
that<00:00:41.429> engages<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> front<00:00:42.359> axle<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:43.379> gonna

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
that engages the front axle I'm gonna

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.619 
that engages the front axle I'm gonna
take<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.070> washer<00:00:44.670> take<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.179> whole<00:00:45.329> shaft

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
take that washer take the whole shaft

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.649 
take that washer take the whole shaft
out<00:00:45.899> take<00:00:46.679> that<00:00:46.710> washer<00:00:47.429> off<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.179> know<00:00:48.300> remove

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
out take that washer off you know remove

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.630 
out take that washer off you know remove
it<00:00:48.780> entirely<00:00:49.109> put<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.190> shelf<00:00:50.429> or<00:00:50.609> something

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.929> when<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.499> engage<00:00:53.329> low<00:00:54.329> range<00:00:54.829> it'll

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and then when I engage low range it'll

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.119 
and then when I engage low range it'll
it'll<00:00:56.309> only<00:00:56.609> be<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.569> rear<00:00:57.899> axles<00:00:58.499> and<00:00:58.739> the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.889 
it off the dash if it's necessary I can
flip<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.829> there<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:08.969> not<00:01:09.030> necessary

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
get in the way I need the speed I don't

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.929 
get in the way I need the speed I don't
need<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> traction<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.710> way<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.820> I'm

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
need the traction this way when I'm

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.260 
need the traction this way when I'm
running<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.450> hard<00:01:18.840> packed<00:01:19.200> gravel<00:01:19.500> or

running on hard packed gravel or
whatever<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.719> operating<00:01:21.899> on<00:01:22.409> even<00:01:23.159> if

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.319 
means that you could operate in low
range<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.649> parade<00:01:29.219> grounds<00:01:29.729> assuming<00:01:30.240> you

alright<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.740> got<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> cotter<00:01:59.159> pins

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
alright now that I got the cotter pins

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.160 
alright now that I got the cotter pins
out<00:02:00.320> should<00:02:01.320> just

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
out should just

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.270 
out should just
we'll<00:02:02.850> pull<00:02:03.850> these<00:02:04.030> pins<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:05.070> hope<00:02:06.070> that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
we'll pull these pins I hope that

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:25.160 
we'll pull these pins I hope that
linkage<00:02:06.670> doesn't<00:02:07.030> flop<00:02:07.299> around<00:02:07.679> not<00:02:08.679> too<00:02:08.830> bad

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.500 

fascinating<00:02:26.640> valve<00:02:27.640> operates<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.390> either

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
fascinating valve operates in either

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.630 
fascinating valve operates in either
direction<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:29.320> might<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.400> right
