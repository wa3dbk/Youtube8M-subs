I've looked around for a while for a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.250 
I've looked around for a while for a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
camera bag and I've even looked at the

sling type and one thing I don't really

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.169 
sling type and one thing I don't really
like<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.609> sling<00:00:26.880> type<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.750> bag<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.730> it's<00:00:29.730> great

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
like the sling type of bag is it's great

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.680 
like the sling type of bag is it's great
if<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.779> removing<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.590> camera<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.390> bag

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
if you're removing a camera from the bag

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.639 
if you're removing a camera from the bag
when<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.710> straps<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.059> convenient

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
when it straps you it's very convenient

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.970 
when it straps you it's very convenient
but<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.670> using<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.780> sling<00:00:40.110> that's

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
but if you are using a sling that's

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.139 
but if you are using a sling that's
placed<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> ground<00:00:41.730> or<00:00:41.850> anything<00:00:41.969> like

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
placed on the ground or anything like

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.330 
placed on the ground or anything like
that<00:00:42.210> basically<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> access<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that basically you have to access the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
that basically you have to access the
sling<00:00:44.760> sideways<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
sling sideways like this so you have to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.819 
sling sideways like this so you have to
open<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.030> pull<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> camera<00:00:48.829> I
