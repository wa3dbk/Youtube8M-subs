like<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.790> months<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.400> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400

super easiest thing ever and I think it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.260 
super easiest thing ever and I think it
looks<00:01:28.829> even<00:01:29.040> better<00:01:29.310> than<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.000> times

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
looks even better than a lot of times

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730 
looks even better than a lot of times
where<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> wear<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.049> crap<00:01:31.320> ton<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.619> makeup

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
where I wear like a crap ton of makeup

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.819

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
eyeliner on this side but there is a

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.150 
eyeliner on this side but there is a
little<00:03:21.690> bit<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> eyeliner<00:03:22.079> on<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.739> side<00:03:22.980> just

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
little bit of eyeliner on this side just

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.339 
little bit of eyeliner on this side just
to<00:03:23.280> enhance<00:03:23.489> my<00:03:23.910> lash<00:03:24.120> line<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.599> find<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.079> look

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
to enhance my lash line I find this look

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.490 
to enhance my lash line I find this look
so<00:03:25.739> easy<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.519> such<00:03:26.879> a<00:03:26.910> pretty<00:03:27.329> natural<00:03:27.840> look

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
so easy and such a pretty natural look

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.009
