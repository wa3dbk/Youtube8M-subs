a look at dart the Triceratops and he is

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.540 
a look at dart the Triceratops and he is
one<00:00:31.190> of<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.430> new<00:00:31.750> 2014<00:00:32.750> version<00:00:33.400> switching<00:00:34.400> go

dinos he's a cool little white car when
I<00:00:41.720> say<00:00:41.960> little<00:00:42.200> he's<00:00:42.790> very<00:00:43.790> little<00:00:44.120> he's

I say little he's very little he's
actually<00:00:44.510> quite<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:44.960> bit<00:00:45.200> smaller<00:00:45.470> than<00:00:45.650> the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
actually quite a bit smaller than the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.890 
actually quite a bit smaller than the

original the original switching go dinos
see<00:00:50.900> right<00:00:51.110> there<00:00:51.320> quite<00:00:51.770> a<00:00:51.800> bit<00:00:51.950> of<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.250> size

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
see right there quite a bit of a size

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.720 
see right there quite a bit of a size
reduction<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:54.920> should<00:00:55.100> call<00:00:55.280> him<00:00:55.340> sort<00:00:55.580> of<00:00:55.640> a

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
reduction you should call him sort of a

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.920 
reduction you should call him sort of a
scout<00:00:56.030> class<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:58.210> although<00:00:59.210> he<00:00:59.450> does<00:00:59.630> retain

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
scout class and although he does retain

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.160 
scout class and although he does retain
his<00:01:00.310> sound<00:01:01.310> gimmick<00:01:01.760> 3-way<00:01:02.630> switch<00:01:02.900> right

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
his sound gimmick 3-way switch right

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.999 
his sound gimmick 3-way switch right
here<00:01:03.440> loud<00:01:03.770> medium<00:01:04.610> off<00:01:05.740> doesn't<00:01:06.740> seem<00:01:06.920> to

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
here loud medium off doesn't seem to

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.150 
here loud medium off doesn't seem to
have<00:01:07.160> any<00:01:07.310> light<00:01:08.140> functions<00:01:09.140> like<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.500> 2013

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
have any light functions like the 2013

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.210 
have any light functions like the 2013
line<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:10.900> I<00:01:11.900> didn't<00:01:12.530> see<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:12.740> mentioned<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.130> the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
line so I didn't see it mentioned on the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.710 
line so I didn't see it mentioned on the
box<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.759> maybe<00:01:13.970> they've<00:01:14.150> just<00:01:14.330> done<00:01:14.479> away<00:01:14.690> with

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
box so maybe they've just done away with

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.330 
box so maybe they've just done away with
that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.700 
that
however<00:01:16.340> they<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:16.790> added<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.930> believe<00:01:18.229> it's

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
however they have added I believe it's

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.499 
however they have added I believe it's
called<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:18.950> friction<00:01:19.190> drive<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.000> basically

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
called a friction drive and basically

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.030 
called a friction drive and basically
it's<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.259> kind<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.530> thing<00:01:21.710> where<00:01:21.830> when<00:01:21.950> you

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
it's the kind of thing where when you

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.290 
it's the kind of thing where when you
push<00:01:22.250> him<00:01:22.399> along<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.759> ground<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:25.729> stores<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
push him along the ground it stores the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.270 
push him along the ground it stores the
energy<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.930> keeps<00:01:27.649> him<00:01:27.830> going

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
energy and keeps him going

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.180 
energy and keeps him going
so<00:01:28.670> uh<00:01:28.899> you<00:01:29.899> know<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.530> kind<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.920> fun<00:01:31.160> little

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
so uh you know just kind of a fun little

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.130 
so uh you know just kind of a fun little
action<00:01:31.700> feature<00:01:31.910> and<00:01:32.300> if<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.750> have<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.899> couple

action feature and if you have a couple

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.590 
action feature and if you have a couple
of<00:01:33.289> these<00:01:33.410> you<00:01:33.679> can<00:01:33.830> race<00:01:34.729> them<00:01:34.910> around<00:01:35.119> smash

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
of these you can race them around smash

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.059 
of these you can race them around smash
them<00:01:35.780> into<00:01:35.840> stuff<00:01:36.200> make<00:01:36.530> them<00:01:36.619> drive<00:01:36.830> over

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
them into stuff make them drive over

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.570 
them into stuff make them drive over
things<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.759> know<00:01:37.880> have<00:01:38.539> fun<00:01:38.750> like<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.140> kid

things you know have fun like a kid

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.469 
things you know have fun like a kid
since<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.819> kid's<00:01:41.060> toy

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479

since it is a kid's toy
okay<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.119> sound<00:01:44.119> effects

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320 

and<00:01:57.700> that's<00:01:58.570> all<00:01:58.780> very<00:01:59.050> fun<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:01.030> main

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
and that's all very fun but the main

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.790 
and that's all very fun but the main
attraction<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:01.990> course<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.500> he<00:02:02.590> turns

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
attraction of course is that he turns

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.190 
attraction of course is that he turns
into<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.370> robot<00:02:03.880> dinosaur<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.840> flip<00:02:05.080> his

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
into a robot dinosaur so you flip his

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.150 
into a robot dinosaur so you flip his
tail<00:02:05.440> down<00:02:05.620> and<00:02:06.510> then<00:02:07.510> these<00:02:08.320> gray<00:02:08.740> pieces

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
tail down and then these gray pieces

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.800 
tail down and then these gray pieces
will<00:02:09.310> flip<00:02:09.550> back<00:02:09.760> and<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.119> white<00:02:10.360> piece<00:02:10.570> will

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
will flip back and this white piece will

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.690 
will flip back and this white piece will
flip<00:02:11.050> back<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.770> white<00:02:12.130> piece<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.550> what

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
flip back the white piece is what

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.070 
flip back the white piece is what
activates<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.300> sound<00:02:13.570> clip<00:02:13.840> for

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
activates the sound clip for

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.740 
activates the sound clip for
transformation<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.040> go<00:02:21.630> which<00:02:22.630> of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
transformation so here we go which of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.730 
transformation so here we go which of
course<00:02:22.780> you've<00:02:23.140> already<00:02:23.260> heard<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.710> intro

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
some detail on the head frill not a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.110 
some detail on the head frill not a
whole<00:02:41.110> lot<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.880> robot<00:02:43.720> Dino<00:02:43.990> legs<00:02:44.350> but

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
whole lot on the the robot Dino legs but

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.960 
whole lot on the the robot Dino legs but
yeah<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.330> know<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.140> ridges<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.280> you

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
yeah you know in the the ridges that you

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.400 
yeah you know in the the ridges that you
know<00:02:49.060> obviously<00:02:49.390> they're<00:02:49.570> there<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:49.960> car<00:02:50.200> mode

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
know obviously they're there in car mode

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.230 
know obviously they're there in car mode
but<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.890> don't<00:02:51.070> necessarily<00:02:51.250> see<00:02:51.910> them<00:02:52.030> but
