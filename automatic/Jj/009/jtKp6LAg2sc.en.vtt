00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.470
 hello good for blind and we will be this video with a first contact and a 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.079
 small analysis 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.199
 initial of colo qurez 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.400
 poster 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.289
 it's a game 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.320
 give me I think it is the third of the room or the second I'm not sure what happens 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.380
 is he good 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.260
 the previous one was based on sentís in the Mexican period epoch of the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 jeans and if I remember correctly 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.269
 while this one is based is inspired by the current time the 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.410
 argument to grosso modo mother 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
 of a Mexican drug cartel the one that pulled out very strong that rides a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.800
 attack on 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.410
 in the united states then 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.249
 Americans of the heap or kind of independent anti-terrorist cell 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.080
 and declares war on this poster 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.240
 good in general we are talking about a driver in the first person 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.440
 by the way is that I already placed me juárez 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.480
 in the style of colloquia and but that is not a mere coincidence nobel and in the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.490
 name is not 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.119
 I am afraid of the only thing that they have tried to copy to the colloquium I think that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.459
 little with him as he says jan fischer first person 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.020
 Mao Christmas campaign mode 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.700
 with tito action shares the world is in very serious state contains a 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.920
 decided 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.360
 When you spend that corporate amin other elements such as time can be 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.429
 bullet that the campaign can be played 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.440
 cooperatively among several players between three 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.820
 and well I think that except that the attempt to do many things and without any 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.060
 finished or not at all 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.790
 Well, here we start 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.259
 percent and with one of the first missions of the game we have done 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.740
 we are facing 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.160
 create a war between bands 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 and now because we're not asking for 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.640
 mid-August to the three characters 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.900
 in the main this triumph 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.199
 then being hanover 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.199
 we are trying to advance an accident we can catch 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.459
 objects are collectibles north the typical not that they are scattered by the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.589
 mapped and 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.849
 if we choose all for this and we have more points and 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.159
 things do not 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.509
 so much of good I'm looking for the gun 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:28.809
 bush at the time 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.889
 an example of bullet time 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.769
 since then it has been reflected in estoril these entrepreneurs of the meat 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.209
 this tribute 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.379
 criticized the gun because in the main human cost ascope stems a 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.999
 shit 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.999
 these I have no choice but to continue using the piston 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.219
 another one of the curious things about the west feef 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.969
 common four shots that you hit the cars the cars already explode 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.039
 which for good as tactical element is okay did not operate tip a little 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.849
 of realism does not put a spectacular spectacular to the goalkeeper 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.849
 d to remove realism as had been said on the phone 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.989
 a gun because 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.929
 a shotgun could not do a shit 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.929
 we are trying to get closer to the car to escape 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.859
 in controls for good is the only thing 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.419
 the focus that unravels is that the end is him 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.059
 the recharge in the triangle with him would be giving when you come out to be 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.189
 accustomed to the tri load being 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.279
 the square nor that is a bit otherwise otherwise well 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:37.029
 the camera at the time of aiming and such no no I did not finish it turns out the whole 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.639
 comfortable I do not wish he knew that he 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.959
 try 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.579
 always creates a very frenetic rhythm 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.889
 but wolf takes a lot pointed ariel character moves slow not then that 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.040
 edes fits a bit not because later when we already have heart and undo a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.039
 focus on transaction 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.079
 but then the character does not respond to 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.669
 at the speed that fire development 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:03.829
 it implies 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.589
 and here you can deny we take the car 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:10.589
 this is very common in almost all missions we have to drive though 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:11.829
 well, good 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.120
 that is simply a mere procedure because bocón had a touch is the car 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 and here we have made a mistake we have to open to the right 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.659
 I said that 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.469
 and confessed that he crossed to go out king 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.469
 and shoot those who show up 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.879
 good in this case percent 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.470
 I'm not pointing 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.969
 I'm not voting on the point button 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.229
 percent is a bit of the game and when they kill you while our pointing 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.579
 something that can be very usual because when reloading the 

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:53.709
 heading for one hundred you stay aim and offices that 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.900
 to restart 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.120
 and in this case it looks 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.729
 oo driving I'm going to often armida shares yes for example anything and 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:05.699
 To come back 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.689
 as the camera goes crazy it gets low and the car becomes 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.639
 almost drive 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.199
 Well, this is one of the most negative aspects of the game and it is that 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.129
 is full of bush 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.949
 texture which looks bad percent mogollón of camera failures 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.310
 percent many times especially when they call you on your mobile phone not because 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.270
 sometimes you are when how and what you pretend to be called by the mobile 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.599
 well 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.419
 They call you on your mobile and what you're hearing that the audio status 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.439
 He spoke Spanish does not correspond to the subtitles in Castilian 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.469
 a mess 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.580
 and well this you see here what came after a kalashnikov is a 

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:47.710
 shell 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.710
 per cent what happens is that you play 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.050
 it looks like one each as 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.569
 like a cupcake peraza 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.589
 in the shop below the Chinese 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:04.469
 they sell plastic weapons that look more like the mirror or not and this is an opera 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.729
 min of the things that I liked cooke 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.430
 despite having a 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.479
 a to go to graficado quite good with 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:16.999
 ccoo in more before detailing the textures and some lighting effects and such 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.629
 but 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.699
 to this day there are still subways 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.120
 where they take out weapons that are toys that this one and nobody believes them 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.089
 that is 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.379
 which is that they look like plastic and I think that by now 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.110
 that should not happen 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.199
 I think I do not see it measured and another is one of the things that in osman liked 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.990
 besides things also that I did not like any of this typography what 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.210
 well here and in him he lived maybe if you see him in small he appreciates us so much 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.970
 but when you're on TV 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.540
 if it is big besides especially 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.370
 it's not a salty supercup typography it was super old it's seems to me it 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.229
 I feel very austere 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.159
 and it looks like it's playing with the spectrum 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:04.569
 also here you can see the protavoz dust joshua barcina his vest his cross 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:05.469
 over 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:09.299
 the thing about two belt caps as if he were a Texan 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.960
 well I also think the design of the main character very tacky 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.979
 so in conclusion 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.969
 a truck game I did not like a lot 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:26.139
 as I said at the beginning of the video I think he stressed that it compensates 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.399
 he ends them doing well at all 

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.679
 it has in good things not like a good story a good graphic engine 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:36.399
 the possibility of playing cooperatively with two other friends 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.490
 to campaign mode 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.689
 but then its mechanics does not bring anything new and 

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:44.029
 It seems crazy to him because that 

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.699
 as a copy of in the Chinese one-way colloquium 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.710
 he has not said that the one that is called colo juárez the copy of names I do not know that 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.659
 the copy does not remain only in the name 

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:56.210
 so in conclusion I think your son is going to have them 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.050
 and well I also wanted to apologize because maybe I made a 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.929
 little too fast he lived loved with 

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:07.199
 with the quality all the care that only put in the text the videos also 

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:10.379
 is more than anything because year with huma liked and and in what I want 

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:13.889
 invest more time than you deserve 

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:14.699
 so, goodbye
