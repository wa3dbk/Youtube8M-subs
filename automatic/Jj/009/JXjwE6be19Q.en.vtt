was good I think I was talking a lot

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.210 
was good I think I was talking a lot
more<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.670> beginning<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.500> overall<00:03:25.799> pretty

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
more in the beginning but overall pretty

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.280 
more in the beginning but overall pretty
good<00:03:26.459> date<00:03:26.670> was<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.359> as<00:03:27.510> awkward<00:03:27.840> as<00:03:28.200> they

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
good date was it as awkward as they

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.170 
good date was it as awkward as they
thought<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.590> would<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.829> as<00:03:29.730> far<00:03:29.970> as<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
thought it would be as far as the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.059 
thought it would be as far as the
romantic<00:03:30.480> connection<00:03:30.750> it's<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.950> bit

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
romantic connection it's a little bit

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.580 
romantic connection it's a little bit
too<00:03:32.250> early<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.730> tell<00:03:33.019> sometimes<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.409> know<00:03:34.530> you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
too early to tell sometimes you know you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.520 
too early to tell sometimes you know you
might<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.250> get<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.049> person<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
might have to get to know a person a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.110 
might have to get to know a person a
little<00:03:37.680> bit<00:03:37.859> better<00:03:38.159> or<00:03:38.459> actually<00:03:38.849> you<00:03:38.970> know

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
get romantic with them no it doesn't

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.420 
get romantic with them no it doesn't
romantic<00:03:42.359> connection<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.139> only<00:03:43.920> time<00:03:44.190> can

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
romantic connection but only time can

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.940 
romantic connection but only time can
tell<00:03:44.540> maybe<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.810> we<00:03:46.019> go<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.409> second<00:03:46.799> date

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
tell maybe if we go on the second date

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.509 
tell maybe if we go on the second date
I'll<00:03:47.670> find<00:03:47.939> that<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.590> don't<00:03:49.590> see<00:03:49.889> a<00:03:49.920> romantic

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
I'll find that I don't see a romantic

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.580 
I'll find that I don't see a romantic
connection<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.359> because<00:03:52.019> we<00:03:52.170> don't<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:52.439> a

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
connection just because we don't have a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.629 
connection just because we don't have a
lot<00:03:52.859> in<00:03:53.040> common

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
lot in common

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.199 
lot in common
he's<00:03:54.239> very<00:03:54.569> nice<00:03:54.870> very<00:03:55.379> sweet<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.579> there's

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
he's very nice very sweet but there's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.690 
he's very nice very sweet but there's
not<00:03:57.420> much<00:03:57.870> there<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.409> we<00:03:58.560> would<00:03:58.980> do<00:03:59.159> together

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
not much there that we would do together

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.399 
not much there that we would do together
I<00:03:59.849> think<00:04:00.120> his<00:04:00.299> interests<00:04:00.840> are<00:04:00.930> definitely

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
I think his interests are definitely

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.229 
I think his interests are definitely
different<00:04:01.799> than<00:04:01.920> mine<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.400> would<00:04:02.760> definitely

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
different than mine I would definitely

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.920 
different than mine I would definitely
go<00:04:03.420> out<00:04:03.659> on<00:04:04.319> another<00:04:04.379> day<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.250> Linda<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:05.930> I

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
go out on another day with Linda and I

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.129 
go out on another day with Linda and I
will<00:04:07.139> be<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.709> idiot<00:04:08.250> not<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.389> don't<00:04:09.569> think<00:04:09.810> I

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
will be a idiot not to I don't think I

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.689 
will be a idiot not to I don't think I
would<00:04:10.440> go<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.620> another<00:04:10.889> date<00:04:11.099> with<00:04:11.250> him<00:04:11.430> just

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
would go on another date with him just

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:12.920 
would go on another date with him just
because<00:04:11.879> I<00:04:12.000> already<00:04:12.209> know<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.540> we<00:04:12.810> don't

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
because I already know that we don't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.720 
because I already know that we don't
have<00:04:13.049> similarities<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.919> wouldn't<00:04:14.400> want<00:04:14.609> to

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
have similarities I wouldn't want to

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.690 
have similarities I wouldn't want to
waste<00:04:15.180> his<00:04:15.480> time
