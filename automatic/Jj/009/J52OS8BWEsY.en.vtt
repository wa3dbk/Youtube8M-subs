00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
either side do you remember that we are

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.950 
either side do you remember that we are
using<00:01:49.130> hardware<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.420> does<00:01:50.630> get<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.840> little

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
using hardware so it does get a little

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.719 
using hardware so it does get a little
heavy<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.740> would<00:01:51.950> lean<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
heavy so I would lean on the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.520 
heavy so I would lean on the
conservative<00:01:53.299> side<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:53.539> just<00:01:53.929> have<00:01:54.200> fun<00:01:54.409> with

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
conservative side but just have fun with

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.590 
conservative side but just have fun with
it<00:01:54.709> layer<00:01:55.190> different<00:01:55.399> sets<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:55.940> washers<00:01:56.420> and

it layer different sets of washers and
colors<00:01:56.959> and<00:01:57.140> you'll<00:01:57.649> really<00:01:57.830> find<00:01:58.009> something

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
colors and you'll really find something

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.850 
colors and you'll really find something
that<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.490> like<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:59.000> am<00:01:59.360> more<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.470> matchy

since<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.870> are<00:02:29.959> using<00:02:30.110> nylon<00:02:30.470> cord<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.310> bit

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
since we are using nylon cord it's a bit

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.300 
since we are using nylon cord it's a bit
harder<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.790> double<00:02:32.150> not<00:02:32.330> slippery<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.739> cut<00:02:34.220> off

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
harder to double not slippery so cut off

both excess sides make sure you don't

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.979 
both excess sides make sure you don't
cut<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.280> necklace<00:02:37.730> then<00:02:38.450> take<00:02:38.629> your<00:02:38.780> lighter

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989
