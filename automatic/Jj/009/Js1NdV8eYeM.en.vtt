stronghold or second drill hall because

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.330 
stronghold or second drill hall because
you<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> most<00:00:55.110> drops<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.190> my

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you get the most drops out of it in my

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.580 
you get the most drops out of it in my
opinion<00:00:56.570> depending<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
opinion depending on you know where you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.229 
opinion depending on you know where you
stand<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.579> usually<00:00:59.820> stand<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.210> right

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
stand and I usually stand like right

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.990 
stand and I usually stand like right
next<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> portal<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.370> plenty<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
next to the portal so I get plenty of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.149 
next to the portal so I get plenty of
drops<00:01:03.239> when<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> train<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> yeah<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
drops when I train there and yeah I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:05.870 
drops when I train there and yeah I
farmed

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
farmed

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
farmed
four<00:01:06.150> hundred<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.540> seventy<00:01:06.869> coins<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.350> far<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
four hundred and seventy coins so far I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.690 
four hundred and seventy coins so far I
think<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.549> took<00:01:08.880> roughly<00:01:09.840> about<00:01:10.250> three<00:01:11.250> days

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
think this took roughly about three days

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
think this took roughly about three days
worth<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.450> two<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> half<00:01:12.960> days<00:01:13.439> worth

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
worth or like two and a half days worth

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.960 
worth or like two and a half days worth
of<00:01:13.920> farming

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
of farming

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.620 
of farming
I<00:01:15.000> usually<00:01:16.520> estimate<00:01:17.520> around<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.330> get

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
I usually estimate around or I get

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
I usually estimate around or I get
around<00:01:19.310> 2,000<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.600> 3,000<00:01:21.600> boxes<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> day<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
around 2,000 or 3,000 boxes a day so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.929 
around 2,000 or 3,000 boxes a day so
it's<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.520> too<00:01:23.729> bad

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it's not too bad

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's not too bad
