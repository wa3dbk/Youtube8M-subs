00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
anchored back into place the next step

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.320

compartment<00:00:07.970> and<00:00:09.080> as<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.230> recall<00:00:10.380> from<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
compartment and as you recall from the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.100 
compartment and as you recall from the
teardown<00:00:11.880> part<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.360> video<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.080> little

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
teardown part of the video it's a little

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.460 
teardown part of the video it's a little
bit<00:00:13.440> tricky<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.769> finagle<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.519> into<00:00:14.910> place<00:00:15.470> but

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
bit tricky to finagle it into place but

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.830 
bit tricky to finagle it into place but
essentially<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.310> slides<00:00:18.240> back<00:00:18.480> into<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
essentially it just slides back into the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.220 
essentially it just slides back into the
hole<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.520> then<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> tricky<00:00:21.840> part<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.109> just

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
hole and then the tricky part is just

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.279 
hole and then the tricky part is just
getting<00:00:22.320> these<00:00:22.619> tabs<00:00:22.920> down<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.289> clear

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
getting these tabs down here to clear

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.550 
getting these tabs down here to clear
this<00:00:25.470> plastic<00:00:26.099> piece<00:00:26.220> right<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:27.560> there's

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this plastic piece right here there's

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.759 
this plastic piece right here there's
also<00:00:28.710> three<00:00:29.990> retainer<00:00:30.990> Clips<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.619> want

one on each side I forgot to mention
before<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> step<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.729> to

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
before you do that step you do want to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.980 
before you do that step you do want to
put<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> key<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.740> ignition<00:01:20.990> don'tdon't

put the key in the ignition don'tdon't

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
put the key in the ignition don'tdon't
you<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.439> need<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> start<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> car

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you don't actually need to start the car

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
you don't actually need to start the car
but<00:01:23.460> turn<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> ignition<00:01:24.570> into<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
but turn the ignition into the on

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
but turn the ignition into the on
position<00:01:26.119> shift<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> lever<00:01:27.420> down<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:27.930> first

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
position shift the lever down into first

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
position shift the lever down into first
gear<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> get<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> way<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
gear so you get it out of the way and of

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.410 
gear so you get it out of the way and of
course<00:01:30.659> set<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:30.990> parking<00:01:31.110> brake<00:01:31.880> if<00:01:32.880> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
course set your parking brake if you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.210 
course set your parking brake if you
have<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> shifter<00:01:34.259> all<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> way<00:01:34.799> forward<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
have a shifter all the way forward in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740 
have a shifter all the way forward in
Park<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.880> won't<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.150> able<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> get<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.509> piece

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
Park you won't be able to get this piece

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.990 
Park you won't be able to get this piece
back<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.740> forgot<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> mention<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
back in so I forgot to mention that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.440 
back in so I forgot to mention that
again<00:01:39.390> before<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.810> installed<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.799> part<00:01:41.100> but

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
again before I installed that part but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.580 
again before I installed that part but
that's<00:01:42.450> pretty<00:01:43.020> self-explanatory

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that's pretty self-explanatory

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.260 
that's pretty self-explanatory
I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.369> everybody<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:44.790> figure<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.060> in

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
I think everybody would figure that in

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.210 
I think everybody would figure that in
anyway<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.590> mentioned<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.009> during

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
anyway I think I mentioned that during

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.210 
anyway I think I mentioned that during
the<00:01:47.430> disassembly<00:01:48.240> portion<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.560> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the disassembly portion but I just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.060 
the disassembly portion but I just

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
reinstall this piece which should just

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.340

sit<00:01:59.729> back<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.060> place<00:02:01.430> like<00:02:03.200> basically<00:02:04.200> like

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
sit back in place like basically like

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.590
