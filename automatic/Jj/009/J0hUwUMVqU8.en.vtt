different than what I normally see out
for<00:01:34.270> sale<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:34.930> that's<00:01:35.829> why<00:01:36.039> I<00:01:36.070> made<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
for sale so that's why I made it and and

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.560 
for sale so that's why I made it and and
I'm<00:01:39.369> going<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.549> get<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.759> question<00:01:39.969> where<00:01:40.450> did

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
I'm going to get the question where did

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.660 
I'm going to get the question where did
I<00:01:40.659> buy<00:01:40.840> all<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.200> little<00:01:41.409> things<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.549> it

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
I buy all the little things and is it

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.380 
I buy all the little things and is it
hard<00:01:42.969> and<00:01:43.390> how<00:01:43.539> did<00:01:43.689> I<00:01:43.780> do<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:45.579> won't<00:01:46.210> lie

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
hard and how did I do it and I won't lie

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.060 
hard and how did I do it and I won't lie
it<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.719> pretty<00:01:46.960> time<00:01:47.229> consuming<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:47.859> tedious

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
it is pretty time consuming and tedious

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.999 
it is pretty time consuming and tedious
so<00:01:48.780> probably<00:01:49.780> gonna<00:01:49.929> recommend<00:01:50.229> that<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:50.829> go

so probably gonna recommend that you go
out<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:51.399> buy<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.670> for<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.270> most<00:01:52.390> part<00:01:52.689> but<00:01:53.409> if
