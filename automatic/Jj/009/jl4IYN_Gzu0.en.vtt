00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:08.140
 we do not have this laser tablet 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:12.810
 seven inches and has a sheet 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:20.670
 number f 7 61 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:24.010
 a work efe 761 version 2.0 has a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.750
 it fails and it is that it does not understand 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.050
 and we are going to see 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 that only shows that it's loading if the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 we can load 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.760
 we see that it appears that it is loading 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.760
 with the charger 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.270
 needle 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.140
 and if we try with the other charger 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.140
 dump the mini usb charger 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.580
 shows us here that the bulb 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.180
 load indicator and here I want to explain 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.180
 two things 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.920
 a 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.920
 that when meters 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.510
 the needle that of 2000 mini amps 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.470
 it shows that it is loading 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.470
 and we see what 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.850
 showing that it loads the tablet 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.790
 but after several hours 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.549
 even after several hours of that 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.729
 it appears that it is loading as we see there 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.570
 is disconnected and has been turned on and not 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.140
 does nothing 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.120
 and just turn on 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.120
 when connected to the charger 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.960
 today we see that if you understand perfectly 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.610
 all normal functions make them 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.500
 from function to touch and everything that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.420
 we want to do normal but connected to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.190
 the current if we disconnect it 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.460
 then look what happens 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.380
 it automatically turns off 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.430
 if I want to do the same the first 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.430
 mini usb charger 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.650
 to light it 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.569
 there we see that I am giving him power 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.610
 but it does not turn on this is because the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.720
 charger that I am using for the mini 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:30.280
 usb is 1200 milliamps 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:35.130
 of 1 point and is that I'm using 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.040
 of needle is from 2 to 2000 milliamps 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.550
 with that yes it is enough here levy power 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.620
 and it does not turn on because that amperage is not 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.130
 he really enough to be able 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.210
 feed the says power and be able to do 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.360
 turn on the tablet but just enter 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.880
 the plugin 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.160
 start charging and turn on with that 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.960
 when we have a failure of that what 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.060
 first thing we're going to do is review what 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.060
 voltage is in the battery 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.380
 we put our multimeter we already know 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.980
 on the 20 volt measurement scale 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.680
 continuous 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.319
 we measure and we see that a voltage appears 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.510
 of 2.47 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.349
 meaning that the charging voltage 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.349
 if it's coming 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.810
 and the charging voltage is coming and 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.280
 let's unplug it and go back to 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.280
 prove what voltage is coming 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.900
 247 is the same voltage that I had when 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.640
 I was with the battery meaning 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.320
 that is not accumulating a voltage 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.850
 because remember, I said I left it 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.340
 several hours loading and the client 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.740
 He also leaves it several hours and does not 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.270
 turn on 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.340
 when looking at this is happening 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.220
 then what follows next 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.980
 as explained 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.150
 is to tell you the direct cables 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.519
 of the charger 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.519
 to the battery of the tablet 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.699
 with this we will get this power 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.549
 rule out if after 20 minutes you have not 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.780
 taken a download the tablet is 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.300
 damaged and we would have to replace it 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.620
 and here already after spending half an hour of 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.130
 charge the battery has taken 3.76 volts 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.830
 from 3 volts and to the battery this one 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.340
 returns to its normal function as they bring 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.169
 the protective circuits a transit a 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.780
 transistor inside that helps control 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.830
 that and when the battery has stopped 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.919
 charge that circuit is disabled 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.900
 so it does not allow to enter voltage to 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.880
 the battery that was why he had the 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.620
 good pin when we connect the charger 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.380
 here comes a voltage but the tablet 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.720
 I never received it because of the battery, I never 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.010
 received and that circuit had been turned off 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:09.470
 and when reactivating again giving it voltage 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.750
 direct to the battery to more than 3 volts 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.970
 that is, let accumulate more than 3 volts 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.340
 in the battery that cell returns 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.040
 again to work and when receiving 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.990
 load but now we're going to observe that 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.210
 now if the tablet already turns on 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.210
 for example let's put the load 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.849
 and shows that it is loading 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.719
 we give him 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.719
 turn on 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.410
 let's hide it 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.880
 the fire is already beginning to 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.130
 load your operating system and you already 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.290
 disconnected the charger there we see that what 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.020
 disconnect the tablet keeps running 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.240
 is still on because the battery is already 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.180
 reanimated and right now we are going to 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.430
 Approve 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.150
 yes with the mini usb charger 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.139
 of 1200 milliamps will load the 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.210
 tablet already with its battery 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.210
 this reanimates again 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.870
 there we see that now it turns on with the 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.380
 mini usb charger what was not 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.390
 previously 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.520
