of packages out there you can use the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.769 
of packages out there you can use the

ones off the top of my head I can think

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.250 
ones off the top of my head I can think

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.049 
rail and just FYI I'm not being paid to
endorse<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.980> something<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.670> purchased

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
endorse this it's something I purchased

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
endorse this it's something I purchased
back<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:49.129> 2001<00:00:50.510> based<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.590> ads<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.160> Model

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
back in 2001 based on some ads and Model

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
back in 2001 based on some ads and Model
Railroader<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.750> time<00:00:54.989> was

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
Railroader and I think at the time was

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.729 
Railroader and I think at the time was
one<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.640> CAD<00:00:56.640> programs<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.360> had<00:00:57.510> been

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
one of the CAD programs that had been

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.799 
one of the CAD programs that had been
around<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:59.160> quite<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.789> while<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.719> was

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
around for quite a while I think it was

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
around for quite a while I think it was
a<00:01:00.870> DOS<00:01:01.109> version<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.160> time<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
a DOS version of it at one time so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.609 
a DOS version of it at one time so
that's<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> went<00:01:04.379> with

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that's what I went with

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.870 
that's what I went with
and<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.479> happy<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.580> um<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.760> you're

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and I was happy with it but um if you're

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
and I was happy with it but um if you're
interested<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.390> checking<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.229> any<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.770> these

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
interested in checking out any of these

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100 
interested in checking out any of these
programs<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.850> go<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> their<00:01:12.390> websites

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
programs you can go to their websites

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.490 
programs you can go to their websites
and<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.880> mine<00:01:15.450> OCAD<00:01:15.750> rail<00:01:15.960> has<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> demo

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and I think mine OCAD rail has a demo

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
and I think mine OCAD rail has a demo
version<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.240> sure

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
version out there and I'm pretty sure

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
version out there and I'm pretty sure
third<00:01:18.869> planet<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> them<00:01:19.920> have

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
third planet I think all of them have

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.730 
third planet I think all of them have
demo<00:01:20.340> versions<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.740> download

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
demo versions out there you can download

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
demo versions out there you can download
and<00:01:23.280> play<00:01:23.880> around<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.159> I'll<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.310> using

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and play around with but I'll be using

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.700 
and play around with but I'll be using
kaz<00:01:27.900> rail<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.799> demo<00:01:29.490> today<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.329> to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
kaz rail for this demo today just to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.469 
kaz rail for this demo today just to
give<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> feel<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
give you a feel for what it's like to

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
give you a feel for what it's like to
use<00:01:33.509> CAD<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.079> you've<00:01:34.200> never<00:01:34.350> used<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.040> before

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
use CAD if you've never used it before

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.600 
use CAD if you've never used it before
and<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.590> familiar<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.770> using

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and if you are familiar with using

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.499 
and if you are familiar with using
computer-aided<00:01:39.570> design<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:41.210> building<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
computer-aided design in building and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080 
computer-aided design in building and
you<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.560> designing<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.159> layout<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:44.939> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you know designing your layout then you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.050 
you know designing your layout then you
can<00:01:45.240> probably<00:01:45.509> skip<00:01:46.500> over<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.070> section<00:01:47.369> but

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
can probably skip over this section but

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030 
can probably skip over this section but
if<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.990> haven't<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.590> you're<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.860> familiar

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
if you haven't if you're not familiar

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.020 
if you haven't if you're not familiar
with<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
with it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.810 
with it
or<00:01:51.119> been<00:01:51.840> nervous<00:01:52.770> about<00:01:52.920> trying<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> learn<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
or been nervous about trying to learn a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
or been nervous about trying to learn a
program<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.380> mean<00:01:55.500> there's<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
program like this I mean there's a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380 
program like this I mean there's a
little<00:01:55.979> bit<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.280> learning<00:01:56.520> curve<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.090> once

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
little bit of a learning curve but once

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.749 
little bit of a learning curve but once
you<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.799> basics<00:01:59.159> down<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.610> not

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
you get the the basics down it's not

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.840 
you get the the basics down it's not
that<00:02:00.000> bad

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
that bad

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.260 
that bad
and<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.590> may<00:02:02.740> even<00:02:02.770> wonder<00:02:03.100> what<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.090> did

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and you may even wonder what you did

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.109 
and you may even wonder what you did
without<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.350> for<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.680> long<00:02:05.710> for<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.610> many<00:02:06.790> years

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
without it for so long for so many years

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.650 
without it for so long for so many years
so<00:02:07.450> go<00:02:07.869> ahead<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.880> get<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.030> with<00:02:10.509> this

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
so go ahead and get on with this

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.350 
so go ahead and get on with this
tutorial<00:02:14.520> okay<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:17.160> CAD<00:02:18.160> rail<00:02:18.400> version

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
tutorial okay this is a CAD rail version

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.780 
tutorial okay this is a CAD rail version
9<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.910> plan<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:23.140> my<00:02:23.530> model<00:02:24.370> railroad

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
9 this is the plan of my model railroad

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
9 this is the plan of my model railroad
such<00:02:25.510> as<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.410> now<00:02:27.120> always<00:02:28.120> subject<00:02:28.750> to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
such as it is for now always subject to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.650 
such as it is for now always subject to
change<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.380> can<00:02:32.530> see<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.510> is

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
change and as you can see I have this is

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.009 
change and as you can see I have this is
the<00:02:34.840> basic<00:02:35.290> layout<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:37.330> room<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.900> it

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
the basic layout of the room I have it

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.690 
the basic layout of the room I have it
in<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.769> my<00:02:38.980> basement

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
in in my basement

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.960 
in in my basement
and<00:02:39.989> as<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.530> can<00:02:41.650> see<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.890> drew<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.459> all<00:02:42.610> sorts

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
and as you can see I drew in all sorts

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.370 
and as you can see I drew in all sorts
of<00:02:43.000> little<00:02:43.180> features<00:02:43.660> here<00:02:43.959> I've<00:02:44.080> got<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
of little features here I've got the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.020 
of little features here I've got the
walls<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.950> there

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
walls in there

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.180 
walls in there
I've<00:02:46.600> drawn<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:48.190> also<00:02:48.540> drew<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:50.190> those

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
I've drawn in and I also drew in those

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.110 
I've drawn in and I also drew in those
items<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.810> here<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.500> are<00:02:54.190> permanent<00:02:54.670> measure

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
items in here that are permanent measure

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.970 
items in here that are permanent measure
them<00:02:55.360> their<00:02:55.840> location<00:02:56.470> there's<00:02:56.830> their

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
them their location there's their

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.680 
them their location there's their
approximate<00:02:57.549> size<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.030> drew<00:02:58.180> them<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.450> here

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
approximate size and drew them in here

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.470 
approximate size and drew them in here
because<00:02:58.870> these<00:02:59.260> are<00:02:59.549> obstacles<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.910> are<00:03:01.120> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
because these are obstacles that are and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.120 
because these are obstacles that are and
movable<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.500> I'm<00:03:02.590> gonna<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.890> plan

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
movable and so I'm gonna have to plan

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.600 
movable and so I'm gonna have to plan
around<00:03:03.370> them<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.060> your<00:03:04.180> room<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.690> have

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
around them so if in your room you have

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.860 
around them so if in your room you have
this<00:03:06.610> kind<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.940> situation<00:03:07.150> if<00:03:07.720> you're

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
this kind of a situation if you're

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.069 
this kind of a situation if you're
building<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.290> layout<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.799> basement<00:03:09.989> one<00:03:10.989> of

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
building a layout in a basement one of

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.630 
building a layout in a basement one of
the<00:03:11.140> first<00:03:11.320> things<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.650> want<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.950> do<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.400> draw

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
the first things you want to do is draw

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.949 
the first things you want to do is draw
your<00:03:12.940> room<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.630> any<00:03:14.670> immovable<00:03:15.670> items<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
your room and any immovable items that

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.380 
your room and any immovable items that
you're<00:03:17.079> gonna<00:03:17.170> have<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.440> work<00:03:17.650> around<00:03:17.859> and<00:03:18.549> of

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
you're gonna have to work around and of

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.050 
you're gonna have to work around and of
course<00:03:19.690> like<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.799> first<00:03:20.980> two<00:03:21.489> videos<00:03:21.670> if

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
course like in the first two videos if

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.270 
course like in the first two videos if
you<00:03:22.150> have<00:03:22.329> if<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.440> don't<00:03:23.620> have<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.799> dedicated

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
you have if you don't have a dedicated

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.310 
you have if you don't have a dedicated
space<00:03:24.549> for<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.510> have<00:03:25.690> furniture

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
space for this and you have furniture

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.319 
space for this and you have furniture
you<00:03:26.470> need<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.769> plan<00:03:26.980> for<00:03:27.010> well<00:03:27.700> then<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.090> can

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
you need to plan for well then you can

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.720 
you need to plan for well then you can
draw<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.530> label<00:03:29.680> your<00:03:30.010> pieces<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.459> furniture

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
draw and label your pieces of furniture

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.599 
draw and label your pieces of furniture
and<00:03:31.680> move<00:03:32.680> them<00:03:32.859> whoops

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
and move them whoops

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.220 
and move them whoops

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
move them around in the room and I'll

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.569 
move them around in the room and I'll
show<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.500> how<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.709> do<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.280> I'm<00:03:39.430> gonna

show you how it's done okay let me go

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.949 
show you how it's done okay let me go
over<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:51.120> blank<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.420> new<00:03:52.900> drawing<00:03:53.620> here<00:03:54.190> and

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
over to a blank a new drawing here and

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.229 
over to a blank a new drawing here and
when<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.049> fire<00:03:56.320> up<00:03:56.350> CAD<00:03:56.739> rail<00:03:57.069> you'll<00:03:58.060> just

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
when you fire up CAD rail you'll just

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.330 
when you fire up CAD rail you'll just
see<00:03:58.390> those<00:03:58.510> blank<00:03:58.840> screen<00:03:59.230> don't<00:04:00.100> be

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
see those blank screen don't be

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.160 
see those blank screen don't be
intimidated<00:04:00.609> you<00:04:01.000> saw<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.420> nice<00:04:01.600> little

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
intimidated you saw this nice little

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.800 
intimidated you saw this nice little
grid<00:04:02.530> am<00:04:02.890> i<00:04:03.489> drawing<00:04:03.790> that's<00:04:04.030> fairly<00:04:04.450> easy<00:04:04.660> to

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
grid am i drawing that's fairly easy to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.640 
grid am i drawing that's fairly easy to
set<00:04:05.140> up<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:06.190> go<00:04:06.370> up<00:04:06.459> here<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.630> this<00:04:07.780> item<00:04:08.500> right

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
set up you go up here to this item right

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.180 
set up you go up here to this item right
there<00:04:08.949> and<00:04:09.220> that's<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.760> grid<00:04:10.269> on/off<00:04:11.109> switch

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
there and that's the grid on/off switch

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.580 
there and that's the grid on/off switch
you<00:04:12.430> turn<00:04:12.639> the<00:04:12.760> grid<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:12.970> there<00:04:13.510> we<00:04:13.600> go

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
you turn the grid on there we go

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.220 
you turn the grid on there we go
now<00:04:14.739> as<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.550> default<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:17.139> grid<00:04:17.829> size<00:04:18.130> is

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
now as a default the grid size is

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.360 
now as a default the grid size is
defaulted<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:21.360> feet<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.500> can<00:04:24.070> define

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
defaulted to feet so you can define

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.700 
defaulted to feet so you can define
increments<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.270> feet<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.690> can<00:04:25.840> define<00:04:26.169> inches

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
increments of feet you can define inches

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.670 
increments of feet you can define inches
depending<00:04:26.979> on<00:04:27.479> how<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.870> want<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.169> lay<00:04:29.350> things

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
depending on how you want to lay things

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.129

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
grid size up oh let me change this just

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.390 
grid size up oh let me change this just
to<00:04:51.070> show<00:04:51.100> ya<00:04:51.460> let's<00:04:51.970> just<00:04:52.150> do<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> six<00:04:52.720> inch<00:04:52.930> grid

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
to show ya let's just do a six inch grid

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.330 
to show ya let's just do a six inch grid
okay<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.960> decimal<00:04:55.960> feet<00:04:56.200> we<00:04:56.410> point<00:04:56.680> five<00:04:56.950> to

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
okay and decimal feet we point five to

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.950 
okay and decimal feet we point five to
okay

is<00:06:56.300> probably<00:06:56.660> gonna<00:06:56.900> be<00:06:57.110> a<00:06:57.139> lot<00:06:57.380> like<00:06:58.660> probably

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
is probably gonna be a lot like probably

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.080 
is probably gonna be a lot like probably
a<00:06:59.780> lot<00:06:59.900> like<00:07:00.080> Microsoft<00:07:00.680> Word<00:07:00.800> you<00:07:01.400> know<00:07:01.550> they

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
a lot like Microsoft Word you know they

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.230 
a lot like Microsoft Word you know they
say<00:07:02.270> there's<00:07:02.440> tons<00:07:03.440> and<00:07:03.770> tons<00:07:04.130> and<00:07:04.700> billions

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.180 
say there's tons and tons and billions
and<00:07:05.479> billions<00:07:05.780> of<00:07:06.229> features<00:07:06.650> to<00:07:06.680> the<00:07:06.950> thing

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
and billions of features to the thing

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.070 
and billions of features to the thing
but<00:07:07.430> the<00:07:07.700> average<00:07:08.060> human<00:07:08.240> being<00:07:08.660> the<00:07:08.930> average

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
but the average human being the average

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.620 
but the average human being the average
mortal<00:07:09.620> only<00:07:09.889> uses<00:07:10.310> maybe<00:07:10.490> about<00:07:10.669> 10%<00:07:11.450> of<00:07:11.510> them

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
mortal only uses maybe about 10% of them

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.450 
mortal only uses maybe about 10% of them
well<00:07:11.810> I'm<00:07:11.900> kind<00:07:12.200> of<00:07:12.260> that<00:07:12.590> way<00:07:12.770> with<00:07:12.950> CAD<00:07:13.160> rail

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
well I'm kind of that way with CAD rail

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.440 
well I'm kind of that way with CAD rail
too<00:07:13.700> I<00:07:13.729> kind<00:07:14.150> of<00:07:14.210> learned<00:07:14.450> it<00:07:14.650> just<00:07:15.650> enough<00:07:16.450> to

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
too I kind of learned it just enough to

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.080 
too I kind of learned it just enough to
get<00:07:17.630> done<00:07:17.900> what<00:07:18.139> I<00:07:18.169> need<00:07:18.410> done<00:07:18.680> and<00:07:19.090> unless

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
get done what I need done and unless

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.540 
get done what I need done and unless
you're<00:07:20.270> really<00:07:20.450> into<00:07:21.010> serious<00:07:22.010> CAD<00:07:22.280> you'll

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
you're really into serious CAD you'll

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.219 
you're really into serious CAD you'll
probably<00:07:22.760> do<00:07:23.060> that<00:07:23.270> too<00:07:23.510> so<00:07:23.810> there's<00:07:24.050> things

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229 
probably do that too so there's things

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.129 
probably do that too so there's things
that<00:07:24.380> I<00:07:24.500> may<00:07:24.650> show<00:07:24.680> you<00:07:24.950> that<00:07:25.960> there<00:07:26.960> may<00:07:27.110> be

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.139 
that I may show you that there may be

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.110 
that I may show you that there may be
easier<00:07:27.590> ways<00:07:27.800> of<00:07:28.039> doing<00:07:28.220> it<00:07:28.520> but<00:07:28.760> that's<00:07:28.850> just

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
easier ways of doing it but that's just

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.900 
easier ways of doing it but that's just
kind<00:07:29.330> of<00:07:29.419> the<00:07:29.539> way<00:07:29.570> I<00:07:29.720> learned<00:07:30.110> it<00:07:30.320> so<00:07:30.760> and<00:07:31.760> I've

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.910 
kind of the way I learned it so and I've

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.250 
kind of the way I learned it so and I've
probably<00:07:32.090> forgotten<00:07:32.270> some<00:07:32.810> stuff<00:07:33.050> too

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
probably forgotten some stuff too

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.719 
probably forgotten some stuff too
because<00:07:33.530> I<00:07:33.650> haven't<00:07:33.830> really<00:07:34.190> messed<00:07:34.400> with<00:07:34.520> my

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:34.729 
because I haven't really messed with my

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:38.110 
because I haven't really messed with my
drawing<00:07:35.060> in<00:07:35.240> a<00:07:35.300> while<00:07:35.620> but<00:07:36.760> walk<00:07:37.760> you<00:07:37.910> through

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 
drawing in a while but walk you through

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.300 
drawing in a while but walk you through
this<00:07:38.270> it's<00:07:38.539> not<00:07:38.690> that<00:07:38.900> bad<00:07:39.110> to<00:07:39.140> do<00:07:39.470> basic

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:40.310 
this it's not that bad to do basic

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.870 
this it's not that bad to do basic
drawing<00:07:40.789> in<00:07:41.030> get<00:07:41.240> yourself<00:07:41.390> set<00:07:41.840> up
