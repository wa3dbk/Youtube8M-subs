00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.970 
that Ford and then I'll get this mission
and<00:02:32.150> then<00:02:32.690> after<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:32.990> do<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.230> mission<00:02:33.710> I'll

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
and then after I do that mission I'll

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.500 
and then after I do that mission I'll
get<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.250> other<00:02:34.400> one<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:40.730> can<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.150> have

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
get the other one as you can see I have

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.080 
get the other one as you can see I have
cut<00:02:41.810> some<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.350> sequences<00:02:42.650> out<00:02:43.040> because<00:02:43.730> I

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
cut some of the sequences out because I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.670 
cut some of the sequences out because I
don't<00:02:44.150> think<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.870> want<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.140> watch<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.650> whole

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
don't think you want to watch the whole

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.160 
don't think you want to watch the whole
entire<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.550> two<00:02:46.640> minute<00:02:46.970> video<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.450> me<00:02:47.810> running

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
entire a two minute video of me running

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.610 
entire a two minute video of me running
around<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:50.180> get<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.600> these<00:02:50.750> places

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
around to get to these places

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.370 
around to get to these places
so<00:02:52.430> that's<00:02:53.300> why<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.570> seems<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:54.110> I'm<00:02:54.230> getting

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
so that's why it seems like I'm getting

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:17.000 
so that's why it seems like I'm getting
these<00:02:54.650> very<00:02:55.220> quickly

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.190 

here's<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.310> fifth<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.000> final<00:03:19.240> one<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.900> tried

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
here's the fifth and final one I tried

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.010 
here's the fifth and final one I tried
to<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.530> stealthy<00:03:21.040> with<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:23.730> without<00:03:25.020> getting

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
to be stealthy with this without getting

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.660 
to be stealthy with this without getting
into<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.290> fight<00:03:26.380> but<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.220> didn't<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.550> work

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
into a fight but it didn't really work

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.140 
into a fight but it didn't really work
it<00:03:28.630> doesn't<00:03:29.050> really<00:03:29.200> matter<00:03:29.530> anyway<00:03:29.950> because

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
it doesn't really matter anyway because

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.309 
it doesn't really matter anyway because
even<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.300> you<00:03:31.420> get<00:03:31.569> into<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> fight<00:03:32.140> you'll

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
even if you get into a fight you'll

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.949 
even if you get into a fight you'll
still<00:03:32.620> get<00:03:32.800> credit<00:03:33.010> for<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.959> assassination

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
still get credit for the assassination

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.290 
still get credit for the assassination
contract<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.190> doesn't<00:03:36.459> really<00:03:36.550> matter<00:03:39.300> I'm

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
contract so it doesn't really matter I'm

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.780 
contract so it doesn't really matter I'm
