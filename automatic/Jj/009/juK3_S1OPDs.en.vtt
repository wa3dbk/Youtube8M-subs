00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello how are you how you went with your 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.609
 first beer brewed from 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.219
 malt extract very well look at them 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.070
 I present where we did in the video 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.139
 here and you see that he is already grabbing very 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.240
 good color already has the sediment of 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.250
 yeast in the background is completely 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.529
 normal I have received many emails 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.180
 asking me this question this beer 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.430
 remember boys who do not drink 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.859
 directly from the bottle because by the 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.910
 sediment nothing happens to them but it's not 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.859
 nice 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.559
 well, our beer with 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.930
 beer is almost ready to drink 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.450
 I know what we did good 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.930
 reviewing we dissolved the extract of 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.940
 malt and hops is once it started to 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.700
 boil according to the taste of everyone 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.890
 the bitterness was getting 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.540
 and then it started to ferment 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.090
 inoculate the yeast was left 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.510
 fermenting seven days after the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.630
 seven days that beer was passed to a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.270
 new container the sterile as it is 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.250
 sterile good bought the water the bottle 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.040
 of new water the vacuum and that 's where 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.800
 put the beer he had just made 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.080
 then in the first bottle you will be 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.300
 it forms a sediment well big team 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.800
 So what we did then was remove 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.130
 as much as possible I added 55 grams 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.740
 forgiveness of sugar dissolved in water 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.310
 boiled or boiling in 100 milliliters 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.080
 and more or less what I got here I 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.720
 I'm leaving a space for 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.900
 breathe with the days at temperature 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.090
 environment we are going to go touching it since 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.270
 be so hard you can notice that it is very 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.460
 lasts and we put this one in the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.620
 refrigerator and nothing else we let 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.690
 complete in at least 15 days 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.400
 of maturation the suggestion is that they go 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.140
 uncovering a bottle every week for 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.600
 that you prove it and you can notice 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.060
 sensoryly how it changes over time 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.400
 and where they like it most is where 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.030
 you found your point 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.890
 maturing your own beer and then 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.530
 now nothing else is left of a videoblog 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.800
 more to do the uncovering of our 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.560
 beer and tell them how we stayed 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 I hope you send me your comments 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.120
 suggestions your emails with all 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.850
 doubts in fact I have been receiving all 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.070
 this week many questions and we are going to 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.840
 go solving them together next 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.730
 so that it opens up a little 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.530
 more the panorama and little by little go 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.990
 complicating the process so that every time 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.910
 let's have better beers 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.640
 our first question makes us 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.520
 mariana da fini from argentina she us 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.030
 question how can you tell if a 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.160
 beer is contaminated good taste 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.050
 It is very evident when you have a 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.660
 pollution if we are doing 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.700
 obviously beer our product 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.730
 final our result must be a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.470
 taste of beer if you know or detect your 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.320
 flavor that has nothing to do with the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.010
 beer like for example heartburn the egg 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.200
 rotten butter candy or any 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.670
 another flavor that you have never detected 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.100
 to a beer like the ones that normally 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.330
 you drink then if it's a sign of 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.760
 pollution 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.860
 in any way in another capsule we go 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.110
 to talk about the 24 deviations from the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.340
 flavor that is 24 defects that we can 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.340
 find in a beer 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.550
 our friend Sebastian from Spain 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.430
 Galicia asks us what quantities and 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.640
 proportions should be measured each 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.100
 good ingredient sebastiÃ¡n cabe 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.480
 mention that there are two types of 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.900
 ale ale oe and lager now of each 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.420
 type are derived styles that what you 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.510
 you know like clear white dark amber 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.350
 brown etcetera etcetera then 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.890
 depending on the recipe is the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.300
 formulation a good general rule not 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.460
 there is so that forever 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.950
 it will necessarily be this if you are looking 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.200
 on the internet recipes for preparing 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.960
 beer you're going to see that it 's a world you're going to 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.600
 see that it is a huge fan and that 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.580
 you are simply going to miss the most the only thing 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.890
 that I recommend you good follow 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.260
 moment the basic recipes that can 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.290
 find in Youtube not only the shits 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.270
 of any brewer they also serve 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.310
 and who is going to be your first focus 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.170
 when they get beer that does not 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 let's have the deviations of flavor that 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.950
 do not get contaminated and once you get 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.920
 come out well that already dominates is the process 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.260
 Now if you look for styles and according to your 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.780
 taste to your palate you're going to start 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.570
 make the formulations of any 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.440
 so you can buy a book there is also 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.540
 books in pdf format on the entire network
