00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
word document you're working on it will

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.949 
word document you're working on it will
jump<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.800> one<00:02:52.150> which<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.360> kind<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.780> cool

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
jump to that one which is kind of cool

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.250 
jump to that one which is kind of cool
but<00:02:54.320> not<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:54.830> feature<00:02:55.160> i<00:02:55.400> use<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.970> much

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
but not really feature i use that much

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.350 
but not really feature i use that much
so<00:02:57.260> let's<00:02:57.800> go<00:02:58.010> back<00:02:58.220> into<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.640> settings<00:02:59.030> and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
so let's go back into the settings and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.060 
so let's go back into the settings and
you<00:02:59.720> would<00:02:59.840> also<00:02:59.989> do<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.510> along<00:03:03.470> with<00:03:03.500> the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
you would also do this so along with the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.060 
you would also do this so along with the
heart<00:03:04.280> zones<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.209> i<00:03:05.330> mentioned<00:03:05.720> earlier

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
heart zones that i mentioned earlier

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
heart zones that i mentioned earlier
there's<00:03:07.070> also<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:08.150> miniature<00:03:09.019> all<00:03:09.790> key<00:03:10.790> so

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
there's also a miniature all key so

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.060 
there's also a miniature all key so
that's<00:03:11.269> bait<00:03:11.900> that's<00:03:12.200> basically<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.800> same

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
that's bait that's basically the same

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.120 
that's bait that's basically the same
thing<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:14.540> just<00:03:14.780> gives<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.500> grid<00:03:15.890> view

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
thing it just gives you that grid view

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.320 
thing it just gives you that grid view
and<00:03:16.810> as<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.989> view<00:03:18.320> but<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.830> want<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.330> choose

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
and as you view but you want to choose

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.740 
and as you view but you want to choose
for<00:03:20.630> an<00:03:20.720> application<00:03:21.320> or<00:03:21.410> window<00:03:21.830> that's<00:03:22.040> open

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
for an application or window that's open

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.390 
for an application or window that's open
right<00:03:23.750> here<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:24.110> miniature<00:03:24.739> related<00:03:25.190> so

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
right here is miniature related so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.430 
right here is miniature related so
that's<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:26.239> same<00:03:26.480> thing<00:03:26.510> only<00:03:27.019> in<00:03:27.260> this

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
that's the same thing only in this

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.160 
that's the same thing only in this
instance<00:03:27.950> if<00:03:28.160> i<00:03:28.310> was<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.489> activated<00:03:29.299> seeing<00:03:30.049> is

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
instance if i was to activated seeing is

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.070 
instance if i was to activated seeing is
ahead<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.470> two

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
ahead of two

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.530 
ahead of two
google<00:03:31.410> chrome<00:03:31.680> window<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.280> open<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:33.300> would

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
google chrome window is open it would

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.140 
google chrome window is open it would
view<00:03:34.020> only<00:03:34.230> those<00:03:34.590> two<00:03:34.620> because<00:03:35.340> those<00:03:35.970> are

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
view only those two because those are

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.990 
view only those two because those are
the<00:03:36.240> duplicates<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.900> are<00:03:37.140> opening<00:03:37.890> now<00:03:38.580> show

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
the duplicates that are opening now show

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.550 
the duplicates that are opening now show
hi<00:03:39.510> desktop<00:03:40.080> that's<00:03:40.350> pretty

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
hi desktop that's pretty

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.890 
hi desktop that's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.700> if<00:03:41.850> i<00:03:41.970> set<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.690> to

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
self-explanatory so if i set this to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.100 
self-explanatory so if i set this to
this<00:03:43.320> corner<00:03:43.590> for<00:03:43.890> example<00:03:44.480> if<00:03:45.480> i<00:03:45.660> went<00:03:45.840> over

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
this corner for example if i went over

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.340 
this corner for example if i went over
here<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:47.730> would<00:03:48.000> basically<00:03:48.300> do<00:03:48.780> windows

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
here it would basically do windows

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.680 
here it would basically do windows
already<00:03:49.620> does<00:03:49.950> which<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.060> hide

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
already does which is just hide

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.880 
already does which is just hide
everything<00:03:52.070> which<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.450> kind<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.890> redundant

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
everything which is kind of redundant

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.480 
everything which is kind of redundant
but<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:57.630> set<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.260> either<00:03:58.800> side<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.340> doesn't

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
but can set it to either side it doesn't

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.920 
but can set it to either side it doesn't
have<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.820> be<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:00.240> where<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.570> windows

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
have to be the one where the windows

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.990 
have to be the one where the windows
usually<00:04:01.860> has<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:03.710> also<00:04:04.710> you<00:04:05.040> can<00:04:05.220> set<00:04:05.880> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
usually has it also you can set the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.660 
usually has it also you can set the
background<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:07.070> you'll<00:04:08.070> notice<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.580> the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
background so you'll notice in the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.520 
background so you'll notice in the
background<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.150> actually<00:04:09.330> graded<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:10.050> black

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
background is actually graded a black

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.860 
background is actually graded a black
and<00:04:10.800> blue<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.850> can<00:04:12.000> actually<00:04:12.300> choose<00:04:12.540> your

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
and blue you can actually choose your

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.840

exclude windows so if you don't want a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.200 
exclude windows so if you don't want a
window<00:04:21.780> showing<00:04:22.049> up<00:04:22.350> in<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.590> grid<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:24.060> do

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
window showing up in the grid you can do

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.860 
window showing up in the grid you can do
that<00:04:24.710> obviously<00:04:25.710> zooming<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.910> i<00:04:27.390> really

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
that obviously zooming that i really

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.950 
that obviously zooming that i really
like<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.290> which<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:29.550> shows<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.600> close

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
like that which is it shows you a close

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.010 
like that which is it shows you a close
up<00:04:30.990> view<00:04:31.640> which<00:04:32.640> is<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> lot<00:04:33.090> easier<00:04:33.120> than<00:04:33.570> just

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
up view which is a lot easier than just

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.430 
up view which is a lot easier than just
taking<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:34.980> what<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:36.450> live<00:04:36.960> update

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
taking it for what it is a live update

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.470 
taking it for what it is a live update
this<00:04:37.680> is<00:04:37.919> basically<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.090> if<00:04:39.360> you're

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
this is basically like if you're

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.530 
this is basically like if you're
streaming<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.290> video<00:04:40.440> or<00:04:40.830> something<00:04:40.950> online

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
streaming a video or something online

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.870 
streaming a video or something online
i'ma<00:04:42.540> tries<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:43.050> keep<00:04:43.560> track<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:43.890> where<00:04:44.700> you

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
i'ma tries to keep track of where you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.780 
i'ma tries to keep track of where you
are<00:04:44.970> on<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.150> video<00:04:45.510> so<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.890> preview<00:04:47.610> of

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
are on the video so like the preview of

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.230 
are on the video so like the preview of
the<00:04:47.970> window<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.600> have<00:04:49.370> in<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.580> grid<00:04:50.910> it

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
the window that you have in the grid it

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.180 
the window that you have in the grid it
will<00:04:51.419> try<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.690> keep<00:04:51.930> up<00:04:52.110> with<00:04:52.169> that<00:04:52.530> as<00:04:52.770> it's

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
will try to keep up with that as it's

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.020 
will try to keep up with that as it's
playing<00:04:53.630> which<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.780> kind<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.080> cool<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:55.620> can

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
playing which is kind of cool you can

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.180 
playing which is kind of cool you can
not<00:04:57.030> really<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.600> much<00:04:57.660> of<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:58.050> use<00:04:58.260> but<00:04:58.620> it

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
not really that much of a use but it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.210 
not really that much of a use but it
says<00:04:59.490> enable<00:04:59.700> for<00:05:00.320> enable<00:05:01.320> on<00:05:01.470> fast<00:05:01.770> machines

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
says enable for enable on fast machines

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.130 
says enable for enable on fast machines
only<00:05:02.490> so<00:05:02.970> if<00:05:03.570> you're<00:05:03.690> having<00:05:03.810> any<00:05:03.990> trouble

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
only so if you're having any trouble

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.730 
only so if you're having any trouble
with<00:05:04.470> this<00:05:04.710> I'd<00:05:04.919> suggest<00:05:05.340> unchecking<00:05:05.760> this

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
with this I'd suggest unchecking this

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.460 
with this I'd suggest unchecking this
and<00:05:07.940> then<00:05:08.940> prefetch<00:05:09.510> window<00:05:09.990> content

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
and then prefetch window content

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.780 
and then prefetch window content
increases<00:05:11.010> speed<00:05:11.640> but<00:05:12.360> results<00:05:12.870> and

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
increases speed but results and

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.520 
increases speed but results and
artifacts<00:05:14.790> so<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.479> basically<00:05:15.690> just<00:05:16.290> goes

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
artifacts so this basically just goes

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.450 
artifacts so this basically just goes
over<00:05:16.950> and<00:05:18.350> takes<00:05:19.350> everything<00:05:19.740> from<00:05:19.979> your

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
over and takes everything from your

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.240 
over and takes everything from your
window<00:05:20.610> so<00:05:21.120> as<00:05:21.390> i<00:05:21.419> said<00:05:21.600> before<00:05:21.870> i'm<00:05:22.410> you<00:05:23.130> can

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
window so as i said before i'm you can

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.120 
window so as i said before i'm you can
go<00:05:23.400> over<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.760> start<00:05:24.060> typing<00:05:24.720> in<00:05:25.050> whatever<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
go over and start typing in whatever the

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.010 
go over and start typing in whatever the
window<00:05:26.430> is<00:05:26.490> about<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:27.210> if<00:05:27.390> i<00:05:27.510> typed<00:05:27.720> in<00:05:27.870> twitter

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
window is about so if i typed in twitter

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.320 
window is about so if i typed in twitter
like<00:05:31.020> youtube<00:05:31.590> /<00:05:32.130> word<00:05:32.669> document<00:05:33.270> or

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
like youtube / word document or

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.360 
like youtube / word document or
something<00:05:33.720> it<00:05:33.900> would<00:05:34.020> start<00:05:34.290> showing<00:05:35.250> up

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
something it would start showing up

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.529 
something it would start showing up
right<00:05:35.760> away<00:05:36.140> so<00:05:37.140> this<00:05:37.530> is<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:38.180> pretty<00:05:39.180> cool
