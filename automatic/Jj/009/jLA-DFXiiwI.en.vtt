00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.430 
strand on do it now before you get where
you<00:02:22.819> scrutinize<00:02:23.420> your<00:02:23.600> tree<00:02:23.810> every<00:02:24.080> night<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
you scrutinize your tree every night and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.140 
you scrutinize your tree every night and
you're<00:02:24.530> upset<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.489> don't<00:02:25.730> have<00:02:25.880> enough

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
light anyway here's the second step and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.900 
light anyway here's the second step and
I<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.569> try<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:29.989> twine<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.950> had<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.400> way<00:02:31.880> up

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
I do try to twine it I had to get way up

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.080 
I do try to twine it I had to get way up
to<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> top<00:02:32.750> there<00:02:33.110> but<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.739> do<00:02:33.860> try<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.819> as

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
to the top there but I do try to get as

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.640 
to the top there but I do try to get as
close<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.840> base<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.350> tree<00:02:36.560> as

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
close to the base of the tree as

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.100 
close to the base of the tree as
possible<00:02:37.190> because<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.549> like<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.110> illuminate

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
possible because I like to illuminate

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.050 
possible because I like to illuminate
the<00:02:39.260> ornaments<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:39.920> go<00:02:40.190> deep<00:02:40.459> that's<00:02:40.760> where

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
the ornaments that go deep that's where

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.240 
the ornaments that go deep that's where
I<00:02:41.090> put<00:02:41.390> my<00:02:41.420> larger<00:02:42.140> ornaments<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.950> give<00:02:43.100> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
I put my larger ornaments to give the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.009 
I put my larger ornaments to give the
tree<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> lot<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.910> depth<00:02:44.120> yeah<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> dark

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
tree a lot of depth yeah I have a dark

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.340 
tree a lot of depth yeah I have a dark
spot<00:02:45.260> I'm<00:02:45.440> gonna<00:02:45.620> fix<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.010> okay<00:02:46.310> thank<00:02:46.970> you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
okay so I've added and I use this stuff

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.900 
okay so I've added and I use this stuff
on<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> lot<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.320> things<00:02:51.500> I've<00:02:51.709> shown<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:52.010> in<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
on a lot of things I've shown you in the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.069 
on a lot of things I've shown you in the
past<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.390> added<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.489> gold<00:02:55.489> tooling<00:02:56.480> ribbon

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
past I added this gold tooling ribbon

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.729 
past I added this gold tooling ribbon
mesh<00:02:57.709> all<00:02:58.609> sorts<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.150> names<00:02:59.329> for<00:02:59.660> it<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.049> I

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
mesh all sorts of names for it and I

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.470 
mesh all sorts of names for it and I
intertwined<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.609> through<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> tree<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.180> it's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
intertwined it through the tree and it's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.599 
intertwined it through the tree and it's
very<00:03:02.720> haphazard<00:03:03.470> right<00:03:03.680> now<00:03:03.829> but<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.579> thing

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
very haphazard right now but the thing

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.509 
very haphazard right now but the thing
is<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:06.230> hear<00:03:06.410> me<00:03:06.530> say<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.980> lot<00:03:07.220> it's

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
is and you hear me say this a lot it's

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.599 
is and you hear me say this a lot it's
all<00:03:07.760> about<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.269> layering<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:09.410> it's<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:10.250> one

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
all about the layering so it's just one

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.640 
all about the layering so it's just one
more<00:03:10.790> component<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.720> give<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.079> tree<00:03:12.380> some

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
more component to give this tree some

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.949 
more component to give this tree some
depth<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.190> next<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.359> to<00:03:14.450> start<00:03:14.750> adding

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
depth and next I'm going to start adding

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.099 
depth and next I'm going to start adding
that<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.829> oversized<00:03:16.459> large<00:03:17.000> ornaments<00:03:17.930> and

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
that that oversized large ornaments and

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.370 
that that oversized large ornaments and
then<00:03:18.890> it'll<00:03:19.430> start<00:03:19.790> slowly<00:03:20.180> hiding<00:03:20.870> all<00:03:21.079> these

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
then it'll start slowly hiding all these

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.190 
then it'll start slowly hiding all these
wires<00:03:21.799> that<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.310> can<00:03:22.670> see<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.180> then<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.079> know

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
wires that you can see and then you know

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.009 
wires that you can see and then you know
of<00:03:24.320> course<00:03:24.350> we'll<00:03:24.739> add<00:03:24.950> all<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:26.019> gilded

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
wires and stuff I started at the top

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.160 
wires and stuff I started at the top
really<00:03:56.739> trying<00:03:57.219> to<00:03:57.459> focus<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:58.269> getting<00:03:58.900> the

really trying to focus on getting the
majority<00:03:59.769> of<00:03:59.799> the<00:04:00.340> top<00:04:00.579> done<00:04:00.969> and<00:04:01.299> I'll<00:04:01.689> have

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
majority of the top done and I'll have

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
of the tree okay here's something else I

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.570 
of the tree okay here's something else I
wanted<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.599> show<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.320> you've<00:05:12.039> come<00:05:12.220> upon

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.570 
wanted to show you so you've come upon
this<00:05:12.789> branch<00:05:13.120> like<00:05:13.449> this<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:14.310> there's<00:05:15.310> not

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
this branch like this and there's not

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.570 
this branch like this and there's not
much<00:05:15.849> to<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.180> it's<00:05:16.479> looking<00:05:16.900> dark<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.560> all<00:05:18.370> you

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
much to it it's looking dark and all you

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.820 
much to it it's looking dark and all you
do<00:05:18.789> is<00:05:19.060> put<00:05:19.659> in<00:05:19.840> yes

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
do is put in yes

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.490 
do is put in yes
simple<00:05:23.560> gilded<00:05:24.560> fraud<00:05:25.129> and<00:05:25.460> look<00:05:25.759> at<00:05:25.879> that

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
simple gilded fraud and look at that

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.869 
simple gilded fraud and look at that
because<00:05:28.539> it's<00:05:29.539> haphazard<00:05:30.729> arrangements<00:05:31.729> of

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
because it's haphazard arrangements of

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.089 
because it's haphazard arrangements of
the<00:05:32.090> leaves<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.720> everything<00:05:32.960> else<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:33.830> gives

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
the leaves and everything else it gives

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.059 
the leaves and everything else it gives
depth<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:34.879> light<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:35.750> movement<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:37.039> that

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069 
depth and light and movement to that

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.749 
depth and light and movement to that
branch<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.789> now<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.509> flat<00:05:39.349> branch<00:05:39.740> has<00:05:40.159> become

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
branch and now a flat branch has become

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.540 
branch and now a flat branch has become
this<00:05:41.599> is<00:05:41.810> gilded<00:05:42.409> beautiful<00:05:42.979> branch<00:05:43.280> and

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
this is gilded beautiful branch and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.830 
this is gilded beautiful branch and
that's<00:05:43.639> all<00:05:43.909> I'm<00:05:44.060> doing<00:05:44.090> right<00:05:44.360> now<00:05:44.539> I'm

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
that's all I'm doing right now I'm

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.050 
that's all I'm doing right now I'm
adding<00:05:45.680> these<00:05:46.069> and<00:05:47.060> onto<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:48.020> different<00:05:49.060> the

adding these and onto the different the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.969 
adding these and onto the different the
different<00:05:50.479> branches<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:51.259> the<00:05:51.440> tree<00:05:51.710> and

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
different branches of the tree and

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.580 
different branches of the tree and
pretty<00:05:52.280> soon<00:05:52.639> the<00:05:53.539> whole<00:05:53.810> tree<00:05:54.259> will

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
pretty soon the whole tree will

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.920 
pretty soon the whole tree will
definitely<00:05:55.250> come<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.819> life<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.330> again<00:05:56.630> I<00:05:56.690> know

one<00:07:10.250> next<00:07:11.150> to<00:07:11.389> the<00:07:11.449> brown<00:07:11.780> one<00:07:12.169> I<00:07:14.139> did<00:07:15.139> several

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
one next to the brown one I did several

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.040 
one next to the brown one I did several
snowflakes<00:07:17.260> that<00:07:18.260> just<00:07:18.500> out<00:07:18.710> of<00:07:18.860> iridescent

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350 
yet being you know translucent makes a

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.340 
yet being you know translucent makes a
huge<00:07:24.620> difference<00:07:24.760> so<00:07:25.760> anyway<00:07:26.720> this<00:07:26.900> is<00:07:26.960> the

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:27.350 
huge difference so anyway this is the
