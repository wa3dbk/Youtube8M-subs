smaller ones I believe that has the
bookshelf's<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> little<00:02:31.410> library<00:02:31.860> but

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
bookshelf's in it the little library but

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.950 
bookshelf's in it the little library but
other<00:02:32.640> than<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.390> fairly

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
other than that it's just a fairly

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.470 
other than that it's just a fairly
fairly<00:02:34.350> simple<00:02:34.770> village<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> definitely

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
fairly simple village that I definitely

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.200 
fairly simple village that I definitely
do<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:36.900> Anna<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.520> know<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.150> just

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
do like Anna and you know it's it's just

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.450 
do like Anna and you know it's it's just
a<00:02:39.390> fairly<00:02:39.720> simple<00:02:39.960> one<00:02:40.050> no<00:02:40.170> blacksmith<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.250> um

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
a fairly simple one no blacksmith but um

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.840 
a fairly simple one no blacksmith but um
it<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.480> still<00:02:42.990> nothing<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.800> shrug<00:02:44.010> off<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.580> a

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
it is still nothing to shrug off it is a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
it is still nothing to shrug off it is a
village<00:02:45.330> after<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:45.840> all<00:02:46.110> right<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.980> next

that<00:02:58.500> one<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.520> best<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.910> my<00:03:00.030> opinion<00:03:00.060> this

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
that one is the best in my opinion this

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.660 
that one is the best in my opinion this
one<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.930> really<00:03:01.290> really<00:03:01.770> weird<00:03:02.190> one<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.580> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
one is a really really weird one but it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.580 
one is a really really weird one but it
is<00:03:02.820> still<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> village<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:03.960> have<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
is still a village we have the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.650 
is still a village we have the
Squidward's<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.220> all<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> little

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
Squidward's in all we do have a little

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.750 
Squidward's in all we do have a little
bit<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.840> crops<00:03:07.050> right<00:03:07.740> here<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.160> have<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.730> I

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
bit of crops right here we have the I

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.430 
bit of crops right here we have the I
think<00:03:09.000> that's<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.540> building<00:03:09.900> one<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.290> these

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440

is the building with or maybe they both

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.030 
is the building with or maybe they both
are<00:03:12.900> maybe<00:03:13.050> they're<00:03:13.260> both<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.620> ones<00:03:13.800> with

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
are maybe they're both the ones with

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.430 
are maybe they're both the ones with
them<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:15.540> bookshelf<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.050> yeah<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.230> looks<00:03:16.380> like
