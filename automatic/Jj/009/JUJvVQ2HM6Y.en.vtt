would<00:01:49.829> recognize<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.700> human<00:01:50.820> face<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
would recognize as a human face and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.480 
would recognize as a human face and
respond<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.710> smile<00:01:53.009> back<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
respond to it would smile back at the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
respond to it would smile back at the
face<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> ultimate<00:01:54.390> cartoon<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
face so it's the ultimate cartoon is the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
face so it's the ultimate cartoon is the
ultimate<00:01:55.979> linear<00:01:56.700> simplification<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
ultimate linear simplification of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.010 
ultimate linear simplification of

that's what we were doing we were saying

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.999 
that's what we were doing we were saying
well<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.450> looked<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:10.020> comic<00:02:10.800> book

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
well what if we looked at comic book

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.750 
well what if we looked at comic book
characters

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
characters

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.390 
characters
but<00:02:12.180> said<00:02:12.450> well<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:13.680> would<00:02:13.799> really<00:02:14.069> happen

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
but said well what would really happen

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.940 
but said well what would really happen
and<00:02:14.989> really<00:02:15.989> that's<00:02:16.110> how<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.379> symbol<00:02:16.769> came

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and really that's how the symbol came

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.100 
and really that's how the symbol came
about<00:02:17.159> again<00:02:17.370> completely<00:02:18.030> fortuitously<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
about again completely fortuitously and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.649 
about again completely fortuitously and
in<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.099> way<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.519> obviously<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.909> didn't<00:02:21.329> foresee

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
in a way that obviously I didn't foresee

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.300 
in a way that obviously I didn't foresee
when<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.200> drew<00:02:22.379> this<00:02:22.500> little<00:02:22.650> yellow<00:02:22.980> disc

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
when I just drew this little yellow disc

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.699 
when I just drew this little yellow disc
only<00:02:23.579> on<00:02:23.939> the<00:02:24.180> leather<00:02:24.439> originally<00:02:25.439> it<00:02:25.530> was

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
only on the leather originally it was

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.580 
only on the leather originally it was
just<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.340> simple<00:02:26.909> image<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.360> happened<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:28.079> be

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
just a simple image that happened to be

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.369 
just a simple image that happened to be
in<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.950> first<00:02:29.280> issue<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:29.959> which<00:02:30.959> we<00:02:31.140> found

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
in the first issue that which we found

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.289 
in the first issue that which we found
strangely<00:02:32.040> compelling<00:02:32.489> there<00:02:32.819> was<00:02:32.909> something

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
strangely compelling there was something

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.630 
strangely compelling there was something
about<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.629> innocent<00:02:34.470> yellow<00:02:34.920> smiley<00:02:35.430> face

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
about that innocent yellow smiley face

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.270 
about that innocent yellow smiley face
with<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.120> splash<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.540> blood<00:02:36.690> across<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.170> eye

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
with that splash of blood across the eye

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.649 
with that splash of blood across the eye
and<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.700> think<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:39.239> was<00:02:39.329> some<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.569> other

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
and I think that was some of the other

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.949 
and I think that was some of the other
people<00:02:39.870> found<00:02:40.200> as<00:02:40.379> well<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.799> ended<00:02:41.220> up<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.549> an

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
people found as well it ended up as a an

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
people found as well it ended up as a an
emblem<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.470> acid<00:02:44.159> house<00:02:44.310> music<00:02:44.790> scene

emblem of the acid house music scene

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.479 
emblem of the acid house music scene
over<00:02:45.989> here<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.349> for<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.829> while<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.129> couldn't<00:02:47.370> go

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
over here and for a while I couldn't go

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.309 
over here and for a while I couldn't go
out<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.760> house<00:02:47.909> without<00:02:48.150> saying<00:02:48.569> all<00:02:49.140> these

faces everywhere I got quite sick of it

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.809 
faces everywhere I got quite sick of it
but<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> way<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.739> manipulating<00:02:56.159> symbols

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
but it was a way of manipulating symbols

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.069 
but it was a way of manipulating symbols

working with that device was that

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.820 
working with that device was that

that<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.580> became<00:04:41.909> eventually<00:04:42.150> like<00:04:42.539> the

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
that it became eventually like the

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.010 
that it became eventually like the

proscenium arch at a theater that you or

proscenium arch at a theater that you or
a<00:04:46.080> television<00:04:46.949> you're<00:04:47.069> looking<00:04:47.310> at<00:04:47.430> a

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
a television you're looking at a

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.809 
a television you're looking at a
television<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:49.680> shape<00:04:49.919> of<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.249> screen<00:04:50.580> does

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
television the shape of the screen does

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.489 
television the shape of the screen does
not<00:04:50.849> change<00:04:51.240> just<00:04:51.659> like<00:04:51.779> the<00:04:52.020> shape<00:04:52.229> of<00:04:52.379> the

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
proscenium arch doesn't change and so

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.399 
proscenium arch doesn't change and so
you<00:04:54.479> forget<00:04:54.900> about<00:04:55.050> it

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
you forget about it

which you can't do in a movie these

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.519 
which you can't do in a movie these
resonances<00:05:53.430> become<00:05:53.789> very<00:05:54.539> very<00:05:55.259> striking

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
resonances become very very striking

also<00:05:56.399> in<00:05:56.550> terms<00:05:56.819> of<00:05:57.180> control<00:05:57.689> it<00:05:58.680> meant<00:05:58.979> that<00:05:59.039> I

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
also in terms of control it meant that I

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.139 
also in terms of control it meant that I
was<00:05:59.520> able<00:05:59.699> to<00:06:00.740> lay<00:06:01.740> out<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.099> pages<00:06:02.339> visually

was able to lay out the pages visually

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:06.019 
was able to lay out the pages visually
and<00:06:03.330> know<00:06:03.870> exactly<00:06:04.139> how<00:06:05.069> much<00:06:05.250> space<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.819> had

and know exactly how much space I had

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.379 
and know exactly how much space I had
for<00:06:06.240> each<00:06:06.360> image<00:06:06.719> you<00:06:07.529> know<00:06:07.710> where<00:06:08.639> the<00:06:09.000> the

for each image you know where the the

for each image you know where the the
full<00:06:09.569> page<00:06:09.870> with<00:06:10.589> images<00:06:10.830> would<00:06:11.339> fit<00:06:11.610> best<00:06:12.649> you

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:13.649 
full page with images would fit best you

full page with images would fit best you
know<00:06:13.800> where<00:06:14.219> you<00:06:14.370> should<00:06:14.399> use<00:06:14.909> a<00:06:14.939> run<00:06:15.210> of<00:06:15.330> small

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
know where you should use a run of small

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.119 
know where you should use a run of small
panels<00:06:16.050> where<00:06:16.169> you<00:06:16.289> should<00:06:16.439> use<00:06:16.589> bigger<00:06:16.860> ones

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
panels where you should use bigger ones

panels where you should use bigger ones
I<00:06:17.430> was<00:06:18.389> able<00:06:18.569> more<00:06:19.349> so<00:06:19.560> than<00:06:19.710> ever<00:06:19.919> before<00:06:20.389> to

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
I was able more so than ever before to

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.550 
I was able more so than ever before to
have<00:06:21.930> control<00:06:22.500> over<00:06:23.240> the<00:06:24.240> visual<00:06:24.599> flow<00:06:24.839> of<00:06:25.110> the

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
have control over the visual flow of the

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.230 
have control over the visual flow of the
narrative<00:06:25.979> which<00:06:26.189> was<00:06:26.370> great<00:06:26.580> for<00:06:26.759> me<00:06:26.909> I<00:06:26.939> think

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
narrative which was great for me I think

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.629 
narrative which was great for me I think
you're<00:06:27.360> seeing<00:06:27.599> a<00:06:27.750> lot<00:06:27.870> of<00:06:27.930> my<00:06:28.080> other<00:06:28.199> work

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
you're seeing a lot of my other work

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.939 
you're seeing a lot of my other work
since<00:06:29.639> then<00:06:29.909> I've<00:06:30.289> found<00:06:31.289> that<00:06:31.439> grid<00:06:31.770> to<00:06:31.919> be

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
since then I've found that grid to be

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.420 
since then I've found that grid to be
very<00:06:32.490> useful<00:06:32.759> and<00:06:33.149> I've<00:06:33.990> used<00:06:34.529> it<00:06:34.740> repeatedly

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
very useful and I've used it repeatedly

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.980 
very useful and I've used it repeatedly
it<00:06:35.639> just<00:06:35.849> seems<00:06:36.029> to<00:06:36.180> me<00:06:36.330> to<00:06:36.360> be<00:06:36.569> a<00:06:36.599> much<00:06:36.810> more

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
it just seems to me to be a much more

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.510 
it just seems to me to be a much more
classic<00:06:37.289> and

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
classic and

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.999 
classic and
direct<00:06:38.910> form<00:06:39.150> comic<00:06:39.509> storytelling<00:06:40.139> for<00:06:40.860> me

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
direct form comic storytelling for me

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.339 
direct form comic storytelling for me
the<00:06:41.340> grid<00:06:41.580> also<00:06:41.910> suggested<00:06:42.509> a<00:06:42.599> rhythm<00:06:43.110> like<00:06:43.319> a

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
the grid also suggested a rhythm like a

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.390 
the grid also suggested a rhythm like a
ticking<00:06:44.129> watch<00:06:44.340> did<00:06:45.030> you<00:06:45.150> find<00:06:45.389> that<00:06:45.569> as<00:06:45.750> well

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
ticking watch did you find that as well

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.930 
ticking watch did you find that as well
and<00:06:47.780> the<00:06:48.780> grid<00:06:49.020> did<00:06:49.259> give<00:06:49.470> it<00:06:49.560> a<00:06:49.819> read<00:06:50.819> the

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
and the grid did give it a read the

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.719 
and the grid did give it a read the
minute<00:06:51.180> it<00:06:51.300> also<00:06:51.680> yes<00:06:52.680> it<00:06:52.860> was<00:06:53.220> a<00:06:53.250> rhythm<00:06:53.550> an

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
minute it also yes it was a rhythm an

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.129 
minute it also yes it was a rhythm an
interesting<00:06:54.150> thing<00:06:54.240> about<00:06:54.330> a<00:06:54.509> rhythm<00:06:54.840> is<00:06:54.990> that

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
interesting thing about a rhythm is that

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.210 
interesting thing about a rhythm is that
anything<00:06:55.379> that<00:06:55.470> breaks<00:06:55.620> the<00:06:55.830> rhythm<00:06:56.099> becomes

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
anything that breaks the rhythm becomes

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.490 
anything that breaks the rhythm becomes
very<00:06:56.550> conspicuous<00:06:57.300> I<00:06:57.479> mean<00:06:57.750> normally<00:06:58.169> in<00:06:58.349> a

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
very conspicuous I mean normally in a

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.950 
very conspicuous I mean normally in a
comic<00:06:58.800> book<00:06:58.830> a<00:06:59.220> big<00:06:59.879> picture<00:07:00.360> we're<00:07:00.659> talking

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
comic book a big picture we're talking

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.230 
comic book a big picture we're talking
about<00:07:01.050> two<00:07:02.039> thirds<00:07:02.220> of<00:07:02.340> a<00:07:02.430> page<00:07:02.639> or<00:07:02.849> something

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
about two thirds of a page or something

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.219 
about two thirds of a page or something
but<00:07:03.750> in<00:07:03.870> a<00:07:03.960> page<00:07:04.289> has<00:07:04.530> broken<00:07:04.949> up<00:07:05.039> into<00:07:05.220> nine

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
but in a page has broken up into nine

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.300 
but in a page has broken up into nine
fragments<00:07:07.229> even<00:07:08.129> two<00:07:08.460> of<00:07:08.490> those<00:07:08.729> put<00:07:09.090> together

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
fragments even two of those put together

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.189 
fragments even two of those put together
appears<00:07:11.310> a<00:07:11.400> big<00:07:11.610> picture<00:07:11.880> so<00:07:12.659> we<00:07:12.840> found<00:07:13.110> that

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 
appears a big picture so we found that

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.980 
appears a big picture so we found that
we<00:07:13.380> actually<00:07:13.680> had<00:07:14.580> a<00:07:14.610> range<00:07:15.210> that<00:07:15.419> there<00:07:15.840> was<00:07:15.960> a

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
we actually had a range that there was a

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.960 
we actually had a range that there was a
with<00:07:16.680> with<00:07:17.099> the<00:07:17.340> rhythm<00:07:17.639> there<00:07:17.789> were<00:07:17.849> the

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
with with the rhythm there were the

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.520 
with with the rhythm there were the
different<00:07:18.539> beats<00:07:18.780> that<00:07:19.050> could<00:07:19.229> go<00:07:19.349> within

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
different beats that could go within

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.680 
different beats that could go within
that<00:07:19.770> rhythm<00:07:20.039> and<00:07:20.280> again<00:07:21.240> I<00:07:21.270> mean<00:07:21.389> this<00:07:21.509> was<00:07:21.659> a

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
that rhythm and again I mean this was a

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.930 
that rhythm and again I mean this was a
great<00:07:22.289> thing<00:07:22.680> for<00:07:22.740> Allen<00:07:23.220> because<00:07:23.520> he<00:07:23.699> could

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
great thing for Allen because he could

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.059 
great thing for Allen because he could
he<00:07:24.419> could<00:07:24.539> orchestrate<00:07:24.780> it<00:07:25.319> he<00:07:25.440> could<00:07:25.620> say

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:26.069 
he could orchestrate it he could say

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.020 
he could orchestrate it he could say
Dada<00:07:27.030> Dada<00:07:27.240> da<00:07:27.449> da<00:07:27.840> that<00:07:28.409> da<00:07:29.130> if<00:07:29.699> you<00:07:29.849> are
