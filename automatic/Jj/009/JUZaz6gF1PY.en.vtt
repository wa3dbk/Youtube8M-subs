00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.459
 like the land that contains so much e 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.670
 a lot of water 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.860

 for my vegetable garden those of a well 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.010
 I would be very helpful but this is not 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.670
 by no means a real little is a parable of 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 plastic and has no hole below but 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.700

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.250
 never a well without water a well of gods 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.170
 wish you throw a coin in and 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.630

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.049

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.340
 the desire of the well does not center a little 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.650
 this wish 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.840
