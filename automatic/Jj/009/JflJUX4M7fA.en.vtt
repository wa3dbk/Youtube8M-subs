Hi everyone from AC News!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let’s see the trailer for The Change-Up,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
after the news today.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
From the writers of The Hangover,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
a hilarious new comedy starring Ryan Reynolds and Jasohn Bateman.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Mitch and Dave are best friends but they lead two very different lives,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
one is a married, family man, the other a convinced bachelor.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But after a night of revelry and confidences,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the two men wake up in each other’s body.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The film opens in cinemas on September 9

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
After so many legal problems,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it seems that Lindsay Lohan is finally ready to get back on set.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We'll see her soon in two films,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
both produced by Marc Fiore, and both about the Mafia:

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Gotti: Three Generations, on Gotti family and Mob Street,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
about how the Mafia entered the mechanisms of Wall Street.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It's all for today,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
goodbye from AC News!
