00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.950
 riga stored by you and well I'm fine 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.470
 super good we find ourselves today 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.660
 to introduce you to five small nugget 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.190
 small budget indeed decided to 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.300
 you take 5 nuggets within 5 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.430
 millions of euros on career mode 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.840
 that may allow you to do 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.369
 low profits because you can 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.330
 buy them sell them later but 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.560
 it is true that with small clubs we 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.400
 always looking for the nugget that can 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.320
 change the game 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.760
 no I'm going to turn around 5.5 of 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.250
 countries that can allow you to 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.630
 earn career mode a maximum 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.460
 money but also a maximum of titles 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.920
 Basel I took the real madrid for 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.819
 just show you down I wanted 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.109
 to have the players without taking me the 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.429
 head since I wanted to recruit them all 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.739
 so I took the real madrid as 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.799
 like that it's easy so the players 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.549
 are just here often the team are we going there 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.010
 reports the team 

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.659
 so the first is youri medeiros of 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.979
 rice medeiros and a player who was playing at 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.600
 sporting portugal 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.299
 it was bought for 4 million euros 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.059
 youri medeiros and if you look closely it 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.289
 at 84.2 potential so really it's 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.269
 a very very good player stan winger 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.819
 left look at me these stats 87 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.159
 acceleration 110 speed 87 in 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.689
 agility 92 in balance we will go see 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.430
 also four-star technical gesture the 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.049
 gay 20 years ago can even play 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.759
 work I tell you so that day 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.020
 it's really a pure nugget it's the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.840
 little cristiano ronaldo others who puts 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.520
 of the career mode he has he only 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380
 20 years it takes 4 million euros I 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.810
 you highly recommend it the other 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.909
 player and more look at that before 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.329
 to follow on the small bilal or 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.579
 chic 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.259
 that day still played two games 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.820
 with me there is already caught a chick 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.020
 guys to tell you the level of the player 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.280
 to tell you that it will be joking 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.270
 really not I think it's one of 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.710
 best that I can present 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.240
 maybe millions of euros is 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.649
 really that slab you are recruiting that a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.030
 little team kind when etc 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.109
 I am sure and will come here because 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.999
 they play sporting portugal 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.439
 montseret that he not badly coveted so that 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.130
 that I had to put a little more money if he 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.179
 is not we see if in your 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.689
 career you can see it for 3 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.909
 millions of euros 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.829
 but know that this day is really worth 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.450
 really kick with candy that starts 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.850
 it's okay you can take yourself without 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.929
 problem of rice medeiros then bilal 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.729
 or chic 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.009
 excuse me for hours for the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.280
 pronunciation 3 million 8 and fc 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.869
 twente is therefore eredivise and he has 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.350
 than 66 of general but when we look 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.479
 it is an evolution of 84 if I get 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.110
 do not deceive yes here is the little bilal or 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.150
 chic 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.440
 so here he is very very very technical 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.840
 must say he says 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.300
 dpj maghreb if I'm wrong he must 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.650
 to be moroccan i do i do it before that 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.930
 by reading this just your name haye them 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.490
 down there he comes from the Netherlands where he has 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.230
 Algerian origins or maybe 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.400
 moroccan i will moroccan me so 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.600
 it is true that people morocco and these 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.460
 grounds are very very very technical 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.230
 then it is part of the very close 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.690
 and technical he is 17 years old they allow 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.120
 67 look at me this is stats 79 in 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.930
 acceleration 74 speed know that the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.580
 speed you're going to tell me this is 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.530
 anecdotal it's for a young player 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.240
 it's not a 74 but know that 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.560
 I use increases enormously his stats 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.250
 in-game will also increase 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.700
 Verry much 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.900
 he's agitated me 1,092 in balance the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.220
 Guys it's just amazing 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.630
 he's a very, very good player that I 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.310
 also advises you is part of 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.870
 great nuggets in the same way as a 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.370
 youri medeiros that makes you two wingers 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.930
 for less than 10 million euros 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.160
 this addition if you arrange 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.650
 well we can see both for 7 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.060
 million who you are badly enough you can 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.110
 see both for 7 million and I you 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.860
 ensures that these two days there are 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.610
 players that goes up to 84 for one and and 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.230
 him I believe that goes up to 86 which me 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.800
 not wrong no really are very very 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.630
 very good player 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.500
 do not hesitate to buy them so I 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.510
 do not know why I'm leaving but we 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.340
 will return the other cns directly 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.830
 bonal him this day more expensive than 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.290
 I have or present our clio 5 million and 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.520
 100000 euros so he is a player 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.970
 who took a lot I had a lot of 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.140
 wrong to buy 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.489
 but that's a day I wanted because 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.580
 it took a scorer to introduce you 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.150
 to introduce you to a scorer so he 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.650
 i took and nasbinals so him there is 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.880
 stadiums rather honorable he has four 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.520
 and technical objects 4 was bad 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.810
 So walk him there to finish very 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.920
 very easily contributions 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.500
 medium-sized means it may be its 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.480
 biggest fault it closed 81 15 85 so 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.160
 it's rather big 72 mhz acceleration 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.269
 center 15 in speed so much you 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.820
 to say that when he is at his level 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.310
 maximum of 83 roughly it's about 1 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.810
 of which 83 he will have well over 80 of 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.720
 speed it might be a super player 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.940
 super interesting it's true that he he 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.530
 is recruited two arms of bursaspor 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.670
 so for 5 million 1 it's true they 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.019
 are pretty tough they do not want the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.459
 to let go or for sure I made 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.080
 offers a lot of offers I have 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.310
 mounted gradually and it's true that 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.840
 he's brutal he did not want to let go 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.370
 finally they let go and that's right 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.110
 that he already put a roof goal of my 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.380
 side so really very very very good 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.019
 player 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.070
 the fourth player cfa reis bahlouli the 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.510
 Olympique Lyonnais player 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.160
 so him it's very easy to have a 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.750
 lion is not interested in him 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.520
 could have it for 2 million euros 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.319
 guys so him very good attack 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.240
 ration in speed in agility and in 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.030
 balance with him is that he has 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.590
 a 68 word might see this item 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.509
 technical 4 stars you were and 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.840
 look at me especially the post pallet 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.610
 where he can play m at cmd mgb he has 19 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.319
 years and finally m 81 a contribution 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.370
 strong offensive and defensive average this 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.270
 which is really interesting for a 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.530
 central offensive midfielder 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.120
 really it's a player that has to be 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.020
 you were testing it's cheap 2 million 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.069
 I can tell you I did not do 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.509
 in the lace you can heat it 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.830
 for less I gave them what they 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.000
 wanted because good it's money 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.409
 but you can largely chopper 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.300
 for me the little fares bahlouli and 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.220
 he really is a gem and also 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.810
 the last seller keen rise to mali 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.789
 so lempel a central defensive midfielder 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.159
 I told you I wanted one and 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.780
 so the gaps austin ali ba it's a 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.180
 players only with one of the biggest players 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.110
 potential on the game he at 63.2 general 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.150
 so there you tell me he 'll take 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.060
 what +10 their at 73 in the stations not the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.949
 high this tournament here goes up to 84 the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.419
 general guy so him 65 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.330
 acceleration without two speed 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.530
 68 in agility 67 in balance you have 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.300
 to tell his stats there are disgusting and 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.979
 to play strings they are duras but 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.169
 he is a player who can become 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.550
 really amazing who there you can 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.630
 not know which stadiums there I go 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.039
 maybe show you at the end of the 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.599
 video 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.800
 the pulpit stats there ten years after and 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.360
 you will see you will see that these players 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.919
 there will have increased that they will have almost 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.139
 80 everywhere in all the stats he has to 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.240
 do not you say you trick all there is 63 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.680
 from general it goes to 84 so you 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.750
 take all the stats there you them 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.770
 put +20 +20 all the stats and 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.509
 look at me start at a lot more 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.440
 interesting right now if we had 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.550
 more than twenty all the stats it was 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.169
 85 in acceleration 88 years speed 88 years 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.190
 and agility you what is that day 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.900
 can really be a big fat 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.199
