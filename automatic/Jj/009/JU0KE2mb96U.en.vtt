00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.200
 ah 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.029
 winning is always a very satisfying 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.840
 very important the rivals to whom 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:23.800
 you face different tastes 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.689
 different ways because that is how they are 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.840
 rivalries that you tell me that's why it's 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.439
 extra sporty then it 's something that 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.660
 here you will never miss that 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.660
 rivalry that there are artists with chivas 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.570
 that the whole society is all day in 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.860
 the same is very nice always and 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.190
 when it does not happen 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.170
 to the aggressive issue and win a 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.060
 match one way or another that 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.940
 means in different things but 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.270
 always winning is a very satisfying 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.100
 nice for the voladitos the marbles 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.050
 you win and you feel that plot of when 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.700
 you lose wu you have to stay quiet and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.610
 either way 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.260
 I missed directing the truth that if it is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.210
 adrenaline that feels before the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.740
 matches that you have during the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.630
 party if it is part of oneself 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.550
 then of course it is strange 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.770
 and as I tell you all the matches 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.980
 if you do not feel that web like that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.420
 you are inside then it is part as of 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.280
 oneself and is outside is feels a 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.560
 uncomfortable good area what they mean 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.300
 the parties with all the fuss that 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.780
 there in societies are very nice 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.310
 the truth because it is not a week is 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.080
 depends on the result as they have been 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.310
 what happened that did not happen are followed 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.230
 commenting and the mockery continues for 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.040
 until you come back to face what 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:58.000
 you can retaliate and that's the way it is and I think 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.940
 the group has been growing little by little 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.950
 has been loosing with a lot of effort and 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.470
 much patience the truth that they have 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.960
 endured many things for a long time 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.030
 time and now that they have been able to respond 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.560
 that they have jointly given 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.590
 results or you've won a lot 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.390
 trust and process is taking us little 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.460
 little you do not have to know how to distinguish 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.710
 how far 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:26.020
 you have to get things not to take them to 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.800
 the blows you never have to get past what 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.570
 what happens 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.030
 as much as it bothers you no matter how much 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.710
 mockery I know that suddenly we are 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.140
 different and some are not reached 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.310
 hold on but this is to enjoy it 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.170
 to relax to let off steam and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.450
 feel happy with your with your team 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.010
 not to transcend and has 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.440
 misbehavior not because many take advantage and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.310
 they hide inside and a crowd to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.450
 make mischief and that's what those who do not 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.450
 we want inside the stadiums
