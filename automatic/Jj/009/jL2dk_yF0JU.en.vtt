00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.540
 I'm with the speed 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.610
 suite and the game link are in the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.460
 description 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.710
 and the first thing we will do is go to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.009
 this page to see if the game is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.529
 compatible with the computer and here 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.400
 we put the name of the game and click 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.400
 in can you run it 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.219
 well here says 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.159
 for only the tests the requirements 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.799
 and the results will be 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.909
 As you can see, everything is correct 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.909
 what will work 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:22.820
 then the second thing is to download these 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.380
 two programs the mourning that will serve us 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.490
 for 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.490
 download the game 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.960
 and that of montull is to mount the image 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.960
 just click on download 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.320
 well first accept these and they will start 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.320
 the discharge 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.420
 good here they download it install it is easy 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.790
 once done this here we will have the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.180
 torrent of the game which we will open 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.370
 with the torrent 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.380
 but that message comes to me because 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.380
 I downloaded 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.320
 you will get a box that will 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.679
 He says 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.410
 where are you going to download the files that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.140
 will you download in the ok 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.200
 and well, if you want, you can change the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.230
 where they are downloaded but they 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.560
 I recommend that you read ok and the game is 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.460
 something heavy almost 8 gigs so they should 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.620
 have patience and wait 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.099
 [Music] 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.620
 once downloaded we select it 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.180
 we click right and we are going to open 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.180
 the container folder 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.750
 we can go out now 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 well here we will have these two things the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.160
 image made which we will mount with the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.840
 montull 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.840
 making the clicks 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.330
 Well, this will come out 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.069
 this reproduction we just click on it 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.680
 when the author executed an excel point 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.680
 and we will proceed to install it 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.930
 We accept the terms if we click on 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.720
 next we accept and click on the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.720
 next we choose the installation 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.060
 personalized and let's open the next 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.209
 This is where we will be installed 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.970
 that's why they can change it but not anymore 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.970
 I will do it so we click on install 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.680
 here 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.680
 we click on next 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.799
 this cancer to see him 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.390
 yes 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.520
 the installation of the game will begin here 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.870
 and this will depend on the speed of 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:12.010
 his computer that's why I to read vi and 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.340
 well once downloaded and installed 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.160
 sorry the game will appear an image 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.359
 like this one in which we just have to 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.359
 give cristian final 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.689
 and here 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.119
 we cancel this 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.939
 good to create the game what 

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:37.889
 we will have to do first go to the 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:41.529
 team 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.760
 once in a team we leave 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:47.020
 to the game unit 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.880
 we open it and then to the crack folder 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.360
 we entered the crack letter and copied 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.200
 this click right copper we go to the place 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.000
 where the game was installed for it 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.270
 in my case teams are integrated in 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.480
 place of program files 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.200
 electronic arts for speed and here we paste 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.200
 what we copied 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.460
 we replace obviously we continue to 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.070
 we copy and represent because I already had 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.410
 fact 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.289
 and then we give it right click and what 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.479
 we run as administrator 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.069
 here tells us press the key to 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.069
 continue press any 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.750
 and we hope good and that would be all the 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:37.160
 crack what would remain would be to select 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.310
 in the game application click 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:45.310
 right and send it to the desktop 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:48.360
 and leave them a direct access as 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.360
 like this 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.200
 and well they would have the game to 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.320
 play and that this 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.000
 [Music] 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.700
 good 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.880
 this would be all remember to follow me in 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.300
 twitter and on facebook give fine to the 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.300
 page 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.360
 and I forget to tell you that the 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.790
 links to download the game will be in 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.950
 description and I have uploaded several 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.100
 servers in case they fall 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.200
 choose an option and do it well 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.620
 it has been all we see ourselves in our 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.620
 videochat
