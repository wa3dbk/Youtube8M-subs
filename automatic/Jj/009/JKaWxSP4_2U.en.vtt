00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 to 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.770
 Now we have from our tickets 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.760
 plane up to our childhood photos 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.860
 stored in our tablets and 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.200
 phones but now and then 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.970
 we need a paper copy but 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.070

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.989

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.650
 I show how to print so 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.810
 wireless from any device 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.820
 The first thing you should do is 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.070
 find out if your printer is compatible 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.140
 with apple airprint to find out 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.190
 go to the apple website and go to 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 u support s10 click on the print and 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.270
 You will see a huge list of printers 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.610
 remember that the configuration process 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.320
 will vary a bit depending on your model and if 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.660
 Your printer does not appear in this list 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.360
 there is a remedy but first I show you 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.250
 this epson that if it is compatible after 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.710
 verify you must connect your printer to 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.230
 a wifi network this is usually 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.329
 from the same printer you enter 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.890
 the password of your network then the 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 printer turns off and it goes back to 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.520
 turn on only when you're connected 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.770
 correctly you will see that the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.780
 light of the icon here and now we turn to the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.760
 configuration of your mobile device 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.740
 I will be using this area connects 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.750
 to the same wifi network that you connect to 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.610
 the printer now opens what you want 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.830
 print and press the action icon 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.380
 with the arrow at the bottom left hand 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.510
 of your screen press the button 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.640
 print and how can you see the ipad already 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.370
 found the printer if it does not come out 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.900
 automatically press select and 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.910
 choose yours 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.950
 here you also decide how many copies of the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.960
 document you want to press 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.730
 print and ready if instead your 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.980
 printer is not compatible with airprint 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.900
 the process will be a bit longer but 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.180
 If you can configure there are several 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.190
 options but I recommend you oh print 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.410
 if you have windows or handy computer 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.820
 print for the mac once you install the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.190
 program on your computer the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.530
 connected printers will be ready 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.180
 to print wirelessly only 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.130
 remember to print from your 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.840
 mobile device your computer should 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.270
 be on the same Wi-Fi network as the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.160
 mobile device and the printer the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 process to print is the same you go 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.360
 to the document you press the icon 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 action with the arrow and press 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.200
 print now you will not have to 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.300
 move documents from your 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.450
