mushroom is basically an analog delay

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.639 
mushroom is basically an analog delay
with<00:02:03.939> an<00:02:04.209> optical<00:02:04.689> sensor<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.200> control<00:02:05.229> the

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
with an optical sensor to control the

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.680 
with an optical sensor to control the
pitch<00:02:05.799> of<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.069> delay<00:02:07.530> has<00:02:08.530> two<00:02:08.920> modes<00:02:09.160> set

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pitch of the delay has two modes set

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.120 
pitch of the delay has two modes set
with<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.929> switch<00:02:11.230> right<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.859> middle

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
with the switch right here in the middle

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.250 
with the switch right here in the middle
and<00:02:12.340> sets<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> right<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.750> just<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.079> basic

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
and sets of the right it's just a basic

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.150 
and sets of the right it's just a basic
analog<00:02:14.799> delay<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.730> red<00:02:16.510> knob<00:02:16.720> controls<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
analog delay the red knob controls the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.550 
analog delay the red knob controls the
feedback<00:02:18.609> and<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.910> white<00:02:19.090> knob<00:02:19.299> controls<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
feedback and the white knob controls the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.199 
feedback and the white knob controls the
delay<00:02:21.370> time<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.810> at<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.019> left<00:02:23.639> it<00:02:24.639> activates

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
delay time so at the left it activates

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.920 
delay time so at the left it activates
this<00:02:25.660> optical<00:02:26.380> sensor<00:02:26.799> right<00:02:27.010> here<00:02:27.370> which

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
this optical sensor right here which

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.199 
this optical sensor right here which
controls<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.109> pitch<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.560> delay<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:31.030> red

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
controls the pitch of the delay the red

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.090 
controls the pitch of the delay the red
knob<00:02:31.359> still<00:02:31.660> controls<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.170> feedback<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
knob still controls the feedback but the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.860 
knob still controls the feedback but the
white<00:02:33.250> knob<00:02:33.459> controls<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:34.060> sensitivity<00:02:34.750> of

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
white knob controls the sensitivity of

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.920 
white knob controls the sensitivity of
this<00:02:35.170> optical<00:02:35.769> sensor<00:02:36.660> basically<00:02:37.660> how<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
this optical sensor basically how it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.580 
this optical sensor basically how it
works<00:02:37.989> is<00:02:38.850> however<00:02:39.850> much<00:02:40.239> light<00:02:40.569> gets<00:02:40.959> through

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
works is however much light gets through

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.819 
works is however much light gets through
this<00:02:42.430> optical<00:02:42.940> sensor<00:02:43.299> controls<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.620> pitch

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
this optical sensor controls the pitch

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.839 
this optical sensor controls the pitch
of<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> delay<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.970> by<00:02:46.359> covering<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:46.989> or

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
of the delay so by covering it up or

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.539 
of the delay so by covering it up or
uncovering<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.560> change<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.310> pitch

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
uncovering it you can change the pitch

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.599 
uncovering it you can change the pitch
of<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:51.880> just<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.269> delayed<00:02:52.569> sound<00:02:53.459> set<00:02:54.459> on

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
of the just of the delayed sound set on

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.270 
of the just of the delayed sound set on
low<00:02:54.849> sensitivity<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.870> unit<00:02:56.170> sounds<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:56.829> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
low sensitivity the unit sounds like a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.879 
low sensitivity the unit sounds like a
course<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.450> broto<00:02:58.690> effect<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.590> delayed

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
course of a broto effect on the delayed

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.960 
course of a broto effect on the delayed
sound<00:03:00.220> which<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.579> what<00:03:00.819> I<00:03:01.090> mainly<00:03:01.690> use<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.049> for

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
sound which is what I mainly use it for

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.220 
sound which is what I mainly use it for
and<00:03:03.970> then<00:03:04.359> like<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.660> showed<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.900> on<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.109> video

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and then like I showed you on the video

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.190 
and then like I showed you on the video
set<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:05.680> high<00:03:05.940> sensitivity<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.180> sounds<00:03:07.630> just

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
set on high sensitivity it sounds just

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.190 
set on high sensitivity it sounds just
like<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.410> crazy<00:03:08.859> pitch<00:03:09.220> shifter<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:10.690> has<00:03:10.840> a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
like a crazy pitch shifter that has a

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.710 
like a crazy pitch shifter that has a
lot<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.500> feedback<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.299> makes<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.420> lot<00:03:13.599> of

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
lot of feedback and makes a lot of

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.940 
lot of feedback and makes a lot of
really<00:03:13.959> cool<00:03:14.110> sounds

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
really cool sounds

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.050 
really cool sounds
I<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.660> spell<00:03:16.959> because<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.400> use<00:03:18.670> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
I like the spell because you can use the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.479 
I like the spell because you can use the
the<00:03:19.870> analog<00:03:20.260> delay<00:03:20.590> side<00:03:20.830> which<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:21.099> know<00:03:21.430> I

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
the analog delay side which you know I

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.690 
the analog delay side which you know I
just<00:03:21.640> leave<00:03:21.819> on<00:03:21.970> all<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.270> time<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:23.670> also<00:03:24.670> I

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
just leave on all the time and also I

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.240 
just leave on all the time and also I
can<00:03:24.940> switch<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.360> back<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.750> use<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:27.010> pitch

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
can switch it back and use that pitch

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.970 
can switch it back and use that pitch
shift<00:03:27.550> which<00:03:27.880> i<00:03:28.780> think<00:03:29.050> is<00:03:29.290> pretty<00:03:29.590> unique<00:03:29.920> to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
shift which i think is pretty unique to

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.210 
shift which i think is pretty unique to
this<00:03:30.310> pedal<00:03:30.959> well<00:03:31.959> that's<00:03:32.140> about<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
this pedal well that's about it for the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.610 
this pedal well that's about it for the
moody<00:03:33.430> mushroom<00:03:33.910> but<00:03:34.720> make<00:03:35.080> sure<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.440> go<00:03:35.560> to

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
moody mushroom but make sure and go to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.699 
moody mushroom but make sure and go to
