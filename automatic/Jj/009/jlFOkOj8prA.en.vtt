the same but it doesn't have wings so

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.380 
the same but it doesn't have wings so
that's<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.040> only<00:02:36.099> thing<00:02:36.489> different<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
that's the only thing different and the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.270 
that's the only thing different and the
feet<00:02:37.599> are<00:02:37.780> completely<00:02:38.440> different<00:02:38.890> from<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
feet are completely different from the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.460 
feet are completely different from the
style<00:02:39.519> town<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:44.019> know<00:02:44.170> yeah<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:45.750> was<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
style town so you know yeah that was the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
style town so you know yeah that was the
real<00:02:47.829> feel<00:02:48.099> for<00:02:48.130> grant<00:02:48.579> tighten<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.630> think

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
real feel for grant tighten and I think

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.809 
real feel for grant tighten and I think
it's<00:02:50.019> actually<00:02:50.319> pretty<00:02:50.530> cool<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.970> also<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
it's actually pretty cool but also the

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.180 
it's actually pretty cool but also the
