00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 as far as we know somewhere four with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
 half a billion years ago cobble 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.170
 on which we live was formed from dust 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.960
 and debris remaining after formation 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.639
 the sun without the pizza delivery planes or 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.639
 Internet subjects moved much 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.870
 slower on the young earth than it is now 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.000
 for example the formation of oceans from 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.369
 isolated pools took from 400 to 800 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 million years so much time 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.019
 it would take your hair to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.880
 go around the earth twice at the same time 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.949
 bacterial life has spread to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 the waters of the globe higher plants and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.969
 animals on the other hand needed 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.079
 much more time to develop 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.670
 spread but we'll miss 3 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.290
 billion years during which your 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.219
 hair could grow to the moon and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.020
 talk about us 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.329
 homo sapiens we were much faster 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 of our hair that will grow by only 27 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.420
 kilometers for the same time for which we 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
 crossed africa and got to all 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 unfrozen continents 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.449
 in many territories we developed such 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.620
 useful activities like farming 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 but because people were 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 spread around the world the best ideas 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.360
 and delicious local produce 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.160
 distributed only by 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.289
 trade or migration 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 wheat, for example, was domesticated in all 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.989
 ten and a half thousand years ago for 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.670
 cooking porridge 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 some believe that it was used 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.479
 for making beer but anyway 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.619
 wheat in the regions begins fertile 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 crescent and pacific 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.330
 spread over 6000 years six thousand 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 kilometers over 6000 years may seem 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 fast paced but let's take a look 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 on the middle ages bubonic plague i 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.070
 the printing press spread by 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 Europe in less than a hundred years bringing 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.590
 death literacy people whose hair is behind 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.299
 this time grew by only 15 meters 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 in the twentieth century mania on the beatles and hula 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.170
 hoop raced around the world for a year or 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.329
 two 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.920
 now even a year is a long time at that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.990
 time like millions of people on the plane 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.030
 around the globe every day such 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.770
 diseases like atypical pneumonia can 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.899
 develop almost everywhere throughout 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.670
 a few weeks and units and zeros 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.020
 who make up this video will need 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.759
 less than a tenth of a second to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.040
 get to you during this time your 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.330
 hair grew by two houses in short 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.180
 rate of movement on 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.440
 I have grown a lot like this 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.920
 you were a doctor 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.920
 bye everyone
