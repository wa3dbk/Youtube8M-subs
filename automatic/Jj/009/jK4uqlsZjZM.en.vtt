 I'm sharing with you in the new 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.079
 my experiences with the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.020
 tattoo and the little I learned 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.449
 during those 13 years that everything is ok 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.230
 So if he tells me he finds himself 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.379
 smart ass oriental mandarin 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.750
 before my beer starts 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.939
 speaking the style first style that I 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 I met in magazines and tattoos 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.090
 old or sorry I'll put here 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.369
 the work that this work of the sound of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.400
 my friend gabriel saltori than he 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.650
 tact he once acted the towel and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.750
 well then excuse the time a 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.420
 tougher footprint on one thing in colors 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.450
 more classic does not have much fight 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.329
 a lot of fishing trip is a footprint 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.329
 I really like this type, there are some 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.860
 tattoos and other cool glitches I would say 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.710
 in styles fascinates me more than one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.140
 simpler style and more dry double 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.729
 so it does not have much 99 look what thing 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.619
 more traditional 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.210
 you can also search for other 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.670
 16 drawings in the diary that is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.979
 practically the father donated or the disc is a 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.360
 computer, the old one there you go 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.780
 see lots of legal references on the internet 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.909
 It's heavy because you're a good man. 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.469

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.600
 work I put here is my O 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.440
 friend karina guimarães from são paulo 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.960
 a kiss here she tattooed me she did this 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.240
 are thirteen current who was the one who made the 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.820
 Her footprint is very dark you can see that it is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.760
 a design but is more rounded with the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.720
 more vivid colors the exaggerated eyes one 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.460
 different footprint 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.980
 I particularly do not like to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.660
 bus with no quiet at all 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.660
 sorry let's talk about the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.040
 realism style is that there is one 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.700
 thing as you can see the photo 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.380
 here o 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.780
 you're practically copying a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.380
 photo has a face that puts a photo 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.480
 and do exactly the same same design 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.910
 on the skin of the person using 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.350
 much much more babies but as we saw 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.080
 which was reference has also colored 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.690
 There are several famous artists around the world. 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.820
 Fuck, I particularly do not like it. 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.530
 I have as close as I have to 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.420
 realism I think this creed is the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.970
 blackberry on the website want to see if more 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.860
 Someone does a thigh, I do not know either. 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.140
 we will see also the oriental 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.390
 traditional Christmas I have seen some 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.710
 subclasses some divisions so but the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.690

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.280
 guide the traditional time

 here you accompany in this is the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.680
 my cradle on my back is good and 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.230
 Pippin who made the friend's cocoa 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.720
 fifth, this work also took time 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.209
 one year and seven months to do 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.430
 about 28 two sessions is eastern 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.470
 extremely traditional style and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.940
 He accuses me of killing me, but for me. 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.230

 I always say the cocoa I wanted 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.550
 everything under the inscription will have 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.530

 Feather has a new style that I do not know. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.760
 if this is the name that I am going to present 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.250
 here is a nice job that my 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.890

 has several several several photos of 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.700
 It's a very different thing. 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.400
 is a style that has been growing for some 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.380
 time I remember when 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.690
 when it was the tattoo blog 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.370
 style is starting to look even for 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.470
 do little research on the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.630
 internet translate texts in English for 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.520
 to be able to talk about the style that was not 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.440
 being very known here in brazil 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.330
 also did not have much publicity here 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.050
 in curitiba the christ is this kind of 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.539

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.330
 1 a testosterone friend is a job 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.780
 the very cool max you did and it is a 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.580
 footprint that I do not like much but would 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.530
 on my skin both marking praetorium 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.180
 crisis in which the current 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.520
 he gave the ball as a gift to celebrate 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.080
 one year channel and been through some 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.820
 months I'll do something 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.160
 related to the canal in the leg 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.020
 in this style and several watercolor 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.389
 different styles ae also has the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.460
 What pointillism is I have two 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.590
 work of the pontilhismo sunday kaká 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.280
 public this work that is his is very 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.930
 cool 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.180
 I do not know, the guy has to have a lot of mothers. 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.460
 make you are you do not try 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.930
 some shade such but you go 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.940
 make a little dot 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.039
 the cabo carlos that he did in me he 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.900
 has drawn the drawing and then it makes the 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.470
 shadow make a gradient with a dot 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.630
 not even 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.090
 using if you are doing so if you 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.970
 searching the internet has a lot of stuff 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.979
 has several well-known intimate artists 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.539
 For those who attend so much, do not you? 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.699
 it has to be look for methods 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.430
 known the work I like I have 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.530
 two car jobs and I would do more 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.970
 a style that appeals to me a little more 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.500
 and also remembering so you saw that 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.000
 features a style is there but I 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.770
 I liked the disco 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.889
 I usually talk like this, look for a 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.159
 tattooist who does well done existed 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:55.979
 tempting that only make users actors 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.389
 that make the oriental disco more realism but 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.310
 if you choose a job for example 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.169
 to follow a risky job said little 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.940
 The Olympian is this style that I want 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.400
 So you ask everyone in society. 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.740
 specialists in this type of 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.539
 right tattoo because it will 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.070
 to do is something that they slept there for 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.010
 example with the calm that I quoted here 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.599
 he only does environmental he only does oriental 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.610
 traditional comes to his studio speaks 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.090
 I want to make a swallow here. 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.220
 Who are going to talk here? He knows how to do it. 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.560
 the movie started doing it only he 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.690
 passes to the tattoo artist as he has more 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.910
 two or three handlers of his studio 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.160
 and one of them is his brother Rodrigo 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.440
 I already acted and it makes a very beautiful disc 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.330
 also peter gabriel made the album too 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.550
 It's cool for you to look for someone who is 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.350
 specific in that style and this helps 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.040
 enough then that is a cool thing of 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.229
 to emphasize 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.000
 You choose the look for tattooists style 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.250
 in your city and region to make a 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.990
 water style with stop at work or 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.820
 Other when we go here your friend 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.979
 several shrines and he said that he has 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.320
 come and exclude the guy shows you that he 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.389
 did you go after you search on 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.139
 internet to your advantage and do not fall into 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.850
 snares 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.800
 the guy was not easy or wants to make a 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.229
 easy disco guy goes there he'll say 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.080
 who does everything at the time he does crap 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.540
 no then not from your skin to 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.919
 any link we're talking about alone 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.260
 remembering that this weekend now 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.210
