Mach 10 so I could show it to you guys

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.650 
Mach 10 so I could show it to you guys
before<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:44.460> was<00:00:44.670> already<00:00:44.880> over<00:00:45.150> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
before you know it was already over and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.150 
before you know it was already over and
it<00:00:46.080> already<00:00:46.290> came<00:00:46.560> out<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.860> there's<00:00:47.040> no<00:00:47.130> use

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it already came out so there's no use

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.470 
it already came out so there's no use
for<00:00:47.550> box<00:00:48.020> but<00:00:49.020> whatever<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.820> said<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.270> think

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
for box but whatever this said I think

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.450 
for box but whatever this said I think
it<00:00:51.540> looks<00:00:51.720> pretty<00:00:51.870> cool

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
it looks pretty cool

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.810 
it looks pretty cool
it's<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.730> tall<00:00:54.030> solve<00:00:54.660> anything<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:56.670> can

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it's really tall solve anything you can

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's really tall solve anything you can
move<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.420> actual<00:00:58.230> pie<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.800> legs<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.870> movable

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
move the actual pie the legs are movable

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.350 
move the actual pie the legs are movable
up<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.860> using<00:01:02.340> these<00:01:02.460> new<00:01:02.730> ratchets

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
up here using these new ratchets

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.389 
up here using these new ratchets
as<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.559> whatever<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:05.040> knew<00:01:05.189> but

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
as you can see whatever they knew but

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.210 
as you can see whatever they knew but
those<00:01:05.610> ratchets<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.479> they're<00:01:07.170> hard<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:08.009> move

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
those ratchets and they're hard to move

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.920 
those ratchets and they're hard to move
and<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> break<00:01:09.390> anything<00:01:09.690> on

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and I don't want to break anything on

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.180
