00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
while in the cups you can just check on

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.100 
while in the cups you can just check on
them<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.309> flip<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.180> over<00:00:42.420> you're<00:00:42.780> looking

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
them if you flip it over you're looking

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840 
them if you flip it over you're looking
for<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> root<00:00:43.710> system<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> roots<00:00:44.460> should<00:00:44.700> be

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
for the root system the roots should be

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
for the root system the roots should be
nice<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.059> white<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.620> these

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
nice and white and you can see these

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.060 
nice and white and you can see these
roots<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.640> still<00:00:50.940> growing<00:00:51.590> down<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.860> length

roots are still growing down the length
of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> cup<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> bottom<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.840> there<00:00:55.289> are

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
of the cup to the bottom and there are

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080 
of the cup to the bottom and there are
no<00:00:55.620> roots<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.219> plant<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.789> stay<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
no roots here this plant can stay in

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.060 
no roots here this plant can stay in
here<00:00:57.270> probably<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.379> least<00:00:58.500> another<00:00:58.859> week

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
here probably for at least another week

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
here probably for at least another week
but<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.460> how<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> check<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
but that's how you check on them as you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.640 
but that's how you check on them as you
work<00:01:01.910> your<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:03.000> across<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.840> did<00:01:04.199> cheat<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
work your way across I did cheat and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.690 
work your way across I did cheat and
peek<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:05.010> these<00:01:05.450> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> cayenne<00:01:07.110> pepper

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
peek at these this is a cayenne pepper

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.050 
peek at these this is a cayenne pepper
you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.210> system<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:11.280> roots<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you can see this system of roots is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.969 
you can see this system of roots is
going<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.689> they're<00:01:12.930> starting<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.439> show

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
going down and they're starting to show

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.469 
going down and they're starting to show
right<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.520> could<00:01:14.700> transplant<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
right here you could transplant this

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
right here you could transplant this
right<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.799> could<00:01:16.950> wait<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> couple<00:01:17.369> of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
right now or you could wait a couple of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.890 
right now or you could wait a couple of
days<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.939> don't<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.509> starting<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
days you don't want them starting to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
days you don't want them starting to
coil<00:01:19.259> right<00:01:19.830> around<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.930> can

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
coil right around here but what you can

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.370 
coil right around here but what you can
tell<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.860> nice<00:01:23.040> solid<00:01:23.610> strong

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
tell is that they have nice solid strong

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
tell is that they have nice solid strong
root<00:01:25.380> systems<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.630> then<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:29.420> mulatto

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
root systems and then this is a mulatto

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.140 
root systems and then this is a mulatto
and<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.159> how<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.490> coiling<00:01:33.000> more

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and you can see how this is coiling more

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.600 
and you can see how this is coiling more
these<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.509> definitely<00:01:34.049> ready<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.650> go<00:01:35.430> into

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
these are definitely ready to go into

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510 
these are definitely ready to go into
the<00:01:35.810> containers<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the containers and then this one is a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.940 
the containers and then this one is a
Soriano<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.509> same<00:01:42.509> thing<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.049> when<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> roots

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
Soriano and same thing so when the roots

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
Soriano and same thing so when the roots
really<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.060> mean<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.390> look<00:01:45.570> great<00:01:45.750> when<00:01:45.960> they

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
really I mean they look great when they

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.429 
really I mean they look great when they
start<00:01:46.710> filling<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> sides<00:01:48.079> start<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> coil

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
start filling up the sides start to coil

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.100 
start filling up the sides start to coil
right<00:01:49.680> around<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.280> they're<00:01:50.579> ready<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
right around here they're ready to go so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.420 
right around here they're ready to go so
these<00:01:52.259> three<00:01:52.590> plants<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.280> into

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
these three plants can go into

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
these three plants can go into
containers<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.530> into

when you do this you want to get about

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.600 
when you do this you want to get about
an<00:02:34.629> inch<00:02:34.900> worth<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.319> soil<00:02:35.590> on<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.830> bottom<00:02:36.190> so

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
an inch worth of soil on the bottom so

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.550 
an inch worth of soil on the bottom so

it
also<00:02:39.250> when<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.519> put<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.819> in<00:02:39.940> there's<00:02:40.750> enough

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
also when you put it in there's enough

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.309 
also when you put it in there's enough
room<00:02:41.410> around<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.540> root<00:02:43.690> systems<00:02:44.110> can

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
room around it that the root systems can

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.650 
room around it that the root systems can
grow<00:02:44.500> out<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.459> see<00:02:45.700> when<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.239> to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
grow out and you can see when you get to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.920 
grow out and you can see when you get to
a<00:02:46.690> bigger<00:02:46.959> container<00:02:48.269> there's<00:02:49.269> more<00:02:49.510> room<00:02:49.900> for

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the root this one's better because not

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.530 
the root this one's better because not
only<00:02:53.680> does<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.519> give<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.910> lot<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.209> space<00:02:55.510> for

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
only does it give it a lot of space for

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.960 
only does it give it a lot of space for
the<00:02:55.930> roots<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.290> grow<00:02:56.379> out<00:02:56.680> from<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> sides<00:02:57.250> but

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
the roots to grow out from the sides but

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.119 
the roots to grow out from the sides but
it<00:02:58.060> gives<00:02:58.209> some<00:02:58.390> space<00:02:58.660> down<00:02:58.959> there<00:02:59.010> and<00:03:00.010> I'm

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
it gives some space down there and I'm

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.229 
it gives some space down there and I'm
going<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.310> show<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.519> how<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.510> transplant<00:03:03.239> one

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
going to show you how to transplant one

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.440 
going to show you how to transplant one
of<00:03:04.359> them<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:05.349> pretty<00:03:05.620> simple<00:03:06.209> drop<00:03:07.209> in

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
of them it's pretty simple drop in

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.729 
of them it's pretty simple drop in
enough<00:03:08.140> soil<00:03:08.440> press<00:03:09.099> it<00:03:09.280> down<00:03:10.440> maybe<00:03:11.440> get

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
enough soil press it down maybe get

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.009 
enough soil press it down maybe get
about<00:03:11.920> an<00:03:12.099> inch

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
about an inch

don't<00:03:18.040> have<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.400> plant<00:03:18.669> it<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.989> you

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
don't have to plant it like that you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.009 
don't have to plant it like that you
want<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.130> gently<00:03:22.500> break<00:03:23.500> up<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.859> system<00:03:25.019> break

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
want to gently break up the system break

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.550 
want to gently break up the system break
up<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.380> sides<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.519> other<00:03:28.480> roots<00:03:29.440> look

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
up the sides and this other roots look

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.129 
up the sides and this other roots look
like<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:29.859> when<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.099> sit<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.489> down<00:03:31.139> they're

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
like that when you sit it down they're

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.270 
like that when you sit it down they're
going<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.380> be<00:03:32.440> pointing<00:03:32.799> in<00:03:32.859> every<00:03:33.099> direction

near<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.900> don't<00:05:02.110> overdo<00:05:02.530> it

a<00:05:18.490> little<00:05:18.520> bit<00:05:18.819> harder<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:19.300> hopefully<00:05:19.900> this

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
a little bit harder so hopefully this

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.260 
a little bit harder so hopefully this
gives<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.349> an<00:05:20.409> idea<00:05:20.560> of<00:05:21.129> when<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:21.699> transplant
