00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
see a lot of size difference this may

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160 
see a lot of size difference this may
seem<00:03:14.260> very<00:03:14.530> big<00:03:15.100> for<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.060> bridge<00:03:16.330> camera<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.959> may

it's<00:03:19.900> not<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.170> DSLR<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.190> means<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.550> it's

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
it's not a DSLR so it means that it's

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.509 
it's not a DSLR so it means that it's
not<00:03:21.880> going<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.390> be<00:03:22.480> as<00:03:22.720> big<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.500> it's<00:03:23.709> also<00:03:23.980> not

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
not going to be as big and it's also not

that you cannot unscrew it and you

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.970 
that you cannot unscrew it and you
cannot<00:03:34.150> wind<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.840> up<00:03:34.930> either<00:03:35.170> you've<00:03:35.620> got<00:03:35.830> to
