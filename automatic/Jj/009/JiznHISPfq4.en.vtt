00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.566
- HEY, LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR CUTE DOGS,

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.866
'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH THEM.

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.866
- I AM.

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.933
- YOU TAKE LOTS OF PICTURES
OF THEM.

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.466
- I LOVE THEM SO MUCH.
- AND...

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.000
- THEY'RE THE CUTEST.
- DO THEY COME TO WORK WITH YOU?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.233
- THEY DO. THEY DO.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:10.266
THEY'RE, UM...

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.633
audience: AWW.
- THEY'RE JUST DELIGHTFUL.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:12.800
- THEY'RE ADORABLE.
- YEAH.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.033
THAT'S THEM AT WORK, ACTUALLY.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.700
THEY'RE SNUGGLING
WITH MY BLANKET.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.166
IT WAS COLD THAT DAY.

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.333
- THAT'S SO CUTE.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.966
DID THEY WARN YOU
ABOUT THE EARTHQUAKE?

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.566
BECAUSE USUALLY--NO?
- NO.

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.566
[laughter]

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.566
NO. YEAH--

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.800
I'M SURE YOU WERE THINKING
THAT ANIMALS

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.033
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PSYCHIC.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.466
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT...
- EVERYONE THINKS THAT.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.000
- OR THINKS THAT, AND, UM,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.166
IT'S NOT TRUE WITH MY DOGS.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.733
THEY'RE NOT PSYCHIC OR GOOD
AT PREDICTING EARTHQUAKES,

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.800
'CAUSE THEY WERE LIKE--
I WOKE UP DURING THAT EARTHQUAKE

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND, LIKE--

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.433
'CAUSE IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
A BANG,

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.966
AND I WOKE UP, AND I THOUGHT DOT
HAD JUMPED OFF THE BED

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.566
'CAUSE SHE'S A LITTLE BIT--

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.333
SHE SOMETIMES DOES STUFF
LIKE THAT.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.400
[laughter]

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.100
AND I LOOK UP,
AND I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.300
IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE."

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.633
AND I LOOK AT THEM,
AND THEY'RE LIKE...

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:55.300
[laughter]

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.100
LIKE FUR, YOU KNOW,
LIKE BED FUR,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.633
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY, LIKE,
ARE SLEEPING...

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.366
- RIGHT, FLATTENED DOWN.
- AND THEIR FUR, LIKE--

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.400
YEAH, YEAH, IT'S LIKE BED HEAD
BUT FUR--FOR FUR.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.633
- LIKE HAT--YEAH.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:05.266
- HAT...
- HAT, YEAH, HAT HAIR.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.500
- HAT, HAT, FUR.
- HAT, HAIR, HEAD, FUR.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.600
BUT MAYBE THEY DON'T
WANT TO WARN YOU

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.933
BECAUSE YOU DRESS THEM
IN LITTLE RAINCOATS

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.933
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.166
MAYBE--
MAYBE THEY'RE ANGRY WITH YOU

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.466
THAT YOU PUT CLOTHES ON THEM.

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.500
- OH, IT COULD BE.
THAT IS A...

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.533
- IS THAT NECESSARY?

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.533
- IT'S A DEBATE
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.533
HE--
[giggles]

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.900
HE--HE THINKS
THEY SHOULDN'T WEAR CLOTHES,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.466
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.966
- YEAH.
- SO...

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.133
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW?

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.833
- LOOK, HE--
- THAT WAS A HALLOWEEN COSTUME.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.400
I REALLY HONESTLY
ONLY DID THAT FOR THE PHOTO,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400
AND THEN I TOOK IT OFF.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.933
SHE REALLY DID NOT LIKE THAT.
- NO, LOOK AT HER.

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.266
SHE IS SO EMBARRASSED.
IF SHE COULD--

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.333
[laughter]

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.766
SHE CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU'RE PHOTOGRAPHING HER.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.933
- THEY LIKE THE TRENCH COATS,
THOUGH.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.500
THEY HAVE TRENCH COATS,
AND THEY DO LIKE THOSE.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
- I DO AGREE WITH THAT.
THEY DO LIKE A TRENCH COAT.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.266
OUR DOG WEARS A TRENCH COAT,

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.833
AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I PUT ON IT.

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:50.500
- THE--THEY SORT OF LIKE
THE GENDER-NEUTRAL THINGS.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.866
- YES.
- THEY'RE NOT INTO, LIKE--

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:54.700
IF YOU TRY--IF I TRIED TO PUT
SOME, LIKE, GIRLY STUFF ON THEM,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.766
THEY--THEY WOULDN'T BE...

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.266
- SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU BOUGHT
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLOTHES

00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.666
TO TRY ON THE DOG.

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.200
- MAYBE I HAVE.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.000
[laughter]
