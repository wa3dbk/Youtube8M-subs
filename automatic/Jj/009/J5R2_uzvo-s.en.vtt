00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 so even if today fink sunday is it 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.350
 There are things that leave 1 no rest 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.040
 most of them now know that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.509
 new drywall screw 1 10.8 volt 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.790
 I just got that from 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.680
 my dealer borrowed at times 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.869
 a little something to test and something for you 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.949
 to show 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.600
 On the other hand, you see the 18 volt brother 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.060
 These devices differ 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.439
 not at all down here 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.300
 the 10 8 is a bit thicker 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.700
 behind it is under 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.260
 other the circuit board for the state of charge 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.190
 display the batteries below of course one 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.579
 big difference 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.820
 18 volts against 10 8 volts what 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.550
 the two devices are still different 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.940
 holder the 18 I can with and without 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:56.190
 always 55 without problems to belt hangs 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.020
 that's not the case with the 10 8 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.660
 I thought you would do it 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.730
 something special and just constructed 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 times a holder of the later 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.290
 clean it is retrofittable 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.720
 is without the device to change insight 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.250
 For this device he would be like that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.030
 look like that is one of those times 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.290
 half hour record blessing yes 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 File a little bit of sanding 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.840
 bit boring and you see 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.390
 he can remember the original 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.409
 fixing screws for the gearbox 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.150
 I'll fix myself there too 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.799
 no thoughts that in a wise way 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.290
 the helicopter can harm because of the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.259
 Women are long enough and if one 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.299
 how extreme it is then it is 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.470
 it just leads to a defect but 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.390
 I do not believe it 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.290
 I've built it so he's here 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.570
 Not so much one considers that of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.549
 At the front you can see how it rounds something 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.490
 unlike here so exactly opposite 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.570
 are we still a little change on me 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.360
 she would have to stay here a bit more 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.810
 could sleep on the left and right 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.729
 to be assembled 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.070
 Right now he is only for right-handed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:05.700
 I did not think the whole thing up here as well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.439
 for example, with the big screws 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.560
 at network screwdrivers 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.350
 case is there is up has a whole 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.670
 special reason 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.830
 if i put the big screw on one 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.030
 Lucky hang should be the cable 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.130
 leave a bit otherwise I prevent 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.170
 I was constantly in the cable so it was fine 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.090
 At that time I also thought of these 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.780
 it just as honestly not lacking can 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.820
 you show times you think it looks like this 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.520
 I do not think he's wonderful here 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.370
 he hangs wonderfully at the side 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.290
 the whole thing with this is it 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.740
 of course, but I can just me 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.080
 also not imposed in the cable only 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.310
 disadvantages i can not work freely 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.680
 it works in this case too 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.810
 relatively straight that is the front screw 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:03.170
 turn on the plate, for example, push up and work 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:06.970
 the whole also with mounted 55 sees 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.710
 you can also easily hook it up 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.100
 I have to take it out somewhere 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.210
 have both hands free 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.210
 that was it and I would say
