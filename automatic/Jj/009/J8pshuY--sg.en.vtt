first learned is that the designated
marksman<00:00:21.990> rifles<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.560> finally<00:00:23.279> seeing<00:00:23.580> a

marksman rifles are finally seeing a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.820 
marksman rifles are finally seeing a
buff<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.869> gonna<00:00:24.960> come<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.380> parts<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
buff it's gonna come in two parts the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.529 
buff it's gonna come in two parts the
first<00:00:25.859> part<00:00:26.369> being<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.390> their

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
first part being that all of their

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.060 
first part being that all of their
damages<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.439> increased<00:00:28.859> at

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
damages are going to be increased at

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.980 
damages are going to be increased at
long-range<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.240> instead<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> having<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> take

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
long-range so instead of having to take

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
long-range so instead of having to take
out<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.349> target<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.920> four<00:00:32.579> bullets<00:00:32.969> at<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
out your target in four bullets at a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
out your target in four bullets at a
distance<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.960> only<00:00:34.110> gonna<00:00:34.290> require<00:00:34.770> three

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
distance it's only gonna require three

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
distance it's only gonna require three
that<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.149> HUGE<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.960> second<00:00:37.410> part

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that is that is HUGE the second part

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
that is that is HUGE the second part
being<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> recoils<00:00:39.629> are

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
being is that all of the recoils are

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.380 
being is that all of the recoils are
going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.500> decreased<00:00:41.190> across<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.149> board

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
going to be decreased across the board

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
going to be decreased across the board
it<00:00:42.899> will<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.079> slightly<00:00:43.500> different<00:00:43.770> depending

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it will be slightly different depending

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
it will be slightly different depending
on<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:44.940> using<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.570> it's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
on which one you're using I think it's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.000 
on which one you're using I think it's
also<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.110> based<00:00:46.289> off<00:00:46.469> their<00:00:46.800> rate<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
also going to be based off their rate of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.700 
also going to be based off their rate of
fire<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.850> across<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.480> board<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.079> recoil<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
fire but across the board the recoil of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
fire but across the board the recoil of
these<00:00:49.950> weapons<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.000> reduced<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
these weapons is going to be reduced and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
these weapons is going to be reduced and
so<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> sounds<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> they're

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so what it sounds like is that they're

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.360 
so what it sounds like is that they're
not<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> increase<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.960> overall<00:00:55.370> damage

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
not going to increase the overall damage

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.740 
not going to increase the overall damage
of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> weapons<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.360> you're<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.600> going

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
of the weapons and so you're not going

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
of the weapons and so you're not going
to<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.870> able<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.199> those<00:00:58.320> one-shot<00:00:58.859> kills

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to be able to get those one-shot kills

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.130 
to be able to get those one-shot kills
like<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.609> back<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.969> battlefield<00:01:00.329> 3<00:01:00.359> but

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
like you would back in battlefield 3 but

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
like you would back in battlefield 3 but
just<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> fact<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.250> use<00:01:03.180> these

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
just the fact that you can now use these

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.969 
just the fact that you can now use these
weapons<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> distance<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> don't<00:01:04.920> have

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
weapons at a distance and you don't have

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
weapons at a distance and you don't have
to<00:01:05.070> put<00:01:05.220> four<00:01:05.489> bolts<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.090> enemy<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
to put four bolts in your enemy and the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390 
to put four bolts in your enemy and the
recoil<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.890> reduced

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
recoil is going to be reduced

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
recoil is going to be reduced
it<00:01:08.460> finally<00:01:09.090> sounds<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> designated

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it finally sounds like the designated

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
it finally sounds like the designated
marksman<00:01:10.740> rifle<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.180> weapon

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
marksman rifle is going to be a weapon

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120 
marksman rifle is going to be a weapon
of<00:01:12.689> choice<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:13.260> you're<00:01:13.380> trying<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.799> take<00:01:13.950> out

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
of choice when you're trying to take out

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.130 
of choice when you're trying to take out
people<00:01:14.310> at<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> distance<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.600> exactly

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
people at a distance which is exactly

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
people at a distance which is exactly
what<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.590> made<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
what it's made for and so that is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.289 
what it's made for and so that is
amazing<00:01:18.600> news<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:20.009> pump-action<00:01:20.580> shotguns

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
amazing news the pump-action shotguns

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.240 
amazing news the pump-action shotguns
are<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.630> receiving<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.350> buff<00:01:22.590> where<00:01:22.950> their

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
are also receiving a buff where their

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
are also receiving a buff where their
aim<00:01:23.490> down<00:01:23.790> sight<00:01:24.180> accuracy<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.890> be

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
aim down sight accuracy is going to be

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.210 
aim down sight accuracy is going to be
doubled<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.590> significant<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.710> dice<00:01:29.070> is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
doubled that is significant and dice is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.950 
doubled that is significant and dice is
justification<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:29.970> doing<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
justification for doing this is that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960 
justification for doing this is that
because<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.100> any<00:01:32.310> barrel

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
because there are not any barrel

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
because there are not any barrel
attachments<00:01:33.689> or<00:01:33.869> grips<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.829> slap

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
attachments or grips that you can slap

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
attachments or grips that you can slap
on<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.880> customization<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> weapons

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
on to the customization of the weapons

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.230 
on to the customization of the weapons
themselves<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.280> isn't<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.610> any<00:01:38.820> way<00:01:39.000> for

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
themselves there isn't way any way for

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.399 
themselves there isn't way any way for
you<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> increase<00:01:39.659> their<00:01:39.990> accuracy

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you to increase their accuracy

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.469 
you to increase their accuracy
especially<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.460> you're<00:01:41.579> using<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.150> slug

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
especially when you're using the slug

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
especially when you're using the slug
rounds<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.710> dice<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.009> trying<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> do

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
rounds and so what dice is trying to do

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
rounds and so what dice is trying to do
here<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.509> using<00:01:45.930> slug

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
here is that when you are using slug

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.050 
here is that when you are using slug
rounds<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> pump-action<00:01:47.369> shotguns

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
rounds with the pump-action shotguns

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
rounds with the pump-action shotguns
they<00:01:48.600> want<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> increase<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> effectiveness

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they want to increase the effectiveness

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.830 
they want to increase the effectiveness
of<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.340> where<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:51.000> pointing<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.630> your

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
of it so where you're pointing at your

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.530 
of it so where you're pointing at your
enemy<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.770> basically<00:01:53.670> where<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> bullet

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
enemy that's basically where the bullet

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
enemy that's basically where the bullet
is<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.079> land<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.100> while<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> don't

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
is going to land and so while I don't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
is going to land and so while I don't
use<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.479> weapons<00:01:57.869> all<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.290> often<00:01:58.469> I'm

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
use these weapons all that often I'm

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.830 
use these weapons all that often I'm
just<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> shotgun<00:01:59.460> user<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.540> everyone

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
just not a shotgun user for everyone

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
just not a shotgun user for everyone
else<00:02:00.990> out<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.590> enjoys<00:02:01.979> these<00:02:02.310> setups

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
else out there that enjoys these setups

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.399 
else out there that enjoys these setups
this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.450> make<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.780> life<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.140> lot

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
this is going to make your life a lot

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.859 
this is going to make your life a lot
easier<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:05.610> thing<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.210> did<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.630> me<00:02:06.750> by

easier one thing that did take me by
surprise<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:08.099> dice<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> be

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
surprise is that dice is going to be

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.110 
surprise is that dice is going to be
changing<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.899> hipfire<00:02:10.530> accuracy<00:02:10.979> transition

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
changing the hipfire accuracy transition

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240 
changing the hipfire accuracy transition
when<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.629> are<00:02:12.870> hipfiring<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.159> then

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
when you are hipfiring and then

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.610 
when you are hipfiring and then
immediately<00:02:14.459> aiming<00:02:15.090> down<00:02:15.269> sight<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> don't

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
immediately aiming down sight so I don't

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.960 
immediately aiming down sight so I don't
know<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.980> are<00:02:17.129> aware<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.879> if

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
know if you are aware of this but if

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.399 
know if you are aware of this but if
you're<00:02:18.090> using<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.510> light<00:02:18.690> machine<00:02:18.870> gun<00:02:19.230> or

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
you're using a light machine gun or

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.830 
you're using a light machine gun or
really<00:02:20.099> any<00:02:20.340> weapon<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.879> game<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
really any weapon in the game if you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.259 
really any weapon in the game if you
start<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.739> engagement<00:02:23.310> by<00:02:23.400> hip<00:02:23.670> firing<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
start the engagement by hip firing and

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.149 
start the engagement by hip firing and
then<00:02:24.360> immediately<00:02:24.569> aim<00:02:25.019> down<00:02:25.260> sight<00:02:25.620> it's

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
then immediately aim down sight it's

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.920 
then immediately aim down sight it's
still<00:02:26.459> as<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.819> your<00:02:27.000> hip<00:02:27.150> firing<00:02:27.480> your<00:02:27.599> bullets

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
still as if your hip firing your bullets

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.600 
still as if your hip firing your bullets
are<00:02:28.049> flying<00:02:28.290> everywhere<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:29.010> don't<00:02:29.190> get<00:02:29.340> any

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
are flying everywhere you don't get any

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.149 
are flying everywhere you don't get any
aim<00:02:29.909> down<00:02:30.150> sight<00:02:30.480> accuracy<00:02:31.110> bonus<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.709> so

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
aim down sight accuracy bonus and so

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.920 
aim down sight accuracy bonus and so
what<00:02:32.400> dice<00:02:32.549> is<00:02:32.670> gonna<00:02:32.819> do<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.750> do

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
what dice is gonna do is that if you do

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.780 
what dice is gonna do is that if you do
start<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.379> fire<00:02:34.590> fight<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:35.250> initiate<00:02:35.760> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
start a fire fight and you initiate it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.460 
start a fire fight and you initiate it
by<00:02:36.060> hip<00:02:36.299> firing<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.720> then<00:02:36.810> immediately<00:02:37.019> aim

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
by hip firing and then immediately aim

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.100 
by hip firing and then immediately aim
down<00:02:37.709> sight<00:02:38.099> you<00:02:38.670> will<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.540> an<00:02:39.750> aim<00:02:39.930> down

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
down sight you will now get an aim down

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.559 
down sight you will now get an aim down
sight<00:02:40.440> bonus<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:41.250> will<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.849> wars<00:02:42.060> bonus

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
sight bonus it will be the wars bonus

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.880 
sight bonus it will be the wars bonus
that<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.900> weapon<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.349> have<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.769> will

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that that weapon can have so will

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.440 
that that weapon can have so will
essentially<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.000> kind<00:02:45.420> of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
essentially be as if you just kind of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.910 
essentially be as if you just kind of
held<00:02:45.660> down<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.840> trigger<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.560> your<00:02:46.739> light

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
machine gun for five seconds bullets are

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.300 
machine gun for five seconds bullets are
still<00:02:49.019> gonna<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.319> flying<00:02:49.530> all<00:02:49.739> over<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.069> place

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
still gonna be flying all over the place

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.819 
still gonna be flying all over the place
but<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:50.970> won't<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.810> bad<00:02:52.079> as<00:02:52.140> if<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.739> were

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
another thing that took me by surprise

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.039 
another thing that took me by surprise
is<00:03:02.609> that<00:03:02.640> dice<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.150> gonna<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.569> making<00:03:03.690> some

is that dice is gonna be making some

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.809 
is that dice is gonna be making some
small<00:03:04.349> tweaks<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.859> a<00:03:04.890> couple<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.400> pistols

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
small tweaks to a couple of the pistols

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.330 
small tweaks to a couple of the pistols
by<00:03:06.299> increasing<00:03:07.079> their<00:03:07.200> damage<00:03:07.620> slightly<00:03:08.159> this

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
by increasing their damage slightly this

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.830 
by increasing their damage slightly this
includes<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.000> m1911<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.260> qsz<00:03:10.829> 92<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.239> FN<00:03:12.629> 57

includes the m1911 the qsz 92 the FN 57

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.449 
includes the m1911 the qsz 92 the FN 57
the<00:03:13.680> cz<00:03:14.340> 75<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.329> compact<00:03:15.840> 45<00:03:16.139> all<00:03:17.069> of

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
the cz 75 and the compact 45 all of

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.759 
the cz 75 and the compact 45 all of
these<00:03:17.639> pistols<00:03:18.090> either<00:03:18.359> do<00:03:18.540> 34<00:03:19.109> damage<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.530> shot

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
these pistols either do 34 damage a shot

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.220 
these pistols either do 34 damage a shot

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
up close or 20 damage shot up close and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.259 
up close or 20 damage shot up close and
the<00:03:22.739> reason<00:03:23.069> why<00:03:23.220> dice<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.669> doing<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.090> is

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
the reason why dice is doing this is

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.420 
the reason why dice is doing this is
that<00:03:24.690> because<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.380> defensive<00:03:26.069> field<00:03:26.220> upgrade

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
that because the defensive field upgrade

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.640 
that because the defensive field upgrade
path<00:03:26.849> is<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.810> game<00:03:28.019> right<00:03:28.230> now<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.590> you

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
path is in the game right now and you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.979 
path is in the game right now and you
can<00:03:28.799> get<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.099> armor<00:03:29.549> as<00:03:29.730> one<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.660> your

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
can get that armor as one of the your

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.409 
can get that armor as one of the your
first<00:03:31.290> unlocks<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:32.099> makes<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.879> so<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.090> it

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
first unlocks it makes it so that it

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.360 
first unlocks it makes it so that it
requires<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:34.200> extra<00:03:34.590> bullet<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:35.069> take<00:03:35.220> out

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
requires one extra bullet to take out

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.520 
requires one extra bullet to take out
your<00:03:35.489> enemy<00:03:35.760> when<00:03:36.030> using<00:03:36.359> these<00:03:36.900> weapons<00:03:37.349> and

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
your enemy when using these weapons and

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.409 
your enemy when using these weapons and
so<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.919> reason<00:03:38.250> why<00:03:38.370> dice<00:03:38.669> is<00:03:38.940> putting<00:03:39.329> a

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
so the reason why dice is putting a

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.300 
so the reason why dice is putting a
little<00:03:39.510> extra<00:03:39.780> damage<00:03:40.139> in<00:03:40.410> there<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:41.190> if

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
little extra damage in there is that if

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.740 
little extra damage in there is that if
you<00:03:41.459> are<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:41.819> close<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.209> personal<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.629> your

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
you are up close and personal in your

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.140 
you are up close and personal in your
using<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.109> m1911<00:03:44.040> normally<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.940> would<00:03:45.060> only

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
using the m1911 normally it would only

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.699 
using the m1911 normally it would only
take<00:03:45.480> three<00:03:45.720> bullets<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.109> trap<00:03:46.290> your<00:03:46.440> enemy

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
take three bullets to trap your enemy

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.800 
take three bullets to trap your enemy
but<00:03:46.859> if<00:03:47.010> they<00:03:47.129> are<00:03:47.280> using<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.150> armor

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
but if they are using the the armor

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.289 
but if they are using the the armor
field<00:03:49.169> upgrade<00:03:49.500> path<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:50.190> would<00:03:50.400> require<00:03:50.549> four

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
field upgrade path it would require four

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.119 
field upgrade path it would require four
so<00:03:51.480> that's<00:03:51.629> a<00:03:51.750> pretty<00:03:51.989> big<00:03:52.230> nerf<00:03:52.560> if<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.949> are

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
so that's a pretty big nerf if you are

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.430 
so that's a pretty big nerf if you are
using<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.609> pistol<00:03:54.090> same<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.900> true<00:03:55.079> if<00:03:55.319> you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
using that pistol same is true if you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.710 
using that pistol same is true if you
were<00:03:55.470> using<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.889> pistol<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.250> did<00:03:56.910> 20<00:03:57.329> damage<00:03:57.629> a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
were using a pistol that did 20 damage a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.689 
were using a pistol that did 20 damage a
shot<00:03:57.989> because<00:03:58.290> if<00:03:58.410> they<00:03:58.560> were<00:03:58.620> using<00:03:59.069> the

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
shot because if they were using the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.879 
shot because if they were using the
defensive<00:04:00.329> field<00:04:00.449> upgrade<00:04:00.660> path<00:04:01.079> instead<00:04:01.799> of

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
defensive field upgrade path instead of

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.710 
defensive field upgrade path instead of
requiring<00:04:02.250> five<00:04:02.669> ball<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.120> drop<00:04:03.329> them<00:04:03.540> from

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
requiring five ball to drop them from

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.470 
requiring five ball to drop them from
100<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.139> zero<00:04:04.349> it<00:04:04.530> would<00:04:04.620> now<00:04:04.799> require<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:06.060> six

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
100 to zero it would now require you six

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.330 
100 to zero it would now require you six
and<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:06.989> what<00:04:07.169> it<00:04:07.260> sounds<00:04:07.590> like<00:04:07.620> dice<00:04:07.949> wants<00:04:08.280> to

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
and so what it sounds like dice wants to

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.640 
and so what it sounds like dice wants to
do<00:04:08.459> here<00:04:08.699> is<00:04:08.879> that<00:04:09.299> while<00:04:09.569> they<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.379> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
do here is that while they like the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.470 
do here is that while they like the
defensive<00:04:11.160> field<00:04:11.340> upgrade<00:04:11.549> path<00:04:12.030> they<00:04:12.269> like

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
defensive field upgrade path they like

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.729 
defensive field upgrade path they like
the<00:04:12.660> armor<00:04:12.959> because<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.319> makes<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.590> more

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the armor because it makes you more

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.050 
the armor because it makes you more
effective<00:04:14.220> against<00:04:14.549> going<00:04:14.760> against

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
effective against going against

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.819 
effective against going against
aggressive<00:04:15.359> recons<00:04:15.870> using<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.289> bolt<00:04:16.440> action

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
aggressive recons using the bolt action

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.680 
aggressive recons using the bolt action
rifles<00:04:17.250> they<00:04:17.789> don't<00:04:17.970> want<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.209> make<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.449> so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
rifles they don't want to make it so

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.630 
rifles they don't want to make it so
that<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.260> an<00:04:19.380> extra<00:04:19.799> bullet<00:04:20.130> when<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.430> are

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
that it's an extra bullet when you are

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.520 
that it's an extra bullet when you are
using

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
using

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.860 
using
one<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.799> these<00:04:21.920> weapons<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:22.670> I<00:04:22.880> do<00:04:23.180> agree

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
one of these weapons and so I do agree

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.140 
one of these weapons and so I do agree
with<00:04:24.200> this<00:04:24.560> slight<00:04:25.010> tweak<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.670> couple<00:04:26.000> of

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
with this slight tweak to a couple of

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.420 
with this slight tweak to a couple of
these<00:04:26.330> weapons<00:04:26.590> players<00:04:27.590> who<00:04:27.770> enjoy<00:04:27.800> using

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
these weapons players who enjoy using

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.520 
these weapons players who enjoy using
the<00:04:28.790> Magnum<00:04:29.210> or<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.600> Rex<00:04:29.900> there<00:04:30.169> probably

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
the Magnum or the Rex there probably

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.379 
the Magnum or the Rex there probably
isn't<00:04:30.740> many<00:04:31.070> out<00:04:31.280> there<00:04:31.310> but<00:04:31.730> if<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.120> enjoyed

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
isn't many out there but if you enjoyed

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.510 
isn't many out there but if you enjoyed
using<00:04:32.810> these<00:04:33.110> weapons<00:04:33.380> back<00:04:33.710> in<00:04:33.889> Pataca<00:04:34.220> three

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
using these weapons back in Pataca three

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.610 
using these weapons back in Pataca three
because<00:04:34.820> they<00:04:34.970> were<00:04:35.030> flat-out<00:04:35.450> amazing<00:04:35.870> they

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
because they were flat-out amazing they

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.590 
because they were flat-out amazing they
are<00:04:36.650> finally<00:04:37.160> reducing<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:38.150> atrocious

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
are finally reducing that atrocious

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.720 
are finally reducing that atrocious
delay<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.470> plagues<00:04:39.830> both<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.370> these<00:04:40.460> weapons

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
delay that plagues both of these weapons

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.760 
delay that plagues both of these weapons
so<00:04:41.450> if<00:04:41.570> you've<00:04:41.690> ever<00:04:41.750> tried<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.169> use<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
so if you've ever tried to use the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.740 
so if you've ever tried to use the
Magnum<00:04:43.190> you'll<00:04:43.400> know<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.940> when<00:04:44.150> you<00:04:44.419> press

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
Magnum you'll know that when you press

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.659 
Magnum you'll know that when you press
the<00:04:44.960> trigger<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.560> takes<00:04:46.010> a<00:04:46.130> good<00:04:46.250> half<00:04:46.520> a

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
the trigger it takes a good half a

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.000 
the trigger it takes a good half a
second<00:04:47.090> for<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.660> bullet<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.930> fly<00:04:48.290> out<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:48.650> the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
second for the bullet to fly out of the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.970 
second for the bullet to fly out of the
barrel<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.790> that<00:04:50.180> bad<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.350> while<00:04:51.650> die

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
barrel it is that bad and so while die

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.590 
barrel it is that bad and so while die
still<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.550> probably<00:04:52.880> gonna<00:04:53.060> have<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.270> delay

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
still is probably gonna have a delay

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.850 
still is probably gonna have a delay
because<00:04:53.930> they<00:04:54.080> want<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.380> make<00:04:54.530> it<00:04:54.650> feel

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
because they want to make it feel

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.650 
because they want to make it feel
realistic<00:04:55.400> because<00:04:55.910> apparently<00:04:56.240> that's<00:04:56.480> how

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
realistic because apparently that's how

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.720 
realistic because apparently that's how

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
life the delay is going to be reduced

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.780 
life the delay is going to be reduced
significantly<00:05:02.260> we<00:05:03.260> don't<00:05:03.650> know<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.220> exact

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570

my fingers I'm crossing my fingers that
it's<00:05:10.669> almost<00:05:10.850> gonna<00:05:11.090> be<00:05:11.150> non-existent

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
it's almost gonna be non-existent

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.110 
it's almost gonna be non-existent
because<00:05:11.960> if<00:05:12.290> I<00:05:12.440> want<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.919> use<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.370> pistol<00:05:13.790> or<00:05:13.880> any

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.730 
because if I want to use a pistol or any

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
any delay it messes with my mind I just

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.150 
any delay it messes with my mind I just
I<00:05:20.180> can't<00:05:20.240> do<00:05:20.570> well<00:05:20.780> with<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.260> so<00:05:21.740> if<00:05:21.950> the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
I can't do well with it and so if the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.710 
I can't do well with it and so if the
weapon<00:05:22.490> wants<00:05:22.760> to<00:05:22.880> be<00:05:22.970> competitive<00:05:23.120> and<00:05:23.690> I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
weapon wants to be competitive and I

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.790 
weapon wants to be competitive and I
understand<00:05:24.110> that<00:05:24.229> they<00:05:24.380> want<00:05:24.590> to<00:05:24.650> be

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
understand that they want to be

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.890 
understand that they want to be
authentic<00:05:25.610> that's<00:05:25.880> important<00:05:26.630> for<00:05:26.780> the

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
authentic that's important for the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.990 
authentic that's important for the
Battlefield<00:05:27.290> franchise<00:05:27.350> I<00:05:27.890> get<00:05:28.100> that<00:05:28.310> but<00:05:28.910> if

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
Battlefield franchise I get that but if

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.850 
Battlefield franchise I get that but if
they<00:05:29.120> want<00:05:29.360> people<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.810> use<00:05:30.050> this<00:05:30.260> weapon<00:05:30.470> the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
they want people to use this weapon the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.290 
they want people to use this weapon the
delay<00:05:31.190> needs<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.640> be<00:05:31.760> almost<00:05:31.970> non-existent

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
delay needs to be almost non-existent

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.480 
delay needs to be almost non-existent
because<00:05:33.020> at<00:05:33.169> least<00:05:33.290> for<00:05:33.560> me<00:05:33.650> if<00:05:33.860> it's<00:05:34.040> still<00:05:34.280> in

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
because at least for me if it's still in

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.130 
because at least for me if it's still in
there<00:05:34.700> and<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:35.000> can<00:05:35.180> feel<00:05:35.390> it<00:05:35.600> then<00:05:35.930> I'm<00:05:36.050> just

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
there and I can feel it then I'm just

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.700 
there and I can feel it then I'm just
gonna<00:05:36.260> stick<00:05:36.560> with<00:05:36.620> my<00:05:36.950> trusty<00:05:37.370> mp443

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
gonna stick with my trusty mp443

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.230 
gonna stick with my trusty mp443
surprisingly<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:40.100> heavy<00:05:40.370> barrel<00:05:40.580> is<00:05:40.850> also

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
surprisingly the heavy barrel is also

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.810 
surprisingly the heavy barrel is also
receiving<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:42.200> full<00:05:42.530> buff<00:05:42.800> treatment<00:05:43.340> where

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
receiving the full buff treatment where

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.090 
receiving the full buff treatment where
you<00:05:44.030> will<00:05:44.180> now<00:05:44.330> get<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:45.110> bonus<00:05:45.440> accuracy<00:05:45.919> that

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
you will now get the bonus accuracy that

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.800 
you will now get the bonus accuracy that
comes<00:05:46.310> along<00:05:46.550> with<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.789> attachments<00:05:47.270> while

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
comes along with the attachments while

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.630 
comes along with the attachments while

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
on the move it's going to be slightly

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.340 
on the move it's going to be slightly
reduced<00:05:50.060> than<00:05:50.300> compared<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:50.840> you<00:05:50.930> if<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.229> were

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
reduced than compared to you if you were

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.390 
reduced than compared to you if you were
just<00:05:51.380> standing<00:05:51.770> still<00:05:52.100> and<00:05:52.340> that

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
just standing still and that

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.730 
just standing still and that
aim-down-sight<00:05:53.210> accuracy<00:05:53.840> but<00:05:54.470> what<00:05:54.650> it

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
aim-down-sight accuracy but what it

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.110 
aim-down-sight accuracy but what it
sounds<00:05:55.100> like<00:05:55.130> dice<00:05:55.400> is<00:05:55.580> doing<00:05:55.880> is<00:05:56.000> that

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
sounds like dice is doing is that

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.340 
sounds like dice is doing is that
they're<00:05:56.210> trying<00:05:56.450> to<00:05:56.570> make<00:05:56.750> this<00:05:56.900> a<00:05:57.140> more

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
they're trying to make this a more

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.250 
they're trying to make this a more
competitive<00:05:58.270> attachment<00:05:59.270> for<00:05:59.479> the<00:05:59.930> barrel

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
competitive attachment for the barrel

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.440 
competitive attachment for the barrel
slide<00:06:00.530> right<00:06:01.190> now<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.700> know<00:06:01.760> some<00:06:02.090> people<00:06:02.210> will

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
slide right now I know some people will

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.790 
slide right now I know some people will
claim<00:06:02.660> that<00:06:02.870> it's<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.080> best<00:06:03.260> attachment<00:06:03.740> out

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
claim that it's the best attachment out

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.260 
claim that it's the best attachment out
there<00:06:03.979> because<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.340> increases<00:06:04.640> your<00:06:04.760> accuracy

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
there because it increases your accuracy

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.440 
there because it increases your accuracy
but<00:06:05.960> that<00:06:06.140> 50%<00:06:06.500> increase<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.520> your<00:06:07.550> recoil<00:06:08.150> is

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
but that 50% increase to your recoil is

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.080 
but that 50% increase to your recoil is
a<00:06:08.780> large<00:06:09.530> deterrent<00:06:10.039> for<00:06:10.310> most<00:06:10.550> players<00:06:10.850> they

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
a large deterrent for most players they

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.550 
a large deterrent for most players they
don't<00:06:11.270> want<00:06:11.450> to<00:06:11.570> deal<00:06:11.750> with<00:06:12.080> all<00:06:12.289> of<00:06:12.320> that

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
don't want to deal with all of that

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.170 
don't want to deal with all of that
recoil<00:06:12.950> bouncing<00:06:13.400> all<00:06:13.490> over<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.760> place<00:06:13.820> and

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
recoil bouncing all over the place and

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.969 
recoil bouncing all over the place and
while<00:06:14.479> yes<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:14.870> is<00:06:15.200> more<00:06:15.410> accurate<00:06:15.590> at<00:06:15.950> a

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
while yes it is more accurate at a

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.700 
while yes it is more accurate at a
distance<00:06:16.490> that<00:06:16.669> recoil<00:06:17.600> is<00:06:17.810> a<00:06:17.840> significant

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
distance that recoil is a significant

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.650 
distance that recoil is a significant
deterrent<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:19.520> so<00:06:19.789> I<00:06:19.820> don't<00:06:20.150> know<00:06:20.240> if<00:06:20.450> this<00:06:20.630> is

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
deterrent and so I don't know if this is

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.240 
deterrent and so I don't know if this is
going<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:20.990> be<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.169> keystone<00:06:21.680> to<00:06:21.860> make<00:06:22.070> it<00:06:22.160> a

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
going to be the keystone to make it a

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.010 
going to be the keystone to make it a
more<00:06:22.400> competitive<00:06:22.760> pick<00:06:23.240> with<00:06:23.510> all<00:06:23.690> of<00:06:23.870> the

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
more competitive pick with all of the

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.690 
more competitive pick with all of the
different<00:06:24.320> other<00:06:24.410> customization<00:06:25.250> options

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
different other customization options

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.969 
different other customization options
but<00:06:26.210> I<00:06:26.240> know<00:06:26.330> that<00:06:26.690> once<00:06:26.930> this<00:06:27.200> patch<00:06:27.410> launches

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
but I know that once this patch launches

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.680 
but I know that once this patch launches
I'll<00:06:28.400> give<00:06:28.610> it<00:06:28.700> a<00:06:28.729> try<00:06:28.880> I'll<00:06:29.120> see<00:06:29.330> if<00:06:29.479> this

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
I'll give it a try I'll see if this

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.159 
I'll give it a try I'll see if this
makes<00:06:29.960> it<00:06:30.200> a<00:06:30.380> more<00:06:30.860> viable<00:06:31.220> option<00:06:31.550> and<00:06:31.970> see<00:06:32.960> if

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
makes it a more viable option and see if

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:34.210 
makes it a more viable option and see if
this<00:06:33.409> is<00:06:33.440> the<00:06:33.860> buff

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
this is the buff

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.430 
this is the buff
needed<00:06:34.670> and<00:06:35.360> then<00:06:35.510> the<00:06:35.600> last<00:06:35.750> thing<00:06:36.020> that<00:06:36.050> I'm

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
needed and then the last thing that I'm

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.110 
needed and then the last thing that I'm
going<00:06:36.560> to<00:06:36.620> talk<00:06:36.770> about<00:06:36.950> today<00:06:37.280> is<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.790> the<00:06:37.970> EM

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
going to talk about today is that the EM

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.660 
going to talk about today is that the EM
tars<00:06:38.570> long<00:06:39.110> range<00:06:39.560> damage<00:06:39.950> is<00:06:40.280> going<00:06:40.490> to<00:06:40.580> be

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
tars long range damage is going to be

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.580 
tars long range damage is going to be
reduced<00:06:41.000> to<00:06:41.180> put<00:06:41.360> it<00:06:41.450> more<00:06:41.690> in<00:06:41.900> line<00:06:41.930> with<00:06:42.410> all

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
reduced to put it more in line with all

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.980 
reduced to put it more in line with all
of<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:42.920> other<00:06:43.070> carbines<00:06:43.610> I<00:06:43.940> realized<00:06:44.780> the

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
of the other carbines I realized the

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.200 
of the other carbines I realized the
mtar<00:06:45.410> is<00:06:45.440> very<00:06:45.890> popular<00:06:46.400> many<00:06:46.700> people<00:06:47.030> like<00:06:47.180> to

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
mtar is very popular many people like to

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.970 
mtar is very popular many people like to
use<00:06:47.330> it<00:06:47.540> and<00:06:47.840> I<00:06:47.870> know<00:06:47.960> people<00:06:48.110> some<00:06:48.530> people<00:06:48.800> are

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
use it and I know people some people are

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.710 
use it and I know people some people are
going<00:06:49.160> to<00:06:49.250> be<00:06:49.400> upset<00:06:49.670> with<00:06:49.850> this<00:06:49.940> change<00:06:50.210> but

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
going to be upset with this change but

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.180 
going to be upset with this change but
honestly<00:06:51.080> the<00:06:51.440> fact<00:06:51.650> that<00:06:51.920> it<00:06:52.040> was

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
honestly the fact that it was

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.830 
honestly the fact that it was
essentially<00:06:52.640> an<00:06:52.700> assault<00:06:53.000> rifle<00:06:53.060> that<00:06:53.330> anyone

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
essentially an assault rifle that anyone

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.450 
essentially an assault rifle that anyone
could<00:06:53.990> use<00:06:54.200> it<00:06:54.350> because<00:06:54.590> it<00:06:54.740> was<00:06:54.860> an<00:06:54.980> all<00:06:55.160> kit

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
could use it because it was an all kit

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.030 
could use it because it was an all kit
weapon<00:06:55.790> it<00:06:55.910> is<00:06:56.030> a<00:06:56.060> carbine<00:06:56.600> that<00:06:56.900> long<00:06:57.740> range

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
weapon it is a carbine that long range

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.210 
weapon it is a carbine that long range
damage<00:06:58.340> was<00:06:58.850> a<00:06:59.180> little<00:06:59.570> bit<00:06:59.720> too<00:06:59.960> good<00:06:59.990> I<00:07:00.530> still

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
damage was a little bit too good I still

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.740 
damage was a little bit too good I still
think<00:07:01.460> the<00:07:01.550> mtar<00:07:01.850> is<00:07:02.060> going<00:07:02.300> to<00:07:02.420> be<00:07:02.510> fantastic

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
think the mtar is going to be fantastic

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.630 
think the mtar is going to be fantastic
it's<00:07:03.410> still<00:07:03.560> gonna<00:07:03.740> dominate<00:07:03.950> up<00:07:04.400> close

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.640 
it's still gonna dominate up close

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.250 
it's still gonna dominate up close
because<00:07:04.940> it's<00:07:05.060> got<00:07:05.180> that<00:07:05.360> solid<00:07:05.630> rate<00:07:05.930> of<00:07:06.050> fire

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
because it's got that solid rate of fire

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.650 
because it's got that solid rate of fire
and<00:07:06.530> 25<00:07:07.010> damage<00:07:07.400> up<00:07:07.550> close<00:07:07.580> and<00:07:08.090> so<00:07:08.450> it<00:07:08.570> is

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
and 25 damage up close and so it is

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.930 
and 25 damage up close and so it is
going<00:07:08.870> to<00:07:08.990> still<00:07:09.230> be<00:07:09.260> an<00:07:09.620> amazing<00:07:10.280> carbine<00:07:10.730> of

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
going to still be an amazing carbine of

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.420 
going to still be an amazing carbine of
choice<00:07:11.210> it<00:07:11.450> just<00:07:11.930> won't<00:07:12.080> be<00:07:12.230> as<00:07:12.530> good<00:07:13.040> as<00:07:13.250> it

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
choice it just won't be as good as it

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.550 
choice it just won't be as good as it
previously<00:07:13.640> was<00:07:14.030> at<00:07:14.480> taking<00:07:14.720> people<00:07:15.140> out<00:07:15.290> at<00:07:15.530> a

previously was at taking people out at a

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.920 
previously was at taking people out at a
distance<00:07:16.130> but<00:07:16.820> those<00:07:17.030> are<00:07:17.240> all<00:07:17.390> the<00:07:17.420> port<00:07:17.840> and
