00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.569
 just stefan android pad here 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.059
 today we want to talk about the htc evo m 9 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.490
 or htc klima speak 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:12.460
 how is it with htc exciting club 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.129
 actually because year after year they build 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.470
 the smartest smartphones on the market 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.260
 or the experts absolutely popular though 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.670
 somehow the buyer does not know 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.920
 they simply do not have a commercial one 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.679
 success that one would wish them that 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.990
 now has the power super device the same 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.140
 phenomenon and we are still looking forward to it 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.610
 the successor that had the new 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.629
 short the name before we speak 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.290
 the really interesting things 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.469
 approach 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.469
 the rumor mill is talking more and more often 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.879
 from the htc team that was only the first 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.050
 internal code name is now 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.300
 said that that too 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.680
 we will be the final brand name 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.629
 we just do not care 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.840
 how many assume that's why 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.070
 you should leave this one behind this brand 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.340
 let yourself go why should you suddenly 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.800
 his obscure names hima htc e mail 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.090
 version still quite cool but china no 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.190
 nobody knows what that means 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.080
 but let 's surprise you 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.820
 Let's talk about the release 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.090
 expected release that htc carries on 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.160
 was presented on 24 march in new york 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.200
 So not on the mwc but 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.830
 my own press press event at 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.510
 a press event can do the same 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.860
 of course imagine now 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.460
 Of course, looks are now directed 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.990
 like mwc because on the cs 2015 nothing 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.650
 it was also talked about 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.080
 that since the HTC evo m 9 the light of 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.580
 It was not possible to see this world 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.230
 Of course we can only talk about the price 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.420
 certainly speculate between 600 and 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.280
 700 euros he will be the price decline 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.990
 at htc is not quite as bad as 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.720
 at samsung but also here 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.440
 certainly the vp did not last long 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.710
 have the technical data speak of 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.110
 Display only 55 inches was actually 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.810
 the first and biggest rumor is too 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.670
 relatively plausible 55 inches is currently 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 so the new standard that the story of 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.070
 lg started it 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.130
 However, the rumor mill has the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.200
 developed from 55 5 422 of mine 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.180
 opinion a very nice size and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.990
 Last time it was called 5 inches and that meant that 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.000
 always like 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.850
 and that is quite interesting because 5 inches 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.680
 First, the biggest makes it from the HTC and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.080
 because htc would have a possibility here 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.690
 also to be differentiated from the rest of the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.090
 Not everyone is watching you 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.140
 the outside with such mini ends as 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.340
 I be blessed or punished 515 times 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.700
 also incredibly big 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.720
 therefore 55 inches possible even if one 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.070
 Of course, of course, that thinks that 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.190
 manufacturer of this data sheet 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.260
 You have to go with the skin because of that 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.880
 Customer The buyer actually comes 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.120
 just pay more on the data sheet 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.420
 the better phone is the logic 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.650
 before hd, the theory is not qhd too 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.140
 the same logic 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.260
 Do you dare to do that? 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.820
 defy possible but also one 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.680
 possibility to delineate each other 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.850
 see why qhd now really 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.950
 important are the human eye can 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.370
 it at the average distance 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.850
 from 20 to 30 cm do not recognize the the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.270
 pixel or the difference so intends 5 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.980
 inch display or 55 snapdragon 810's 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.420
 guess at the processor that is 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.130
 actually only plausible because that is 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.840
 Now the new reference device from 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.640
 qualcomm on the market we already know 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.940
 that she fix 2 had already installed it 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.760
 hence the rumors of 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.660
 production problems with qualcomm 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.020
 probably three gigabytes outdated 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.480
 ran 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.920
 that's not controversial four gigabytes 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.100
 are now possible as we 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.560
 since then meaning of two but know 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.920
 I personally would definitely rather 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.920
 direction three gigabytes tap at htc 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.410
 the battery the last rumors went 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.090
 direction 2,800 milliampere will even 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.380
 pretty precise time 2840 be it drum 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.450
 probably under 3000 milliamps 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.790
 that's a pity but htc is 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.240
 not known for battery monster too 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.040
 to build 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.080
 even if that is certainly good to face 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.230
 2800 is not real anymore 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.580
 up to date the competition watch us 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.840
 Camera htc is yes with the ultra pixels 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.820
 This marketing trick is not famous 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.260
 but became aware of itself 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.080
 That was a courageous decision 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.660
 because four ultra pixels sounds even if 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.880
 the ultra city mega ahead of the word pixel 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.360
 just stands for less and is too 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.910
 less than 13 20 megapixels like that 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.620
 We are currently in competition 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.180
 lately see a trend at htc 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.550
 away from it and back to the 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.980
 classic megapixels like in the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.270
 models that came out last time 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.950
 also here it is spoken of 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.300
 in the rumor mill that the ultra 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.470
 pixel at least in the main camera 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.240
 possibly still with the front camera 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.930
 but past the main camera 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.740
 could be 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.919
 that is now the speech is from 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.180
 13-16 maybe 20 megapixels and that 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.919
 also pretty much got one 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.580
 Particularity is guided by one 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.650
 cooperation with Bose and the name is 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.380
 you of course known as a manufacturer 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.470
 pretty prestigious manufacturers 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.380
 from soundsystem is a smartphone and 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.510
 no ghetto blaster but better 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.180
 Sound is just pleasant to take from there 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.430
 we like that with us 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.470
 Well, that's all conceivable 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.370
 In spite of the fact that she had the energy it is 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.570
 hard to imagine but conceivable 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.150
 a rumor still it will be over again 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.300
 from 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.380
 htc one m 9 prime spoken you know 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.940
 that certainly if he already has the market 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.910
 tracked longer that was in the last 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.460
 years at htc the case was at 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.840
 samsung 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.680
 I think there was already talk of the s5 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.940
 prime or something 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.830
 So that's a rumor whatever 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.210
 is thrown around again when we are 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.950
 See the technical data like you 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.920
 are currently being promoted so now 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.270
 straight 5 inch display hd city qhd then 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.580
 Of course there is still room up there 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.970
 also a prime model or a plus 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.950
 or premium or wax model yourself 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.650
 could establish from that is that 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.330
 conceivable but htc has to be last 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.670
 fleet also reduces what actually 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.200
 is quite pleasant so we type 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.240
 not really on it but has 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.520
 keep this in the back of the head direction mwc 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.410
 so march we will certainly more 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.390
 know or at the latest 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.210
 march, we expect the htc 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.550
 evo 9 or htc team we 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.940
 We are looking forward to seeing you 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.940
 next time
