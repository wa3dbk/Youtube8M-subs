00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
 cell phone system in brief 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.490
 The phone works for the vendor self-defense 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.820
 6 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.329
 for this we 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.679
 to make sure go to the menu 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.209
 options 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.789
 system 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.919
 and if that 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.229
 such programs note 

00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:20.119
 arrangement so we see that the processor 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.109
 control is set here 65 16 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.890
 clean clean processor 416 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 megahertz 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.579
 memory indicated 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.720
 version of bendus you can see hundreds of 6 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:34.719
 5 build this 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.750
 phone and not make those aggression 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.500
 six megabyte 2 gigabyte memory card 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.410
 my subjective opinion about the system 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740
 initially of course m 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.800
 in view of the fact that now many are broke 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.540
 usually lead in defense 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.570
 relatively buggy 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.730
 systems but of course in my experience but here too 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.330
 not bad work this percentage vindous 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.120
 mobile 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.800
 considering that 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.640
 This is the shell of the books 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.340
 pretty pretty and March 6 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.910
 you can change the estimated cover 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.440
 so he 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.870
 seeing presents a menu where there are three 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.460
 desktops can be back 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.780
 return 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.010
 there are still such interesting 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.390
 opportunities i like budgets 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.540
 further he 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.990
 this way you can again get into 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.520
 this mode 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.520
 then you can see 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.250
 and what systems 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.280
 for installation but for example 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.860
 The percentage with a little in the zone can be seen as 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.060
 she looks unique 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.829
 looks less interesting of course 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.610
 wildlife because 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.900
 oao beautiful all light all 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.320
 the rest for some reason they are black and white 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.520
 but still pretty good too 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.120
 it looks and they are absolutely all 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.390
 mini interface 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.680
 that is, we are now clicking on 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.030
 central school button 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.920
 and we get already rub display exactly 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.860
 Here is such a menu 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.399
 also interesting if we need 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.150
 house 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.930
 just watch we serve 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.389
 back to the world 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.069
 in this way are displayed 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.069
 other parameters 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.929
 business can 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.020
 to explain 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.489
 why he doesn't want 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.679
 but you can 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.489
 the side 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.959
 very beautifully made interesting 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:32.949
 there is 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:36.339
 means options such when for example 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.339
 if we set the theme 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.299
 I'll say what if wildlife 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.789
 themes installed 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.659
 yes and actually few of them rub 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.879
 such support for example one thing about what 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.349
 you are displayed on the screen but 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.800
 highly 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.999
 percent 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.130
 some meteorites are falling 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.920
 But if this day is displayed 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.249
 Basically, here is such 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.550
 picture 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.169
 In this case, unfortunately 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.229
 I have a wrong showing price 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.479
 temperature 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.849
 and while he said that there are heavy showers 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.569
 booty file was connected and I have 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.049
 automatic by the way here you can 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.809
 show you how he showed the weather 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.209
 the weather is displayed like this 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.059
 now of course something is wrong 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.459
 because connecting to 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.879
 there is no internet 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.739
 can scroll through 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.739
 as you see in quite beautiful 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.899
 so here's how you see it rain on the screen 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.409
 if a special account the weather the sun shines 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.230
 if it's evening here 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.140
 or sunset then we have everything to paint that circle 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.319
 and shade if we have earlier morning then the sun 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.780
 shines well, interestingly done 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.269
 really thought the interface 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.309
 quite good at least it's better than 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:51.510
 just a goal 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.910
 weather is underway 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.910
 with such an ordinary standard 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.490
 as i said the system works sure 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.340
 there are no problems without such big advantages 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.099
 so can 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.779
 from my point of view 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.779
 we confidently put four with a plus 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.549
 considering this phone here 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.029
 only 400 megahertz processor 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.559
 and so sort of freaks installed 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.319
 then the four plus it led the most 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.199
 suited to the system works all without 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.349
 of problems 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:25.829
 surprisingly
