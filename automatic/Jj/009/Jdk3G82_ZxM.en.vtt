think<00:01:59.670> they<00:01:59.909> should<00:02:00.090> switch<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.540> faster<00:02:00.960> lock

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.480 
think they should switch the faster lock

around<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.520> same<00:02:11.700> effect<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.150> started

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390

like<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.450> chopper<00:02:13.660> gunner<00:02:13.960> why<00:02:15.900> are<00:02:16.900> they

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
like a chopper gunner why are they

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.600

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
making it lock home faster like it's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.060 
making it lock home faster like it's
like<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.880> intrude<00:02:19.680> only<00:02:20.680> thing<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.010> think

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
like to intrude only thing I can think

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.900 
like to intrude only thing I can think
they'd<00:02:21.310> do<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.520> they'd<00:02:21.610> make<00:02:21.790> it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
they'd do is they'd make it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.260 
they'd do is they'd make it
instantaneous<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.580> would<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.760> really

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
instantaneous and that would be really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.710 
instantaneous and that would be really
annoying<00:02:25.720> yeah<00:02:27.180> extreme<00:02:28.180> conditioning

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
annoying yeah extreme conditioning

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.750 
annoying yeah extreme conditioning
double<00:02:29.410> your<00:02:29.560> sprint<00:02:29.860> length<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.340> faster

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
double your sprint length the faster

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.340 
double your sprint length the faster

black<00:02:32.560> ops<00:02:32.800> I'm<00:02:32.890> kind<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.190> sad<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.520> there's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
black ops I'm kind of sad that there's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.090 
black ops I'm kind of sad that there's
no<00:02:33.760> moral<00:02:34.030> unlimited<00:02:34.540> sprint<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.050> really<00:02:35.950> did

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
no moral unlimited sprint I really did

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.710 
no moral unlimited sprint I really did
use<00:02:36.340> marathon<00:02:36.790> much<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.090> modern<00:02:37.210> warfare<00:02:37.450> 2

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
use marathon much of modern warfare 2

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.510 
use marathon much of modern warfare 2
but<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.050> black<00:02:38.200> ops<00:02:38.470> there's<00:02:39.220> almost<00:02:39.370> a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
but in black ops there's almost a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.160 
but in black ops there's almost a
mainstay<00:02:40.000> because<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.420> ninja<00:02:40.690> being<00:02:40.900> really

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
mainstay because the ninja being really

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.290 
mainstay because the ninja being really
hard<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.470> use<00:02:41.620> efficiently<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.340> used<00:02:43.030> marathon

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
hard to use efficiently I used marathon

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.720 
hard to use efficiently I used marathon

scavenger here which is essentially the
