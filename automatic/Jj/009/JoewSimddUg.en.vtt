spacious there are a few bouncy echoes

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.650 
spacious there are a few bouncy echoes
here<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.340> there<00:02:43.459> maybe<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> higher

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
here and there maybe like a higher

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.540 
here and there maybe like a higher
low-pass<00:02:45.260> filter<00:02:45.800> on<00:02:45.920> something<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.340> kind<00:02:46.519> of

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
low-pass filter on something to kind of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.820 
low-pass filter on something to kind of
give<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.850> low<00:02:47.180> Phi<00:02:47.510> aesthetic<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
give it a low Phi aesthetic and the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.220 
give it a low Phi aesthetic and the
groove<00:02:49.190> on<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.640> track<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.720> interesting

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
groove on the track is is interesting

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.039 
groove on the track is is interesting
because<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.590> feels<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.130> kind<00:02:52.549> of<00:02:52.810> robotic<00:02:53.810> and

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
because it feels so kind of robotic and

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.380 
because it feels so kind of robotic and
sterile<00:02:55.010> usually<00:02:55.880> something<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.209> would

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
sterile usually something that would

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.030 
sterile usually something that would
turn<00:02:56.569> me<00:02:56.720> off<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.140> feel<00:02:57.319> like<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.590> helps<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
turn me off but I feel like it helps the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.770 
turn me off but I feel like it helps the
track<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.549> this<00:02:58.700> case<00:02:58.940> because<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.360> brings<00:02:59.540> a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
track in this case because it brings a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.320 
track in this case because it brings a
really<00:03:00.170> unique<00:03:00.319> flavor<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.670> song<00:03:01.910> this

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
really unique flavor to the song this

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.210 
really unique flavor to the song this
track<00:03:02.600> really<00:03:02.810> becomes<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.410> half<00:03:03.739> human<00:03:04.010> half

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
track really becomes a half human half

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.729 
track really becomes a half human half

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
would like the sixth track that this

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.450 
would like the sixth track that this
starts<00:04:41.900> on<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.080> bit<00:04:42.289> more<00:04:42.530> if<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.800> beat<00:04:43.069> wasn't

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
starts on a bit more if the beat wasn't

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.119

so<00:04:43.639> plainly<00:04:44.330> sequenced<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.199> get<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.770> this<00:04:45.919> guy

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
so plainly sequenced I get that this guy

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.149 
so plainly sequenced I get that this guy
wants<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.759> bring<00:04:47.120> some<00:04:47.479> musical<00:04:48.289> variety<00:04:48.500> some

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159

stylistic<00:04:49.610> variety<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:51.050> album<00:04:51.500> but<00:04:51.680> I

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
stylistic variety to this album but I

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.540 
stylistic variety to this album but I
don't<00:04:52.550> think<00:04:52.909> every<00:04:53.659> change<00:04:54.289> adds<00:04:54.860> up<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.280> a

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
don't think every change adds up to a

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.059 
don't think every change adds up to a
phenomenal<00:04:56.360> track<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.990> track<00:04:57.229> transparency

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
phenomenal track the track transparency

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.279 
phenomenal track the track transparency
has<00:04:58.280> some<00:04:58.460> subtle<00:04:58.729> dubstep<00:04:59.270> influences<00:05:00.050> and

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
has some subtle dubstep influences and

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.110 
has some subtle dubstep influences and
the<00:05:00.469> synthesizers<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.759> vocal

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the synthesizers and in the vocal

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.850 
the synthesizers and in the vocal
samples<00:05:02.569> but<00:05:02.810> it's<00:05:03.080> not<00:05:03.560> really<00:05:03.800> that

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
samples but it's not really that

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.670 
samples but it's not really that
memorable<00:05:04.639> of<00:05:04.729> a<00:05:04.849> moment<00:05:05.270> on<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.870> LP<00:05:06.259> for<00:05:06.530> me
