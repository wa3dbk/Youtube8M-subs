 Special theme made with salmon fillet 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 so we will start doing 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 systematically, you see what the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.690

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.579
 we're going to use april salmon in shape 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.739
 a seaweed actually 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.930
 so we ordered 200 grams of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.800
 salmon 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.140
 but if it's for a piece and we'll open it 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.340
 hand 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.340
 think none 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.870
 so you need a good grinding knife 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.960
 in this area is a chipped knife pass the 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.400
 cut perfectly to be able to hurt the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.830
 salmon 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:24.130
 then we started yet I am the UN 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.540
 stay thin or better a special theme 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.240
 You have to be careful not to 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.670
 to be ugly at the time of being boring enter 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.420
 on my desk also the right nuts 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 so let's put the rigid here 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.840
 the other part of the salmon voted in Cuba 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.230
 with this it is completely raw not 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.860
 it is good it is not precooked it is 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.630
 smoked nothing cro fresh fruity 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.630
 Let's cut the people. 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.650
 how many grams is enough to make 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.170
 a temaki in 30 grams of salmon 30 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.640
 grams of people and 30 grams of shrimp 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:14.530
 which will be my fill of the fill and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:19.690
 let's put 30 grams of mx1 in another 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.670
 you put them the people the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.920
 shrimp are also crosses 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.209
 is this the truth the shrimp it is pre 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.760
 cooked and the people also cooked 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.330
 we added 30 grams of cream x 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.090
 we mix 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:45.230
 I left the head fat is a cream of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:47.540
 cheese is not presented the chive 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.410
 goal does not mix much to appear well 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.410
 salmon is very visible 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.670
 Now let's get the rice. 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.770
 What is the ideal rice for making the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.410
 temaki that rice is own rice 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.020
 rice is the ideal rice for 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.970
 do the emerged the temaki I find 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:11.210
 meeting in supermarkets here 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.180
 before we put the rice spread well 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.980
 here on the side it's good to wait for the whole rice 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.420
 because we're going to close the temaki we 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.940
 we need a space well it 's the stuffing 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.020
 full now this rice he is already 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.010
 cooked he is already cooked loves 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.010
 Let's put the stuffing 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.780
 and now we close it very carefully 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.780
 on here 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.780
 this maxi only serves a fake person 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.900
 or it is a climax that is well served in 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:55.950
 stuffed cove is a temaki that 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.950
 two people, right? 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:08.120
 It's a special theme. It's big. 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.120
 in the campaign 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.180
 now let's put it on the plate 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.180
 but to deal 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.100
 can carefully handle where salmon 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.100
 It's very light, I'm very light. 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:37.199
 let's see bono had some olive oil 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.810
 programming of corpse and olive oil 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.270
 at the time of listening August August part 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.199
 we can make an excuse not to 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.199
 we went to the year 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.680
 and who does not have a room at home sometimes 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.419
 has a torch the smallest ones that are 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.300
 is not this 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.580
 jo I have no choice and have to be 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.169
 with a blowjob even though it's good to have a 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.779
 tortilla that changes the flavor and if you 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.599
 microwave oven it breaks the 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:32.370
 sound while minutes or so is the 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.319
 He blows it just enough for him. 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.909
 brown minute to minute 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.740
 now before we add a month of 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.960
 sauce that the herbs sauce 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.339

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.289
 olive oil 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:50.189
 I put everything in the blender how 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.099
 You put in the unifier beats right. 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:56.339
 ready is ready died they 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:06:01.229
 Portuguese game on top of 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:04.439
 that olive oil already helps to give more 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:07.469
 a stretcher allowance 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:09.240
 we have a tomato sauce that is the juice of 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.089
 Tomato is this and taking against the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.009
 supermarket in specialist houses 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:16.889
 Tomato juice is yours for a bit of 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:20.639

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:23.969
 thing and we now add the 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.279
 finish the teriyaki sauce what is in that 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.610

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:31.169
 show the ginger sake 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.419

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.050
 prepare or in some places come already come 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:39.770
 ready but if the person wants to prepare 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:43.520
 a better taste is good 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.520
 Let's play the sauce. 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:48.860
