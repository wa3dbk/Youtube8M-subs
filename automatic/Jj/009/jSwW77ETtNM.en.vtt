00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
this is the this is the low C or low

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.839 
this is the this is the low C or low
yeah<00:00:06.210> losi<00:00:06.720> mini<00:00:07.049> desert<00:00:07.560> truck<00:00:07.849> the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
yeah losi mini desert truck the

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.020 
yeah losi mini desert truck the
modifications<00:00:09.540> do<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.929> are<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:11.700> antenna

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
modifications do it are the antenna

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.129 
modifications do it are the antenna
obviously<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.139> got<00:00:13.950> tired<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.549> ripping<00:00:14.910> out

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
obviously I got tired of it ripping out

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.080 
obviously I got tired of it ripping out
so<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.220> like<00:00:17.490> ultra<00:00:17.730> mega<00:00:18.859> friggin

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
so this is like ultra mega friggin

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.900 
so this is like ultra mega friggin
bendable<00:00:21.090> wire<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.769> it's<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:23.490> know<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
bendable wire and it's you know it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.429 
bendable wire and it's you know it
wrapped<00:00:24.150> around<00:00:25.490> mmm<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.199> that

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
wrapped around mmm so I like that

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.609 
wrapped around mmm so I like that
because<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.730> never<00:00:30.060> ripped<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.570> because<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
because it's never ripped out because it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.560 
because it's never ripped out because it
is<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.090> bendable<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> lot<00:00:33.510> more

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
is so bendable and it's a lot more

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.920 
is so bendable and it's a lot more
heavy-duty<00:00:34.760> deal<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.210> only<00:00:36.390> other<00:00:36.420> upgrade

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
heavy-duty deal the only other upgrade

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
heavy-duty deal the only other upgrade
is<00:00:37.969> there's<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.120> actually<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:41.250> gear<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
is there's two actually the this gear is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
is there's two actually the this gear is
different<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.989> stripped<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.500> other

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
different because I stripped the other

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.310 
different because I stripped the other
one<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> don't<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.190> mad<00:00:44.670> crazy<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:46.140> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
one I don't like mad crazy and then this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.350 
one I don't like mad crazy and then this
is<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:48.230> 370<00:00:49.230> frenzy<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.090> insane<00:00:51.600> 370

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
is the 370 frenzy not the insane 370

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.650 
is the 370 frenzy not the insane 370
they<00:00:54.360> told<00:00:54.629> me<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> hobby<00:00:55.590> shop<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
they told me at the hobby shop that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
they told me at the hobby shop that
it'll<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.649> slower<00:00:58.980> than<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it'll do it's a little slower than the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.560 
it'll do it's a little slower than the
insane<00:00:59.969> 370<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.379> most<00:01:02.030> people<00:01:03.030> who<00:01:03.120> race<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
insane 370 but most people who race in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.359 
insane 370 but most people who race in
our<00:01:03.690> area<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.320> use<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.100> they're<00:01:05.250> going

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
our area they use this if they're going

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.270 
our area they use this if they're going
to<00:01:05.430> upgrade<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.270> motor<00:01:06.619> with<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.799> small<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to upgrade to a motor with this small of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120 
to upgrade to a motor with this small of
a<00:01:08.340> vehicle<00:01:08.549> because<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:10.080> doesn't<00:01:10.530> draw<00:01:10.770> as

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
a vehicle because it doesn't draw as

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.050 
a vehicle because it doesn't draw as
much<00:01:11.460> battery<00:01:11.909> power<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.659> insane<00:01:13.350> 370<00:01:14.060> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
much battery power is the insane 370 so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
much battery power is the insane 370 so
that's<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.420> nice<00:01:15.540> um<00:01:15.890> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.159> want<00:01:17.310> to

can see the original hold right there
and<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:43.229> gear<00:01:43.530> mesh<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:46.470> gets<00:01:46.860> messed<00:01:47.159> up

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and the gear mesh is it gets messed up

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
and the gear mesh is it gets messed up
all<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.000> time<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.899> put<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.079> penny

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
all the time so I just put that penny

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.280 
all the time so I just put that penny
their<00:01:49.590> help<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.549> along<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:50.939> bit<00:01:51.270> um<00:01:51.509> and

their help it along a little bit um and
the<00:01:52.649> other<00:01:53.840> there's<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:55.290> other<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.799> should

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the other there's two other there should

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.800 
the other there's two other there should
be<00:01:56.100> two<00:01:56.250> other<00:01:56.399> videos<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.210> post<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
be two other videos I'm all post and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
be two other videos I'm all post and
you'll<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.759> this<00:01:59.759> gear<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
you'll see the this gear if you what I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.690 
you'll see the this gear if you what I
think<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.020> called<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> pinion<00:02:01.619> gear<00:02:01.829> flies

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
think it's called the pinion gear flies

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.999 
think it's called the pinion gear flies
off<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> mesh<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.829> at

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
off because of the mesh it just it's at

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.859 
off because of the mesh it just it's at
an<00:02:05.130> angle<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.850> takes<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.329> off<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
an angle and it just takes it off as you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.130 
an angle and it just takes it off as you
can<00:02:07.670> set<00:02:08.670> an<00:02:08.789> angle

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
can set an angle

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.319 
can set an angle
alright<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:14.010> kind<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.189> park<00:02:15.519> thing

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
alright so this is kind of a park thing

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.140 
alright so this is kind of a park thing
in<00:02:16.840> my<00:02:17.019> area<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.530> we're<00:02:18.219> under<00:02:18.519> obviously<00:02:19.120> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
in my area and we're under obviously a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.369 
in my area and we're under obviously a
pine<00:02:19.540> tree<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:21.310> great<00:02:21.609> for<00:02:21.939> this<00:02:22.379> just

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379
