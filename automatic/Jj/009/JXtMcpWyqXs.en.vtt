00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
amounts of diversity as far as which

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.300

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
are the other four people going to do

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.360 
are the other four people going to do
like<00:03:59.200> do<00:03:59.350> they<00:03:59.410> have<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.590> wait<00:03:59.920> until<00:04:00.130> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
like do they have to wait until the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.949 
like do they have to wait until the
struggle<00:04:00.730> ends<00:04:00.880> or<00:04:01.120> do<00:04:01.570> they<00:04:01.660> have<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.840> like

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
struggle ends or do they have to like

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.570 
struggle ends or do they have to like
trying<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.260> swerve<00:04:02.530> away<00:04:02.739> from<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.220> light<00:04:03.430> and

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
trying to swerve away from it light and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.280 
trying to swerve away from it light and
of<00:04:04.000> course<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.269> gets<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.510> beam<00:04:04.720> struggle<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:05.200> if

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
of course I gets a beam struggle so if

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.420 
of course I gets a beam struggle so if
you<00:04:05.350> go<00:04:05.470> through<00:04:05.739> it<00:04:05.830> you're<00:04:05.980> you're<00:04:06.310> gonna

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
you go through it you're you're gonna

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.970 
you go through it you're you're gonna
die<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.810> completely<00:04:08.320> makes<00:04:08.440> sense<00:04:08.650> as<00:04:08.950> to

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
die so it completely makes sense as to

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.130 
die so it completely makes sense as to
why<00:04:09.100> beam<00:04:09.430> struggles<00:04:09.880> are<00:04:09.970> not<00:04:10.120> in<00:04:10.299> however<00:04:10.900> at

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
why beam struggles are not in however at

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.210 
why beam struggles are not in however at
the<00:04:11.260> end<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.470> day<00:04:11.620> is<00:04:11.799> still<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.190> a
