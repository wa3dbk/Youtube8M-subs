every single accessory when this was

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.300 
every single accessory when this was

recorded I didn't even have the straight
full<00:00:31.550> bolts<00:00:31.820> that's<00:00:32.029> why<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:32.239> kind<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.599> looks<00:00:32.750> a

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
full bolts that's why it kind of looks a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.040 
full bolts that's why it kind of looks a
bit<00:00:32.960> sloppy<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.560> do<00:00:34.220> have<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.850> 12x<00:00:35.540> scope<00:00:35.840> on

bit sloppy I do have the 12x scope on

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.090 
bit sloppy I do have the 12x scope on
this<00:00:36.200> one<00:00:36.380> because<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:36.710> still<00:00:36.860> haven't

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
unlocked the 8 X 1 so that's what I'm

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380

have one in the attending the magazine
one<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.980> chamber<00:01:10.160> which<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.880> same<00:01:11.030> as

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
one in the chamber which is the same as

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.700 
one in the chamber which is the same as
most<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.840> other<00:01:11.960> ones<00:01:12.140> except<00:01:12.440> for<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.620> m

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
most of the other ones except for the m

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.990 
most of the other ones except for the m
98<00:01:12.920> be<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:14.450> has<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:16.790> bullet<00:01:17.150> speed<00:01:17.480> of<00:01:17.950> 560

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
98 be it has and a bullet speed of 560

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.390 
98 be it has and a bullet speed of 560
meters<00:01:20.000> per<00:01:20.180> second<00:01:20.570> which<00:01:21.140> in<00:01:21.440> comparison<00:01:22.160> is

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
meters per second which in comparison is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.830 
meters per second which in comparison is
the<00:01:22.820> l<00:01:23.390> minus<00:01:23.540> 6<00:01:23.930> has<00:01:24.670> 540<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.090> shoots<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.720> bit

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
the l minus 6 has 540 so it shoots a bit

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.590 
the l minus 6 has 540 so it shoots a bit
faster<00:01:27.320> than<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.710> l<00:01:27.920> 96<00:01:28.250> by<00:01:28.940> faster<00:01:29.360> i<00:01:29.420> mean

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
faster than the l 96 by faster i mean

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.930 
faster than the l 96 by faster i mean
the<00:01:29.720> bullet<00:01:29.960> traveled<00:01:30.320> faster<00:01:30.920> which<00:01:31.760> also

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
the bullet traveled faster which also

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.300 
the bullet traveled faster which also
means<00:01:32.090> less<00:01:32.510> bullet<00:01:32.840> drop<00:01:33.110> easier<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.740> hit<00:01:33.890> you

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
means less bullet drop easier to hit you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.240 
means less bullet drop easier to hit you

is<00:02:55.250> very<00:02:55.790> important<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.770> is<00:02:57.770> a<00:02:57.800> very<00:02:58.130> big

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
is very important and that is a very big

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.060 
is very important and that is a very big
downside<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.180> weapon<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:00.860> you're

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
downside of this weapon so if you're

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.380 
downside of this weapon so if you're
going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> use<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.610> weapon<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:02.000> would<00:03:02.180> prefer

going to use this weapon I would prefer

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.030 
going to use this weapon I would prefer
using<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:03.020> from<00:03:03.140> medium<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.650> long<00:03:04.010> range

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
using it from medium to long range

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.360 
using it from medium to long range
engagements<00:03:04.660> but<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.470> has<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:07.340> know

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
engagements but because it has you know

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.220 
engagements but because it has you know
good<00:03:07.730> damage<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.360> has<00:03:08.480> good<00:03:08.750> bullet<00:03:09.110> velocity

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
good damage it has good bullet velocity

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.100 
good damage it has good bullet velocity
it<00:03:10.070> has<00:03:10.190> ten<00:03:10.490> bullets<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.060> magazine<00:03:11.110> it

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
it has ten bullets in the magazine it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.660 
it has ten bullets in the magazine it
looks<00:03:12.350> cool<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.890> doesn't<00:03:13.160> cover<00:03:13.370> half<00:03:13.640> the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
looks cool it doesn't cover half the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.780 
looks cool it doesn't cover half the
screen<00:03:14.000> like<00:03:14.330> for<00:03:14.540> example<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.020> m40a5<00:03:15.790> so

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
screen like for example the m40a5 so

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.790 
screen like for example the m40a5 so
it's<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.090> very<00:03:17.120> good<00:03:17.630> weapon<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.050> feels<00:03:18.410> great

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
it's a very good weapon it feels great

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.340 
it's a very good weapon it feels great
it<00:03:19.100> handles<00:03:19.850> great<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.300> very<00:03:20.540> good<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.050> only

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
it handles great it's very good the only

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.170 
it handles great it's very good the only
drawback<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:22.040> slowly<00:03:22.340> chain<00:03:22.850> ring<00:03:23.060> and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
drawback is to slowly chain ring and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.270 
drawback is to slowly chain ring and
you'll<00:03:23.420> see<00:03:23.660> when<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> far<00:03:24.170> as<00:03:24.320> well<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:25.010> very

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
you'll see when I far as well it's very

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.070 
you'll see when I far as well it's very
slow<00:03:25.670> until<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.000> can<00:03:26.120> fire<00:03:26.360> again<00:03:26.660> compared

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
slow until you can fire again compared

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.440 
slow until you can fire again compared
to<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.230> other<00:03:27.320> weapons<00:03:27.710> now<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.940> fastest

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
to the other weapons now the fastest

at 54.5 rounds per minute and trust me
you'll<00:03:35.930> notice<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.380> very<00:03:36.920> well<00:03:37.190> once<00:03:37.460> you

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
you'll notice that very well once you

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.840 
you'll notice that very well once you
try<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.790> out<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.930> I've<00:03:39.380> been<00:03:39.560> running
