sure who's gonna be who and I like the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.140 
sure who's gonna be who and I like the
idea<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:29.540> Olivia<00:01:30.540> sort<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.220> becoming<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:33.030> of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
idea of Olivia sort of becoming more of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
idea of Olivia sort of becoming more of
the<00:01:33.299> maternal<00:01:33.840> figure<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.799> taking

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the maternal figure you know and taking

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.219 
the maternal figure you know and taking
care<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> these<00:01:35.700> two<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.180> lost<00:01:36.420> boys<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
care of these two little lost boys but I

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
care of these two little lost boys but I
think<00:01:37.500> she's<00:01:37.650> got<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> long<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> go<00:01:38.430> before

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
think she's got a long way to go before

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.810 
think she's got a long way to go before
she<00:01:39.200> gets<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.829> Peter's<00:01:41.340> correct<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
she gets there and Peter's correct I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.789 
she gets there and Peter's correct I
think<00:01:42.150> he<00:01:42.360> wants<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> look<00:01:42.930> after<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.280 

and<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.610> probably<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> change<00:01:48.689> in

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and that's probably going to change in

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.399 
and that's probably going to change in
season<00:01:49.619> two<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.040> dynamic<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.570> Jeff
