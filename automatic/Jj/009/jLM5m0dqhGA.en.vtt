what's<00:00:03.770> up<00:00:03.980> in<00:00:04.130> the<00:00:04.400> course<00:00:04.670> of<00:00:05.320> doing<00:00:06.320> what<00:00:06.470> I

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
what's up in the course of doing what I

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.350 
what's up in the course of doing what I
do<00:00:06.620> for<00:00:06.920> a<00:00:06.980> living<00:00:07.279> I<00:00:07.340> run<00:00:07.549> across<00:00:07.640> different

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
do for a living I run across different

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.970 
do for a living I run across different
situations<00:00:09.110> that<00:00:09.889> I<00:00:10.100> feel<00:00:10.970> are<00:00:11.210> somewhat

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
situations that I feel are somewhat

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.049 
situations that I feel are somewhat
universal<00:00:12.980> and<00:00:13.130> can<00:00:13.280> show<00:00:13.519> us<00:00:13.670> some<00:00:13.849> things

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
universal and can show us some things

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.560 
universal and can show us some things
that<00:00:14.300> we<00:00:14.420> might<00:00:15.189> want<00:00:16.189> to<00:00:16.250> look<00:00:16.490> at<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:16.970> and

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
that we might want to look at and and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.240 
that we might want to look at and and
some<00:00:17.840> some<00:00:18.050> of<00:00:18.170> you<00:00:18.259> guys<00:00:18.439> for<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.739> first<00:00:18.770> time

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
some some of you guys for the first time

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.240 
some some of you guys for the first time
some<00:00:19.520> of<00:00:19.700> you<00:00:19.790> for<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.000> millionth<00:00:20.450> time<00:00:20.509> so

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
some of you for the millionth time so

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.560 
some of you for the millionth time so
these<00:00:22.250> aren't<00:00:22.460> this<00:00:22.730> is<00:00:22.939> what<00:00:23.270> I'm<00:00:23.360> gonna<00:00:23.450> show

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
these aren't this is what I'm gonna show

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.179 
these aren't this is what I'm gonna show
you<00:00:23.630> today<00:00:23.810> isn't<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.230> only<00:00:24.380> way<00:00:24.649> it's<00:00:24.950> just

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
you today isn't the only way it's just

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.580 
you today isn't the only way it's just
one<00:00:25.399> way<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.939> it's<00:00:26.060> one<00:00:26.210> way<00:00:26.360> that<00:00:26.480> I<00:00:26.599> found<00:00:26.840> to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
one way and it's one way that I found to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.950 
one way and it's one way that I found to
be<00:00:27.710> useful<00:00:27.890> in<00:00:28.279> terms<00:00:28.700> of<00:00:28.970> quality<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.689> sound

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
be useful in terms of quality of sound

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.560 
be useful in terms of quality of sound
and<00:00:30.169> time<00:00:30.820> now<00:00:31.820> this<00:00:32.300> kick<00:00:32.630> drum<00:00:34.269> came<00:00:35.269> to<00:00:35.449> me

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
and time now this kick drum came to me

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.650 
and time now this kick drum came to me
with<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:36.050> couple<00:00:36.800> little<00:00:37.100> issues<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.730> I'm

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
with a couple little issues and I'm

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.979 
with a couple little issues and I'm
going<00:00:38.840> to<00:00:38.870> show<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.019> how<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.289> solve<00:00:39.590> them<00:00:40.989> now

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
going to show you how I solve them now

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.919 
going to show you how I solve them now
first<00:00:42.289> of<00:00:42.440> all<00:00:42.500> look<00:00:42.710> at<00:00:42.769> this<00:00:42.949> curve<00:00:43.929> I'm

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
first of all look at this curve I'm

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.509 
first of all look at this curve I'm
taking<00:00:45.530> out<00:00:46.089> 9<00:00:47.089> dB<00:00:47.510> at<00:00:47.539> 50<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.350> I'm<00:00:48.829> adding<00:00:49.219> 12

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
taking out 9 dB at 50 and I'm adding 12

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.160 
taking out 9 dB at 50 and I'm adding 12
dB<00:00:49.940> at<00:00:49.969> 75

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
dB at 75

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.310 
dB at 75
yeah<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.739> said<00:00:52.309> it<00:00:52.339> so<00:00:53.179> check<00:00:53.659> this<00:00:53.809> out

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
yeah I said it so check this out

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:09.780 
yeah I said it so check this out
here's<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.829> kick<00:00:55.039> drum<00:00:55.339> without<00:00:55.699> this<00:01:00.850> with

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.039 

one<00:01:10.790> of<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.939> hardest<00:01:11.180> things<00:01:11.659> for<00:01:12.399> me<00:01:14.049> among

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
one of the hardest things for me among

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.830 
one of the hardest things for me among
many

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
many

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.940 
many
everything<00:01:17.840> seems<00:01:18.140> hard<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:18.590> it's<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:18.890> I

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
everything seems hard and if it's not I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.120 
everything seems hard and if it's not I
got<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> knack<00:01:19.610> for<00:01:19.640> making<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.299> hard<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.130> what

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
got a knack for making it hard so what

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.889 
got a knack for making it hard so what
are<00:01:22.340> things<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:23.509> of<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.689> last

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
are things that and one of the last

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.490 
are things that and one of the last
things<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:25.430> my<00:01:26.180> ear<00:01:26.450> got<00:01:26.810> accustomed

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
things that that my ear got accustomed

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.670 
things that that my ear got accustomed
to<00:01:27.979> dealing<00:01:28.520> with<00:01:28.729> was<00:01:29.439> frequencies<00:01:30.439> below

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
to dealing with was frequencies below

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.190 
to dealing with was frequencies below
100<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:31.579> then<00:01:32.180> what<00:01:32.360> makes<00:01:32.570> things<00:01:32.840> even<00:01:33.049> more

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
100 and then what makes things even more

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.660 
100 and then what makes things even more
difficult<00:01:33.439> is<00:01:34.219> when<00:01:34.880> you've<00:01:34.969> got<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:36.670> peak

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
difficult is when you've got a a peak

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.330 
difficult is when you've got a a peak
next<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.240> valley<00:01:38.600> think<00:01:39.049> of<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.350> inverse<00:01:40.070> of

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
next to a valley think of the inverse of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.779 
next to a valley think of the inverse of
this

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.209 
this
now<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.090> had<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.469> had<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.500> peak<00:01:42.829> here<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.360> I

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
now I had a had a peak here and so I

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.370 
now I had a had a peak here and so I
pulled<00:01:46.219> that<00:01:46.399> down<00:01:46.609> that<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.939> valley<00:01:47.270> here<00:01:47.719> now

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
pulled that down that a valley here now

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.319 
pulled that down that a valley here now
if<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.829> look<00:01:49.219> here<00:01:49.369> I'm<00:01:49.609> only<00:01:51.609> I'm<00:01:52.609> only<00:01:52.820> 25

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
if I look here I'm only I'm only 25

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.590 
if I look here I'm only I'm only 25
cycles<00:01:53.719> apart<00:01:54.409> that's<00:01:54.950> nothing<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.240> if<00:01:56.479> I

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
cycles apart that's nothing so if I

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.389 
cycles apart that's nothing so if I
start<00:01:56.930> messing<00:01:57.229> with<00:01:57.439> this<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:57.950> pull<00:01:58.219> this

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
start messing with this and I pull this

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.810 
start messing with this and I pull this
peak<00:01:58.670> down<00:01:59.030> now<00:01:59.929> this<00:02:00.200> valley<00:02:00.530> here<00:02:01.009> goes<00:02:01.490> even

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
peak down now this valley here goes even

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.179 
peak down now this valley here goes even
down<00:02:02.030> further<00:02:02.450> I've<00:02:02.780> fixed<00:02:03.500> part<00:02:03.829> of<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.009> run

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
down further I've fixed part of it run

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.550 
down further I've fixed part of it run
the<00:02:04.280> other<00:02:04.369> part<00:02:04.670> okay<00:02:05.299> here's<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.689> valley<00:02:06.020> here

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
the other part okay here's a valley here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.040 
the other part okay here's a valley here
if<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.950> go<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.189> EQ<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.789> up<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.600> peak<00:02:08.869> that

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
if I go to EQ this up the peak that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.830 
if I go to EQ this up the peak that
exists<00:02:09.560> here<00:02:09.920> gets<00:02:10.520> even<00:02:10.820> worse<00:02:11.000> that's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
exists here gets even worse that's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.420 
exists here gets even worse that's
what's<00:02:12.050> kind<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.350> interesting<00:02:12.530> about<00:02:13.040> this

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
what's kind of interesting about this

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.960 
what's kind of interesting about this
and<00:02:13.640> fun

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
and fun

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.720 
and fun
because<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:15.140> things<00:02:15.440> are<00:02:15.620> really<00:02:16.250> hard<00:02:16.520> to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
because these things are really hard to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.150 
because these things are really hard to
hear<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.810> now<00:02:17.960> we've<00:02:18.140> got<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.530> sorted<00:02:18.830> out

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
hear so now we've got that sorted out

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.900 
hear so now we've got that sorted out
we've<00:02:19.400> got<00:02:19.430> we've<00:02:20.000> got<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.960> repaired<00:02:23.350> now<00:02:24.350> I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
we've got we've got that repaired now I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.540 
we've got we've got that repaired now I
could<00:02:25.910> add<00:02:26.150> more<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:27.440> once<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.860> smooth<00:02:28.280> this

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
could add more but once I smooth this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.210 
could add more but once I smooth this
out<00:02:28.820> my<00:02:29.150> parallel<00:02:29.750> chain<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.410> going<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.100> be

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
out my parallel chain is going to be

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.000 
out my parallel chain is going to be
happy<00:02:31.520> happy<00:02:31.790> happy<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:34.270> I<00:02:35.470> added<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.740> little

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
happy happy happy so I added a little

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.040 
happy happy happy so I added a little
bit<00:02:37.220> more<00:02:37.280> eighty<00:02:38.860> here<00:02:40.000> now<00:02:41.000> look<00:02:41.780> at<00:02:41.900> these

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
bit more eighty here now look at these

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.840 
bit more eighty here now look at these
settings<00:02:42.560> they<00:02:42.740> tend<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.250> work<00:02:43.460> really<00:02:43.700> well

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
settings they tend to work really well

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
going to be static this is a good

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.220 
going to be static this is a good
starting<00:03:25.730> spot<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:27.320> then<00:03:28.090> once<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.360> run<00:03:30.110> it

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
starting spot and then once you run it

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.360 
starting spot and then once you run it
through<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.530> compressor<00:03:30.830> you're<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.280> to

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
through the compressor you're going to

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.400 
through the compressor you're going to
lose<00:03:31.520> a<00:03:31.550> little<00:03:31.700> bit<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:31.940> low<00:03:32.180> end<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.170> we're

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
lose a little bit of low end so we're

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.040 
lose a little bit of low end so we're
boosting<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.100> crap<00:03:34.370> out<00:03:34.580> of<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:34.790> hundred<00:03:35.050> okay

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
boosting the crap out of a hundred okay

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.380 
boosting the crap out of a hundred okay
guys<00:03:36.290> remember<00:03:36.500> their<00:03:36.920> summits<00:03:37.310> -<00:03:38.000> seven

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
guys remember their summits - seven

point<00:03:38.660> eight<00:03:38.810> okay<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:40.640> now<00:03:40.790> here's<00:03:41.060> my

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
point eight okay so now here's my

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:57.850 
point eight okay so now here's my
success<00:03:41.570> my<00:03:41.600> kick<00:03:41.930> drum<00:03:42.170> sound

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.160 

so<00:03:58.860> I'm<00:03:58.920> knocking<00:03:59.310> off<00:03:59.400> around<00:03:59.640> 10<00:04:00.030> seems<00:04:01.019> like

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
so I'm knocking off around 10 seems like

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.630 
so I'm knocking off around 10 seems like
a<00:04:01.200> lot<00:04:01.409> but<00:04:01.560> we're<00:04:01.709> making<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:02.069> back<00:04:02.220> up<00:04:02.489> with

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
a lot but we're making it back up with

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:11.869 
a lot but we're making it back up with
this<00:04:02.959> now<00:04:03.959> let's<00:04:04.290> take<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.560> out<00:04:10.519> now<00:04:11.519> if<00:04:11.670> we're

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
this now let's take it out now if we're

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.330 
this now let's take it out now if we're
if<00:04:12.120> depending<00:04:13.049> on<00:04:13.260> what<00:04:13.440> type<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.709> music<00:04:13.950> we're

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
if depending on what type of music we're

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:23.360 
if depending on what type of music we're
using<00:04:14.690> we<00:04:15.690> might<00:04:15.900> want<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.139> do<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:21.949> or<00:04:22.949> might

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
using we might want to do this or might

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.970 
using we might want to do this or might
want<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.610> do<00:04:23.699> this

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
want to do this

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:32.989 
want to do this

okay<00:04:33.999> and<00:04:34.479> then<00:04:35.189> because<00:04:36.189> I<00:04:36.340> can<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:37.830> decided<00:04:38.830> to

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
okay and then because I can I decided to

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.350 
okay and then because I can I decided to
add<00:04:39.189> a<00:04:39.219> little<00:04:39.610> bit<00:04:39.819> of<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:42.340> kick<00:04:42.939> drum<00:04:42.969> that

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
add a little bit of this kick drum that

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.689 
add a little bit of this kick drum that
reminds<00:04:43.689> me<00:04:43.779> of<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.020> Stargate

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
reminds me of a Stargate

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.209 
reminds me of a Stargate
kick<00:04:46.120> drum<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.599> love<00:04:46.960> their<00:04:47.139> stuff<00:04:47.409> so<00:04:47.800> let's

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
kick drum I love their stuff so let's

00:04:48.219 --> 00:05:13.439 
kick drum I love their stuff so let's
check<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.490> out<00:04:48.879> for<00:04:49.150> the<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:12.029> here<00:05:13.029> again<00:05:13.120> you

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
check that out for the so here again you

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.909 
check that out for the so here again you
can<00:05:13.479> use<00:05:13.779> these<00:05:13.990> concepts<00:05:15.270> for<00:05:16.270> snares<00:05:17.050> now

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
can use these concepts for snares now

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.140 
can use these concepts for snares now
the<00:05:17.979> same<00:05:18.310> setting<00:05:18.669> that<00:05:18.789> we<00:05:18.879> use<00:05:19.000> on<00:05:19.120> that

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
the same setting that we use on that

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.360 
the same setting that we use on that
compressor<00:05:19.750> for<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:19.960> kick<00:05:20.259> that<00:05:20.620> the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
compressor for the kick that the

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.920 
compressor for the kick that the
sidechain<00:05:21.639> compressor<00:05:22.180> that<00:05:22.419> I<00:05:22.479> said<00:05:22.719> was

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
sidechain compressor that I said was

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.320 
sidechain compressor that I said was
like<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.139> 160<00:05:23.710> X<00:05:23.860> T<00:05:24.099> but<00:05:24.729> start<00:05:25.089> with<00:05:25.120> those

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
like a 160 X T but start with those

of attack you want I tend to not do this
separately<00:05:55.000> I<00:05:55.120> tend<00:05:55.509> to<00:05:55.689> listen<00:05:56.199> to<00:05:56.439> the

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
separately I tend to listen to the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.269 
separately I tend to listen to the
sidechain<00:05:57.930> with<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.199> original<00:05:59.740> sound<00:06:00.039> as

sidechain with the original sound as

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.339 
sidechain with the original sound as
opposed<00:06:00.669> to<00:06:00.759> soloing<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.389> sidechain<00:06:01.750> because

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
opposed to soloing the sidechain because

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.749 
opposed to soloing the sidechain because
ultimately<00:06:02.830> that's<00:06:03.129> what's<00:06:03.399> going<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.610> have

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
ultimately that's what's going to have

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.070 
ultimately that's what's going to have
to<00:06:03.909> happen<00:06:04.089> it's<00:06:04.360> going<00:06:04.479> to<00:06:04.599> sound<00:06:04.750> good<00:06:04.960> with

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
to happen it's going to sound good with

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.499 
to happen it's going to sound good with
that<00:06:05.259> and<00:06:05.529> then<00:06:06.370> instead<00:06:06.759> of<00:06:06.819> a<00:06:07.000> pull<00:06:07.240> tech

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
that and then instead of a pull tech

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.570 
that and then instead of a pull tech
after<00:06:09.659> after<00:06:10.659> that<00:06:10.810> compressor<00:06:11.379> up<00:06:11.529> I<00:06:11.830> might

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
after after that compressor up I might

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.519 
after after that compressor up I might
actually<00:06:13.120> put<00:06:13.569> something<00:06:13.839> in<00:06:14.050> front<00:06:14.259> of<00:06:14.379> the

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
actually put something in front of the

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:16.559 
actually put something in front of the
compressor<00:06:14.800> and<00:06:15.310> then<00:06:15.909> I've<00:06:16.029> tried<00:06:16.300> in<00:06:16.479> the

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
compressor and then I've tried in the

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:17.070 
compressor and then I've tried in the
back

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
back

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.329
