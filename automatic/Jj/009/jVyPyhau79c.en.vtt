the picture is about so again I made
these<00:01:43.890> pockets<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> did<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> ran

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
these pockets and what I did was I ran

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.560 
these pockets and what I did was I ran
some<00:01:46.259> tape<00:01:46.530> along<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> bottom<00:01:47.420> instead<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
some tape along the bottom instead of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.889 
some tape along the bottom instead of
gluing<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.970> when<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.570> stick<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
gluing because then when you stick the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.109 
gluing because then when you stick the
picture<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.439> it'll<00:01:53.070> stick<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> tape<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
picture in it'll stick to the tape and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.789 
picture in it'll stick to the tape and
it'll<00:01:54.540> hold<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> worry

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it'll hold it so you don't have to worry

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.730 
it'll hold it so you don't have to worry
about<00:01:56.070> anything<00:01:56.369> falling<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.439> also
