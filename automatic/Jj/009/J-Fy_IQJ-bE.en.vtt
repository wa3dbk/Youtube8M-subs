00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay I managed to get the dashboard put

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.099 
okay I managed to get the dashboard put
back<00:00:05.700> together<00:00:06.000> enough<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.569> just<00:00:06.870> kind<00:00:07.080> of

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
back together enough to just kind of

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.680 
back together enough to just kind of
hold<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.529> place<00:00:07.970> we<00:00:08.970> need<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.300> put<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
hold it in place we need to put the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.200 
hold it in place we need to put the
little<00:00:10.040> faceplate<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.070> there<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.550> course<00:00:11.759> but

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
little faceplate on there of course but

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.480 
little faceplate on there of course but
it'll<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.139> good<00:00:13.320> enough<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.559> test<00:00:13.920> purposes

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it'll be good enough for test purposes

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.490 
it'll be good enough for test purposes
and<00:00:15.619> here<00:00:16.619> are<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> keys<00:00:16.949> we've<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.699> keys

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
and here are the keys we've got the keys

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.040 
and here are the keys we've got the keys
so<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:20.400> let's<00:00:20.970> give<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.330> test<00:00:21.510> let's<00:00:21.900> see

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
so now let's give it a test let's see

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.019 
so now let's give it a test let's see
what<00:00:22.230> it'll<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.820> any

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
what it'll do here we don't have any

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
what it'll do here we don't have any
fuel<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> fuel<00:00:24.840> system<00:00:25.080> yet<00:00:25.410> we're<00:00:25.590> just

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
fuel in the fuel system yet we're just

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.679 
fuel in the fuel system yet we're just
going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> check<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> starter<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.269> let's<00:00:27.449> see

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
going to check the starter so let's see

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.700 
going to check the starter so let's see
what<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.470> low<00:00:29.369> air<00:00:30.380> twelve<00:00:31.380> point

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
what we go out here low air twelve point

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.930 
what we go out here low air twelve point
six<00:00:31.920> volts<00:00:32.899> here<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:40.370> yeah<00:00:41.370> starter<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
six volts here we go yeah starter is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.350 
six volts here we go yeah starter is
going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> crank<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.850> looks

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
going to crank so now that that looks

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.880 
going to crank so now that that looks
like<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.780> all<00:00:45.960> okay<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> put

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
like it's all okay we're going to put

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.180 
like it's all okay we're going to put
some<00:00:47.100> fuel<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.809> fuel<00:00:48.809> tank<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:50.039> if

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
some fuel in the fuel tank and see if

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.299 
some fuel in the fuel tank and see if
it'll<00:00:50.370> fire<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:51.680> now<00:00:52.680> I've<00:00:52.770> got<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.100> bit

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
it'll fire up now I've got a little bit

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.279 
it'll fire up now I've got a little bit
of<00:00:53.370> gas<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> carburetor<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.660> got<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
of gas in the carburetor and got the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.090 
of gas in the carburetor and got the
external<00:00:55.800> fuel<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.399> mounted<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> let's<00:00:58.920> give

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
external fuel can mounted so let's give

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:19.700 
external fuel can mounted so let's give
it<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> shot

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.929 

and<00:01:20.710> now<00:01:20.860> we're<00:01:21.070> getting<00:01:21.189> something<00:01:21.789> let's

and now we're getting something let's
pull<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.270> choke<00:01:22.509> out

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.580

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.300 

the<00:01:46.100> engine<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:46.880> running<00:01:47.530> got<00:01:48.530> good<00:01:48.740> charging

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
the engine is running got good charging

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.890 
the engine is running got good charging
14<00:01:49.850> volts

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:04.999 

rpm<00:01:55.900> about<00:01:57.119> 1900

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:15.059 

oil<00:02:05.549> pressure<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.509> okay

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.610

see
let's<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.130> throttle<00:02:17.670> check<00:02:17.940> here

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.440 

hey<00:02:25.030> Idol<00:02:25.480> speed<00:02:25.750> looks<00:02:26.019> good<00:02:27.090> let's<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.329> go

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
hey Idol speed looks good let's just go

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.220 
hey Idol speed looks good let's just go
up<00:02:28.629> here<00:02:28.659> and<00:02:29.109> see<00:02:29.319> what's<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.650> on

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.530 

air<00:02:34.740> compressor<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.400> venting<00:02:36.060> air<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
air compressor just venting air the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.650 
air compressor just venting air the
atmosphere<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.880> we're<00:02:38.880> going<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.090> need<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.420> put

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
atmosphere so we're going to need to put

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.990 
atmosphere so we're going to need to put
up<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.709> hose<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.340> there<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:43.310> cover<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.610> up<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
up the hose on there to cover that up so

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.430 
up the hose on there to cover that up so
we<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.270> build<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.540> some<00:02:45.750> air<00:02:45.930> pressure<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
we can build up some air pressure in the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.670 
we can build up some air pressure in the
air<00:02:46.650> tanks<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.599> sounds<00:02:49.020> real<00:02:49.230> good<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
air tanks but it sounds real good and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.199 
air tanks but it sounds real good and
quiet<00:02:50.930> I'm<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.170> try<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.940> looks<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.090> we

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
quiet I'm going to try and looks like we

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.000 
quiet I'm going to try and looks like we
may<00:02:54.360> be<00:02:54.390> burning<00:02:54.750> some<00:02:55.050> oil<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:58.709> guts

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
may be burning some oil that good guts

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:12.979 
may be burning some oil that good guts
and<00:02:59.340> smoke<00:02:59.580> come<00:02:59.819> from<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.120> tailpipe

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.309 

I'm<00:03:13.470> going<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.709> go<00:03:13.800> ahead<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.250> put<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:15.319> put

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
I'm going to go ahead and put the put

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.790 
I'm going to go ahead and put the put
the<00:03:16.349> hose<00:03:16.709> on<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.660> air<00:03:18.660> compressor<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.650> can

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
the hose on the air compressor so it can

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.440 
the hose on the air compressor so it can
build<00:03:19.980> up<00:03:20.130> some<00:03:20.340> pressure<00:03:20.370> maybe<00:03:20.970> go<00:03:21.209> for<00:03:21.420> a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
build up some pressure maybe go for a

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.729 
build up some pressure maybe go for a
little<00:03:21.599> run<00:03:21.900> here<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:23.400> shut<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:23.970> off<00:03:24.120> here

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.320 

here's<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.920> fuel<00:03:29.130> tank<00:03:29.430> setup<00:03:29.730> just<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:30.209> I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
here's the fuel tank setup just like I

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.870 
here's the fuel tank setup just like I
done<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.780> other<00:03:30.930> buses<00:03:31.459> hook<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.640> up<00:03:32.819> to

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
done on the other buses hook this up to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.000 
done on the other buses hook this up to
the<00:03:33.090> input<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.660> fuel<00:03:33.930> pump<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.410> ensure<00:03:34.769> we

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
the input of the fuel pump to ensure we

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.710 
the input of the fuel pump to ensure we
get<00:03:35.130> clean<00:03:35.489> fuel<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:38.150> looks<00:03:39.150> like<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.510> got<00:03:39.690> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
get clean fuel and looks like we got a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.479 
get clean fuel and looks like we got a
little<00:03:39.959> bit<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.319> a<00:03:40.410> fuel<00:03:40.739> leak<00:03:41.010> there<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
little bit of a fuel leak there at the

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.360 
little bit of a fuel leak there at the
carburetor<00:03:42.140> better<00:03:43.140> check<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.709> out<00:03:43.920> before

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
carburetor better check that out before

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.070 
carburetor better check that out before
I<00:03:44.400> go<00:03:44.670> any<00:03:44.910> further<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.330> see<00:03:45.690> where<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.870> may

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
I go any further just see where it may

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.970 
I go any further just see where it may
be<00:03:46.110> leaking<00:03:46.620> from<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:48.140> think<00:03:49.140> about<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.530> bit<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:49.860> a

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
be leaking from I think about a bit of a

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.670 
be leaking from I think about a bit of a
leak<00:03:50.250> at<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.580> flow<00:03:51.480> Bowl<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.080> Holley<00:03:52.290> so

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
leak at the flow Bowl on the Holley so

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.309 
leak at the flow Bowl on the Holley so
I'm<00:03:52.769> not<00:03:52.890> going<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.130> run<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.489> too<00:03:53.700> long<00:03:54.319> but

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
I'm not going to run it too long but

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:18.490 
I'm not going to run it too long but
just<00:03:55.620> look<00:03:56.340> at<00:03:56.670> how<00:03:56.940> easily<00:03:57.299> this<00:03:57.660> starts<00:03:58.049> up

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:35.040 

the<00:04:18.709> air<00:04:18.980> pressure<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.519> increasing

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.040 

see<00:04:35.590> if<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.800> can<00:04:36.009> get<00:04:36.160> an<00:04:36.250> update<00:04:36.660> we<00:04:37.660> get<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:37.960> up

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
see if I can get an update we get it up

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.270 
see if I can get an update we get it up
to<00:04:38.199> 60<00:04:38.710> air

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
to 60 air

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.409 
to 60 air
I<00:04:40.199> want<00:04:41.199> to<00:04:41.259> leak<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.830> little<00:04:42.789> bit<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.090> fuel

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
I want to leak a little bit of a fuel

00:04:43.419 --> 00:05:02.250 
I want to leak a little bit of a fuel
leak<00:04:43.630> there<00:04:43.930> so<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.229> don't<00:04:44.319> want<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.590> run<00:04:44.740> a.22

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
and the lower air indicator is off let's

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.370 
and the lower air indicator is off let's
see<00:05:05.080> if<00:05:05.260> we<00:05:05.380> can<00:05:05.530> go<00:05:05.680> forward<00:05:06.190> a<00:05:06.250> little<00:05:06.280> bit<00:05:06.550> to

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
see if we can go forward a little bit to

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.280 
see if we can go forward a little bit to
our<00:05:08.380> first<00:05:08.680> gear<00:05:09.040> this<00:05:09.250> year<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.810> we're<00:05:11.260> going

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
our first gear this year and we're going

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.500 
our first gear this year and we're going
to<00:05:11.410> give<00:05:11.950> it<00:05:12.040> a<00:05:12.070> little<00:05:12.220> gas<00:05:15.060> let<00:05:16.060> up<00:05:16.180> off<00:05:16.330> the

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
to give it a little gas let up off the

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:24.629 
to give it a little gas let up off the
clutch<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.620> it's<00:05:20.920> moving

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:31.439 

apply<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.240> parking<00:05:25.539> brake<00:05:29.849> and<00:05:30.849> I<00:05:31.030> think<00:05:31.270> it's

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
apply the parking brake and I think it's

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.960 
apply the parking brake and I think it's
gonna<00:05:31.689> run
