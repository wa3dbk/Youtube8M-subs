00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.719
 so the future of parking looks 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.010
 the car looks fully automated 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.930
 a parking lot 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.270
 it is an electric vehicle 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.970
 it is in need independently to 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.029
 The charge is called the technique 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.800
 is already functional today 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.230
 the driver only has to use a smartphone 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.770
 The order to park give the rest 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.420
 the vehicle alone does it 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.610
 thus the next stage of the so-called 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.320
 world parkings at the one more 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.520
 employee of the parking lot or 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.260
 parking garage the car is parked 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.120
 That's why it gives our customers more comfort and convenience 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.800
 to offer more time wins 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.390
 That's possible because the customers are themselves 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.940
 no more about parking or the 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.420
 Car parking must take care of the same way 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.739
 loading the second aspect is the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.320
 infrastructure for loading from 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 Electric vehicles are not available today 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.049
 so well developed and with this 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.559
 Project is it possible this 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:05.530
 significantly better use of the infrastructure 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.940
 because the car thinks with is the battery 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.360
 loaded makes the vehicle the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.190
 charging cup for others free around 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.560
 to be able to orient 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.810
 vehicle a digital three-dimensional 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.000
 card transmits this contains all 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.090
 Information for navigation in the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 park plant based on natural 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.420
 landmarks from camera images 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.160
 the vehicle knows its own at any time 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.250
 position a novum 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.660
 it would come out without GPS 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 not in parking lots anyway 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.190
 function 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.140
 with the help of four wide-angle cameras 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.060
 two stereo cameras and twelve 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.610
 Ultrasonic sensors capture the car 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.280
 his environment logos obstacles like 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.330
 pedestrians or other vehicles 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 reliably detected 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.900
 the charts is a european one 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.180
 Research project on the next 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.740
 Volkswagen also bosch and well-known 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.690
 universities are involved 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.680
 one goal was the cost of the 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.970
 technology as low as possible 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.010
 in bios advantage we actually come 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.990
 only sensors used today 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.760
 are commercially available and often already 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.210
 most already installed in the vehicle 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.979
 are 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.890
 we have shown that too 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.140
 Sensors are possible to drive autonomously 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.260
 to locate and collide 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.629
 avoid 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.909
 The system works with high precision the 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.950
 Car parks centimeters exactly 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.139
 This could save the required parking space 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.180
 to be smaller in the future and in the car 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.879
 thus the already scarce parking space 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.829
 be used more efficiently and the 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.719
 driver I do not have to remember where he is 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.150
 car turned off because 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.680
 Of course , the car will pick him up 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.680
 Button pressure also breath again
