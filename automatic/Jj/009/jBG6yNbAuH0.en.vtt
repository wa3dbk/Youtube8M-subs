00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
and i'm on my penetrate cannon map which

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.080 
and i'm on my penetrate cannon map which
is<00:00:07.649> an<00:00:07.799> improvement<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.460> set<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.790> blinks

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
is an improvement on set the blinks

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.150 
is an improvement on set the blinks
version<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.080> an<00:00:10.380> improvement<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:10.980> my

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
version and this is an improvement on my

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.390 
version and this is an improvement on my
previous<00:00:11.400> version<00:00:11.969> which<00:00:13.040> yeah<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
previous version which yeah it's a

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.609 
previous version which yeah it's a
significant<00:00:14.910> improvement<00:00:15.059> i'll<00:00:15.509> go<00:00:16.049> over<00:00:16.080> in

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
significant improvement i'll go over in

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.250 
significant improvement i'll go over in
a<00:00:17.010> second<00:00:17.460> first<00:00:18.119> off<00:00:18.359> let's<00:00:18.660> just<00:00:18.900> fire<00:00:19.230> it

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
a second first off let's just fire it

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:29.660 
a second first off let's just fire it
and<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> goes<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:28.050> yes<00:00:28.949> massive

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and see how it goes so yes massive

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.590 
and see how it goes so yes massive
destruction<00:00:30.150> happening<00:00:31.050> them<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.420> off

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
destruction happening them so first off

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.060 
destruction happening them so first off
here's<00:00:33.960> how<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:35.149> fill<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.390> 20<00:00:38.780> just<00:00:40.070> put

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
here's how we fill it with 20 just put

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.020 
here's how we fill it with 20 just put
all<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.399> Thun<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:43.850> power<00:00:44.850> up

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
all of that Thun do that to power up

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:55.569 
all of that Thun do that to power up
this<00:00:45.360> shot<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:47.300> whole<00:00:48.300> column

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.780 

I'll<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.879> take<00:00:57.780> note<00:00:58.110> these<00:00:58.440> positions<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
I'll just take note these positions in

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.579 
I'll just take note these positions in
the<00:01:00.089> single-player<00:01:00.449> grounds<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> just

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
the single-player grounds so it can just

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:12.190 
the single-player grounds so it can just
copy<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.980> paste<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.670> future<00:01:10.670> right

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
copy and paste these in the future right

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:23.300 
copy and paste these in the future right
so<00:01:13.200> yes<00:01:13.440> if<00:01:14.399> you're<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.149> again<00:01:22.310> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
so yes if you're just for it again so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.810 
so yes if you're just for it again so
two<00:01:23.610> shots<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.210> has<00:01:24.330> done<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:25.070> large<00:01:26.070> amount<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
two shots it has done a large amount to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.680 
two shots it has done a large amount to
damage<00:01:27.149> to<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.390> structure<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
damage to that structure so the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.960 
damage to that structure so the
principle<00:01:30.690> of<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.929> is<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.399> we<00:01:32.789> have

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
principle of this is that we all we have

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.169 
principle of this is that we all we have
these<00:01:33.630> stacks<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.770> fitness<00:01:35.640> pits<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
these stacks of fitness pits and

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.160 
these stacks of fitness pits and
pressure<00:01:36.990> plates<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:38.479> my<00:01:39.479> previous<00:01:39.750> version

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
pressure plates in my previous version

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.160 
pressure plates in my previous version
the<00:01:40.500> player<00:01:40.770> would<00:01:41.009> fall<00:01:41.250> through<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:43.020> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the player would fall through but in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.529 
the player would fall through but in
this<00:01:43.350> version<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.950> i'm<00:01:44.640> using<00:01:45.000> mobs<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
this version I i'm using mobs and

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.790 
this version I i'm using mobs and
zombies<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.679> this<00:01:46.800> case<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> we've<00:01:49.649> got

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
zombies in this case so we've got

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.889 
zombies in this case so we've got
zombies<00:01:50.009> which<00:01:50.789> get<00:01:51.149> spawned<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> these

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
zombies which get spawned out to these

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.969 
zombies which get spawned out to these
dispensers<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.989> short<00:01:54.989> while<00:01:55.110> later<00:01:55.289> for

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
dispensers and a short while later for

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.690 
dispensers and a short while later for
ticks<00:01:56.220> later<00:01:56.399> earth<00:01:56.700> believe<00:01:57.860> we<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.459> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
ticks later earth believe we have this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.990 
ticks later earth believe we have this
pittston<00:02:00.179> far<00:02:00.479> enough<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.140> approach<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
pittston far enough to approach the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.199 
pittston far enough to approach the
zombie<00:02:03.020> into<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.200> fence<00:02:04.679> post<00:02:05.119> putting<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
zombie into this fence post putting it

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.910 
zombie into this fence post putting it
in<00:02:06.300> exactly<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:06.929> place<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.440> go<00:02:07.649> through

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
in exactly the right place to go through

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.809 
in exactly the right place to go through
these<00:02:08.099> pressure<00:02:08.459> plates<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.200> also<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.819> trap

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
these pressure plates and also this trap

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.080 
these pressure plates and also this trap
door<00:02:12.030> open<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.599> they<00:02:12.930> fall<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.550> we<00:02:14.550> have<00:02:14.730> both

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
door open so they fall and we have both

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.270 
door open so they fall and we have both
of<00:02:15.120> these<00:02:15.450> set<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.500> go<00:02:16.739> off<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.220> same

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
of these set up to go off at the same

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.960 
of these set up to go off at the same
time<00:02:17.720> which<00:02:18.720> means<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:20.459> zombies<00:02:20.879> will

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
time which means that the zombies will

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.490 
time which means that the zombies will
be<00:02:21.270> exactly<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.840> same<00:02:21.900> place<00:02:22.200> both<00:02:22.830> sides<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
be exactly the same place both sides and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.520 
be exactly the same place both sides and
each<00:02:25.500> side<00:02:26.340> will<00:02:27.270> trigger<00:02:27.540> off<00:02:27.720> alternate

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
each side will trigger off alternate

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.360 
each side will trigger off alternate
piece<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.220> G&amp;T<00:02:30.319> so<00:02:31.319> compared<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.220> my<00:02:32.340> previous

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
piece of G&amp;T so compared to my previous

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.110 
piece of G&amp;T so compared to my previous
designed<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.450> means<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.470> shot<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.120> doubled

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
designed this means the shot is doubled

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.140 
designed this means the shot is doubled
in<00:02:36.300> power<00:02:36.830> can<00:02:37.830> fit<00:02:38.099> in<00:02:38.250> twice<00:02:38.459> as<00:02:38.610> much<00:02:38.700> TNT

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
in power can fit in twice as much TNT

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.940 
in power can fit in twice as much TNT
and<00:02:41.269> also<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.540> don't<00:02:42.750> need<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.349> keep<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.860> up

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
and also you don't need to keep going up

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.180 
and also you don't need to keep going up
and<00:02:44.069> down<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.720> fire<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> tough<00:02:46.050> because<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.800> just

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
and down to fire a tough because in just

00:02:47.190 --> 00:03:02.470 
and down to fire a tough because in just
few<00:02:47.280> zombies<00:02:47.670> at<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.910> top

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:12.710 

it's<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.810> fun<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.109> keep<00:03:04.500> pasting<00:03:04.769> this

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.000 

yeah<00:03:13.520> pretty<00:03:14.520> awesome<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:19.410> one<00:03:19.740> thing

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
yeah pretty awesome so the one thing

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.130 
yeah pretty awesome so the one thing
which<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.280> might<00:03:20.730> be<00:03:20.910> thinking<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.720> this

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
which you might be thinking is that this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.170 
which you might be thinking is that this
can't<00:03:22.440> be<00:03:22.560> used<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.860> survival<00:03:23.370> mode<00:03:23.400> because<00:03:23.760> I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
can't be used in survival mode because I

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.980 
can't be used in survival mode because I
yeah<00:03:24.900> i'm<00:03:25.050> using<00:03:25.380> these<00:03:25.500> spawning<00:03:26.040> eggs<00:03:26.990> well

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
yeah i'm using these spawning eggs well

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.930 
yeah i'm using these spawning eggs well
my<00:03:28.410> suggestion<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.280> would<00:03:29.460> be<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.880> you

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
my suggestion for that would be that you

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.780 
my suggestion for that would be that you
can<00:03:30.060> hook<00:03:30.690> these<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.200> mob<00:03:32.100> spawners<00:03:32.430> if

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
can hook these up to mob spawners if

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.480 
can hook these up to mob spawners if
you've<00:03:33.090> seen<00:03:33.300> eat<00:03:33.630> those<00:03:33.990> mob<00:03:34.740> spawners<00:03:35.040> they

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
you've seen eat those mob spawners they

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.920 
you've seen eat those mob spawners they
would<00:03:35.700> be<00:03:36.180> able<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.600> spawn<00:03:37.070> sufficient<00:03:38.930> mobs

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
would be able to spawn sufficient mobs

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.910 
would be able to spawn sufficient mobs
of<00:03:40.200> their<00:03:40.530> correct<00:03:40.980> dimensions<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:42.560> time<00:03:43.560> for

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
of their correct dimensions in time for

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.820 
of their correct dimensions in time for
you<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.250> survival<00:03:45.030> need<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.450> be<00:03:45.680> filling<00:03:46.680> this

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
you in survival need to be filling this

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.240 
you in survival need to be filling this
kind<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.250> backup<00:03:47.550> with<00:03:47.730> TNT<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:49.709> that

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
kind of backup with TNT so I think that

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.720 
kind of backup with TNT so I think that
would<00:03:50.760> work<00:03:51.080> fine<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:53.250> haven't<00:03:53.520> set<00:03:53.700> up

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
would work fine I just haven't set up

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.030 
would work fine I just haven't set up
because<00:03:54.270> I'm<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.660> creator<00:03:54.930> made<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.830> a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
because I'm in creator made and it's a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.130 
because I'm in creator made and it's a
bit<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.310> effort<00:03:56.640> for<00:03:56.670> no<00:03:57.030> real<00:03:57.240> gain<00:03:59.959> so<00:04:00.959> yeah

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
bit of effort for no real gain so yeah

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.199 
bit of effort for no real gain so yeah
there's<00:04:01.530> going<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.070> download<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.180> the
