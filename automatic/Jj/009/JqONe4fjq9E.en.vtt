Ubbe gamers Inc 194 here I'm showing you
the<00:00:06.390> semi-auto<00:00:07.140> jitter<00:00:07.919> glitch<00:00:08.519> with<00:00:12.440> my

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the semi-auto jitter glitch with my

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.590 
the semi-auto jitter glitch with my
initial<00:00:15.020> take<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.529> when<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.720> on<00:00:19.340> youtube

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
initial take on this when I on youtube

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.689 
initial take on this when I on youtube
was<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.779> immediately<00:00:22.439> thought<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.070> there<00:00:23.580> was

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
was I immediately thought that there was

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.630 
was I immediately thought that there was
no<00:00:23.939> way<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.990> could<00:00:25.410> work<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> mod

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
no way that this could work it was a mod

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.450 
no way that this could work it was a mod
or<00:00:26.670> something<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.050> had<00:00:28.650> no<00:00:29.250> idea

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
or something like that I had no idea

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
or something like that I had no idea
that<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.439> could<00:00:32.239> possibly<00:00:33.239> work<00:00:33.559> so

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that it actually could possibly work so

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.660 
that it actually could possibly work so
the<00:00:35.399> steps<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.969> doing<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.620> opinion<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the steps to doing this in my opinion I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
the steps to doing this in my opinion I
have<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.570> Barrett<00:00:40.469> 50<00:00:40.649> Cal<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> needle<00:00:41.870> my

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
have a Barrett 50 Cal and a needle my

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.950 
have a Barrett 50 Cal and a needle my
perks<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:44.000> light<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.890> steady<00:00:46.890> aim<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.960> I

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
perks are light up and steady aim and I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720 
perks are light up and steady aim and I
can't<00:00:49.260> remember<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> red<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.190> line<00:00:50.399> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
can't remember with the red one line I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
can't remember with the red one line I
don't<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.690> matters

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

ballistic vest and a UAV
I<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> could<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.670> counter

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
I don't know if you could use a counter

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.929 
I don't know if you could use a counter
UAV<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.360> haven't<00:01:09.659> tried<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.939> so

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
really matter but um

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.250 
really matter but um
so<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.980> course<00:02:47.299> before<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.660> before<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so of course before this before I

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.020 
so of course before this before I
actually<00:02:49.530> started<00:02:50.099> thinking<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.489> idea<00:02:50.790> to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
actually started thinking the idea to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.710 
actually started thinking the idea to
film<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.739> have<00:02:52.739> done<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.120> think<00:02:54.239> two

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
film it I have done it like I think two

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.770 
film it I have done it like I think two
or<00:02:54.750> three<00:02:54.959> times<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.790> game<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.540> I'm<00:02:57.659> in

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
or three times in this game that I'm in

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.199 
or three times in this game that I'm in
right<00:02:57.810> now<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.530> mean<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> bunch<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.730> my<00:02:59.849> friends

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
do it and it's really difficult to

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.360 
do it and it's really difficult to
explain<00:03:09.180> unless<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.319> see<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.709> tutorial<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
do it and you see right there I did it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.089 
do it and you see right there I did it
like<00:03:20.669> perfectly<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.599> also<00:03:22.019> your<00:03:22.290> gun<00:03:22.560> kind<00:03:22.950> of

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
like perfectly and also your gun kind of

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.039 
like perfectly and also your gun kind of
slowly<00:03:23.489> goes<00:03:24.359> down<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.450> scope<00:03:27.810> in

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
slowly goes down and you can scope in

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.710 
slowly goes down and you can scope in
with<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.879> but<00:03:29.879> I'm<00:03:30.030> letting<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.510> guys<00:03:30.660> know

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
with it but I'm letting you guys know

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.619 
with it but I'm letting you guys know
right<00:03:31.260> now<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.889> depends<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.940> time<00:03:33.180> but<00:03:33.510> as

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
right now it depends on the time but as

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.650 
right now it depends on the time but as
you<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.870> see<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.230> not<00:03:34.410> killing<00:03:35.040> him

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
you can see it's not killing him

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.960 
you can see it's not killing him
sometimes<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:37.079> does<00:03:37.500> kill<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.190> people<00:03:38.370> but

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
sometimes it does kill the people but

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.050 
sometimes it does kill the people but
not<00:03:39.269> all<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.780> time<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.379> you<00:03:41.099> can<00:03:41.280> stop<00:03:41.639> firing

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
not all the time and you can stop firing

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.890 
not all the time and you can stop firing
actually<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:44.190> if<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.519> stop<00:03:44.790> firing<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
actually and if you stop firing and you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.710 
actually and if you stop firing and you
start<00:03:46.169> firing<00:03:46.440> again<00:03:47.090> it'll<00:03:48.090> keep<00:03:48.269> going

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
start firing again it'll keep going

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.650
