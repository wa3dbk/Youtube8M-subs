than Henry even though he is a tender
engine<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.869> that's<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.920> his<00:01:50.640> smaller

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
engine but that's because of his smaller

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.920 
engine but that's because of his smaller
design<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:53.250> great<00:01:53.579> scale<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.720> good
