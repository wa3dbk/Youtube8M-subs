00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.830
 hey i am my day i am 17 years old 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:11.309
 old and I box that is many court 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.099
 with me 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.139
 that's up to 52 kilograms mine 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 successes are once German in 2010 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.250
 Master then fifth in the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.539
 european championships the international 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.380
 german champions 2011 germany for 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.380
 the german national team 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 at the beginning when I'm in the power room 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 I was pretty excited but now 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.540
 meanwhile I know what I can do 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.579
 and gimmicks and quite loose I have 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.710
 then we just have some 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.079
 Talents who offer themselves that means the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.920
 the requirements of the physical and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.409
 to fulfill the specific characteristics 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.659
 Of course, the omaha falls to me first 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.019
 none of the ninth grade now the tenth 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.909
 class attended here at the sports school 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.439
 if the development is so the course 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.000
 how it has gone so far is the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.500
 grandma has to be the next one 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
 makes itself internationally talked about 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.470
 he must not take if he his 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.030
 weight class so keep the 52 kilo 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.050
 want 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.090
 otherwise he has to go for four kilos 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.140
 heavier and possibly older 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.740
 compete 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.470
 and that would be the biggest 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.729
 problem for him, of course, first 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.280
 actually like all boxers but im 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.140
 moment for him the weight of the boxer 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.390
 actually always fights against two 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.240
 opponents first against the scales and then 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.990
 against against the opponents in his 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.000
 weight 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.220
 he strives, of course, but I have to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 Of course, that is one too 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.000
 difficult process in addition to the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.100
 athletic activity and of course the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.229
 school then too weight too 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.000
 reduce weight to just reduce it 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.720
 that you have to change your diet 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.920
 Of course this is associated with stress 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.729
 Of course, to the nervous 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.140
 substance goes 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.030
 and there are a few problems no 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.479
 I really have problems but you do 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.890
 always weight and it works now 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.500
 that's not three kilos but it's not 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.080
 So I'm very careful 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.700
 especially on my nutrition and sport 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.600
 michaty can be that's great 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.600
 then has this been going
