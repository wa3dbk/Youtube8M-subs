on<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.190> course<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.850> really<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.630> way<00:02:37.660> to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
on a course like this really the way to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.880 
on a course like this really the way to
go<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.940> didn't<00:02:39.940> feel<00:02:40.060> much<00:02:40.120> squirm<00:02:40.660> no<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
go I didn't feel much squirm no the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.980 
go I didn't feel much squirm no the
tires<00:02:42.160> were<00:02:42.430> hooked<00:02:42.730> these<00:02:43.480> tires<00:02:43.720> really

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
tires were hooked these tires really

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.840 
tires were hooked these tires really
have<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.560> stiff<00:02:44.980> construction<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.700> mean

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
have that stiff construction I mean

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.610 
have that stiff construction I mean
they've<00:02:46.030> really<00:02:46.600> got<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.750> stout<00:02:47.080> construction

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
they've really got a stout construction

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.320 
they've really got a stout construction
behind<00:02:47.860> them<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.550> really<00:02:48.670> transfers

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
behind them so that really transfers

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.460 
behind them so that really transfers
everything<00:02:49.450> back<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.050> going<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.260> give<00:02:50.410> you

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
everything back and is going to give you

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.290 
everything back and is going to give you
that<00:02:50.650> great<00:02:51.130> response<00:02:51.459> through<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.150> wheel

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
that great response through the wheel

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.850 
that great response through the wheel
some<00:02:52.630> good<00:02:53.140> choice

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
some good choice
