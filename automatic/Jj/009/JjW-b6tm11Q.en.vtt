00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to not allow my kid to have a nap so

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.010 
to not allow my kid to have a nap so
that<00:00:38.879> he'll<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> bed<00:00:39.300> earlier<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> sleep

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
that he'll go to bed earlier and sleep

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.970 
that he'll go to bed earlier and sleep
through<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> night<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:40.800> actually

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
through the night but that's actually

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740 
through the night but that's actually
counterproductive<00:00:41.879> isn't<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.570> right

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
counterproductive isn't it right

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.119 
counterproductive isn't it right
especially<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.320> young<00:00:43.559> children<00:00:43.950> have

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
especially really young children have

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.190 
especially really young children have
shorter<00:00:44.670> sleep<00:00:44.969> cycles<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.780> adults

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
shorter sleep cycles you know adults

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
shorter sleep cycles you know adults
probably<00:00:46.770> depending<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> person<00:00:47.850> six<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
probably depending on the person six to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
probably depending on the person six to
eight<00:00:48.300> hours<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.870> night<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.440> our<00:00:49.829> cycles<00:00:50.309> are

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
eight hours a night and our cycles are

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220 
eight hours a night and our cycles are
longer<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.969> yang<00:00:51.600> children<00:00:51.960> should<00:00:52.050> go

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
longer and yang children should go

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.750 
longer and yang children should go
through<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.530> quicker<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.039> they'll<00:00:53.550> sleep

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
through them quicker so they'll sleep

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
through them quicker so they'll sleep
for<00:00:53.820> shorter<00:00:54.360> bursts<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> time<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.320> then<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
for shorter bursts of time so then that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.590 
for shorter bursts of time so then that
may<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> good<00:00:56.399> idea<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> preschool

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
may be a good idea for the preschool

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.849 
may be a good idea for the preschool
children<00:00:57.780> actually<00:00:58.350> there's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.620> good

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
children actually there's a very good

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
children actually there's a very good
idea<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.309> preschool<00:00:59.760> children<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.690> I

you<00:03:18.070> can't<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.310> do<00:03:18.520> that<00:03:18.550> now<00:03:18.880> it's<00:03:19.420> a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
you can't really do that now it's a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.790 
you can't really do that now it's a
controversial<00:03:20.080> I<00:03:20.290> mean<00:03:20.440> there's<00:03:20.590> some

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
controversial I mean there's some

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.440 
controversial I mean there's some
evidence<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.610> catch<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:21.940> maybe<00:03:22.300> a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
evidence that you can catch up maybe a

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.900 
evidence that you can catch up maybe a
little<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.840> an<00:03:22.930> hour<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.430> opposite

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
little bit an hour to but the opposite

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.890 
little bit an hour to but the opposite
of<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.480> really<00:03:25.600> should

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
of that is that you really should

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.229 
of that is that you really should
maintain<00:03:26.080> some<00:03:26.730> behavior<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:27.940> sort<00:03:28.180> of

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
maintain some behavior that's sort of

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.060 
maintain some behavior that's sort of
consistent<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.050> if<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.470> have<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:29.950> at

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
consistent and if you have to get up at

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.350 
consistent and if you have to get up at
six<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.489> morning<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.120> get<00:03:31.239> up<00:03:31.330> so

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
six in the morning you have to get up so

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.180 
six in the morning you have to get up so
early<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.870> morning<00:03:31.959> then<00:03:32.590> decide<00:03:32.980> that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
early in the morning then decide that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.979 
early in the morning then decide that
Saturday<00:03:33.550> Sunday<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.880> can<00:03:33.940> sleep<00:03:34.209> 2<00:03:34.360> 10<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.690> 11

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
Saturday Sunday you can sleep 2 10 or 11

Saturday Sunday you can sleep 2 10 or 11
i<00:03:35.050> can<00:03:35.200> really<00:03:35.560> throw<00:03:35.800> your<00:03:36.010> rhythm<00:03:36.310> off<00:03:36.459> so

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
i can really throw your rhythm off so

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.940 
i can really throw your rhythm off so
there's<00:03:37.270> a<00:03:37.360> small<00:03:37.720> degree<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.650> can

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
there's a small degree that you can

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.470 
there's a small degree that you can
catch<00:03:39.220> up<00:03:39.250> but<00:03:39.580> overall<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:40.030> really<00:03:40.300> don't

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
catch up but overall you really don't

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.090 
catch up but overall you really don't
want<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.720> change<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.230> hours<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.830> sleep

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
want to change the hours that you sleep

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.590 
want to change the hours that you sleep
because<00:03:42.550> then<00:03:42.670> it's<00:03:42.820> hard<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.120> get<00:03:43.209> back<00:03:43.420> on

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
because then it's hard to get back on

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.530 
because then it's hard to get back on
rhythm<00:03:44.100> now<00:03:45.100> we're<00:03:45.790> almost<00:03:46.000> out<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.269> time<00:03:46.360> but

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
rhythm now we're almost out of time but

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.880 
rhythm now we're almost out of time but
I<00:03:46.600> want<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.810> get<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:46.959> how<00:03:47.260> we<00:03:47.320> can<00:03:47.620> make<00:03:47.739> it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
I want to get to how we can make it

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.410 
I want to get to how we can make it
better<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.400> know<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.519> improving<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> sleep

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
better you know to improving the sleep

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.090 
better you know to improving the sleep
patterns<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:50.260> how<00:03:50.410> do<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.560> do<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.739> well

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
patterns and so how do you do that well

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.530 
patterns and so how do you do that well
I<00:03:51.220> think<00:03:51.459> from<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.880> young<00:03:52.060> age<00:03:52.090> at<00:03:52.510> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
I think from a young age at the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.150 
I think from a young age at the
emphasized<00:03:52.989> we<00:03:53.200> talked<00:03:53.380> about<00:03:53.500> diet<00:03:53.830> we

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
emphasized we talked about diet we

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.610 
emphasized we talked about diet we
talked<00:03:54.370> about<00:03:54.519> exercise<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.200> sleep<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.440> sort

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
talked about exercise and sleep is sort

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.050 
talked about exercise and sleep is sort
of<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.800> third<00:03:57.040> arm<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.519> that<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:57.880> really

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
of the third arm of that so you really

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.670 
of the third arm of that so you really
have<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.209> build<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.540> into<00:03:58.810> your<00:03:58.900> lifestyle<00:03:59.380> I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
have to build that into your lifestyle I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.320 
have to build that into your lifestyle I
think<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.489> look<00:04:00.610> at<00:04:00.790> what<00:04:00.820> teenagers

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
think you have to look at what teenagers

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.750 
think you have to look at what teenagers
do<00:04:01.510> school<00:04:01.810> children<00:04:02.080> really<00:04:02.470> sort<00:04:02.800> of<00:04:02.890> sort

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
do school children really sort of sort

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.979 
do school children really sort of sort
of<00:04:03.880> set<00:04:04.030> up<00:04:04.150> time<00:04:04.330> where<00:04:04.480> they<00:04:04.540> have<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.810> sleep

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
of set up time where they have to sleep

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.210 
of set up time where they have to sleep
then<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.410> make<00:04:05.530> their<00:04:05.680> environment<00:04:06.130> more

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
then you can make their environment more

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.920 
then you can make their environment more
conducive<00:04:06.280> whether<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.330> television<00:04:07.870> in

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
conducive whether it's the television in
