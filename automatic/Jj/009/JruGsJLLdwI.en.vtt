00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
it really made the homeless smile and I

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.470 
it really made the homeless smile and I
was<00:00:14.160> like<00:00:14.280> man<00:00:14.429> that's<00:00:14.549> that's<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.210> cool<00:00:15.450> I

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.260 
so I thought it'd be cool to dress up as
one<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:19.980> favorite<00:00:20.310> superheroes<00:00:20.520> Iron<00:00:21.000> Man
