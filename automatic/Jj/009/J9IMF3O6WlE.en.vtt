the<00:04:06.150> W<00:04:06.540> shape<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.990> looks<00:04:07.020> more<00:04:07.380> movie

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
the W shape that looks more movie

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.480 
the W shape that looks more movie
accurate

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.590 

after<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.580> get<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> pattern<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.420> mouth

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
after you get the pattern on the mouth

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.640 
after you get the pattern on the mouth
then<00:04:15.840> you're<00:04:15.959> gonna<00:04:16.049> want<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.320> take<00:04:16.440> some

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
then you're gonna want to take some

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.410 
then you're gonna want to take some
black<00:04:16.829> thread<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:17.579> make<00:04:17.790> zigzags

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
black thread and just make zigzags

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:43.170 
black thread and just make zigzags
across<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.200> black<00:04:19.410> line

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.339 

so<00:04:44.180> by<00:04:44.330> now<00:04:44.539> your<00:04:44.749> mask<00:04:44.930> should<00:04:45.139> look

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
so by now your mask should look

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:46.719 
so by now your mask should look
something<00:04:45.650> like<00:04:45.889> this

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
something like this

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
and if it doesn't that means you've

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.929 
and if it doesn't that means you've
probably<00:04:48.590> done<00:04:48.830> something<00:04:49.159> terribly<00:04:49.849> wrong

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:49.939

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.960 
recommend would be figuring out a way to
tighten<00:06:14.350> the<00:06:14.530> mask<00:06:14.740> so<00:06:15.010> it<00:06:15.040> contours<00:06:15.640> to<00:06:15.730> the

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
tighten the mask so it contours to the

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.030 
tighten the mask so it contours to the
shape<00:06:16.150> of<00:06:16.270> your<00:06:16.330> face<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:17.200> first<00:06:17.440> mask<00:06:17.680> I<00:06:17.860> made

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
shape of your face the first mask I made

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.740 
shape of your face the first mask I made
had<00:06:18.280> a<00:06:18.310> tightening<00:06:18.760> system<00:06:19.030> involving<00:06:19.450> D

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
had a tightening system involving D

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.270 
had a tightening system involving D
rings<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.230> pieces<00:06:20.560> of<00:06:20.680> fabric<00:06:20.890> that

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
rings and pieces of fabric that

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.010 
rings and pieces of fabric that
stretched<00:06:21.970> from<00:06:22.120> one<00:06:22.210> side<00:06:22.540> of<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.720> next<00:06:22.960> to

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
stretched from one side of the next to

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.840 
stretched from one side of the next to
the<00:06:23.110> other<00:06:23.260> and<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.500> simply<00:06:23.710> grab<00:06:24.220> one<00:06:24.580> tab

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
the other and you simply grab one tab

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.060 
the other and you simply grab one tab
and<00:06:25.240> then<00:06:25.660> pulled<00:06:26.020> it<00:06:26.230> and<00:06:26.410> it<00:06:26.590> would<00:06:26.710> tighten

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
and then pulled it and it would tighten

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.920 
and then pulled it and it would tighten
with<00:06:27.190> the<00:06:27.340> other<00:06:27.460> side<00:06:27.760> I<00:06:28.090> felt<00:06:28.540> it's<00:06:28.720> just

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
with the other side I felt it's just

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.110 
with the other side I felt it's just
much<00:06:29.140> easier<00:06:29.590> to<00:06:29.770> make<00:06:29.920> yourself<00:06:30.280> rope<00:06:30.580> and

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
much easier to make yourself rope and

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.730 
much easier to make yourself rope and
what<00:06:31.240> I<00:06:31.270> did<00:06:31.450> was<00:06:31.600> took<00:06:31.780> nine<00:06:32.080> strands<00:06:32.560> of

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
what I did was took nine strands of

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.850 
what I did was took nine strands of
twine<00:06:33.070> in<00:06:33.400> sections<00:06:34.300> of<00:06:34.450> three<00:06:34.840> and<00:06:35.110> braided

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
twine in sections of three and braided

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.670 
twine in sections of three and braided
them<00:06:35.950> together<00:06:36.160> to<00:06:36.700> make<00:06:36.730> one<00:06:36.930> thin<00:06:37.930> rope<00:06:38.290> for

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
them together to make one thin rope for

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.020 
them together to make one thin rope for
the<00:06:38.770> rope<00:06:38.950> method<00:06:39.400> you<00:06:39.520> take<00:06:39.700> a<00:06:39.730> pretty

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
the rope method you take a pretty

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.150 
the rope method you take a pretty
shapeless<00:06:40.570> mask<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.200> then<00:06:41.650> you<00:06:41.740> put<00:06:41.890> the<00:06:42.010> rope

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
shapeless mask and then you put the rope

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.800 
shapeless mask and then you put the rope
around<00:06:42.280> the<00:06:42.640> neck<00:06:42.670> which<00:06:43.150> is<00:06:43.180> screen<00:06:43.570> accurate

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
around the neck which is screen accurate

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.250 
around the neck which is screen accurate
having<00:06:44.410> a<00:06:44.590> noose<00:06:45.070> around<00:06:45.220> the<00:06:45.490> neck<00:06:45.670> and<00:06:46.260> then

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
having a noose around the neck and then

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.680 
having a noose around the neck and then
you<00:06:47.380> tighten<00:06:47.650> it<00:06:47.860> and<00:06:48.390> tightening<00:06:49.390> the<00:06:49.480> mask

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
you tighten it and tightening the mask

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.420 
you tighten it and tightening the mask
gives<00:06:49.930> it<00:06:50.080> more<00:06:50.260> shape<00:06:50.530> and<00:06:50.770> it<00:06:50.920> fits<00:06:51.190> better

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
gives it more shape and it fits better

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.820 
gives it more shape and it fits better
