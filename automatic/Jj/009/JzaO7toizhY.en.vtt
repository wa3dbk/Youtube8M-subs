00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
they move across the screen like that
and<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.240> guys<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> very<00:01:30.869> very<00:01:31.170> creative

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and if you guys are a very very creative

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.830 
and if you guys are a very very creative
person<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.250> guess<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.390> could<00:01:33.689> be

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
person I guess you would you could be

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
person I guess you would you could be
able<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.470> cool<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
able to do something really cool with

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
able to do something really cool with
this<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.579> how<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this I don't really know how but you can

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.819 
this I don't really know how but you can
do<00:01:36.810> something<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.200> where<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> make

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
do something like that where you make

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.890 
do something like that where you make
the<00:01:38.040> block<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.670> move<00:01:39.060> across<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.720> screen

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the block if you move across the screen

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
the block if you move across the screen
which<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.290> essentially<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.799> did<00:01:40.950> by<00:01:41.100> moving

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
which I essentially just did by moving

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.880 
which I essentially just did by moving
the<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.180> C<00:01:42.420> right<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:43.590> different

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the little C right here into different

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.380 
the little C right here into different
slots<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> chest<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> appears

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
slots of the chest so it appears

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.030 
slots of the chest so it appears
differently<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.409> chest<00:01:46.649> preview<00:01:46.950> which

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
differently in the chest preview which

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
differently in the chest preview which
is<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.399> cool<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.960> you're<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
is really cool and you know if you're a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.929 
is really cool and you know if you're a
very<00:01:49.470> creative<00:01:49.770> person<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> think<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.340 
very creative person like so I think you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
