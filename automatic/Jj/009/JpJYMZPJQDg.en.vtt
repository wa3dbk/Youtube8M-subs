I'm<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.310> make<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> video<00:00:29.550> there<00:00:30.150> have

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
I'm going to make a video there have

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.790 
I'm going to make a video there have
been<00:00:30.330> several<00:00:30.720> others<00:00:31.080> videos<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.769> there

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
been several others videos out there

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
been several others videos out there
those<00:00:32.189> videos<00:00:32.309> are<00:00:32.520> usually<00:00:33.149> recorded<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
those videos are usually recorded with a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.090 
those videos are usually recorded with a
webcam<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:35.450> video<00:00:36.450> camera<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> little

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
webcam or video camera so it's a little

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
webcam or video camera so it's a little
bit<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.340> difficult<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> screen<00:00:39.390> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
bit more difficult to see the screen so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.850 
bit more difficult to see the screen so
I'm<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> deal<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:40.710> app

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I'm going to have to deal with an app

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
I'm going to have to deal with an app
that<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.879> make<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> little<00:00:42.390> easier<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.719> free<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that I make a little easier to free to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500
