00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.980
 as the fans lined up bewildered 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.020
 eyes 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.300
 sebastian klenner the captain of 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.000
 lausitzer füchse trained in the ice 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.500
 the price he was one of 16 players 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.180
 again for training in the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.370
 energy network arena use 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.290
 not possible for a candidate for 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.330
 the new ice lions team was for 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.970
 lion coach push only one hand 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.310
 person were much more in focus the 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 young player for very satisfied 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 you have to see that the players 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.910
 come here voluntarily in the summer 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.770
 leisure are still many 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.510
 players who want to recommend themselves 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.570
 from new contract also for next year 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.060
 for dresden dresdner ice lions but also 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.170
 in the verbund with chemnitz and yes we are 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.960
 actually very satisfied 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.270
 to the boys who are in dresden for 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.390
 would recommend higher tasks counted 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.340
 also sebastian koberger the 18-year-old 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.440
 played last season for Bad Tölz 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.850
 in the german junior league now 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.260
 wants the defender at the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.600
 adult prevail 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.019
 dresden in cooperation with chemnitz 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.370
 lock for koberger a real option 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.300
 young player is the future in the 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.979
 German ice hockey and we have to go with it 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.740
 have to play with young players because 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.070
 otherwise youth will break away sometime 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.360
 we do not have any practice anymore and 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.350
 So it goes with the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.670
 german national team 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.600
 also bach and just the young 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.960
 players do not get a game practice 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.880
 ambition, good fitness and good fitness 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.920
 solid education these are the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 Requirements the thomas doll poses 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.690
 regardless of the crosses in the environment 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.770
 the hockey focuses on the run 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.630
 on the sporty 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.250
 the timetable is the same as it always is 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.140
 very clear is the summer work of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.710
 Summer athletics training fitness 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.630
 training 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.240
 We will start with the boys in the beginning of august 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.010
 The older ones are already playing ice 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.560
 player or the contracts themselves go 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.450
 starting from 15 august with us and then 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.729
 begins the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.759
 is the training camp 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.340
 Preparatory games and then we go 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.399
 from that on 15 september song 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.200
 so mid-september is just like death 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.460
 said under which name that is 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.320
 still a bit under which star 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.149
 form but there we are I would have to 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.310
 there will be in the next weeks of 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.709
 dispute between German ice hockey 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.120
 Bund and the renegade second division 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.040
 is still in the room 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.780
 nobody knows under which roof the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.420
 will play second bundesliga 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.220
 the floating state was also a topic at 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.140
 try out camp in dresden 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.330
 because the uncertainty of the players 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.420
 is big you can not see him anymore 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.760
 by player always situation for the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.650
 but also for the fans for the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.930
 player anyway because no club can 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 By trade I know well German 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.120
 team plays in the league with there's 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.140
 league how many teams play 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.340
 I hope that it will be clarified quickly 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.709
 because we all really just want that 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.170
 played like skating in turn 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.079
 she wants to cover herself in the new de 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.269
 l two play more but do not say it 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.400
 Instead tinkering renato to pietsch 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.500
 the composition of the cadre of 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.209
 dresden firmly believes in the second league 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.280
 despite the difficulties with the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.239
 Association and your own financial 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.519
 problems 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.380
 yes we are already very much internally 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.880
 continue in the main idea 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.560
 Of course we have to do it now 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.359
 even to conclude there 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.799
 always two pages belong to one 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.430
 happens that player because it is the 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.049
 but the basic features are rough 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.280
 Team now we have to look that 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.660
 We'll be off like that in the next few weeks 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.549
 do tasks and then finished 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
 say the weigh is controversial 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.990
 also the ice lions and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.940
 react quickly 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.130
 Anyway, bruce becker clearly has to 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.870
 dresden known as he wants 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.630
 many players of the old team at 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.940
 the ice lions stay whether also sebastian 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.200
 koberger gets a contract that 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.200
 however, remains to be seen
