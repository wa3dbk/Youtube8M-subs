00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
turned default and then we have the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.039 
turned default and then we have the
first<00:03:41.500> part<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:42.010> turn<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:43.810> if<00:03:43.930> you

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
first part of a turn and then if you

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.600 
first part of a turn and then if you
wanted<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.409> continue<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.040> term<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.489> would

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
wanted to continue the term you would

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.399 
wanted to continue the term you would
just<00:03:45.819> keep<00:03:46.030> doing<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.840> fact<00:03:46.900> at<00:03:47.260> this

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
just keep doing that and in fact at this

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.300 
just keep doing that and in fact at this
point<00:03:47.530> what<00:03:47.890> we<00:03:47.980> can<00:03:48.159> do<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:49.150> take<00:03:49.450> front

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
point what we can do is take front

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.589 
point what we can do is take front
because<00:03:51.310> it's<00:03:51.519> close<00:03:51.909> enough<00:03:51.939> to<00:03:52.329> be<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.510> a

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
because it's close enough to be in a

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.319 
because it's close enough to be in a
head-on<00:03:52.810> shot<00:03:53.260> we<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.680> duplicate<00:03:54.430> it

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.789 

Renate<00:03:58.329> up<00:03:58.599> front<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.049> is<00:03:59.140> fine<00:03:59.319> let's<00:03:59.680> just

Renate up front to is fine let's just

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.289 
Renate up front to is fine let's just
keep<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.069> highlighted<00:04:00.459> come<00:04:00.790> over<00:04:01.000> here<00:04:01.180> to

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
keep it highlighted come over here to

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.220 
keep it highlighted come over here to
your<00:04:01.329> layer<00:04:03.090> flip<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:04.420> way<00:04:04.659> and<00:04:05.019> now
