00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.979
 very good to all welcome to me 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.810
 welcome to a new video channel 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:07.669
 you see we have the review of mauro icardi 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.960
 team of the season before you start with 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.280
 the video as always skies yes 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.140
 you support with a like if you can with 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.370
 your layperson I thank you very much and 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.530
 tell you that lately I'm doing 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.779
 enough reviews enough videos of 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.279
 this guy I think is something important 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.660
 interesting to do them because they are videos 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.189
 in which I think you can 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.689
 help a lot to decide if you want 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.910
 try a player then tell you and 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.740
 try it or if you are not sure that 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.659
 players tried what do you have ideas from 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.130
 what team do you then help you a little 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.320
 so you already know that if you talk about not 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.490
 I like you I appreciate it very much and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.810
 now we are going to start with the review 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.730
 from mauro icardi and I'm watching in 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.710
 screen the letter of this player clear 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.630
 is that I had not planned to try it but I 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.850
 someone said it for comments look at the 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.440
 letter caught my attention and I have 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.720
 try it and less badly because the truth 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.560
 that has surprised me for good 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.730
 we started to see a few goals and 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.170
 meanwhile I tell you a little about your 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.240
 statistics starting as always by 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.710
 the rhythm that according to the letter has 87 of 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.720
 rhythm I think it is a game with a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.640
 good speed I think it has the pace 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.930
 enough for that to be the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.850
 reference in a team to do the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.080
 reference above and that is the is a pass 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.670
 the hole can arrive before the 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 defenses or if you have field by 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.940
 in front you can start running 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.680
 and be faster than the defenders but 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.990
 logically it's not the players anymore 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.280
 fast that has been tested in the game 92 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.570
 of shooting that without a doubt the shot is the best 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.040
 what it has and more specifically its 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.470
 definition is what I liked the most 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.000
 if you are inside the area with him and he has 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.960
 the ball on the feet most likely is 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 that the ball ends up inside the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.240
 goal 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.340
 either with quality shooting or shot with 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.780
 power always defines great from 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.730
 medium long distance has also been 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.740
 with a very good shot over all 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.690
 noticed that his shooting in quality is very very 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.920
 good and the only bad thing about the shot is the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.480
 bad leg issue since it has 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.860
 only three bad leg stars 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.930
 and yes it is true that it shows 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.850
 that his good leg is right though 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.140
 logically if you are with the right and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.290
 with the left sorry 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.090
 you can score a goal and I say that I 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.680
 I've had a lot of tendency to shoot with 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.130
 his right leg because he noticed enough 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.510
 which was the one that best defined 86 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.240
 short pass has this player according to 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.190
 the letter has 70 of pass but 86 of 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.720
 short pass and the truth is that I noticed 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.430
 that has a good short pass like you have 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.350
 seen him likely a formation with two 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.150
 front and now make a wall or the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.280
 now give a pass I have not had any 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.110
 problem so in that sense you're not going to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.030
 have any problem this kind of 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.780
 dribble has enough agility has a 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.330
 good timing has a very good control 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.340
 but then he has three skills and that's 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.930
 something that limits very much since not 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.940
 you can practically dribble with 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.980
 him and this makes it very difficult 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.170
 generate chances of danger with him alone 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.540
 this is one of the reasons why 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.069
 I have tried aicardi has accompanied another 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.780
 front because if you tried it like 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.610
 single front and you were in the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.470
 situation that was only up the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.810
 only solution was to step back or 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.760
 try to go by speed this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.350
 way is easier since it can do 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.600
 some wall you can create new for a 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.130
 occasion with the other player but if 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.290
 you're just up is much more 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.420
 complicated to generate chances of danger 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.190
 with him alone so if you try it 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.660
 I recommend that you bring it with you 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.120
 another forward because if I do not think it does not 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.459
 will also finally render 82 of physical 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.410
 mauro icardi measures one meter 81 has 88 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.269
 of force and in the field you see a 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.590
 game with a good height or very high 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.540
 not very low for the truth is that you 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.519
 see a player with a good height and 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.840
 especially with a good corpulence and 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.100
 what I did want to highlight what yes 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.930
 I wanted to tell you is that I've noticed that 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.670
 has a big jump according to the folder and 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.130
 99 jump and the time is that I think that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.900
 the 99 seems a little exaggerated but 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.700
 I think I know that he has a good leap and has 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.850
 noticed that it jumps a lot and that many 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.680
 sometimes wins values 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.270
 to dig simply repeat what 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.860
 We've done it before you try it on 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.630
 do in a formation with two 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.760
 front since I think the 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.290
 arrest is to prove it with a 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.720
 in front now try it with two changes 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.800
 quite and that if you try it is 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.870
 probable a formation with two 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.250
 front so nothing kids I hope 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.720
 that liked the review and you know that 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.340
 If it's been like that, do not forget to leave 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.140
 you like your books to the channel only 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.980
 you are immersed in the next video 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.980
 see you soon
