you<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.719> there's<00:00:39.870> not<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> man<00:00:40.200> lying<00:00:40.469> on

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the ground it's a girl and it looks like

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.360 
the ground it's a girl and it looks like
could<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.360> patty<00:00:42.600> spivot<00:00:42.899> maybe<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:44.190> you're

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
could be patty spivot maybe so if you're

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.529 
could be patty spivot maybe so if you're
looking<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> picture<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.090> screen<00:00:45.239> now

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
looking at the picture on the screen now

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.760 
looking at the picture on the screen now
you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.899> tell<00:00:46.110> me<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.379> obvious<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you can tell me it's obvious just to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.950 
you can tell me it's obvious just to
back<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.340> picture<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.180> could<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.360> Felicity

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
back a picture so it could be Felicity

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.690 
back a picture so it could be Felicity
but<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.200> probably<00:00:49.350> gonna<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.590> patty<00:00:50.370> spivot

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
but it's probably gonna be patty spivot

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
but it's probably gonna be patty spivot
by<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.140> look<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> things<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> way<00:00:53.160> in

get<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> best<00:01:02.850> look<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.239> magar<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
get the best look but magar to the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.109 
get the best look but magar to the
actual<00:01:04.559> top<00:01:04.949> they've<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.430> changed<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> logo

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
actual top they've just changed the logo

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.450 
actual top they've just changed the logo
where<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.290> completely<00:01:07.740> yellow<00:01:08.100> just

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
where it's not completely yellow just

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.830 
where it's not completely yellow just
like<00:01:08.520> sort<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> an<00:01:08.909> outline<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.420> yellow<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
like sort of an outline of a yellow and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.390 
like sort of an outline of a yellow and
then<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> same<00:01:10.560> fabric<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
then so it's got the same fabric as the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520 
then so it's got the same fabric as the
actual<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:12.479> second<00:01:12.840> color<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> rest

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
actual all second color so is the rest

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.890 
actual all second color so is the rest
of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> actual<00:01:14.280> shirt<00:01:14.630> which<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
of the actual shirt which i think is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.940 
of the actual shirt which i think is
pretty<00:01:16.080> good<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.799> actually

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
pretty good so I think if they actually

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.640 
pretty good so I think if they actually
did<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> whole<00:01:18.090> full-on<00:01:18.450> yellow<00:01:18.990> bolt<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
did the whole full-on yellow bolt I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020 
did the whole full-on yellow bolt I
don't<00:01:20.250> think<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.490> would<00:01:20.580> work<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.850> well<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
don't think it would work as well I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
don't think it would work as well I
think<00:01:21.119> it'd<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.360> look<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.200> look<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.500> bit

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
think it'd be a look but look a bit

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.749 
think it'd be a look but look a bit
weird<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.670> good

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
weird but this is actually a really good

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.399 
weird but this is actually a really good
design<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> outline<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
design which just like the outline and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.340 
design which just like the outline and
the<00:01:26.220> pants<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.720> look<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.869> jeans

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the pants just like just look like jeans

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
the pants just like just look like jeans

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.359 
is actually gonna be narrow I think one
episode<00:01:57.659> could<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.110> too<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:59.009> from<00:01:59.219> one

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
episode could be too but from one

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.830 
episode could be too but from one
episode<00:01:59.790> from<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.090> they're<00:02:00.240> saying<00:02:00.479> so
