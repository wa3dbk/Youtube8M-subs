 that can relate 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.590
 belong now after sweeping 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
 third let's talk about the funds 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 we need

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.140
 with your evaluation 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.490
 the evaluations 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.540
 the evaluations in the system 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
 programmed by 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.570
 hard evaluation 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.090
 tie m to develop 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.680
 it is important that it is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 permanent act 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.670

 it is based on the follow-up of the course that they are 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.110
 another very important point 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.860
 the projects 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.540
 we want to tell you 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.540
 the topic has the possibility to work 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.900
 in the Times 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.200
 if we talk about the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 the period have to be inside the university 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.599
 the penances of their participation 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.919
 inside the university to work the sense of belonging 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.769
 all the elements 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.229
 yes I want to do 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.819
 students nor atlantis

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.489
 that project allen the witch is going to tell you that it can be local it can be 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.489
 regional was that throughout the network 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.329
 very important point 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.619
 you have to develop 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.459
 the readings are initially the first thing to do 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.959
 the act because suddenly unknown the system has the possibility 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.799
 to monitor your time 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.799
 how long it will take 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.159

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.369
 information 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.339
 why that 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.819
 in the system 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.689
 system has a fingerprint that does not have 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.189
 well tic before the problems are created when it is going to end 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.159

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.959
 and what can we do 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.579

 through them elements that exists 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.929
 I want to say something else 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.929
 need something extra is 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.140
 that a period ends to develop an existential crisis 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.009
 because there is no more 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.219
 nor the time to resolve 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.179
 then we welcome you thank you 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.279
