00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
further when you get surface action like

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.509 
further when you get surface action like
that<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.839> always<00:00:57.960> we're<00:00:58.260> throwing<00:00:58.499> a<00:00:58.889> small

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
that is always we're throwing a small

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.069 
that is always we're throwing a small
splice<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> match<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> hatch<00:01:01.050> for

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
splice in there to I match the hatch for

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.889 
splice in there to I match the hatch for
the<00:01:01.260> bait<00:01:01.499> fish<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.149> see<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.389> go<00:01:03.539> so

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the bait fish and see there we go so

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.179 
the bait fish and see there we go so
they'd<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.320> sort<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.589> chasing<00:01:05.040> little

breaking<00:01:47.090> up<00:01:47.149> on<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.360> surface<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:47.869> we<00:01:47.990> just

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
breaking up on the surface so we just

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.620 
breaking up on the surface so we just
saw<00:01:48.319> a<00:01:48.350> little<00:01:48.729> metal<00:01:49.729> splice<00:01:50.030> 20<00:01:50.390> grammar

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
saw a little metal splice 20 grammar

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.929 
saw a little metal splice 20 grammar
through<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.579> hooked<00:01:52.579> up<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:52.819> nice
