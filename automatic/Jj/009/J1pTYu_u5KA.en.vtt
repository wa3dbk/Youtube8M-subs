00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
outside if you're planning on doing

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.440 
outside if you're planning on doing
upgrades<00:01:09.500> like<00:01:09.980> windows<00:01:10.490> if<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.910> home<00:01:11.090> is<00:01:11.300> of

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
upgrades like windows if the home is of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.450 
upgrades like windows if the home is of
the<00:01:11.570> age<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:12.020> you've<00:01:12.170> got<00:01:12.440> older<00:01:13.130> windows

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
the age that you've got older windows

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.100 
the age that you've got older windows
possibly<00:01:13.880> wooden<00:01:14.180> windows<00:01:14.510> or<00:01:14.690> aluminum

possibly wooden windows or aluminum

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.350 
possibly wooden windows or aluminum
windows<00:01:15.410> then<00:01:15.980> I<00:01:16.010> would<00:01:16.430> highly<00:01:16.790> suggest<00:01:16.820> that

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
windows then I would highly suggest that

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.000 
windows then I would highly suggest that
you<00:01:17.540> at<00:01:17.690> least<00:01:17.720> go<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.560> approach<00:01:18.800> of

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
you at least go the approach of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.300 
you at least go the approach of
upgrading<00:01:19.520> your<00:01:20.420> windows<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.440> a<00:01:21.470> vinyl<00:01:21.920> type

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
upgrading your windows to a vinyl type

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.840 
upgrading your windows to a vinyl type
with<00:01:22.550> a<00:01:22.580> low<00:01:22.880> E<00:01:23.210> squared<00:01:23.830> triple-glazed<00:01:24.850> with

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
with a low E squared triple-glazed with

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.230 
with a low E squared triple-glazed with
argon<00:01:26.630> gas<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.800> gives<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.760> energy

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
argon gas that gives you the energy

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.910 
argon gas that gives you the energy
efficiency<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.020> you're<00:01:30.200> looking<00:01:30.530> at<00:01:30.710> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
efficiency that you're looking at and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.280 
efficiency that you're looking at and
then<00:01:31.400> as<00:01:31.580> far<00:01:31.820> as<00:01:31.880> siding<00:01:32.600> on<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.810> exterior

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
then as far as siding on the exterior

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.820 
then as far as siding on the exterior
you<00:01:33.979> could<00:01:34.430> even<00:01:34.640> add<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.330> minimum<00:01:36.260> of<00:01:36.409> one<00:01:36.650> inch

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
you could even add a minimum of one inch

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.310 
you could even add a minimum of one inch

of rigid foam insulation over top of
which<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.710> could<00:01:39.860> go<00:01:40.040> with<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.840> paper<00:01:41.840> like

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
which you could go with the paper like

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.520 
which you could go with the paper like
Tyvek<00:01:42.680> which<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> air<00:01:43.970> barrier<00:01:44.510> and<00:01:44.780> over
