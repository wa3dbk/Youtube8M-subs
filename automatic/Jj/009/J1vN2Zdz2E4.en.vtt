00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
in this video I want to show you the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.370 
in this video I want to show you the
method<00:00:03.090> i<00:00:03.179> would<00:00:03.360> use<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.689> solve<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.080> golden

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
method i would use to solve the golden

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.769 
method i would use to solve the golden
key<00:00:04.549> now<00:00:05.549> keep<00:00:05.759> in<00:00:05.879> mind<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.270> not<00:00:06.600> a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
key now keep in mind this is not a

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.450 
key now keep in mind this is not a
tutorial<00:00:07.020> it's<00:00:08.010> more<00:00:08.280> like<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:09.920> just<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.099> video

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
tutorial it's more like a just a video

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.730 
tutorial it's more like a just a video
to<00:00:11.910> show<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.570> type<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> method<00:00:13.230> i<00:00:13.290> use<00:00:13.500> in

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
to show you the type of method i use in

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.799 
to show you the type of method i use in
case<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.940> if<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> do<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.660> i

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
case you like it and if you do like it i

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.859 
case you like it and if you do like it i
will<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> full<00:00:16.410> tutorial<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.660> first

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
will make a full tutorial so the first

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.450 
will make a full tutorial so the first
one<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.590> first<00:00:19.619> thing<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.010> want<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.310> is

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
one the first thing you want to do is

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.750 
one the first thing you want to do is
get<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.910> tony<00:00:21.210> fisher<00:00:21.630> piece<00:00:21.990> right<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.760> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
get a tony fisher piece right here and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.210 
get a tony fisher piece right here and
it's<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.590> gotta<00:00:25.800> turn

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it's right here so you just gotta turn

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.269 
it's right here so you just gotta turn
turn<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.029> way<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:28.130> place<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
turn out the right way and place it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.749 
turn out the right way and place it
there<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> solve<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
there now we just have to solve the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000 
there now we just have to solve the
other<00:00:32.910> three<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.829> one

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
other three which is this one this one

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:54.790 
other three which is this one this one
to<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:45.600> piece<00:00:45.840> goes<00:00:46.110> there

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.889 

but<00:00:55.370> after<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.640> get<00:00:55.730> this<00:00:55.850> piece<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.270> flat<00:00:56.480> so

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
but after you get this piece of flat so

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.069 
but after you get this piece of flat so
let's<00:00:57.410> try<00:00:57.590> it<00:00:57.649> one<00:00:57.739> more<00:00:57.800> time<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:02.570> then<00:01:02.870> we

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
let's try it one more time and then we

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.079 
let's try it one more time and then we
just<00:01:03.320> have<00:01:03.470> to<00:01:03.620> solve<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.699> piece<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:04.940> goes

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
just have to solve the piece that goes

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.149 
just have to solve the piece that goes
here<00:01:05.239> now<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.140> piece<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.530> gonna<00:01:06.710> be<00:01:06.800> turned<00:01:07.070> a

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
here now this piece is gonna be turned a

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.170 
here now this piece is gonna be turned a
little<00:01:07.310> are<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:08.270> rotate<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> little<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:09.710> we

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
little are like rotate a little so we

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.340 
little are like rotate a little so we
want<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.330> figure<00:01:11.600> like<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:11.960> checking

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
want a figure like to the checking

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:21.399 
want a figure like to the checking
position<00:01:12.800> to<00:01:12.890> make<00:01:13.040> sure<00:01:13.190> it's<00:01:13.340> right<00:01:20.409> don't

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
position to make sure it's right don't

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.219 
position to make sure it's right don't
see<00:01:21.619> that's<00:01:21.830> how<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.040> was<00:01:22.130> going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.399> be<00:01:22.869> so<00:01:23.869> we

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
see that's how it was going to be so we

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.139 
see that's how it was going to be so we
already<00:01:24.380> solved<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.130> one<00:01:25.729> this<00:01:25.909> one<00:01:26.119> this

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
already solved this one this one this

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.450 
already solved this one this one this
one<00:01:26.300> this<00:01:26.450> one<00:01:26.770> snowy's<00:01:27.770> class<00:01:27.979> all<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.340> other

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
one this one snowy's class all the other

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
one this one snowy's class all the other
four<00:01:28.700> without<00:01:28.940> missing<00:01:29.240> those<00:01:29.360> up

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.930 

they're<00:01:37.620> all<00:01:37.770> messed<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.760> do<00:01:38.910> this

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
they're all messed up so we just do this

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:51.380 
they're all messed up so we just do this
algorithm<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.850> solved<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> let's<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.850> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
algorithm it solved two so let's go that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:38.200 
algorithm it solved two so let's go that
way

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.330 

now<00:02:39.210> we<00:02:39.270> solve<00:02:39.570> all<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.840> corners<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.130> you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
now we solve all the corners and all you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.790 
now we solve all the corners and all you
just<00:02:41.460> have<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.760> work<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.720> sinners<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
just have to work on the sinners and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:04:10.490 
just have to work on the sinners and
then<00:02:44.130> orientation

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.630 

and<00:04:11.500> now<00:04:11.620> we<00:04:11.680> flip<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.100> one<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.370> right<00:04:12.490> way

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
and now we flip this one the right way

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.970 
and now we flip this one the right way
we<00:04:13.540> have<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.690> solve<00:04:14.080> now<00:04:14.560> we<00:04:14.620> could<00:04:14.830> work<00:04:14.950> with

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
we have to solve now we could work with

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:26.340 
we have to solve now we could work with
the<00:04:15.250> rest<00:04:21.390> so<00:04:22.390> we<00:04:22.510> got<00:04:22.660> four<00:04:23.050> messed<00:04:23.320> up<00:04:25.350> these

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
the rest so we got four messed up these

00:04:26.350 --> 00:05:00.900 
the rest so we got four messed up these
two<00:04:26.530> need<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.770> swap<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.790> these<00:04:28.480> two<00:04:28.660> new<00:04:28.810> swap

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.370 

those<00:05:01.910> two<00:05:02.150> soft<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.870> just<00:05:03.050> leaves<00:05:03.260> us

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
those two soft and it just leaves us

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.960 
those two soft and it just leaves us
with<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.040> UM<00:05:04.930> parody<00:05:07.270> Center<00:05:08.270> parity<00:05:09.970> so

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
with the UM parody Center parity so

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.030 
with the UM parody Center parity so
these<00:05:11.150> two<00:05:11.420> need<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:12.620> one<00:05:12.830> needs<00:05:12.950> a

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
these two need to this one needs a

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.470 
these two need to this one needs a
hundred<00:05:13.520> eighty<00:05:13.640> degrees<00:05:13.670> and<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.240> is<00:05:14.360> this

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
hundred eighty degrees and so is this

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:22.690 
hundred eighty degrees and so is this
one<00:05:20.470> so<00:05:21.470> we're<00:05:21.590> going<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.800> do<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.010> this

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
one so we're going to do it this

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:38.320 
one so we're going to do it this
algorithm<00:05:23.030> six<00:05:23.450> times<00:05:25.780> one<00:05:29.170> two<00:05:33.340> three<00:05:37.330> four

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
algorithm six times one two three four

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:52.360 
algorithm six times one two three four
five<00:05:41.980> six

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.950 

now<00:05:53.370> we're<00:05:53.520> just<00:05:53.550> going<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:53.880> move<00:05:54.390> it<00:05:54.600> to<00:05:54.810> where

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
now we're just going to move it to where

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:06.320 
now we're just going to move it to where
do<00:05:55.830> too<00:05:56.490> soft<00:05:56.820> centers<00:05:57.150> are<00:05:57.270> by<00:05:57.390> each<00:05:57.510> other

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.219 

and<00:06:07.020> do<00:06:07.139> it<00:06:07.229> again<00:06:11.599> now<00:06:12.599> it's<00:06:12.840> just<00:06:12.960> going<00:06:13.169> to

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
and do it again now it's just going to

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.439 
and do it again now it's just going to
solve<00:06:13.470> itself<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:14.759> you<00:06:14.819> don't<00:06:15.030> have<00:06:15.090> to<00:06:15.210> count

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
solve itself so you don't have to count

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:43.360 
solve itself so you don't have to count
okay<00:06:40.219> so<00:06:41.219> I<00:06:41.669> know<00:06:41.849> this<00:06:42.060> isn't<00:06:42.300> the<00:06:42.599> best<00:06:42.810> video

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
okay so I know this isn't the best video

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.149 
okay so I know this isn't the best video
but<00:06:44.370> it's<00:06:44.460> more<00:06:44.639> like<00:06:44.789> a<00:06:44.819> method<00:06:45.590> video<00:06:46.590> like

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
but it's more like a method video like

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.219 
but it's more like a method video like
to<00:06:47.280> show<00:06:47.490> you<00:06:47.550> how<00:06:48.030> I<00:06:48.060> would<00:06:48.240> solve<00:06:48.690> the<00:06:48.810> golden

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
to show you how I would solve the golden

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:57.589 
to show you how I would solve the golden
cube<00:06:49.909> so<00:06:50.909> my<00:06:51.690> method<00:06:52.110> is<00:06:52.289> to<00:06:52.440> solve<00:06:56.090> this<00:06:57.090> piece

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
cube so my method is to solve this piece

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.749 
cube so my method is to solve this piece
this<00:06:58.289> piece<00:06:58.590> this<00:06:58.979> piece<00:06:59.219> in<00:06:59.400> this<00:06:59.520> piece

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
this piece this piece in this piece

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.529 
this piece this piece in this piece
first<00:07:00.229> then<00:07:01.229> solve<00:07:01.529> all<00:07:01.889> the<00:07:02.129> other<00:07:02.250> pieces

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
first then solve all the other pieces

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.929 
first then solve all the other pieces
and<00:07:03.539> then<00:07:03.840> solve<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.889> sinners<00:07:05.279> and<00:07:05.430> fix<00:07:05.669> any

00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:05.939 
and then solve the sinners and fix any

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.309 
and then solve the sinners and fix any
sinner<00:07:06.750> parodies<00:07:07.229> so<00:07:08.719> this<00:07:09.719> isn't<00:07:10.080> a<00:07:10.139> real

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 
sinner parodies so this isn't a real

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.279 
sinner parodies so this isn't a real

tutorial if you want a full tutorial
I'll<00:07:13.469> make<00:07:13.710> one<00:07:13.740> but<00:07:14.129> I<00:07:14.370> won't<00:07:15.060> make<00:07:15.270> one<00:07:15.509> until

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
I'll make one but I won't make one until

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.110 
I'll make one but I won't make one until
like<00:07:16.020> someone<00:07:16.349> really<00:07:16.620> needs<00:07:16.800> one<00:07:17.120> because

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
like someone really needs one because

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.649 
like someone really needs one because
this<00:07:18.270> is<00:07:18.419> really<00:07:18.659> hard<00:07:19.020> to<00:07:19.110> explain<00:07:19.529> and

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:20.659 
this is really hard to explain and

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:25.189 
this is really hard to explain and
there's<00:07:21.659> already<00:07:21.810> some<00:07:22.139> on<00:07:22.349> YouTube<00:07:23.180> but<00:07:24.199> so

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 
there's already some on YouTube but so

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.559 
there's already some on YouTube but so
far<00:07:25.500> i'm<00:07:26.430> the<00:07:26.699> only<00:07:26.819> one<00:07:26.969> that<00:07:27.150> uses<00:07:27.270> this

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:27.569 
far i'm the only one that uses this

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.589 
far i'm the only one that uses this
method<00:07:27.629> i<00:07:28.080> think<00:07:28.639> because<00:07:29.639> I<00:07:29.849> kind<00:07:30.089> of<00:07:30.150> made<00:07:30.449> it

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 
method i think because I kind of made it

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.700 
method i think because I kind of made it
up<00:07:30.750> I<00:07:31.129> i'm<00:07:32.129> pretty<00:07:32.520> sure<00:07:32.900> if<00:07:33.900> i'm<00:07:34.110> not<00:07:34.289> telling

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710 
up I i'm pretty sure if i'm not telling

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.550 
up I i'm pretty sure if i'm not telling
me<00:07:34.740> but<00:07:34.949> i<00:07:35.629> don't<00:07:36.629> see<00:07:36.690> anyone<00:07:36.930> else<00:07:37.050> using<00:07:37.440> it

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
me but i don't see anyone else using it

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.600 
me but i don't see anyone else using it
so<00:07:38.460> just<00:07:38.729> leave<00:07:39.330> a<00:07:39.449> comment<00:07:39.690> for<00:07:40.279> any<00:07:41.279> of<00:07:41.520> those

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
so just leave a comment for any of those
