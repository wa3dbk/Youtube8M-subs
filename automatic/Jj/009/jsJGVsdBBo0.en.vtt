00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.800 
it to where it will idle I just haven't
set<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.459> up<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.850> twelve<00:02:26.180> hundred<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.660> it's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
set it up on twelve hundred like it's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.900 
set it up on twelve hundred like it's
supposed<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.200> be

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.370 

that's<00:02:31.510> no<00:02:31.780> joke<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.820> about<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.240> 70<00:02:35.020> degree

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that's no joke it is about a 70 degree

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:50.400 
that's no joke it is about a 70 degree
day<00:02:35.410> easily

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.830 

so<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:51.650> taking<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> time<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:53.239> balance<00:02:53.480> the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
so it's taking the time to balance the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.220 
so it's taking the time to balance the
mixtures<00:02:54.349> by<00:02:54.590> temperature<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.599> balance

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
mixtures by temperature and balance

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.320 
mixtures by temperature and balance
vacuum<00:02:57.709> balance<00:02:58.099> your<00:02:58.250> carbs<00:02:58.580> both<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.120> good

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
vacuum balance your carbs both a good

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.890 
vacuum balance your carbs both a good
thing

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
thing

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.620 
thing
yeah<00:03:00.530> because<00:03:00.800> vacuum<00:03:01.190> balanced<00:03:01.849> alone<00:03:02.360> on

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
yeah because vacuum balanced alone on

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.110 
yeah because vacuum balanced alone on
these<00:03:02.810> carbs<00:03:03.580> might<00:03:04.580> sound<00:03:04.880> good<00:03:05.380> but

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.760 

sounds<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.750> whole<00:03:09.870> lot<00:03:09.930> better<00:03:10.290> when<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.620> got

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
sounds a whole lot better when you got

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.670 
sounds a whole lot better when you got
the<00:03:10.890> mixtures<00:03:11.280> balanced<00:03:11.730> -<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.540> that's<00:03:13.350> just

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the mixtures balanced - and that's just

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.440 
the mixtures balanced - and that's just
kind<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.310> mentioning<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.360> my

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
kind of mentioning that because in my

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.870 
kind of mentioning that because in my
previous<00:03:15.870> video<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.380> mean<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:17.010> lot<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.760> people

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
previous video I mean a lot of people

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.059 
previous video I mean a lot of people
think<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.600> it's<00:03:18.810> too<00:03:18.990> much<00:03:19.170> time<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.709> balance

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
think that it's too much time to balance

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.250 
think that it's too much time to balance
your<00:03:20.190> mixtures<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.330> understand<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.050> in<00:03:22.170> a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
your mixtures and I understand that in a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.199 
your mixtures and I understand that in a
shop<00:03:22.470> environment<00:03:22.740> or<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> dealer<00:03:23.459> environment

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
but as far as in a personal environment

the bike either do it yourself or pay
somebody<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:33.060> balance<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.690> mixtures<00:03:34.170> and

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
somebody to balance the mixtures and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.720 
somebody to balance the mixtures and
balance<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:36.090> balance<00:03:36.480> among<00:03:36.959> vacuum<00:03:37.470> -<00:03:37.730> if

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
balance the balance among vacuum - if

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.340 
balance the balance among vacuum - if
they<00:03:39.030> tell<00:03:39.270> you<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.600> balancing<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
they tell you that balancing the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.810 
they tell you that balancing the
mixtures<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:41.220> not<00:03:41.850> necessary<00:03:43.550> or<00:03:44.550> they've

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
mixtures is not necessary or they've

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.520
