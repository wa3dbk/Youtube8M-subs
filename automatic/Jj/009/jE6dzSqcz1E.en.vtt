Helen and I got this from Cal orchid a
couple<00:00:20.640> years<00:00:20.820> ago<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.359> quite<00:00:21.600> nice<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.350> I'm

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
couple years ago it's quite nice but I'm

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.429 
couple years ago it's quite nice but I'm
disappointed<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.310> both<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.300> size<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
disappointed in both the size of the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.570 
disappointed in both the size of the
flower<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> fact<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.220> there's<00:00:26.460> only

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
flower and the fact that there's only

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
flower and the fact that there's only
one<00:00:26.880> flower<00:00:27.150> those<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:28.109> expecting<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> lot

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
one flower those I was expecting a lot

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.070 
one flower those I was expecting a lot
more<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> plant<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.609> year<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.840> here

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
more of the plant this year because here

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
more of the plant this year because here
you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> plant<00:00:31.890> actually<00:00:32.390> looks

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you can see the plant actually looks

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.250 
you can see the plant actually looks
really<00:00:33.480> good<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.350> year's<00:00:34.950> growth<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:36.260> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
really good this year's growth is the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.670 
really good this year's growth is the
largest<00:00:37.829> by<00:00:37.950> quite<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.530> was

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
largest by quite a bit and so I was

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.350 
largest by quite a bit and so I was
expecting<00:00:41.070> more<00:00:41.550> flowers<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.210> bigger

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
expecting more flowers and bigger

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630 
expecting more flowers and bigger
flowers<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.070> reason<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.430> didn't

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
flowers but for some reason we didn't

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.170 
flowers but for some reason we didn't
get<00:00:44.789> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
get that

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
get that
so<00:00:45.300> we'll<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.710> thing<00:00:46.980> continues<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
so we'll see as this thing continues to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340 
so we'll see as this thing continues to
grow<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> expect<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> more<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> more

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
grow I expect the more and more

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
grow I expect the more and more

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
here is a Guerrero now I've had this

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.720 
here is a Guerrero now I've had this
plant<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.109> probably<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.100> least<00:00:59.280> four<00:00:59.699> years

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
plant for probably at least four years

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.080 
plant for probably at least four years
and<00:01:00.530> it's<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> lot<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:01.980> growths<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.850> never

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and it's got a lot of growths it's never

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.479 
and it's got a lot of growths it's never
bloomed<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.719> me<00:01:03.870> here's<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.769> bloom<00:01:05.070> spike

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
bloomed for me here's one bloom spike

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.100 
bloomed for me here's one bloom spike
that<00:01:06.270> never<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:06.979> produced<00:01:07.979> any<00:01:08.159> flowers

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you can see at this point that I have a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.749 
you can see at this point that I have a
series<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.159> relatively<00:01:14.159> smaller<00:01:14.670> growths

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.700 

none<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.119> ever<00:01:21.240> flowered<00:01:21.869> but

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
none of which have ever flowered but

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
none of which have ever flowered but
here<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.340> year<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> plant<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.720> getting

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
here this year as a plant is getting

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.679 
here this year as a plant is getting
over<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> edge<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> basket<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:27.330> see

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
over the edge of the basket you can see

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.539 
over the edge of the basket you can see
that<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.020> getting<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.500> amazing<00:01:29.009> root

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that I'm getting this amazing root

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
that I'm getting this amazing root
growth<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:31.020> matter<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.619> media

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
growth and no matter what kind of media

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.640 
growth and no matter what kind of media
I<00:01:32.070> had<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.729> basket<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.570> didn't<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.500> get

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
I had in this basket I didn't really get

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.090 
I had in this basket I didn't really get
very<00:01:34.920> robust<00:01:35.460> growth<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:37.409> didn't<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.950> very

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
very robust growth and I didn't get very

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
very robust growth and I didn't get very
good<00:01:38.340> growth<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> pot<00:01:39.270> either<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.259> I'm

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
good growth in a pot either so I'm

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
good growth in a pot either so I'm
starting<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.540> having<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.750> roots

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
starting to think that having the roots

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
starting to think that having the roots
just<00:01:43.110> suspended<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> air<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
just suspended in the air in this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.700 
just suspended in the air in this
particular<00:01:44.820> plant<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.750> make<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.409> big

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
particular plant could make a really big

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.859 
particular plant could make a really big
difference<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.549> we'll<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.689> right

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
difference so we'll see if I'm right

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
difference so we'll see if I'm right
about<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> lot<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> nice

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
about that and if we get a lot of nice

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.639 
about that and if we get a lot of nice
growth<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.270> year<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:52.200> nice<00:01:52.380> flowers

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
growth this year and some nice flowers

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.219 
growth this year and some nice flowers
Guerrero<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:54.149> nice<00:01:54.630> variety<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
Guerrero is a really nice variety of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.950 
Guerrero is a really nice variety of
raelia<00:01:55.710> ANSEP<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.460> hopefully<00:01:57.360> it'll<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> lot

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
raelia ANSEP so hopefully it'll do a lot

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
raelia ANSEP so hopefully it'll do a lot
better<00:01:58.140> next<00:01:58.439> year
