use an external microphone but I've

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.399 
use an external microphone but I've
upgraded<00:01:55.610> this<00:01:56.150> new<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.689> will<00:01:56.990> be<00:01:57.110> changing

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
upgraded this new so I will be changing

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.630 
upgraded this new so I will be changing
my<00:01:57.890> internal<00:01:58.640> mic<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:59.390> my<00:01:59.659> new<00:02:00.259> clip-on<00:02:01.100> mic<00:02:01.310> in

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
my internal mic to my new clip-on mic in

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.690 
my internal mic to my new clip-on mic in
three<00:02:02.270> two<00:02:03.110> one

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.670 

so<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.910> audio<00:02:07.240> you're<00:02:07.450> listening<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.200> now<00:02:08.410> is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
so the audio you're listening to now is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.550 
so the audio you're listening to now is
the<00:02:09.540> audio<00:02:10.540> from<00:02:11.110> my<00:02:11.410> new<00:02:12.660> clip-on<00:02:13.660> microphone

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
the audio from my new clip-on microphone

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.680 
the audio from my new clip-on microphone
now<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.460> can<00:02:15.610> probably<00:02:15.820> tell<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.420> audio

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
now you can probably tell that the audio

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.770 
now you can probably tell that the audio
is<00:02:16.720> probably<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.080> lot<00:02:17.260> better<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:18.720> also<00:02:19.720> you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
is probably a lot better and also you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.420 
is probably a lot better and also you
probably<00:02:20.140> won't<00:02:20.770> be<00:02:20.890> able<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.100> hear<00:02:21.250> much<00:02:21.370> of

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
probably won't be able to hear much of

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.460 
probably won't be able to hear much of
the<00:02:21.610> buzzing<00:02:21.910> noise<00:02:21.990> mainly<00:02:22.990> because<00:02:23.140> my

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the buzzing noise mainly because my

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.140 
the buzzing noise mainly because my
microphone<00:02:23.950> picks<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.280> up<00:02:24.340> where<00:02:24.820> this

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
microphone picks that up where this

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.870 
microphone picks that up where this
microphone<00:02:25.930> picks<00:02:26.770> up<00:02:26.950> most<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.430> my<00:02:27.490> voice

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
microphone picks up most of my voice

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.760 
microphone picks up most of my voice
which<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.210> exactly<00:02:28.720> what<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> want<00:02:29.200> when

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
which is exactly what I want when

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.790 
which is exactly what I want when
comparing<00:02:30.250> my<00:02:30.820> clipper<00:02:31.180> mic<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.900> my<00:02:32.260> webcam

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
comparing my clipper mic to my webcam

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.530 
comparing my clipper mic to my webcam
mic<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.430> definitely<00:02:33.640> tell<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
mic you can definitely tell that the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.770 
mic you can definitely tell that the
audio<00:02:34.840> quality<00:02:35.020> is<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:36.250> big<00:02:36.850> deal<00:02:37.090> better<00:02:37.300> on

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
audio quality is a big deal better on

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.190 
audio quality is a big deal better on
the<00:02:38.440> clip-on<00:02:39.040> mic<00:02:39.300> now<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.630> don't<00:02:40.930> think<00:02:41.110> you'll

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
the clip-on mic now I don't think you'll

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200 
the clip-on mic now I don't think you'll
usually<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.680> able<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.920> tell<00:02:42.160> because<00:02:42.700> I

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
usually be able to tell because I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.400 
usually be able to tell because I
actually<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> really<00:02:44.170> really<00:02:44.380> cheap

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
actually have a really really cheap

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.110 
actually have a really really cheap
clip-on<00:02:45.010> mic<00:02:45.160> which<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.460> used<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.760> use<00:02:45.940> where

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
clip-on mic which I used to use where

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.600 
clip-on mic which I used to use where
this<00:02:46.300> one<00:02:46.540> has<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.470> lot<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:47.830> record<00:02:48.310> this

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
this one has a lot of record this

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.580 
this one has a lot of record this
clipper<00:02:49.030> mic<00:02:49.270> actually<00:02:49.420> has<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:50.080> two<00:02:50.140> point

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
clipper mic actually has a two point

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.370 
clipper mic actually has a two point
five<00:02:50.770> meter<00:02:51.070> cable<00:02:51.460> so<00:02:52.240> that's<00:02:52.600> another<00:02:53.110> great

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
five meter cable so that's another great

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.490 
five meter cable so that's another great
advantage<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:55.150> clip-on<00:02:55.750> mic<00:02:55.960> as<00:02:56.140> it

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
advantage of this clip-on mic as it

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.910 
advantage of this clip-on mic as it
gives<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> lot<00:02:57.280> more<00:02:57.610> flexibility<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.920> be

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
gives you a lot more flexibility to be

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.590 
gives you a lot more flexibility to be
honest<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.220> find<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.580> real<00:03:00.820> shame<00:03:01.150> that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
honest I find it a real shame that

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.380 
honest I find it a real shame that
webcam<00:03:02.320> microphones<00:03:03.220> are<00:03:03.580> quite<00:03:04.090> rubbish

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
webcam microphones are quite rubbish

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.190 
webcam microphones are quite rubbish
because<00:03:04.600> it's<00:03:05.260> more<00:03:05.620> than<00:03:05.860> easy<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:07.210> add<00:03:07.600> an

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
because it's more than easy to add an

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.860 
because it's more than easy to add an
extra<00:03:08.530> cable<00:03:08.850> where<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.239> would<00:03:10.600> much<00:03:10.840> rather

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
extra cable where I would much rather

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.380 
extra cable where I would much rather
have<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.709> second<00:03:12.520> cable<00:03:12.700> which<00:03:13.000> would<00:03:13.209> plug

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
have a second cable which would plug

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.600 
have a second cable which would plug
into<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.660> microphone<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.380> have<00:03:14.920> much<00:03:15.340> better

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
into the microphone and have much better

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.790 
into the microphone and have much better
audio<00:03:16.209> quality<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:17.080> have<00:03:17.260> one<00:03:17.530> wire

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
audio quality then just have one wire

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.190 
audio quality then just have one wire
via<00:03:18.430> USB<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.330> Robert<00:03:19.720> probably<00:03:20.080> show

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
via USB and have Robert probably show

you my picks this microphone up from
Amazon<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:23.590> $6.99<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.760> can<00:03:24.940> definitely

tell you that this is a steal the only
downside<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.959> clip

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
downside of it is the clip

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.220 
downside of it is the clip
unfortunately<00:03:31.209> what<00:03:31.480> they've<00:03:31.690> done<00:03:31.989> is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
unfortunately what they've done is

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.210 
unfortunately what they've done is
they've<00:03:32.739> made<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:33.370> clip<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:35.170> when<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.950> use

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
they've made the clip so when you use

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.250 
they've made the clip so when you use
the<00:03:36.430> microphone<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.180> has<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.570> dangle<00:03:37.900> down

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
the microphone it has to dangle down

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.400 
the microphone it has to dangle down
like<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.830> wire<00:03:39.220> where<00:03:39.970> it's<00:03:40.269> not<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:40.660> it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
like a wire where it's not like it

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.900 
like a wire where it's not like it
actually<00:03:41.710> allow<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.130> tuck<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.670> under<00:03:42.820> your

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
actually allow you to tuck it under your

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.340 
actually allow you to tuck it under your
shirt<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.450> can<00:03:43.570> just<00:03:43.720> easily<00:03:43.900> click<00:03:44.320> on

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
shirt and you can just easily click on

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.740 
shirt and you can just easily click on
it<00:03:45.100> makes<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.460> really<00:03:45.760> really<00:03:46.060> awkward<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.630> do

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
it makes it really really awkward to do

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.050 
it makes it really really awkward to do
that<00:03:46.930> now<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:48.010> do<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.370> usually<00:03:48.850> just

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
that now to do that you usually just

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.640 
that now to do that you usually just
have<00:03:49.210> it<00:03:49.360> there<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.780> then<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.200> clips<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
have it there and then it clips on and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.220 
have it there and then it clips on and
it<00:03:50.920> goes<00:03:51.040> down<00:03:51.340> where<00:03:52.060> people<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.930> mean<00:03:53.110> I've

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
it goes down where people I mean I've

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.720 
it goes down where people I mean I've
just<00:03:53.470> wouldn't<00:03:53.710> want<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.890> do<00:03:54.010> other<00:03:54.430> ones<00:03:54.610> to

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
just wouldn't want to do other ones to

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.510 
just wouldn't want to do other ones to
hide<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.060> microphone<00:03:55.180> as<00:03:55.720> much<00:03:55.870> as<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:56.110> can

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
hide the microphone as much as I can
