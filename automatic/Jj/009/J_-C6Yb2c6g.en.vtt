I recommend this vehicle it's the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.510 
I recommend this vehicle it's the
skyline<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.710> mine

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
skyline the mine

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880 
skyline the mine
skyline<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.199> about<00:01:04.470> two<00:01:04.530> hundred

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
skyline which was about two hundred

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.969 
skyline which was about two hundred
thousand<00:01:05.489> credits<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.590> vehicle

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
thousand credits but it's the vehicle

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
thousand credits but it's the vehicle
that<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.580> technically<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> complete

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that you technically need to complete

the<00:01:10.619> special<00:01:11.310> license<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.020> when<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.110> got

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the special license because when I got

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
the special license because when I got
into<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> special<00:01:14.220> license<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.790> couldn't

into the special license I couldn't

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
into the special license I couldn't
figure<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.900> vehicle<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> use<00:01:16.860> because

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
figure out what vehicle to use because

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
figure out what vehicle to use because
it<00:01:17.580> seemed<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.299> was<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.869> challenging

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it seemed like it was really challenging

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.600 
it seemed like it was really challenging
I<00:01:20.090> ended<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.180> using<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> Ford<00:01:21.900> GT<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:23.130> helps

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I ended up using the Ford GT that helps

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.460 
I ended up using the Ford GT that helps
a<00:01:23.700> lot<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:24.659> probably<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.320> going

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a lot and that's probably what I'm going

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
a lot and that's probably what I'm going
to<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.710> finishing<00:01:26.310> off<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> special<00:01:27.270> license

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to be finishing off the special license

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.380 
to be finishing off the special license
with<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.700> specialized<00:01:29.700> things<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
with which specialized things is kind of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.080 
with which specialized things is kind of
difficult<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.960> must<00:01:31.650> admit<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> challenge

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
difficult I must admit it is a challenge

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.600 
difficult I must admit it is a challenge
it's<00:01:33.270> not<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> other<00:01:33.930> license<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.860> once

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it's not like the other license so once

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.179 
it's not like the other license so once
you<00:01:35.729> complete<00:01:35.880> them<00:01:36.240> all<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you complete them all you got to get to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
you complete them all you got to get to
a<00:01:38.220> point<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a point where this is actually a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
a point where this is actually a
difficult<00:01:41.130> game<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.640> actually<00:01:42.000> getting

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
difficult game it's actually getting

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
difficult game it's actually getting
this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.880 

but<00:01:45.520> I'll<00:01:46.300> I'll<00:01:46.630> complete<00:01:47.080> them<00:01:47.230> I<00:01:47.410> think<00:01:47.800> I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
but I'll I'll complete them I think I

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.130 
but I'll I'll complete them I think I
only<00:01:48.040> had<00:01:48.310> three<00:01:48.640> more<00:01:48.790> races<00:01:49.210> left<00:01:49.240> after

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
only had three more races left after

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.410 
only had three more races left after
this<00:01:50.350> after<00:01:51.190> this<00:01:51.340> race<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.850> think<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.150> had<00:01:52.270> three

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
this after this race I think I had three

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.200 
this after this race I think I had three
more<00:01:52.630> races<00:01:53.020> left<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.700> I'll<00:01:54.700> complete<00:01:55.060> the

more races left and I'll complete the
special<00:01:55.630> license<00:01:56.080> hopefully<00:01:56.590> I'll<00:01:56.770> be<00:01:56.800> able

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
special license hopefully I'll be able

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.480 
special license hopefully I'll be able
to<00:01:57.190> lock<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:58.420> think<00:01:58.960> there's<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.490> formula

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
to lock the I think there's a formula

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.760 
to lock the I think there's a formula
car<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.150> you<00:02:01.300> can<00:02:01.450> unlock<00:02:01.720> which<00:02:02.410> is<00:02:02.560> pretty

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
car that you can unlock which is pretty

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.290 
car that you can unlock which is pretty
cool<00:02:03.040> because<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.910> was<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.720> Gran<00:02:04.960> Turismo<00:02:05.200> 3

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
cool because that was in Gran Turismo 3

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.320 
cool because that was in Gran Turismo 3

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
able to pull away from them as fast as I

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.770 
able to pull away from them as fast as I
was<00:02:57.110> as<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.379> progressed<00:02:59.060> because<00:03:00.060> I'm<00:03:00.599> not

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
really eat up in fifth position and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.039 
really eat up in fifth position and
second<00:03:04.440> lap<00:03:04.650> already<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.970> mean<00:03:06.599> we'll<00:03:06.720> pass

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
second lap already so I mean we'll pass

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.350 
second lap already so I mean we'll pass
them<00:03:07.260> pretty<00:03:07.590> easily<00:03:07.799> though<00:03:08.190> I'll<00:03:09.060> probably

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
them pretty easily though I'll probably

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.839 
them pretty easily though I'll probably
had<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.720> purchase<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.380> Ferrari<00:03:10.860> f40<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.640> saw

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
had to purchase that Ferrari f40 you saw

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.949 
had to purchase that Ferrari f40 you saw
that<00:03:12.060> over<00:03:12.239> right<00:03:12.569> there<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:14.280> purchase<00:03:14.700> that

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
that over right there to purchase that

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.140 
that over right there to purchase that
that's<00:03:15.959> another<00:03:16.260> vehicle<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.250> think<00:03:18.000> is

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that's another vehicle that I think is

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.300 
that's another vehicle that I think is
really<00:03:18.540> expensive<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.500> think<00:03:19.799> it's<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.130> little

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
really expensive I think it's a little

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.240 
really expensive I think it's a little
too<00:03:20.640> expensive<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.599> game<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:23.220> should

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
too expensive in this game they should

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.759 
too expensive in this game they should
definitely<00:03:23.579> give<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:25.019> or<00:03:25.290> something

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
definitely give it to you or something

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.650 
definitely give it to you or something
you<00:03:25.860> have<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.129> complete<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> license<00:03:27.329> if<00:03:27.510> I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
you have to complete to a license if I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.619 
you have to complete to a license if I
think<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:27.959> like<00:03:28.110> over<00:03:28.410> 400,000<00:03:29.400> credits<00:03:29.790> and

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
think it's like over 400,000 credits and

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.089 
think it's like over 400,000 credits and
you<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.170> use<00:03:31.349> it<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
you do have to use it for one of the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.970 
you do have to use it for one of the
races<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.480> don't<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:34.049> one<00:03:34.290> yet<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.709> have

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
races but I don't have one yet so I have

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.369 
races but I don't have one yet so I have
to<00:03:35.190> purchase<00:03:35.489> one<00:03:35.730> which<00:03:36.269> which<00:03:36.930> I'll<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.230> to

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
to purchase one which which I'll have to

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.210 
to purchase one which which I'll have to
go<00:03:37.530> back<00:03:37.739> or<00:03:38.579> I'll<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.390> like

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
go back or I'll have to like

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.360 
go back or I'll have to like
another<00:03:41.200> race<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.230> I've<00:03:42.590> already<00:03:42.890> completed

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
another race that I've already completed

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.570 
another race that I've already completed
to<00:03:44.030> get<00:03:44.180> more<00:03:44.390> cash<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:45.020> course<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:45.830> as<00:03:46.400> you

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
to get more cash of course but as you

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.460 
to get more cash of course but as you
proceed<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:47.030> know<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:47.600> specializes<00:03:48.350> you

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
proceed you know this specializes you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.260 
proceed you know this specializes you
get<00:03:48.590> about<00:03:49.540> 440<00:03:50.540> thousand<00:03:50.960> credits<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.890> think

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
get about 440 thousand credits I think

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.820 
get about 440 thousand credits I think
forty<00:03:53.270> or<00:03:53.360> forty<00:03:53.600> two<00:03:53.750> thousand<00:03:54.140> credits<00:03:54.440> each

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
forty or forty two thousand credits each

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.010 
forty or forty two thousand credits each
time<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.280> complete<00:03:55.460> each<00:03:55.850> race<00:03:56.150> which<00:03:56.510> if<00:03:56.840> you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
time you complete each race which if you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.220 
time you complete each race which if you
can<00:03:57.170> first<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:59.030> I'll<00:03:59.330> probably<00:03:59.600> just<00:03:59.870> do<00:04:00.050> this

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
can first so I'll probably just do this

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.140 
can first so I'll probably just do this
race<00:04:00.560> over<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.040> over<00:04:01.220> again<00:04:01.310> or<00:04:01.640> probably<00:04:02.060> go

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
race over and over again or probably go

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.780 
race over and over again or probably go
to<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.270> DOE<00:04:02.570> Daytona<00:04:03.380> you<00:04:04.040> do<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.310> Daytona

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
to the DOE Daytona you do the Daytona

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.850 
to the DOE Daytona you do the Daytona
track<00:04:05.120> which<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:05.630> just<00:04:05.840> an<00:04:05.990> oval<00:04:06.290> track<00:04:06.530> it's

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
track which is just an oval track it's

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.240 
track which is just an oval track it's
pretty

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.430 

you<00:04:11.250> could<00:04:11.400> just<00:04:11.610> get<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.360> 40<00:04:12.810> T<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.349> just

you could just get the the 40 T and just

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.969 
you could just get the the 40 T and just
dominate<00:04:13.769> with<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.519> which<00:04:14.849> is<00:04:15.030> pretty<00:04:15.239> funny

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:15.979 
dominate with it which is pretty funny

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.219 
dominate with it which is pretty funny
at<00:04:16.979> this<00:04:17.190> point<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.940> was<00:04:18.510> pretty<00:04:18.750> happy<00:04:19.049> that

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
at this point I I was pretty happy that

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.340 
at this point I I was pretty happy that
I<00:04:19.440> was<00:04:19.919> able<00:04:19.949> to<00:04:20.220> catch<00:04:21.000> up<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.510> Corvette

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
I was able to catch up to this Corvette

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.469 
I was able to catch up to this Corvette
because<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.979> didn't<00:04:23.400> know<00:04:23.490> if<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.699> was<00:04:23.760> gonna<00:04:23.970> be

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
because I didn't know if I was gonna be

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.260 
because I didn't know if I was gonna be
able<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.840> catch<00:04:25.350> up<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.830> because<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.270> just

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
able to catch up to it because it's just

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.320 
able to catch up to it because it's just
pulling<00:04:27.660> away<00:04:27.780> from<00:04:27.930> me<00:04:28.550> pretty<00:04:29.550> quickly<00:04:29.940> but

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
pulling away from me pretty quickly but

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.540 
pulling away from me pretty quickly but
then<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.690> was<00:04:30.810> able<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.110> keep<00:04:31.380> up<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.740> bit<00:04:31.949> it's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
then I was able to keep up a bit it's

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.390 
then I was able to keep up a bit it's
got<00:04:32.699> some<00:04:32.940> power<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.330> have<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.320> admit<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:35.100> is

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
got some power I have to admit it it is

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.390 
got some power I have to admit it it is
a<00:04:35.960> competitive<00:04:36.960> vehicle<00:04:37.620> against<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.130> one

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
a competitive vehicle against this one

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.730 
a competitive vehicle against this one
they<00:04:39.360> make<00:04:39.570> these<00:04:39.720> license<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.320> little<00:04:40.620> bit

they make these license a little bit

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.150 
they make these license a little bit
more<00:04:40.889> challenging<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:41.760> that's<00:04:42.449> why<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:43.289> kind<00:04:43.949> of

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
more challenging so that's why I kind of

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.570 
more challenging so that's why I kind of
I<00:04:44.840> don't<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.080> at<00:04:46.620> this<00:04:46.860> moment<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.310> kind<00:04:47.460> of

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
I don't know I at this moment I kind of

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.860 
I don't know I at this moment I kind of

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.950 
to
destroy<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.380> vehicles<00:05:02.889> because<00:05:03.220> it's<00:05:03.400> just<00:05:03.610> a

penalties<00:06:00.850> so<00:06:01.389> if<00:06:01.600> you<00:06:01.720> hit<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.960> wall<00:06:02.169> too

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
penalties so if you hit the wall too

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.219 
penalties so if you hit the wall too
hard<00:06:02.680> you<00:06:03.370> get<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.520> second<00:06:04.120> delay<00:06:04.750> I<00:06:04.780> don't<00:06:05.169> know

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
hard you get a second delay I don't know

hard you get a second delay I don't know
how<00:06:05.410> long<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.830> is<00:06:05.860> depending<00:06:06.729> on<00:06:06.850> how<00:06:07.090> hard<00:06:07.360> I

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
how long it is depending on how hard I

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.340 
how long it is depending on how hard I
guess<00:06:07.690> you<00:06:07.870> hit<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.139> wall<00:06:08.320> you<00:06:08.560> get

guess you hit the wall you get
an<00:06:09.590> approximate<00:06:10.810> multiplier<00:06:11.810> of<00:06:12.250> how<00:06:13.250> many

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
an approximate multiplier of how many

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.780 
an approximate multiplier of how many
times<00:06:13.760> you<00:06:14.090> had<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.390> weight<00:06:14.810> or<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:16.130> time<00:06:16.460> for

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
times you had the weight or the time for

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.190 
times you had the weight or the time for
him<00:06:16.880> you<00:06:16.970> have<00:06:17.060> to<00:06:17.180> wait<00:06:17.360> until<00:06:17.660> you<00:06:17.930> can<00:06:17.990> hit

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
him you have to wait until you can hit

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.010 
him you have to wait until you can hit
the<00:06:18.380> X<00:06:18.560> button<00:06:19.180> because<00:06:20.180> you<00:06:20.360> know<00:06:20.510> you<00:06:20.870> know

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
the X button because you know you know

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.870

you're<00:06:21.470> not<00:06:21.590> able<00:06:21.860> to<00:06:21.950> accelerate<00:06:22.370> when<00:06:22.760> you

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
you're not able to accelerate when you

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.550 
you're not able to accelerate when you
get<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.150> penalties<00:06:23.630> it's<00:06:23.960> the<00:06:24.080> same<00:06:24.320> law

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
get the penalties it's the same law

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.480 
get the penalties it's the same law
online<00:06:24.950> as<00:06:25.700> it<00:06:25.940> is<00:06:26.060> on<00:06:26.270> special<00:06:26.420> license<00:06:27.140> which

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
online as it is on special license which

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.250 
online as it is on special license which
it's<00:06:28.490> probably<00:06:28.700> going<00:06:28.970> to<00:06:29.030> be<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.300> same<00:06:29.570> in

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
it's probably going to be the same in

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.230 
it's probably going to be the same in
Gran<00:06:30.560> Turismo<00:06:30.770> 5<00:06:31.250> but<00:06:31.580> I<00:06:31.670> guess<00:06:31.820> we'll<00:06:32.000> have<00:06:32.090> to

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.710 
Gran Turismo 5 but I guess we'll have to
wait<00:06:32.450> and<00:06:32.630> see<00:06:33.760> with<00:06:34.760> this<00:06:34.910> game<00:06:35.180> being<00:06:35.450> two
