you're<00:00:31.790> going<00:00:31.910> up<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.419> SE<00:00:33.020> series<00:00:33.410> with<00:00:33.559> a

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
you're going up to the SE series with a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.260 
you're going up to the SE series with a
precision<00:00:33.890> slide<00:00:34.309> which<00:00:34.610> is<00:00:34.730> right<00:00:34.910> here

yeah<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.600> SI<00:00:36.290> series<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.280> ez<00:00:37.460> series<00:00:38.090> use

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
yeah the SI series and the ez series use

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.820 
yeah the SI series and the ez series use
a<00:00:38.540> recirculating<00:00:39.320> ball<00:00:40.300> bearing<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.830> they

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
a recirculating ball bearing and they

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.700 
a recirculating ball bearing and they
have<00:00:42.980> optional<00:00:43.460> composite<00:00:44.090> bearings<00:00:44.710> you

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
have optional composite bearings you

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.440 
have optional composite bearings you
have<00:00:45.860> two<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.190> three<00:00:46.400> tenths<00:00:46.610> preload<00:00:47.060> on<00:00:47.240> that

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
have two to three tenths preload on that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.110 
have two to three tenths preload on that
and<00:00:47.770> virtually<00:00:48.770> no<00:00:49.130> play<00:00:49.370> now<00:00:49.850> what's<00:00:50.060> the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
and virtually no play now what's the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.060 
and virtually no play now what's the
difference<00:00:50.360> between<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:51.050> in<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.410> ez<00:00:51.590> series

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
difference between that in the ez series

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.680 
difference between that in the ez series
what<00:00:52.190> are<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:52.310> stepping<00:00:52.579> up<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:52.880> it<00:00:52.970> se<00:00:53.420> has<00:00:53.660> a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
what are you stepping up to it se has a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.440 
what are you stepping up to it se has a
short<00:00:54.140> bearing<00:00:54.530> block<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.280> EZ<00:00:55.550> puts<00:00:56.300> the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
short bearing block and the EZ puts the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.540 
short bearing block and the EZ puts the
marry<00:00:56.660> on<00:00:56.840> each<00:00:56.989> end<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:58.100> longer<00:00:58.460> the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
marry on each end so the longer the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.760 
marry on each end so the longer the
stroke<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.120> lighter<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.720> bearings<00:01:00.020> bed<00:01:00.260> okay

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
stroke the lighter the bearings bed okay

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.160 
stroke the lighter the bearings bed okay
that<00:01:01.130> way<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:01.399> use<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:02.030> for<00:01:02.329> an<00:01:02.420> x<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.989> y

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
that way you use that for an x and y

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.270 
that way you use that for an x and y
axis<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:03.950> then<00:01:04.579> SE<00:01:05.149> is<00:01:05.449> good<00:01:05.810> for<00:01:06.079> a<00:01:06.259> z<00:01:06.649> axis<00:01:07.130> or

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
axis and then SE is good for a z axis or

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.999 
axis and then SE is good for a z axis or
short<00:01:07.820> stroke<00:01:08.149> X&amp;Y<00:01:08.780> okay<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:09.530> once<00:01:09.829> you<00:01:09.920> get

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
short stroke X&amp;Y okay so once you get

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.319 
short stroke X&amp;Y okay so once you get
beyond<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.280> eighth<00:01:10.460> another<00:01:10.759> step<00:01:11.030> up<00:01:11.149> you've

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
beyond the eighth another step up you've

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.969 
beyond the eighth another step up you've
got<00:01:11.479> or<00:01:11.630> a<00:01:11.689> different<00:01:12.049> step<00:01:12.259> you<00:01:12.439> have<00:01:12.470> with

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
got or a different step you have with

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.120 
got or a different step you have with
the<00:01:13.340> slides<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.389> wind<00:01:14.600> shaft

the slides is this wind shaft

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.830 
the slides is this wind shaft
twin<00:01:16.130> shaft<00:01:16.429> was<00:01:16.700> designed<00:01:17.149> to<00:01:17.359> get<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:17.719> out

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
twin shaft was designed to get you out

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.020 
twin shaft was designed to get you out
of<00:01:17.869> trouble<00:01:18.139> it<00:01:18.859> takes<00:01:19.130> up<00:01:19.340> no<00:01:19.369> more<00:01:19.700> space

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
of trouble it takes up no more space

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.660 
of trouble it takes up no more space
than<00:01:20.299> NFP<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.810> cylinder<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:22.340> got<00:01:22.490> guide

shafts starting a quarter inch going up

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.730 
shafts starting a quarter inch going up
to<00:01:24.920> one<00:01:25.100> inch<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.729> four<00:01:25.969> inch<00:01:26.090> bore<00:01:26.389> TF<00:01:27.259> has

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
to one inch so the four inch bore TF has

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.730 
to one inch so the four inch bore TF has
to<00:01:28.069> one<00:01:28.549> inch<00:01:28.810> guide<00:01:29.810> chest<00:01:30.139> now<00:01:30.499> the<00:01:30.560> other

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
to one inch guide chest now the other

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.410 
to one inch guide chest now the other
thing<00:01:30.889> I<00:01:30.950> like<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:31.369> kind<00:01:31.700> of<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.819> cool<00:01:31.999> slide

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
thing I like it's kind of a cool slide

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.449 
thing I like it's kind of a cool slide
is<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.719> magnetically<00:01:33.259> coupled<00:01:33.439> one<00:01:33.829> now<00:01:34.159> this

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
is the magnetically coupled one now this

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.099 
is the magnetically coupled one now this
is<00:01:34.609> pretty<00:01:34.759> neat<00:01:34.999> because<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.509> can<00:01:35.659> get<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.899> lot

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
is pretty neat because you can get a lot

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.899 
is pretty neat because you can get a lot
of<00:01:36.139> travel<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:37.039> lot<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.429> power<00:01:37.609> with<00:01:37.880> that

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
of travel and a lot of power with that

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.179 
of travel and a lot of power with that
travel<00:01:38.420> yeah<00:01:38.840> some<00:01:39.139> it's<00:01:39.409> another<00:01:39.619> form<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:40.100> a

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
travel yeah some it's another form of a

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.019 
travel yeah some it's another form of a
Robles<00:01:40.609> cylinder<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.069> you're<00:01:43.069> coupled<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
Robles cylinder so you're coupled to the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:47.499 
Robles cylinder so you're coupled to the
piston<00:01:44.389> inside<00:01:44.569> that<00:01:45.380> cylinder<00:01:45.799> tube<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.609> you

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
piston inside that cylinder tube and you

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.840 
piston inside that cylinder tube and you
can<00:01:47.659> get<00:01:47.810> just<00:01:47.959> a<00:01:48.109> regular<00:01:48.409> cylinder<00:01:48.889> you<00:01:49.670> get

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
can get just a regular cylinder you get

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.699 
can get just a regular cylinder you get
a<00:01:49.880> cylinder<00:01:50.389> that<00:01:50.569> has<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:50.929> rail<00:01:51.259> for<00:01:51.679> the

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
a cylinder that has a rail for the

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.949 
a cylinder that has a rail for the
piston<00:01:52.340> position<00:01:52.729> sensing<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.329> then<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
piston position sensing and then you

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.019 
piston position sensing and then you
have<00:01:54.109> an<00:01:54.259> actual<00:01:54.529> slide<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.579> course<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:55.939> can

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:56.029 
have an actual slide of course you can

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.389
