two<00:03:13.860> because<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:14.310> you'll<00:03:14.459> notice<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.420> holes

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
two because if you'll notice the holes

for<00:03:16.680> winding<00:03:17.040> on<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.310> clock<00:03:17.580> are<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.940> about

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
for winding on this clock are in about

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.670 
for winding on this clock are in about
the<00:03:18.330> same<00:03:18.510> position<00:03:19.019> as<00:03:19.170> they<00:03:19.319> would<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.500> for

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the same position as they would be for

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.080 
the same position as they would be for
the<00:03:20.010> 30-hour<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.850> they<00:03:26.850> were<00:03:26.910> made

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the 30-hour on this and they were made

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.090 
the 30-hour on this and they were made
about<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.420> same<00:03:27.570> time<00:03:27.900> both<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.320> labels<00:03:28.859> say

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
about the same time both the labels say

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.220 
about the same time both the labels say
Thomaston<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:29.850> each<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.180> these<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.780> both<00:03:31.049> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
Thomaston on each of these and both the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.930 
Thomaston on each of these and both the
movements<00:03:31.680> say<00:03:31.829> Plymouth<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:34.940> little

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
movements say Plymouth so a little

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.479 
movements say Plymouth so a little
around<00:03:36.209> or<00:03:36.480> after<00:03:36.780> 1865<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.890> believe<00:03:38.190> was<00:03:38.459> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
around or after 1865 I believe was the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.370 
around or after 1865 I believe was the
year<00:03:38.760> they<00:03:38.910> renamed<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.480> town<00:03:39.660> Thomaston

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
year they renamed the town Thomaston

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.180 
year they renamed the town Thomaston
Connecticut<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.040> nice

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
Connecticut so and it's it's a nice

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.330 
Connecticut so and it's it's a nice
clock<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:47.160> has<00:03:47.340> kind<00:03:47.639> of<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.819> thunk<00:03:48.150> sound<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.780> it

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
clock it has kind of a thunk sound to it

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.710 
clock it has kind of a thunk sound to it
each<00:03:50.340> one<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.790> them<00:03:50.910> sounds<00:03:51.120> different<00:03:51.690> when

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
each one of them sounds different when

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.479 
each one of them sounds different when
they're<00:03:51.900> ticking<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.410> their<00:03:52.530> cases<00:03:53.010> but<00:03:53.280> I

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
they're ticking in their cases but I

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.430 
they're ticking in their cases but I
used<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> think<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.450> one<00:03:54.660> was<00:03:54.810> loud<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.350> then

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
used to think this one was loud and then

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.319 
used to think this one was loud and then
my<00:03:55.620> cottage<00:03:56.040> clock<00:03:56.370> topped<00:03:56.700> it<00:04:00.109> there<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.200> go
