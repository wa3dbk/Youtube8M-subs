00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.820
 last we'll make a cake at 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.320
 goat cheese that's good 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.820
 real favorite cheese is first of all the 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.789
 recipe is super simple at most we go 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.919
 so we will start by mixing all 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.630
 the dry elements 2/10 we know we put 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.260
 flour 1 flour we put a 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.000
 White flour 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.199
 you can of course put a 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.449
 flour a little more complete 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.460
 and his sounds the density wanted to give to 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.039
 your check you put the flour that 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.839
 you want to agree after to yeast 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.809
 chemical to serve it to grow the 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:44.440
 cook dough after ten 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:46.820
 month we mixed did 1 then ok 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.020
 until then I understand to break the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.719
 eggs so I 'm even going to put a 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.649
 a little bit of salt a good pinch 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.140
 salt 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.719
 ok we will add the liquid elements 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.949
 so milk have for the moment reviewed 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.969
 not of course so here we add some 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.190
 melted butter but you can well 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.830
 obviously replace the melted butter by 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:13.880
 one night there you mix starting from the 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:16.130
 center without backing up the dough 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.380
 is ready I advise to leave it 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.420
 rest for 30 minutes cool now 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.240
 we will realize our quay kocher we will 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.430
 put goat or white with goat 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.159
 log the beautiful put a little bit all 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.200
 the goat teams that you like 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.930
 all right we'll put a little 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.210
 candied tomatoes 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.259
 we will put ourselves pepper mill or 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.240
 then a little bit of Espelette pepper 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.369
 and do not see that to make it foolish 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.939
 it's a small bonus 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.229
 little basil 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.399
 if you like and the little idea recipe 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.280
 with a relationship to very small alcohol 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.290
 little fennel 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.409
 I like the fleece fennel goes well 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.409
 together 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.850
 here is the mixture is very homogeneous 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.450
 now will garnish the ok you cedes 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.259
 go here now our mill 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.929
 filled to three quarters 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.590
 we still have 1 leather figure you that 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.750
 even leather 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.950
 was pre heat your oven to 175 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.319
 degrees we will create for how many 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.540
 time 45 it goes on here we will check 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.709
 of course cooking is the tip 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.599
 of a knife this hero on cuttlefish 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.110
 it's good I'm very very hungry 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.110
 we go very quickly
