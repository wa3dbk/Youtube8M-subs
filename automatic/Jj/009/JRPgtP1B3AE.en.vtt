00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
that's why today there are so many

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.280

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
so just like art there's no argument why

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.290 
so just like art there's no argument why
argue<00:05:24.700> so<00:05:25.360> just<00:05:25.930> like<00:05:26.110> people<00:05:26.380> why<00:05:27.040> bother<00:05:27.880> are

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.930 
argue so just like people why bother are
you<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:28.750> why<00:05:28.900> bother<00:05:29.170> hating<00:05:29.710> I<00:05:29.950> think<00:05:30.790> what

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
you and why bother hating I think what

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.630
