00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.790
 centigrade the wind keeps what 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.830
 you say the cold front number 48 the 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.630
 season has been causing these 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.160
 instability is however cleared 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.750
 in the conditions for the next 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.090
 days at the moment all the contribution of 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.529
 moisture from the Pacific Ocean 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.510
 will be causing very heavy rains 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.769
 for today same conditions are 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.440
 they are going to extend for tomorrow 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.870
 minimum of 19 and maximum that holds up to 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.370
 the 29 degrees centigrade for the day 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.260
 Thursday a partly cloudy sky without 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.379
 But the chance of rain and 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.329
 decreases minimum of 21 maximum of 32 already 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.010
 starting from the excellent weekend and 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.920
 bars hopes that for today the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.870
 temperature will be around the 26 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.760
 degrees felt as I comment the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.829
 probability of rain will be present 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.039
 in our city it is expected that for the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.980
 night the temperature will rise until 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.440
 the 26 degrees centigrade if you have 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.290
 planned to go out at night the temperature 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 for later they will be around 22 and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.200
 the 23 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.340
 I felt a maxim that will only be 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.440
 up to 24 degrees centigrade for the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.150
 next five days that condition not 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.610

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.810
