 representative posts of the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.740
 force of the squadron and the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.140
 subordinate military organizations that 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 for two years had Admiral 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.970
 Guimarães as commander 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.220
 I think I 've lived my time and every 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.000
 one has his time and I'm going out on 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.190
 my time 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 I leave with a clear conscience that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.830
 I always tried to make sure I could 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.770
 do and leave with joy when 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.500
 I joined the navy 45 years ago I 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 I think we all have to give 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.229
 younger people coming with 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.899
 more advanced ideas comes with new impetus and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.200
 I believe this is a is a is a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.060
 modernization is an exchange of 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.910
 which was very good the navy the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.830

 there are aspirations there are needs 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.239
 but there are mainly goals 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.329
