00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.040
 What is it? 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.000
 It is a horse that walked around no man's land. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 What kind of horse? 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 A wonderful horse, if you ask me. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 England is at war! We are at war! 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.200

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.300
 Can you imagine flying over a war? 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.040
 And you know you can never look down. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 You have to look ahead or you will never get home. 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.900
 "This Christmas" 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.500
 It is an honor to ride next to you. 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.000
 And may every man make himself and his country proud! 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.160
 "Survives hope" 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.360
 Be brave!
