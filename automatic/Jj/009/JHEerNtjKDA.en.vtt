00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.090
 a new episode of the weapons guide and 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.549
 in this episode I'm going to talk I'm going to 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.129
 comment a little bit the light rifle or 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:17.390
 as it is commonly called the rifle four 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.789
 runner and good to start I want to say 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.330
 that this weapon is very very good is very 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.550
 good 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.920
 sandro using the these days 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.599
 to record is the weapons guide and 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.519
 it means that it is very good very 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.910
 powerful and I think it's one of the 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.410
 better can be compared to lmr but 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.750
 well now let's explore why it is 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.489
 so good and why and I'm going to talk a 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.309
 How to use it or how can it be used? 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.190
 some tips to use it and good 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.960
 this weapon is its main characteristic 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.660
 is that they have two shooting modes that 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.550
 are the bursts mode as if it were a 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.609
 battle rifle 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.960
 that you can ossa that happens when not 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.640
 I'm aiming with the gun but when 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.219
 you give the zoom is automatically put 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.870
 the mode of a shot that fires a 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.989
 shot but that is very powerful is like 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.940
 the previous three together so it's a 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.980
 weapon that is really like a rifle 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.050
 battle coupled with a dm 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.910
 to change it you just have to aim 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.190
 so that's fine because short 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.390
 reach in the short and medium range can already 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.790
 be like maps as you are seeing in 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.710
 this gameplay or maps like hey see or well 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.550
 which are closed are short-range 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.160
 then you can look for the weapon without aiming and 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.470
 so use the common one as a m &amp; r and 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.110
 that's as common as reindeer king of 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.790
 forgiveness battle and that's fine 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.280
 because it also has very good precision 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.640
 and enough damage is the weapon the rifle that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.670
 more damage does the whole game 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.060
 it does more damage than the dmr and then you see it 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.130
 Well, well, that short-term 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.920
 you can use them simply in bursts 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.190
 without pointing because also because 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.750
 also the crosshead does not increase as 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.790
 any other weapon like that of m &amp; r or the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.380
 battle rifle for example when 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.330
 shoot is the crosshead what is the point 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.040
 of sight increases as you go 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.540
 shooting because this one is not kept 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.960
 equal always so the precision the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.850
 you are always perfect and then when 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.759
 when you are on maps a little bit more 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.180
 open can already be like victim battle 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.790
 or battles like that in plan open maps 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410
 then you can use the zoom and so you can 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.150
 used as if it were an emery yet 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.799
 a half sniper or so 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.870
 because in addition his shots are very 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.269
 powerful as I said before when 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.180
 you are pointing or when you are 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.159
 firing pointed only needed 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.019
 three shots to remove the shield a 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.180
 enemy and two to kill him if you give him in 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.980
 the body one in the head so from 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.349
 five shots already kills is a super enemy 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.239
 easy that is very very powers this weapon 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.400
 it is much much more powerful than that of m &amp; r 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.379
 and I like that or never had 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.730
 so used very thoroughly less these 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.250
 days that are playing then to record 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.720
 this guide to have some gameplays and the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.159
 I really liked it a lot 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.550
 I think I use it almost always because 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.490
 It is very good 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.400
 then also good how bad it is is 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.980
 that is not very good at very long range 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.750
 at a very very long distance is not very 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.430
 good as the dmr can be since it can 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.020
 become like a half sniper 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.490
 is brother this weapon is not very good 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.040
 long - range shots as 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.690
 as I do not know what feeling but it is that a 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.490
 feeling that as they do not reach 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.080
 bullets like it deviates a little bit like that 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.110
 that long range can already be maps 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.750
 as ragnarok or so from point to point 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.640
 map as it is not recommended 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.820
 because you will lose a lot of precision so 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.300
 FAPA is better to keep the maps means 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.520
 medium short such short or medium reach 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 as much so without more 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.380
 well this weapon is also very good 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.300
 as against the vehicles as you will see in 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.220
 the end of this video is very very good 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.660
 against vehicles because a bot by 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.150
 example you can destroy it almost from a 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.430
 charger firing whenever you shoot 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.620
 jce with the powerful shots or 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.270
 where you are pointing is very good 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.970
 against vehicles and I'll talk more 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.800
 go ahead this Friday surely go up 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.530
 a video of how is the best class 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.170
 anti game vehicles 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.660
 or the one that seems to me the best and in 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.520
 this class is the weapon I took this 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.620
 weapon with more things but good that already 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.630
 you will see on Friday but that's why as 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.990
 you will see the end of this video is very 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.130
 good against vehicles and that's not like 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.989
 for example the mere rifle 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.489
 battle you see a vehicle and ya 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.750
 you have to hide because there is no 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.090
 no chance after killing 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.360
 cams and baleares damage and such but as 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.700
 that the bad thing about this weapon is that it 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.139
 ends the ammunition very fast salt is 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.419
 ends the ammunition very fast is worth 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.940
 so what I recommend I feel that 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.890
 use this weapon is to use the 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.810
 ammo advantage 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.950
 It is the most advisable to use 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.300
 this weapon because you determine the 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.310
 super fast ammunition because in addition 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.740
 when I'm shooting with the mode 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.260
 one shot you shoot three bullets ie 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.750
 you only have 12 shots you only have 12 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.240
 shots if you shoot aiming so it's 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.130
 better you carry ammunition and nothing I hope 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.370
 that has helped you and until the next 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.370
 video
