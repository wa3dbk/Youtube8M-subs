 Well, as you can see here I have three 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.400
 icons that do not correspond with the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.910

 and you have and the music you can

 make the music application for 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.670
 changing the icons is quite simple 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.320
 you just have to follow the instructions 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 I 'm going to give you now to do what 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.920
 What we are going to do is enter a 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.770
 page that I will leave you below in the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.690
 description of the video the page is 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.630
 custom point to live on dot net 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.490
 now I have it loaded 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.550
 and what are we going to do, let's wait 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.500
 let it charge momentary bar once 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.660
 we are inside the page on the page 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.120
 we will give the little button of 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.870
 be the 'u' we give 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.270
 and here we are going to see that we have several 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.720
 options to choose is worth the first 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.790
 option 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.820
 here we have a drop-down that puts your 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.490
 application type in English is a bit 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.430
 passenger but good we go well 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.590
 we give him here and here we see what we're going 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.220
 to do is a filter for all the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.650
 applications included in this website 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.260
 that we are going to be able to change has 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.460
 enough are not all it is logically 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.490
 all apps in the app store 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.390
 but yes it has enough then we have 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.980
 applications of 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.090
 e-mail 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.260
 browsers and social applications in 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.750
 this case we what are we going to do 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.450
 is to change the icons of the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.530
 native applications of plurality 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.799
 appelhans let's do it though we choose this and 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.950
 another little window opens up below 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.299
 so that we leave an application we are going to 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.650
 change the appstore icon well 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:00.379
 we choose the appstore as an option 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.150
 Now I've done a little bit of cheating and 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.299
 what I have done has been good 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.549
 previously download several icons for 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.640
 then go adding the icons the 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.819
 let's take our reel and good 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.769
 if we put a concrete url I think that 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.410
 it is much more convenient to choose the file 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.269
 have it stored on the reel and then 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.239
 select it from here with which 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.079
 well go to google you look for icons 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.150
 for for iphone or icons or any type 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.620
 of image will serve and record die 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.650
 first you will have to choose what 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.930
 application is the one that you are going to change 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.230
 in the x 1 in google keep it in the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.810
 iphone and then we give the little button 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.849
 select the file by hitting the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.530
 little button x you see we can do 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.060
 a photo record a video or even 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.370
 select an existing one when we do 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.349
 is to select an existing one and 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.480
 only as I tell you I already have 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.629
 saved an icon that I liked for 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.099
 the appstore is this selected and a 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.470
 Once we have selected you 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.560
 we give the green button let's go go 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.560
 there 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.170
 and now we will see that we are charged 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.620
 new page a new a new cuadrito 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.400
 ok we give here to open aft and we are 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.700
 will open a different page worth this is 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.829
 the page that we are going to use to open the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.410
 concrete application with the icon that 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.210
 we have loaded once we are in 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.100
 this page we have to give to the 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.160
 little button under the middle east that puts 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.919
 the square with the arrow we give and 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.160
 we add this screen to the page 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.720
 home that you have here the button like me 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.400
 you will see that it will load good first 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.370
 let's put the name there 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.500
 in this case it's the story 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.410
 we give it and we give the little button add 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.040
 on the top right you will see that we are 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.199
 is going to create there we have an icon with 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.960
 the image that we just loaded to 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.350
 icon if we press him what he does is 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.330
 redirect us that page redirects us to 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.280
 the application that we have told you 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.760
 previously that in this case is the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.760
 restore 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.409
 in this good way we can go 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.270
 customizing as we want 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.879
 our sprint bogart with icons that 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.530
 give us the desire because little is worth 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:19.930
 any type of photo if you take 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.520
 any one picture of your face os 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.500
 will make an icon with your photo 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.400
 face now well what are we doing 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.740
 here is redirect from the web that that 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.680
 we have told you before redirecting to the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.259
 application 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.900
 madrid yes although we have these icons 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:40.289
 the originals as you see are still 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.240
 here we have the detector and we have all 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.710
 the others if you want to replace all the 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.139
 icons for any of your tastes 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.080
 for nothing what you have what you owe 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.000
 to do would be to take the icons that do not 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.240
 like what you are going to change put them in 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.220
 a folder all gathered and leave them 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.479
 in a corner of the sprint bogart tarda 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.250
 a little more time to open the application 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.720
 because good as you see what it does 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.490
 first is to open safari then re 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.490
 direct us to the application in question 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.070
 but in return we have a sprint board 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.259
 with the custom icons and this is 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.389
 all friends so you can customize 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.310
 Our icons we put to your liking 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.320
 if we like the ones that bring the eyes 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.639
