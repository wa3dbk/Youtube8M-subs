image a little we're gonna squash it
down<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.559> bit<00:00:45.050> just<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.410> make<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> match

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
down a bit just so we can make it match

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
down a bit just so we can make it match
up<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:47.399> easier<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.110> widen

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
up a little easier and we're gonna widen

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.069 
up a little easier and we're gonna widen
it<00:00:49.649> out

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
it out

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.500 
it out
just<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.329> image

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
just like that and now we have the image

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.889 
just like that and now we have the image
place<00:00:55.010> pretty<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.129> where<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> go

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
place pretty much where we want it to go

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.069 
place pretty much where we want it to go
we<00:00:58.320> might<00:00:58.530> rotate<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> little<00:00:59.760> bit<00:01:00.079> but

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
we might rotate that a little bit but

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.250 
we might rotate that a little bit but
that's<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.789> when<00:01:02.789> you're<00:01:02.910> done<00:01:03.260> change

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that's about it when you're done change

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's about it when you're done change
the<00:01:04.439> opacity<00:01:04.680> back<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.540> 100%<00:01:07.340> add<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.520> layer

down here on this side we're gonna
actually<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> little<00:01:34.740> bit<00:01:35.930> more<00:01:36.930> accurate

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
actually be a little bit more accurate

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.250 
actually be a little bit more accurate
with<00:01:37.500> our<00:01:37.650> masking

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.710 

and<00:01:41.710> just<00:01:42.220> zoom<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.610> real<00:01:42.820> close<00:01:42.850> make<00:01:43.540> sure

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.740 

and<00:01:50.920> once<00:01:51.550> you<00:01:51.700> have<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.850> good<00:01:52.030> masking<00:01:52.540> job

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
and once you have a good masking job

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.790 
and once you have a good masking job
done<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.880> can<00:01:55.030> go<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.480> to<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.690> fun<00:01:56.140> stuff<00:01:56.440> this

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
done we can go on to the fun stuff this

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.680 
done we can go on to the fun stuff this
is<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.100> most<00:01:57.220> boring<00:01:57.490> part<00:01:57.910> at<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.180> level

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
is the most boring part at a level

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.860 
is the most boring part at a level
process<00:01:59.550> but<00:02:00.550> this<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:00.820> what<00:02:00.970> really<00:02:01.150> adds<00:02:01.330> a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
process but this is what really adds a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.410 
process but this is what really adds a
lot<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.590> detail<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.280> quality<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:04.000> your<00:02:04.150> image

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
so don't skip it alright once we got

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.390 
so don't skip it alright once we got
that<00:02:09.670> time<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.119> zoom<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:12.160> we're<00:02:12.310> also

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that time we zoom out and we're also

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.480 
that time we zoom out and we're also
going<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:13.260> clean<00:02:14.260> up<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.560> area<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.920> little<00:02:15.070> bit

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.170 
hue/saturation
check<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.769> colorize<00:02:36.340> tab<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:40.269> then<00:02:42.180> change

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
check the colorize tab and then change

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
check the colorize tab and then change
your<00:02:43.390> hue<00:02:43.750> slide<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.290> down<00:02:44.409> a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.709> bit

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
your hue slide it down a little bit

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.430 
your hue slide it down a little bit
increase<00:02:47.200> your<00:02:47.230> saturation<00:02:47.890> maybe

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.900 

and<00:02:53.760> also<00:02:54.760> maybe<00:02:55.330> decrease<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.230> lightness

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and also maybe decrease the lightness

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.860 
and also maybe decrease the lightness
what<00:02:57.910> we're<00:02:58.000> trying<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.270> do<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.480> get<00:02:58.660> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
what we're trying to do is get the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.720 
what we're trying to do is get the
yodeler<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.800> match<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:01.420> mr.<00:03:01.660> t<00:03:01.840> face<00:03:02.730> okay

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
yodeler to match the mr. t face okay

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.450 
yodeler to match the mr. t face okay
once<00:03:03.940> you've<00:03:04.060> done<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.950> well<00:03:05.950> we'd<00:03:06.100> like<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
once you've done that well we'd like to

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.810 
once you've done that well we'd like to
do<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:07.360> need<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:08.250> delete<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.430> layer<00:03:09.550> mask

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
do is we need to delete this layer mask

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.670 
do is we need to delete this layer mask
we'll<00:03:10.150> add<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.300> new<00:03:10.450> one<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> very<00:03:11.530> bottom

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
we'll add a new one to the very bottom

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.310 
we'll add a new one to the very bottom
image<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:13.300> we'll<00:03:13.690> fill<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.050> all<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.170> with

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
image and we'll fill it all in with

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.950 
image and we'll fill it all in with
black<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.360> what<00:03:19.450> we're<00:03:19.570> doing<00:03:19.600> here<00:03:19.810> is

black<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.090> bottom<00:03:22.420> layer<00:03:22.540> has<00:03:22.750> our

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
black and that bottom layer has our

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.240 
black and that bottom layer has our
color<00:03:23.110> so<00:03:23.440> what<00:03:23.560> we're<00:03:23.650> gonna<00:03:23.740> do<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.130> we're

color so what we're gonna do is we're

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.450 
color so what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.400> use<00:03:24.580> white<00:03:24.970> now<00:03:26.280> we're<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.400> to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.250 
going to use white now we're going to
show<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.850> eyes<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.540> bottom<00:03:28.810> layer<00:03:28.930> you

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
show the eyes on the bottom layer you

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.890 
show the eyes on the bottom layer you
can't<00:03:29.470> see<00:03:29.620> we're<00:03:29.800> doing<00:03:30.070> yet<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.750> we're

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
can't see we're doing yet and we're

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.860 
can't see we're doing yet and we're
gonna<00:03:32.050> show<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:34.000> color<00:03:34.210> there<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.570> then<00:03:34.780> what

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
gonna show the color there and then what

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.360 
gonna show the color there and then what
we<00:03:34.960> do<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.320> we<00:03:35.500> go<00:03:35.590> back<00:03:35.620> up<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:35.920> our<00:03:36.040> top<00:03:36.310> layer

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
we do is we go back up to our top layer

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.420 
we do is we go back up to our top layer
and<00:03:40.020> we<00:03:41.020> mask<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.530> out<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.070> we<00:03:42.160> get<00:03:42.280> the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
and we mask that out and we get the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.120 
and we mask that out and we get the
color<00:03:42.700> back<00:03:43.090> into<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.450> eyes

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.800 

you<00:03:48.640> know<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.850> can<00:03:48.970> get<00:03:49.120> some<00:03:49.300> color<00:03:49.570> back

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
you know you can get some color back

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.520 
you know you can get some color back
into<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.230> lips<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.970> some<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.530> color

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
into the lips and some of that color

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:02.240 
into the lips and some of that color
back<00:03:53.890> into<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:55.380> earrings<00:03:56.380> as<00:03:56.560> well

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.940 

all<00:04:02.790> right<00:04:02.910> once<00:04:03.180> that's<00:04:03.420> done<00:04:03.920> we're<00:04:04.920> almost

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
all right once that's done we're almost

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.940 
all right once that's done we're almost
there<00:04:05.340> go<00:04:05.790> back<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> top<00:04:06.570> layer<00:04:06.810> use<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> low

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
there go back to the top layer use a low

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.350 
there go back to the top layer use a low
opacity<00:04:08.430> like<00:04:09.240> maybe<00:04:09.510> 10<00:04:09.720> or<00:04:09.840> 20<00:04:10.050> percent<00:04:11.360> what

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
opacity like maybe 10 or 20 percent what

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.070 
opacity like maybe 10 or 20 percent what
we're<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> do<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:12.840> we're<00:04:12.930> going<00:04:12.960> to

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.630 
we're going to do is we're going to
start<00:04:13.610> masking<00:04:14.610> in<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:16.280> allowing<00:04:17.280> some<00:04:17.609> of

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
start masking in and allowing some of

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.470 
start masking in and allowing some of
the<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:19.280> texture<00:04:20.280> from<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.489> yota<00:04:20.790> face<00:04:21.000> back

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
the that texture from the yota face back

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.950 
the that texture from the yota face back
into<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> image<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:23.390> what<00:04:24.390> this<00:04:24.570> does<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:25.230> it

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
into the image and what this does is it

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.700 
into the image and what this does is it
helps<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.260> blend<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:30.140> come<00:04:31.140> across<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.440> little

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
helps to blend to come across a little

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:43.269 
helps to blend to come across a little
bit<00:04:31.860> smoother

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:43.279 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.449 

and<00:04:43.879> once<00:04:44.209> you've<00:04:44.359> done<00:04:44.509> that<00:04:45.309> we're<00:04:46.309> almost

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:46.459 
and once you've done that we're almost

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:49.659 
and once you've done that we're almost
there<00:04:47.679> the<00:04:48.679> next<00:04:48.829> thing<00:04:48.919> we<00:04:49.099> got<00:04:49.219> to<00:04:49.249> do<00:04:49.399> is<00:04:49.489> fix

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
there the next thing we got to do is fix

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.649 
there the next thing we got to do is fix
the<00:04:49.819> hair<00:04:50.619> so<00:04:52.089> what<00:04:53.089> we<00:04:53.179> do<00:04:53.359> is<00:04:53.509> we'll

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
the hair so what we do is we'll

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.889 
the hair so what we do is we'll
duplicate<00:04:54.079> this<00:04:54.229> layer<00:04:55.329> hide<00:04:56.329> the<00:04:56.479> bottom<00:04:56.779> one

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:56.899 
duplicate this layer hide the bottom one

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:00.189 
duplicate this layer hide the bottom one
we'll<00:04:57.109> apply<00:04:57.379> the<00:04:57.469> layer<00:04:57.799> mask<00:04:58.959> we'll<00:04:59.959> select

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
we'll apply the layer mask we'll select

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.749 
we'll apply the layer mask we'll select
the<00:05:00.499> hair<00:05:00.709> copy<00:05:01.609> it<00:05:01.819> and<00:05:01.909> paste<00:05:02.059> it<00:05:02.389> and<00:05:03.759> then

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
the hair copy it and paste it and then

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.979 
the hair copy it and paste it and then
what<00:05:04.969> we'll<00:05:05.089> do<00:05:05.239> is<00:05:05.329> we'll<00:05:05.419> do<00:05:05.599> image

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:05.989 
what we'll do is we'll do image

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:11.619 
what we'll do is we'll do image
adjustment<00:05:08.109> hue/saturation<00:05:10.239> change<00:05:11.239> the<00:05:11.389> hue

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:11.629 
adjustment hue/saturation change the hue

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.980 
adjustment hue/saturation change the hue
on<00:05:11.809> it

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.360 

the<00:05:15.410> saturation

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.790 

and<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:19.030> lightness<00:05:19.449> and<00:05:19.810> we're<00:05:20.440> trying<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.740> do

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
and the lightness and we're trying to do

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.200 
and the lightness and we're trying to do
is<00:05:20.919> make<00:05:21.100> it<00:05:21.160> match<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.610> background<00:05:21.820> when

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
is make it match the background when
