00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
are the thicker ones we're going to go

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.719 
are the thicker ones we're going to go
ahead<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.790> place<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.090> over<00:04:09.509> the<00:04:09.780> shaft<00:04:10.049> and

ahead and place that over the shaft and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.050 
ahead and place that over the shaft and
that's<00:04:11.729> going<00:04:11.879> to<00:04:11.939> go<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.629> front<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.290> the

that's going to go in front of the
existing<00:04:15.060> larger<00:04:15.449> spacer<00:04:15.959> that's<00:04:16.289> already

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
existing larger spacer that's already

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.020 
existing larger spacer that's already
there<00:04:18.500> what<00:04:19.500> we're<00:04:19.680> doing<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.430> we're<00:04:20.699> trying

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
there what we're doing is we're trying

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.810 
there what we're doing is we're trying
to<00:04:21.239> take<00:04:21.389> any<00:04:21.630> wobble<00:04:22.229> out<00:04:22.409> of<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:23.190> gear<00:04:23.490> or

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
to take any wobble out of the gear or

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.700 
to take any wobble out of the gear or
any<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.389> and<00:04:24.599> out<00:04:24.750> movement<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:25.500> we're<00:04:25.620> going

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
any in and out movement so we're going

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
want to over shim it but again there

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.800 
want to over shim it but again there
should<00:05:05.110> be<00:05:05.499> little<00:05:05.979> or<00:05:06.279> no<00:05:06.490> play<00:05:06.819> this<00:05:07.539> point

we're going to go ahead and put one of
the<00:05:10.240> thinner<00:05:10.990> units<00:05:11.409> on<00:05:11.589> because<00:05:11.919> there<00:05:12.039> is

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
the thinner units on because there is

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.659 
the thinner units on because there is
not<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.819> much<00:05:12.969> in<00:05:13.210> there<00:05:13.439> and<00:05:14.439> again<00:05:14.740> we're

getting<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.599> c-clip<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.229> and<00:05:32.469> off<00:05:32.560> is<00:05:32.770> the

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
getting the c-clip on and off is the

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.350 
getting the c-clip on and off is the
most<00:05:33.069> difficult<00:05:33.279> part<00:05:38.999> trying<00:05:39.999> to<00:05:40.089> do<00:05:40.240> it<00:05:40.330> in

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
most difficult part trying to do it in

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.399 
most difficult part trying to do it in
front<00:05:40.569> of<00:05:40.719> the<00:05:40.779> camera

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
front of the camera

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.540 
front of the camera
makes<00:05:42.279> it<00:05:42.430> even<00:05:42.550> more<00:05:42.819> difficult<00:05:44.399> okay<00:05:45.399> we're

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
makes it even more difficult okay we're

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.929 
makes it even more difficult okay we're
going<00:05:45.639> to<00:05:45.699> give<00:05:45.849> it<00:05:45.939> one<00:05:46.120> more<00:05:46.300> shot<00:05:46.360> here

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
going to give it one more shot here

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:49.409 
going to give it one more shot here
there<00:05:48.939> we<00:05:49.029> go

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
there we go

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.699 
there we go
it's<00:05:50.409> on<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:52.180> at<00:05:52.360> this<00:05:52.479> point<00:05:52.749> there<00:05:53.020> is<00:05:53.259> no

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:53.709 
it's on and at this point there is no

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:58.139 
it's on and at this point there is no
play<00:05:54.180> back<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:55.360> forth<00:05:55.629> in<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:56.409> spur<00:05:56.649> gear<00:05:57.149> the

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:58.149 
play back and forth in the spur gear the

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.649 
play back and forth in the spur gear the
last<00:05:58.360> step<00:05:58.689> is<00:05:59.009> that<00:06:00.009> Kraftwerk's<00:06:00.939> has<00:06:01.360> also

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
last step is that Kraftwerk's has also

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.219 
last step is that Kraftwerk's has also
added<00:06:02.289> a<00:06:02.439> set<00:06:03.249> screw<00:06:03.580> which<00:06:04.509> is<00:06:04.719> extra

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
added a set screw which is extra

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.519 
added a set screw which is extra
protection<00:06:05.830> in<00:06:06.300> case<00:06:07.300> your<00:06:07.509> c-clip<00:06:07.930> comes<00:06:08.289> off

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529 
protection in case your c-clip comes off

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.850 
protection in case your c-clip comes off
that<00:06:08.889> the<00:06:09.339> carrier<00:06:09.759> is<00:06:10.479> not<00:06:10.779> going<00:06:11.110> to<00:06:11.289> slide

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
that the carrier is not going to slide

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.360 
that the carrier is not going to slide
off<00:06:12.099> so<00:06:13.029> we're<00:06:13.270> going<00:06:13.479> to<00:06:13.629> go<00:06:14.110> ahead<00:06:14.439> and<00:06:14.889> put

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:38.649 
fast any high heat red thread lock so

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.469 
fast any high heat red thread lock so
we're<00:06:38.740> gonna<00:06:38.829> go<00:06:39.039> ahead<00:06:39.159> and
