00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.319
 stronger 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 deck and here another you do too 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.039
 of course do him and be well 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.199
 nail polish well you know you know that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.670
 I am the one who always lands 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.710
 flaking nail polish I think anyway 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.420
 very difficult tank I am another texel 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 diverse in all sorts of things never 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.129
 will often order one thing I already had 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
 very beautiful and things but then to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.910
 to choose in such a way then I would think 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 I'm going to try this is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.649
 baby pink if I say correctly yes of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.390
 konad itself have been bought on the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.620
 stock market together as an object that true 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.739
 very many people what kind of person is that? 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.750
 color and so just very nice club 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.699
 it's kind of nicki minaj baby 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 pink and still beautiful 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 so that under nail polish but again me 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 wear and not so very mainly 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.330
 just not at all so neat 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.080
 in the middle is next or next 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.119
 thing makes you call 2a area drag 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.580
 about sentences with yes i am now is to the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.369
 oil and such banana I then welcome 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.590
 and then I thought yes it is thought so too 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.689
 I really am upset with this one 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 van der laan the pro series actually 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.270

 of the stuff kept under spray 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.369
 by him under her laugh so but 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.299
 of the plea dissolving it too 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.880
 to get 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.689
 yes I have worn all the buses 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.259
 won in is your bag or a bag well then must 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.500
 I think about it but it's the coach 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.220
 mother no that's a real one but I thought 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.980
 what use 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.870
 to roads and that is really because 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.870
 he might not be a bit theft 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.700
 experiments is my office of help with this 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.830
 is pink and especially the color I think 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.240
 just so incredibly beautiful and according 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.370
 my guys are about to compliment you 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.470
 got on our also really buying those pink 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.420
 And yes this is really one of mine 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.890
 showpieces that I always carry with me 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.050
 I spend a lot with me on the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.640
 city ​​and the man scarf over one 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.050
 example and then it doesn't stand out that way 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.790
 my formula 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.860
 stuff in it and actually goes 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.030
 pretty good the handyman and on 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.220
 never 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.990
 used separately by the way 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.240
 next are shoes 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.860
 Well because I had what I now to 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.860
 food again but of course slippers 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.350
 I really worry there quite often 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 be sure to check message but seemed 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.450
 everything cloths maybe i should meet my 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.830
 my son will olympias with 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.490
 the stone was on it is a good one 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.860
 example 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.300
 and so just walk very nice lahab 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.790
 through a discussion about 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.160
 designer shoes expensive shoes 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.110
 and then I completely agree 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.030
 a kind of path i really said i was 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.430
 really want very good quality shoes 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.800
 are needed for a bit of nonsense 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.360
 but yes I am so full of dreams lost 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.700
 but those beautiful places of shot 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.830
 Olympia are such beautiful shoes and what 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.940
 People microphone shows get the correct 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.290
 also many compliments about the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.650
