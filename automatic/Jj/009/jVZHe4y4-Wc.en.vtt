things<00:01:39.099> with<00:01:39.279> batteries<00:01:39.670> but<00:01:39.880> anyway<00:01:40.709> so<00:01:41.709> a

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
things with batteries but anyway so a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.469 
things with batteries but anyway so a
cable<00:01:42.189> release<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.729> extremely<00:01:43.719> important<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
cable release is extremely important the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.409 
cable release is extremely important the
second<00:01:46.840> most<00:01:46.990> important<00:01:47.590> thing<00:01:47.799> is<00:01:49.709> what<00:01:51.419> that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:52.419 
second most important thing is what that

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:54.719 
second most important thing is what that
is<00:01:52.659> your<00:01:52.840> area<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.200> infinity<00:01:53.679> infinity<00:01:54.310> starts

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
is your area of infinity infinity starts

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.089 
is your area of infinity infinity starts
at<00:01:54.909> about<00:01:55.090> 40<00:01:55.599> feet<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.499> if<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.889> have

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
at about 40 feet so if you have

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.089 
at about 40 feet so if you have
something<00:01:57.459> in<00:01:57.579> focus<00:01:58.060> say<00:01:58.240> at<00:01:58.359> 50<00:01:58.689> feet

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
something in focus say at 50 feet

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.769 
something in focus say at 50 feet
anything<00:02:00.099> beyond<00:02:00.459> that<00:02:00.700> could<00:02:01.239> be<00:02:01.359> up<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:01.599> ten

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
anything beyond that could be up to ten

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.440 
anything beyond that could be up to ten
miles<00:02:01.989> away<00:02:02.349> is<00:02:02.799> going<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.249> be<00:02:03.369> in<00:02:03.609> equal<00:02:04.029> focus

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
miles away is going to be in equal focus

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.919 
miles away is going to be in equal focus
this<00:02:05.409> comes<00:02:05.679> very

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.050 

very<00:02:11.769> important<00:02:12.129> point<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.370> remember<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:12.879> has

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
very important point to remember it has

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.550 
very important point to remember it has
to<00:02:13.150> do<00:02:13.300> with<00:02:13.390> depth<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.810> field<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.319> how<00:02:14.410> it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
to do with depth of field and how it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.160 
to do with depth of field and how it
relates<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.010> focus<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:16.450> key<00:02:16.599> number<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.930> want

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
relates to focus the key number I want

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.009 
relates to focus the key number I want
you<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.349> keep<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.680> mind<00:02:17.950> oh<00:02:18.870> I'm<00:02:19.870> very
