00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
horde as you can see I think he's a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.590 
horde as you can see I think he's a
death<00:02:56.660> knight<00:02:56.900> yes<00:02:57.860> death<00:02:58.190> knight<00:02:58.600> that's

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
death knight yes death knight that's

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:09.420 
death knight yes death knight that's
what<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.110> basic<00:03:00.620> pvp<00:03:01.280> helmet<00:03:01.730> looks<00:03:01.850> like

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.250 

and<00:03:10.430> I'm<00:03:11.299> pretty<00:03:11.540> sure<00:03:11.749> those<00:03:11.959> are<00:03:12.170> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
and I'm pretty sure those are the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.089 
and I'm pretty sure those are the
shoulders<00:03:12.799> that<00:03:13.099> are<00:03:13.159> conquest<00:03:14.469> so<00:03:15.469> that's

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
shoulders that are conquest so that's

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.900 
shoulders that are conquest so that's
what<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.459> armor<00:03:16.730> looks<00:03:16.969> like

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.280 

and<00:03:22.910> that's<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.270> two<00:03:23.420> locations<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290
