00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and well then and we are here in a new 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.569
 video this time we are in my world 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.960
 survival is a world that does not engrave 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.480
 never but then I play from time to time 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.389
 when and I'm doing things like that 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.699
 I will do more guidance for this world and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.650
 here we will find the mine we can 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.590
 get to the diamonds well I've 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.380
 chopped but if you keep punching sure that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 you find more and there belloch that is 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.000
 Take this to 20 with a trolley here 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.140
 we have the never 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.980
 it is preferable not to enter because let's say 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.980
 that a pig wanted to attack me and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.700
 so I hit him and he rode 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.309
 a good party so it's better not to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.470
 I have as well as locked in that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.809
 look nicer, it's not that good here 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.210
 we have a break ion source or how 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.790
 whatever it's called, we put here a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.200
 I know I'm going to love an ingot 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.340
 of these 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.380
 Well, as you can see , it is not here anymore and here 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.000
 is and has become the property of the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.030
 source to see what then I can 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.790
 remove but well then I will show you 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.760
 this I have here cows and chickens here 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.400
 I have my crops here I have pigs and 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.350
 sheep but I have not found so to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.590
 see there 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.409
 it's for her but she's brought us 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 here there was a chaos of a puddle over here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.440
 a tree house pursued to my 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.970
 sister so I decided to leave it on or 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.799
 fix this whole area and make it a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.420
 house that by the way is on a raft 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.840
 is very good has not entered and here is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 can see some lanterns 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.240
 underground that you have fixed 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.829
 are also here this make is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.009
 halloween I do not play that's why I have 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.750
 these pumpkins I put them two nights 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.929
 previous or the previous night of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.350
 halloween well I will eat that if not no 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.470
 I can go fast 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.100
 well it's worth it here we're going to find 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.989
 some studies here I wanted to do as a 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.650
 theater not since I had the material 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.319
 I was going crazy and I said I'm going to 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.450
 to do a theater here but I've stayed 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.270
 without material so this is in 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.890
 construction still 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.350
 and now let's see the house inside 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.310
 that I think all this is done in 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.150
 survival 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.830
 It has cost me his and I think 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.380
 well back then here we are 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.900
 with this floor here a harmonic are this 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.180
 that a pork is removed in a pig 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.390
 here four ovens I have not needed 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.870
 plus 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.819
 then here we found a room where 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.420
 I have all the food here and here 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.970
 I have the blocks so I have extra things 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.800
 they do a lot to me that makes me a lot 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.910
 laziness order here the minerals here 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.040
 what is your name 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.159
 well then the tools here things 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.189
 what they cost to get and in the 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.909
 upstairs we found the table of 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.109
 kraft 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:18.110
 what do I say the table enchantments with 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:23.090
 its bookstores 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.740
 and in this door we find the bed 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.710
 for sleeping 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.510
 what an apple tells me because in 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.020
 this world what it was to fulfill 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.670
 all the objectives and let's say that I 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.890
 I made a mistake and instead of making an apple 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.010
 at night and a golden apple so 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.530
 I left her here and here a little terrace 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.350
 I know this is a little berizzo 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.960
 because it does not help but good 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.330
 let's say I'm proud not of my 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.120
 home so nothing if I see someone 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.590
 He says he wants the house, so 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.140
 He wants me to pass the map, I'm going to 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.640
 happen so that's why you do not worry 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.120
 that if you want you can have it 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.850
 or if it is not very good for me yes or 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.710
 all this in survival let's say that has 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.710
 cost yours here we can upload 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.100
 I have a sign saying what is the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.520
 official currency that are the nuggets 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.210
 and well this is all my world I have not gone 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.670
 to the mine because I can not go down 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.200
 but I have a car but it does not matter 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.970
 foolishness is a normal mine 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.340
 so nothing I hope you liked
