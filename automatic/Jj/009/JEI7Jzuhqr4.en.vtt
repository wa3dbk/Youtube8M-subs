00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 in another situation that also 

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.980
 we follow closely is what has been 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.700
 to improve mobility in the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.440
 capital 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.650
 despite the implementation projects of 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.599
 cycle paths to coexist between drivers 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.360
 and cyclists is still quite complicated 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.789
 and after serious accidents involving 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.430
 buses and bicycles a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.529
 transport of the north of the island has 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 practice a defensive driving course 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.349
 has even a booklet of good coexistence 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.859
 Look how cool it is between cyclists and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.859
 drivers 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.540
 The training gathers drivers and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.610
 cyclists in rooms are given 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.190
 awareness lectures and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.350
 clarification debate on the code 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 national transit system and also 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.210
 rights and duties of both courts 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.100
 in practice the roles are reversed or 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.920
 who faces traffic every day 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.750
 from florianÃ³polis driving bus feel 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.010
 in the skin as it is the life of the person doing the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.010
 even on two wheels 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.130
 who created the young program the advances 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.500
 that the need to expand 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.140
 they have already passed is over 200 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:19.250
 drivers in our training and they 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.230
 is what they have in the past is that it's okay 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.050
 being very important to them because 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.340
 day to day traffic is not easy right 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.830
 so it's the one with these tips 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.500
 reinforcing the traffic laws for them 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.330
 It is easier not to know which 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.020
 rights and duties they have to 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.479
 What is it is when you drive a bus and 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.200
 the cyclist to make them feel the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.360
 whats going on how dangerous it is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.369
 put the bus very close to the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.890
 cyclist or even a pedestrian or even a 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.840
 from another car also from this 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 initiative you start to respect more 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.040
 the cyclist certainly puts you in the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.490
 place of snow the difficulties that he 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.490
 has day to day 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.709
 i 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.610
 pablo is quite as it is also in the I 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.610
 based basketball
