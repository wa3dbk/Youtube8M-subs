 theve in funk city 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.950
 roller test bench of the world so 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.320
 is unique 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:26.490

 with state-of-the-art automation technology 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.390
 after the installation of the vehicle 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.030
 the programmed test run starts 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.170
 the driver is a robot controlled by
