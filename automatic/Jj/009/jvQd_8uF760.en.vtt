00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.710
 sony presented with the kdl 65 w 855 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.570
 all 65 inch tv itself 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.130
 prominence between the full hd medium 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.949
 and uhc beginner class 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.689
 positioned next to it tries sony with 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.099
 rich colors and useful tv 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.990
 to score points 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.189
 if that is enough for a place in the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.939
 to earn living room 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:32.110
 with 164 cm screen diagonal has the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:35.710
 kdl 65 w 855 just the right size 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.750
 for home cinema fans with its 35 kilograms 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 he is not easy for his 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 size class but that's fine 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.530
 The round foot not only looks elegant 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.420
 He is also responsible for the safety 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.610
 in the connection panel one finds unfortunately only 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.330
 a single gymnast there would be more in it 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.970
 been 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.490
 Otherwise, the owner gets four hdmi 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:59.079
 and three usb ports as well as the usual ones 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.579
 analogue connections offered a ci plus 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.329
 Of course, card can also be used 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.160
 plug in 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.809
 already when you turn it on 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.700
 positively surprised after only four 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.800
 seconds you can see the tv picture and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.540
 otherwise, the service also convinces 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.090
 fast switching times and cool 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.070
 Special functions with quick tap 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.110
 Just click on the program button 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.210
 and you end up in the channel list 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.159
 Here you can watch TV channels 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.420
 also radio stations or youtube videos 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.280
 choose 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.900
 so lets have a short commercial break 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.620
 by looking at a movie theater 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.780
 bridge 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.670
 also very nice is the electronic 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.020
 program guide succeeded alongside the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.640
 tv picture you can see at first 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.799
 view the city and end time of the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.659
 program 's extensive program 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.130
 information and timer programming is 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.640
 just a quick click 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.590
 away 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.900
 In addition, a total of four 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.159
 favorite lists create all this 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.049
 goes thanks to the brisk use 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.210
 speed can be by hand 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.650
 Next to that, the smart mini also comes along 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.750
 meaningful and clear 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.729
 features on these are in 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.590
 different categories sorted like this 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.479
 can you watch the latest tv stations 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.189
 frequently used apps and connected 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.990
 display devices 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.360
 at the large number of apps 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.540
 Media libraries internet sites and games 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.830
 but you quickly lose the overview 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.289
 the picture is also varied 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.510
 settings options 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.189
 in addition to the usual brightness color and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.010
 There are a number of sharpness settings 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.140
 special options from sony behind the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.329
 point reality creation hides 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.459
 a content selective contrast enhancement 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.959
 so increase the sharpness without fear 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.280
 from flooding and double contours 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.379
 to have to have 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.209
 More details come naturally 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.299
 not subjectively takes the detail sharpness 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.980
 but too with the motionflow setting 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.629
 You can set the moving picture sharp on one 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.879
 increase excellent level 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.469
 with the standard and soft settings 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.540
 the movements already appear 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.239
 liquid, however, sneak like this 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.159
 also artifacts in the picture clark la plus 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.260
 and impulse still fly black pictures 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.150
 what the moving shear extremely increases 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.669
 but unfortunately at the expense of brightness 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.709
 the point is evenly graded 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.389
 improves color transitions frequently 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.980
 in animated films or strong 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.319
 compressed internet videos 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.659
 creep in behind color brilliance 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.400
 hides sony stream - technology 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.919
 this increases the color saturation 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.840
 especially in red and green area in the 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.730
 optimal case, the picture also affects 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.220
 not and of course the skin tones 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.659
 Hardly changed sony ensures one 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.269
 real value especially at 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.280
 animations and movies to give you that 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.870
 to enjoy almost impeccable picture too 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.579
 you should be the right one 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.139
 take a seated position 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.489
 the viewing angle dependence of the 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.269
 TV is not allowed 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.579
 underestimate 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.659
 the really nice red is added 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.909
 a slightly temporal one 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.109
 viewing angle fast orange too 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.109
 the brightness decreases strongly 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.340
 the second point of criticism is the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.380
 illumination accuracy 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.240
 especially with bright pictures emerges 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.130
 Semi -circular shuttle in the middle of the picture and 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.620
 Generally, the image edges are visible 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.270
 they get darkened in practice 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.220
 from the illumination but hardly defects 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.640
 something with sony integrated 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.230
 Sophisticated LED 3d led render left 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.420
 and right- fitting in sectors the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.400
 brightness automatically adjusts the image content 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.740
 the coordinated image processing 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.690
 avoids a loss of brightness in 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.490
 Overall, you see excellent black values 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.680
 at the same time without errors by 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.540
 Drawings dark areas in the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.730
 Contrary to the picture already in the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.580
 default almost optimal fails 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.140
 is in the sound a lot of fine tuning in demand 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.299
 the delivery condition sounds 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.530
 TV terrible tin with 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.450
 some corrections is the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.790
 sound character but more complete with almost 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.380
 perfect speech intelligibility and 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.400
 convincing heights 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.170
 Altogether they make 65855 with the kdl 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.790
 nothing wrong beside his elegant 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.650
 Design and great picture quality 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.930
 the TV convinced with a 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.150
 unmatched low input delay 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.070
 in games mode is the 20 at 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.380
 milliseconds giving you a good one 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.570
 partner for computer players does not do any 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.280
 fun makes head of the 3d mode the 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.890
 shutter glasses make for a dark 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.900
 picture with visible double contours though 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.000
 But they do not care about that and 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.210
 a really big tv for the home cinema 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.990
 Looking for the 3200 euro are good here 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.870
 created 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.790
 further detailed tests included with
