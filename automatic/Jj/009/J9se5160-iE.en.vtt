hey<00:00:07.350> guys<00:00:07.529> here's<00:00:07.830> your<00:00:07.980> introduction<00:00:08.820> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
hey guys here's your introduction to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.049 
hey guys here's your introduction to
dichotomous<00:00:09.809> keys<00:00:10.460> and<00:00:11.460> make<00:00:11.759> sure<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.969> take

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
dichotomous keys and make sure you take

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.700 
dichotomous keys and make sure you take
some<00:00:12.240> good<00:00:12.450> notes<00:00:12.690> as<00:00:13.049> these<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.440> your<00:00:13.590> notes

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
some good notes as these are your notes

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.820 
some good notes as these are your notes
for<00:00:13.980> class<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.460> don't<00:00:14.670> take<00:00:14.880> notes<00:00:15.420> or

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
for class we don't take notes or

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.130 
for class we don't take notes or
lectures<00:00:16.830> during<00:00:17.550> class<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.480> videos<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
lectures during class the videos are the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.870 
lectures during class the videos are the
alternative<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.890> doing<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.730> make<00:00:20.850> sure

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
alternative to doing that so make sure

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.240 
alternative to doing that so make sure
you<00:00:21.119> guys<00:00:21.270> take<00:00:21.600> good<00:00:21.779> notes<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.769> when<00:00:23.160> we

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you guys take good notes so that when we

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.750 
you guys take good notes so that when we
come<00:00:23.430> into<00:00:23.609> class<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:25.320> next<00:00:25.350> class<00:00:26.279> after<00:00:26.519> you

this<00:00:37.380> lecture<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:38.129> introduction<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
this lecture is an introduction to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.590 
this lecture is an introduction to
dichotomous<00:00:39.660> keys<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.940> method<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
dichotomous keys this is a method of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
dichotomous keys this is a method of
identifying<00:00:45.710> organisms<00:00:46.710> based<00:00:46.950> on

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
identifying organisms based on

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.180 
identifying organisms based on
characteristics<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.960> key<00:00:49.200> helps<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
characteristics and the key helps you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.520 
characteristics and the key helps you
figure<00:00:50.430> out<00:00:50.809> what<00:00:51.809> different<00:00:52.170> organisms<00:00:52.710> are

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
figure out what different organisms are

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.880 
figure out what different organisms are
dichotomous<00:00:55.530> means<00:00:56.329> well<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> die<00:00:58.620> part

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
dichotomous means well the die part

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
dichotomous means well the die part
means<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> you'll<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.000> why<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> two

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
means two and you'll see why the two

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.580 
means two and you'll see why the two
comes<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.640> play<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> second<00:01:06.350> well<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
comes and play in just a second well so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.910 
comes and play in just a second well so
we<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:07.890> deck<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.310> skis<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.939> classifying

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
we use deck on the skis for classifying

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
we use deck on the skis for classifying
or<00:01:10.970> classification<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.360> where<00:01:12.540> we

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
or classification and this is where we

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.630 
or classification and this is where we
separate<00:01:13.020> large<00:01:13.290> groups<00:01:13.770> into<00:01:14.369> smaller

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
separate large groups into smaller

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.940 
separate large groups into smaller
groups<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:17.090> five<00:01:18.090> different

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
groups right here we have five different

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.840 
groups right here we have five different
carta<00:01:19.950> Linnaeus<00:01:20.540> fish<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.520> we<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:23.670> break

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
carta Linnaeus fish and we could break

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.170 
carta Linnaeus fish and we could break
these<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:25.280> one<00:01:26.280> large<00:01:26.460> group<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> car

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
these into as one large group of car

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
these into as one large group of car
Delaney's<00:01:27.540> fish<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.350> we'll<00:01:28.590> break<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.890> into

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
Delaney's fish and we'll break them into

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
Delaney's fish and we'll break them into
smaller<00:01:29.189> groups<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.960> could<00:01:31.140> by

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
smaller groups and there you could by

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
smaller groups and there you could by
looking<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.890> their<00:01:32.100> characteristics<00:01:32.880> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
looking at their characteristics you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.660 
looking at their characteristics you
might<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.329> able<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.630> divide<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.290> into

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
might be able to divide them into

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
might be able to divide them into
different<00:01:35.670> groups<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.670> flat<00:01:39.680> ray<00:01:40.680> would<00:01:41.520> be

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
different groups the flat ray would be

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.340 
different groups the flat ray would be
different<00:01:42.060> than<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> Hammerhead<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
different than the Hammerhead and you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.920 
different than the Hammerhead and you
could<00:01:43.560> maybe<00:01:43.890> determine<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.700> by<00:01:44.909> their<00:01:45.570> body

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
could maybe determine that by their body

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
could maybe determine that by their body
shapes<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.740> their<00:01:47.070> head<00:01:47.280> shapes<00:01:47.640> or<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
shapes or their head shapes or the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.840 
shapes or their head shapes or the
shapes<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> their<00:01:48.689> fins<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.070> coloration

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
shapes of their fins or the coloration

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.399 
shapes of their fins or the coloration
or<00:01:51.060> different<00:01:51.450> things<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.290> may

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
or different things like that so you may

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.230 
or different things like that so you may
take<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> large<00:01:52.920> group<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.340> organisms<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
take a large group of organisms and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.609 
take a large group of organisms and
break<00:01:54.540> them<00:01:54.720> into<00:01:54.840> smaller<00:01:54.990> groups<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:58.380> key

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
break them into smaller groups the key

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
break them into smaller groups the key
is<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.130> tool<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.729> used<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.000> classify<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
is the tool that we used to classify the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.569 
is the tool that we used to classify the
organisms<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.530> already<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
organisms they already have the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
organisms they already have the
descriptions<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> different<00:02:04.020> organisms

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
descriptions of the different organisms

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.490 
descriptions of the different organisms
and<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> helps<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> identify<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.360> are

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
and it helps you identify what they are

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.710 
and it helps you identify what they are
it<00:02:07.500> uses<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.860> list<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> specific

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
it uses a list of specific

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.260 
it uses a list of specific
characteristics<00:02:09.720> such<00:02:10.349> as<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.800> structure<00:02:11.370> or

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
characteristics such as the structure or

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.270 
characteristics such as the structure or
behavior

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
behavior

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.610 
behavior
the<00:02:13.400> organisms<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.240> such<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.630> way<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.080> they

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
the organisms and such a way like they

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.280 
the organisms and such a way like they
can<00:02:15.800> be<00:02:15.920> identified<00:02:16.600> through<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.660> process<00:02:18.200> of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
can be identified through a process of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.309 
can be identified through a process of
elimination<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.520> start<00:02:19.819> off<00:02:19.970> with<00:02:20.330> your

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
elimination so you start off with your

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.600 
elimination so you start off with your
object<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.760> ask<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.740> two<00:02:24.740> ways<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.310> describe

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
object and ask you two ways to describe

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.180 
object and ask you two ways to describe
it<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.180> figure<00:02:26.480> out<00:02:26.540> which<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.050> is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
it and you figure out which one it is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.190 
it and you figure out which one it is
describes<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:29.209> move<00:02:29.600> on<00:02:29.750> from<00:02:29.930> there

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
describes it and then move on from there

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.870 
describes it and then move on from there
and<00:02:30.410> I'll<00:02:30.530> show<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.770> in<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.550> second<00:02:32.500> example

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and I'll show you in a second example

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.940 
and I'll show you in a second example
here<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.060> beans<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:36.230> have<00:02:36.350> five<00:02:36.590> pictures

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
here it is beans we have five pictures

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.540 
here it is beans we have five pictures
across<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.760> bottom<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:39.440> different<00:02:39.890> beans<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
across the bottom of different beans and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.210 
across the bottom of different beans and
by<00:02:41.000> looking<00:02:41.150> at<00:02:41.450> them<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.230> may<00:02:42.440> or<00:02:42.739> may<00:02:42.890> not<00:02:42.920> be

by looking at them you may or may not be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.220 
by looking at them you may or may not be
able<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.550> identify<00:02:43.670> what<00:02:44.390> type<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.569> beans<00:02:44.900> they

able to identify what type of beans they

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.890 
able to identify what type of beans they
are<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.880> if<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.030> really<00:02:47.300> want<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.570> know<00:02:47.690> we

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
are and if you really want to know we

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.160 
are and if you really want to know we
can<00:02:48.019> use<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> key<00:02:48.590> or<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.940> dichotomous<00:02:50.660> key<00:02:50.930> and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
can use a key or a dichotomous key and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.160 
can use a key or a dichotomous key and
the<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.070> remember<00:02:52.580> means<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.360> as<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.989> see

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
the I remember means to and as you see

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.220 
the I remember means to and as you see
as<00:02:54.320> we<00:02:54.440> look<00:02:54.620> down<00:02:54.650> our<00:02:55.010> list<00:02:55.250> one<00:02:56.209> two<00:02:56.810> three

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
as we look down our list one two three

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.490 
as we look down our list one two three
four<00:02:57.950> each<00:02:58.519> one<00:02:58.850> has<00:02:59.600> two<00:02:59.959> options<00:03:00.370> A&amp;B<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:03.380> if

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
four each one has two options A&amp;B so if

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.780 
four each one has two options A&amp;B so if
we<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.100> we<00:03:04.220> always<00:03:04.400> start<00:03:04.610> at<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> very

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
we so we always start at the very

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.180 
we so we always start at the very
beginning<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.870> key<00:03:06.110> let's<00:03:06.830> say<00:03:07.010> we're

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
beginning of the key let's say we're

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.240 
beginning of the key let's say we're
looking<00:03:07.550> at<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:09.200> first<00:03:11.410> beam<00:03:12.410> picture<00:03:13.130> on

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
looking at this first beam picture on

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.940 
looking at this first beam picture on
the<00:03:13.430> bottom<00:03:13.880> left<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.560> want<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.680> find<00:03:15.830> out

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
the bottom left and want to find out

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.740 
the bottom left and want to find out
what<00:03:16.069> they<00:03:16.190> are<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.700> we<00:03:16.790> look<00:03:17.090> at<00:03:17.239> number<00:03:17.570> one

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
what they are so we look at number one

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.870 
what they are so we look at number one
and<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.260> gives<00:03:18.410> us<00:03:18.530> two<00:03:18.769> options<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.670> Dean

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and it gives us two options is the Dean

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.449 
and it gives us two options is the Dean
round<00:03:20.180> or<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.560> Dean<00:03:21.739> elliptical<00:03:22.340> or

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
round or is the Dean elliptical or

round or is the Dean elliptical or
oblong<00:03:22.820> I<00:03:23.120> look<00:03:23.540> at<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.780> picture<00:03:24.079> it's<00:03:24.380> not

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
oblong I look at this picture it's not

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.039 
oblong I look at this picture it's not
round<00:03:24.799> it's<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.340> lipstick<00:03:25.670> or<00:03:25.940> oblong<00:03:26.269> so<00:03:26.989> I

round it's a lipstick or oblong so I

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.319 
round it's a lipstick or oblong so I
look<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.890> right<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.100> gives<00:03:28.640> me<00:03:28.880> the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
look to the right and gives me the

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.600 
look to the right and gives me the
choice<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.900> tells<00:03:30.500> me<00:03:30.590> what<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.799> do<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.220> says<00:03:31.400> go

choice it tells me what to do it says go

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.229 
choice it tells me what to do it says go
to<00:03:32.380> number<00:03:33.380> two<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.850> I'm<00:03:34.910> going<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.090> go<00:03:35.180> to

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
to number two so I'm going to go to

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.840 
to number two so I'm going to go to
number<00:03:35.420> two<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.530> Dean<00:03:36.709> white<00:03:36.980> or<00:03:37.489> does<00:03:37.820> it

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
number two is the Dean white or does it

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.670 
number two is the Dean white or does it
being<00:03:38.120> head<00:03:38.299> dark<00:03:38.510> pigments<00:03:39.049> well<00:03:39.260> it's<00:03:39.530> not

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
our next picture here do the same thing

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.200 
our next picture here do the same thing
is<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.910> round<00:04:20.269> or<00:04:20.799> elliptical<00:04:21.799> or<00:04:21.890> oblong<00:04:22.280> it's

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
is it round or elliptical or oblong it's

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.360 
is it round or elliptical or oblong it's
all<00:04:23.330> along<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.409> have<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.680> go<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.860> number<00:04:25.070> two

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
all along so I have to go to number two

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.129 
all along so I have to go to number two
so<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.060> key<00:04:26.210> tells<00:04:26.450> me<00:04:26.630> what<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.810> do

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
so the key tells me what to do

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.010 
so the key tells me what to do
tell<00:04:27.439> me<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.800> do<00:04:28.009> is<00:04:28.939> it<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.090> white<00:04:29.360> bean<00:04:29.659> or<00:04:29.930> is

go<00:05:13.939> to<00:05:14.000> three<00:05:14.680> so<00:05:15.680> I'm<00:05:15.740> going<00:05:15.889> to<00:05:15.949> go<00:05:16.009> down<00:05:16.159> to

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:16.189 
go to three so I'm going to go down to

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.999 
go to three so I'm going to go down to
number<00:05:16.520> three<00:05:16.819> my<00:05:17.479> choices<00:05:17.750> are<00:05:18.139> even<00:05:18.770> are

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
number three my choices are even are

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:28.209 
number three my choices are even are
modeled<00:05:25.270> sorry<00:05:26.270> about<00:05:26.419> that<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.830> evenly

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
modeled sorry about that it's evenly

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.990 
modeled sorry about that it's evenly
pigmented<00:05:28.909> so<00:05:29.659> go<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.930> four<00:05:30.469> it's<00:05:31.400> not<00:05:31.639> black

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
pigmented so go to four it's not black

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.029 
pigmented so go to four it's not black
so<00:05:32.419> that<00:05:32.569> was<00:05:32.689> the<00:05:32.810> black<00:05:33.020> bean<00:05:33.259> reddish<00:05:33.740> brown

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
so that was the black bean reddish brown

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.689 
so that was the black bean reddish brown
there<00:05:35.029> it<00:05:35.210> is<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.689> kidney<00:05:36.050> bean<00:05:36.319> so<00:05:37.219> I<00:05:37.279> use<00:05:37.520> the

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
there it is the kidney bean so I use the

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.329 
there it is the kidney bean so I use the
key<00:05:37.879> to<00:05:38.029> identify<00:05:38.569> these<00:05:38.629> for<00:05:39.229> a<00:05:39.469> last<00:05:40.279> one<00:05:42.339> to

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:43.339 
key to identify these for a last one to

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.760 
key to identify these for a last one to
key<00:05:43.550> out<00:05:43.729> so<00:05:44.089> let's<00:05:44.330> look<00:05:44.449> at<00:05:44.599> the<00:05:44.750> top<00:05:44.960> it's

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
key out so let's look at the top it's

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.869 
key out so let's look at the top it's
elliptical<00:05:46.099> go<00:05:46.939> to<00:05:47.000> two<00:05:47.439> wire<00:05:48.439> dark<00:05:48.889> it's<00:05:49.520> dark

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
elliptical go to two wire dark it's dark

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.990 
elliptical go to two wire dark it's dark
so<00:05:49.969> I<00:05:50.180> have<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.419> go<00:05:50.569> to<00:05:50.629> three<00:05:52.000> evenly

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
so I have to go to three evenly

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.999 
so I have to go to three evenly
pigmented<00:05:53.539> or<00:05:53.750> model<00:05:54.080> this<00:05:54.229> is<00:05:54.289> model<00:05:54.800> because

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
pigmented or model this is model because

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.529 
pigmented or model this is model because
you<00:05:55.099> can<00:05:55.250> see<00:05:55.399> they're<00:05:55.550> like<00:05:55.729> lights<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.300> dark

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
you can see they're like lights and dark

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.700 
you can see they're like lights and dark
colors<00:05:57.439> on<00:05:57.860> it<00:05:57.889> so<00:05:58.759> it's<00:05:58.939> a<00:05:59.089> pinto<00:05:59.839> beans<00:06:00.110> so

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
colors on it so it's a pinto beans so

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.909 
colors on it so it's a pinto beans so
you<00:06:00.860> successfully<00:06:01.849> use<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.539> key<00:06:03.050> for<00:06:03.379> being<00:06:03.620> so

that's<00:06:18.110> how<00:06:18.259> you<00:06:18.319> can<00:06:18.439> use<00:06:18.800> a<00:06:19.039> dichotomous<00:06:19.969> key

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
that's how you can use a dichotomous key

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.439 
that's how you can use a dichotomous key
to<00:06:21.050> identify<00:06:21.649> things<00:06:22.060> next<00:06:23.060> class<00:06:23.240> we're

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
to identify things next class we're

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.649 
to identify things next class we're
going<00:06:23.479> to<00:06:23.689> practice<00:06:24.020> you<00:06:24.439> ingest<00:06:24.979> this<00:06:25.659> we're
