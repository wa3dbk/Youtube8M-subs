00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:02.620
 .... here is this "dragon consumerism ... 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.410
 and destruction of nature. 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.860
 Even Hollywood puts our hopes in us - all of America. 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.629
 But there are also patriots of the white race in Hollywood. 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.959
 There are also a lot of our - healthy people. 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.149
 There, too, many of our - healthy people work .... 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.169
 for the good of the whole world and not only ... 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:19.320
 film production for the needs of Żmija Gorynycza. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.409
 film production for the needs of Żmija Gorynycza. 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.400
 Therefore - 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.619
 -good youngsters and beautiful young ladies - 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.829
 I urge everyone to .... 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.409
 they have completed their Matrioshka - all of their magical bodies. 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:32.600
 they have completed their Matrioshka - all of their magical bodies. 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.290
 Go on a diet of "self-made tablecloths". 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.240
 Go on a diet of "self-made tablecloths". 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.590
 Create your magical Rhodium habitat. 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.450
 Be the Kings and Queens of your life. 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.920
 Activate your free will (?) 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.450
 Let your hair grow all over your body ... 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.690
 Today, for example, there is fashion to shave ... 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.020
 underarm hair. 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.620
 And what is the result? 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.990
 That is the end of your sex life. 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.830
 After all, underarm hair ... 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.500
 they have a completely different structure than hair on the head. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.330
 they have a completely different structure than hair on the head. 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.540
 Hair on the head are antennas, contact with space. 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.140
 "Cosmas" - means a bond with space. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620
 Hair on legs - contact with Matenka Ziemią. 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.500
 Hair on legs - contact with Matenka Ziemią. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 Women who shave their hair on their feet give birth to a harder one. 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.250
 It is harder for them to give birth to children. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.960
 It's harder for them to become a mother. 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.210
 They heal their Rod's energy. 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.549
 Underarm hair is a hidden knowledge ... 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.950
 - a secret tour to which no one has access. 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.790
 When you go, you have hair under your armpits .... 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.850
 you do not have access to secret knowledge- 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.680
 - whatever you would do there and pray for. 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.630
 - whatever you would do there and pray for. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840
 And that's because as long as you bully your body .... 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.700
 And that's because as long as you bully your body .... 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.650
 you will not see anything good. 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.810
 When mass destruction of forests began in Rus ... 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.070
 When mass destruction of forests began in Rus ... 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.400
 Piotr Piotr Pierwszy - 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 - he brought these gays to Russia. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870
 In these trousers .... 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.060
 who wore wigs from women's hair, shaved their beards. 0: 01: 50.060,0: 01: 51.560 who wore wigs from women's hair, shaved their beards. 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.770
 and they walked around St. Petersburg .... 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.049
 and the boyars with these beards, following them, said: 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.060
 "o -this gays have gone." 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.030
 These European pants came. 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.660
 The protection of gay rights was for Piotr. 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.760
 The protection of gay rights was for Piotr. 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.820
 Peter said, shave them all. He shaved himself. 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.170
 And as soon as the boyars shaved their beards .... 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.019
 порты 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.900
 "Bo-Roda" - they covered their family energy 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.230
 this is the same as in fairytales the fox cut off the wolf's tail - remember? 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.499
 this is the same as in fairytales the fox cut off the wolf's tail - remember? 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.409
 When the wolf escaped without a tail. 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.739
 The same beard shave. 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.829
 shortly after, as shaved and showered boyars ... 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:25.700
 in Rus, the logging of forests began to increase. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.909
 in Rus, the logging of forests began to increase. 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.709
 The analogy is that first man ... 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.330
 he is abusing his body .... 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.720
 over your body - 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.850
 - and then you are going to mistreat nature. 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.909
 Nature is the projection of our body. 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.989
 And when you rebuild your body .... 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.719
 and you will become as it used to be only then ... 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.949
 we can rebuild Mateńkę nature. 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.789
 And here some men want to build ... 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.499
 your ancestral habitat and shave your beard. 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.489
 Without a beard, you will build a non-native habitat ... but a plot of land with trees. 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.019
 Without a beard, you will build a non-native habitat ... but a plot of land with trees. 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.659
 Because "b-Roda" is a bond with Rod. 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.549
 Why did the old Hatabycz pluck ... 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.739
 hair from the beard and his wishes were fulfilled? 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.629
 hair from the beard and his wishes were fulfilled? 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.059
 Because every hair is an antenna .... 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.259
 to one of your relatives. 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.629
 And when the old Hatabycz ... 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.999
 he used the strength of his family's kin ... 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.659
 it was his wishes that were fulfilled. 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.519
 But that's not our Ruskie approach .... 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.510
 pull your hair out of the beard .... 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.349
 to make small wishes come true. It's their way to the problems. 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.779
 to make small wishes come true. It's their way to the problems. 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.219
 to make small wishes come true. It's their way to the problems. 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.499
 Bór Rodu - B-roda. 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.719
 A bond with your Earth Father. 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.899
 And I will return to the hair under the armpits: 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:42.399
 Underarm hair gives off pheromone- hormones of sexual attraction. 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:44.039
 And when a woman shaves her hair under her arms ... 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.149
 And when a woman shaves her hair under her arms ... 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.479
 it's her hormones of sexual allure ... 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.309
 they cease to be secreted .... 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.289
 and the man can not know her by the smell. 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:53.270
 and the man can not know her by the smell. 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.130
 She pours on different perfumes ... 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.489
 made in the fox lab. 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.719
 made in the fox lab. 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.129
 And the man chooses the wrong woman. 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.929
 And the man chooses the wrong woman. 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:04.949
 That is how the sense of smell was spoiled. 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.629
 After all, male .... 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.349
 she chooses the female smell. You know that. 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.609
 That's how wolves foxes etc. 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.819
 And here .... 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.370
 the aromas appear in the smells. 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.150
 The woman kills her natural scent ... 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.430
 when he shaves his hair smoothly. 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.979
 And pheromones instead of exuding ... 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:24.949
 And pheromones instead of exuding ... 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.870
 and surround it with such a cloud ... 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.900
 make the best of men .... 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.749
 he recognized the one that was the most appropriate for himself by smell. 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.779
 When you cut your hair ... 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.340
 these pheromones start inside ... 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.909
 and a small lake is created there ... 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.849
 where the mushrooms feed ... 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:42.469
 where the mushrooms feed ... 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.319
 and this stink appears. 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.399
 This stench from underarms is a sick armpit. 

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.669
 This is when these hormones just rot. Mud is done there. 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.020
 This is when these hormones just rot. Mud is done there. 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.039
 How can you have the ideal of a husband or wife when it stinks there? 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.259
 How can you have the ideal of a husband or wife when it stinks there? 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.539
 What to expect? 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.590
 When everything is right ... 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.840
 When everything is right ... 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.759
 that's where a nice can is growing and a pleasant smell. 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.729
 that's where a nice can is growing and a pleasant smell. 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.330
 If you are a healthy person ... 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.699
 you will attract a healthy spouse. 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.360
 And if it stinks because of this mud .... 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.360
 And if it stinks because of this mud .... 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.229
 you will attract a woman or a man, 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.879
 króry / a will make you unhappy. 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.809
 Because the smell itself is lying. 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:21.529
 And the smell of us all leads very much. 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.419
 And the smell of us all leads very much. 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.479
 These are the fox ways ... 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.080
 I barely said a little about the armpits. 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.949
 I barely said a little about the armpits ... 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.759
 and I could about this hour. 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.409
 Come to meetings with Ivan Carewicz if anyone is curious ... 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.229
 Come to meetings with Ivan Carewicz if anyone is interested in fairy tales. 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.400
 Come to meetings with Ivan Carewicz if anyone is interested in fairy tales. 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:44.590
 "A fairy tale is not true but there is a hint in it Who has it, this one has a lesson". 0: 05: 37590.0: 05: 40.580
