of<00:02:00.899> which<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> crystal<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.070> keeps

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
of which is like this crystal that keeps

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
of which is like this crystal that keeps
growing<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.149> growing<00:02:03.240> until<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.049> consumes

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
growing and growing until it consumes

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.840 
growing and growing until it consumes
them<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
them and if you can get to the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.809 
them and if you can get to the
challenges<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.509> time<00:02:06.719> he'll<00:02:07.259> let<00:02:07.439> them<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:07.819> if

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
challenges in time he'll let them go if

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
challenges in time he'll let them go if
you<00:02:09.209> watch<00:02:09.390> deep<00:02:09.720> space<00:02:09.989> 9<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.679> know

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you watch deep space 9 you can know

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.809 
you watch deep space 9 you can know
they're<00:02:11.250> getting<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.670> from<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.120> but

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
they're getting it from that but

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.110 
they're getting it from that but
yeah<00:02:12.939> that's<00:02:13.150> okeke<00:02:13.689> but<00:02:14.040> anyway<00:02:15.040> maybe<00:02:15.760> same

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
yeah that's okeke but anyway maybe same

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.050 
yeah that's okeke but anyway maybe same
idea<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.689> know<00:02:16.810> perfectly<00:02:17.290> possible<00:02:17.499> uh<00:02:18.189> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
idea you know perfectly possible uh and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.410 
idea you know perfectly possible uh and
the<00:02:19.569> whole<00:02:19.719> idea<00:02:19.749> of<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.200> challenges<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:21.420> guess

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
the whole idea of the challenges I guess

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.459 
the whole idea of the challenges I guess
sort<00:02:23.139> of<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:24.159> good<00:02:24.639> idea<00:02:25.239> all<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
sort of is a good idea all the

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.770 
sort of is a good idea all the
challenges<00:02:26.680> had<00:02:27.340> sort<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.819> like<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.239> trick<00:02:28.569> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
challenges had sort of like a trick to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.789 
challenges had sort of like a trick to
it<00:02:28.810> or<00:02:29.019> wasn't<00:02:29.379> what<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:29.980> expected<00:02:30.359> um<00:02:31.799> you

it or wasn't what you expected um you

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.539 
it or wasn't what you expected um you
know<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.969> there's<00:02:34.239> even<00:02:34.540> one<00:02:34.569> where

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
great big fight so I sorta like that

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.539

like<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.239> trick<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.569> top<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.019> trick<00:03:02.519> but<00:03:03.519> i

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
like a trick on top of a trick but i

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.089 
like a trick on top of a trick but i
guess<00:03:03.939> the<00:03:04.150> purpose<00:03:04.599> was<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.290> show<00:03:05.799> him

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
guess the purpose was just to show him

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.679 
guess the purpose was just to show him
to<00:03:06.310> always<00:03:06.699> think<00:03:06.730> out<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.389> box<00:03:09.120> cool<00:03:10.120> you

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
to always think out of the box cool you

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.250 
to always think out of the box cool you
know<00:03:10.719> all<00:03:11.409> right<00:03:11.709> um<00:03:12.870> it'll<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:13.959> interesting

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
know all right um it'll be interesting

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.110 
know all right um it'll be interesting
to<00:03:14.469> see<00:03:14.560> if<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.739> actually<00:03:14.859> comes<00:03:15.370> back<00:03:15.669> to

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
to see if that actually comes back to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.789 
to see if that actually comes back to
whether<00:03:16.480> that's<00:03:16.750> relevant<00:03:17.199> but<00:03:17.560> this

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
whether that's relevant but this

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.229 
whether that's relevant but this
definitely<00:03:18.069> seems<00:03:18.400> sort<00:03:18.699> of<00:03:18.729> like<00:03:18.879> a<00:03:18.909> side

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
definitely seems sort of like a side

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.559 
definitely seems sort of like a side
