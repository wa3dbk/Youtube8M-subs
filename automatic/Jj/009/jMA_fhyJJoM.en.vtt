currently working on different sections
of<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.359> 80<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.399> I<00:01:00.460> wanted<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.760> go<00:01:00.850> back<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.120> that

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.110 
of the 80 so I wanted to go back to that
because<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.690> flat<00:01:01.899> cat<00:01:02.170> standard<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:04.030> know

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
because the flat cat standard you know

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.680 
because the flat cat standard you know
it'll<00:01:04.360> boil<00:01:04.629> two<00:01:04.840> cups<00:01:05.050> of<00:01:05.140> water<00:01:05.320> using<00:01:05.710> 15

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
it'll boil two cups of water using 15

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.840 
it'll boil two cups of water using 15
mls<00:01:07.690> or<00:01:07.810> half<00:01:08.020> ounce<00:01:08.200> alcohol<00:01:08.740> but<00:01:09.640> it's<00:01:09.790> a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
mls or half ounce alcohol but it's a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.960 
mls or half ounce alcohol but it's a
tough<00:01:10.420> little<00:01:11.170> stove<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.860> so<00:01:12.370> we<00:01:12.820> thought

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
tough little stove and so we thought

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.180 
tough little stove and so we thought
we'd<00:01:13.120> make<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:13.420> video<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.870> show<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.770> what

how<00:01:18.610> we've<00:01:18.820> abused<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.590> how<00:01:20.590> robust<00:01:21.160> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
how we've abused it and how robust the
