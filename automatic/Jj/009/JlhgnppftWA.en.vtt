00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.929
 stone 7 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.760
 the score of 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.520
 snub 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.520
 who knows 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.380
 but the score of 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.169
 rio what is it for you she Templars 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.640
 of course I think that apart 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.770
 I had crossed millau every year 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 to possibly go down to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 montpellier same young head there has been 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.809
 maybe not the viaduct yet we had 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.449
 used to find the plugs here 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.220
 and then after that has been since 2006 the 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.570
 Templars is what the Knights Templar 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.280
 a form of freedom or constraint to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 it's going to be there then you already said 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.059
 two words that is yes because freedom 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.879
 because I will associate freedom with 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.460
 pleasure to run to feel free to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.619
 to hit the road to discover 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.629
 news of the new places so 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.100
 freedom side yes and force her to the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.470
 constraint of fading 100 days to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.780
 the training lasts since August 1st 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 every year there are still some 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 long outlets very very long a lot 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.930
 very hard workout every 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.280
 weekends what we devoted ourselves to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.360
 of the specific Templars so that makes a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 package of constraints anyway for 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.759
 really prepared the test 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.759

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.439
 m 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.890

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.830
 where I had the joy of doing it myself and 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.600
 I wish to full I wish to full 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.899

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.709
 body as much as me I wore them or 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.970

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.110
 it's something huge 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.430
 that's why we're getting ready for the weather 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.640
 for there to try to win this 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.640
 test 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.250

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.230
 she is friends who in the end 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.480
 that's tamedia always someone who 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.819
 is race ah ben I believe that the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.840
 Sundays I saw a lady with the roque 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.360
 holy daisy she told me they 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.720
 had passed the world since 2-3 Sunday 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.489
 his love 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.690
 but I think people have been there 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.769
 facts they know that at a test they 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.660
 know that people have been recognizing since 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.090
 for three four years now they 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.660
 know that and runner on Sunday 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.550
 certainly that sometimes they have to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.860
 questioned to know how to look for their 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.870
 way to the 6th of May where they and the people of 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.890
 surroundings know that at a race to the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.750
 end of the month of October 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.850

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.920

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.720

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.610

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.370

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.250
