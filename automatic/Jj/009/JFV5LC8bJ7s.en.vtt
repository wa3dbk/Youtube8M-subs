00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
as early as who can get up the reason is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
as early as who can get up the reason is
this<00:01:08.880> after<00:01:09.510> you've<00:01:09.659> watered<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.170> garden<00:01:10.200> all

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
this after you've watered the garden all

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.410 
this after you've watered the garden all
of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> moisture<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.700> remains<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
of the moisture that remains in the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
of the moisture that remains in the
foliage<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> plant<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> varies

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
foliage of the plant and if this varies

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
foliage of the plant and if this varies
from<00:01:14.640> plant<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> plant<00:01:15.060> makes<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> plant

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
from plant to plant makes the plant

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.190 
from plant to plant makes the plant
susceptible<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> disease<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.180> having<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.930> burn

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
susceptible to disease so having a burn

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
susceptible to disease so having a burn
off<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> Sun<00:01:20.040> mid<00:01:20.369> morning<00:01:20.580> through

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
off in the Sun mid morning through

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
off in the Sun mid morning through
midday<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.990> benefit<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> plant<00:01:22.979> there's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
midday is a benefit to the plant there's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.530 
midday is a benefit to the plant there's
one<00:01:23.460> other<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.880> important<00:01:24.390> thing<00:01:24.509> about

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
one other really important thing about

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
one other really important thing about
this<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.189> day<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.340> how

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this not just the time of day but how

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
this not just the time of day but how
you<00:01:26.700> water<00:01:27.090> getting<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.540> water<00:01:27.750> down<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you water getting that water down to the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.960 
you water getting that water down to the
root<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.860> important<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.400> well<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
root is really important as well and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.780 
root is really important as well and
what<00:01:30.119> about<00:01:30.210> lawns<00:01:30.570> same<00:01:31.259> idea<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:32.009> quite<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
what about lawns same idea not quite I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.789 
what about lawns same idea not quite I
never<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.570> concerned<00:01:33.990> myself<00:01:34.170> about

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
never really concerned myself about

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.710 
never really concerned myself about
watering<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> lawn<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> morning<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
watering the lawn in the morning or the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
watering the lawn in the morning or the
evening<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.439> avoid<00:01:37.950> watering<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
evening but I do avoid watering in the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
evening but I do avoid watering in the
midday<00:01:39.180> period<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> reason<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
midday period and the reason is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
midday period and the reason is
evaporation<00:01:41.430> especially<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.329> an

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
evaporation especially if you use an

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
evaporation especially if you use an
oscillating<00:01:42.899> sprinkler<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.680> goes<00:01:43.860> like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
oscillating sprinkler that goes like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
oscillating sprinkler that goes like
this<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> reason<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.149> you'll<00:01:45.360> lose<00:01:45.509> 30<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
this and the reason is you'll lose 30 to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.410 
this and the reason is you'll lose 30 to
40<00:01:46.530> percent<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.250> water<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.850> evaporation

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
40 percent of your water to evaporation

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.749 
40 percent of your water to evaporation
next<00:01:48.990> question<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> best<00:01:50.340> sprinkler

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
next question what is the best sprinkler

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
next question what is the best sprinkler
for<00:01:50.790> my<00:01:51.030> glance<00:01:51.270> that's<00:01:51.659> both<00:01:52.079> efficient<00:01:52.590> with

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
for my glance that's both efficient with

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
for my glance that's both efficient with
water<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.189> gentle<00:01:53.610> that's<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.030> very<00:01:54.210> good

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
water and gentle that's a very good

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.340 
water and gentle that's a very good
question<00:01:54.540> actually

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
question actually

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
question actually
and<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:56.009> there<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> March<00:01:56.880> choice

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and you know there is a March choice

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.999 
and you know there is a March choice
sprinkler<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.869> call<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.290> heartbreaker

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
sprinkler I call the heartbreaker

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.440 
sprinkler I call the heartbreaker

sprinkler<00:02:43.299> system<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.989> know<00:02:44.079> there<00:02:44.290> are

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
sprinkler system you know there are

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.869 
sprinkler system you know there are
really<00:02:44.439> two<00:02:44.799> solutions<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.609> they<00:02:45.669> both

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
really two solutions and they both

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.309 
really two solutions and they both
amount<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.389> same<00:02:46.629> thing<00:02:46.930> they're<00:02:47.169> now

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
amount to the same thing they're now

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.250 
amount to the same thing they're now
called<00:02:47.709> soaker<00:02:48.159> hoses<00:02:48.579> and<00:02:49.030> these<00:02:49.959> are<00:02:50.169> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
called soaker hoses and these are the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.009 
called soaker hoses and these are the
hoses<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.919> basically<00:02:51.310> bleed<00:02:51.849> water<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.689> the

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
hoses that basically bleed water and the

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.159 
hoses that basically bleed water and the
idea<00:02:53.409> is<00:02:53.919> to<00:02:53.980> place<00:02:54.730> these<00:02:55.060> black<00:02:55.659> soaker

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
idea is to place these black soaker

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.050 
idea is to place these black soaker
hoses<00:02:56.349> underneath<00:02:57.159> either<00:02:57.489> 4<00:02:57.819> or<00:02:57.909> 5

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
hoses underneath either 4 or 5

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.599 
hoses underneath either 4 or 5
centimeters<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.930> mulch<00:02:59.169> or<00:02:59.709> underneath<00:03:00.069> soil

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
centimeters of mulch or underneath soil

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.629 
centimeters of mulch or underneath soil
perfect<00:03:01.299> for<00:03:01.599> growing<00:03:02.079> tomatoes<00:03:02.469> or<00:03:03.219> growing

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
perfect for growing tomatoes or growing

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.879 
perfect for growing tomatoes or growing
roses<00:03:03.879> or<00:03:04.389> any<00:03:04.659> plant<00:03:05.139> that<00:03:05.379> needs<00:03:05.620> a

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
roses or any plant that needs a

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.819 
roses or any plant that needs a
reasonably<00:03:06.790> regular<00:03:07.540> application<00:03:08.409> of<00:03:08.590> water

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
reasonably regular application of water

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.970 
reasonably regular application of water
the<00:03:09.250> two<00:03:09.459> choices<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.939> have<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.629> one<00:03:11.230> that's

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
the two choices you have is one that's

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.189 
the two choices you have is one that's
made<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.519> recycled<00:03:12.729> rubber<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.900> these<00:03:14.019> are

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199 
made of recycled rubber so these are

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.069 
made of recycled rubber so these are
your<00:03:14.319> old<00:03:14.560> car<00:03:14.889> tires<00:03:15.389> repurposed<00:03:16.389> and<00:03:16.569> it's<00:03:16.989> a

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
your old car tires repurposed and it's a

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.110 
your old car tires repurposed and it's a
porous<00:03:17.440> material<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:18.310> allows<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.790> water<00:03:18.970> to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
porous material that allows the water to

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.110 
porous material that allows the water to
just<00:03:19.389> bleed<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.109> fabric<00:03:20.709> one<00:03:20.949> actually<00:03:21.879> takes

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
just bleed the fabric one actually takes

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.929 
just bleed the fabric one actually takes
a<00:03:22.209> lot<00:03:22.239> more<00:03:22.560> pressure<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.069> if<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.669> lot

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
a lot more pressure so if you have a lot

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.000 
a lot more pressure so if you have a lot
of<00:03:24.970> water<00:03:25.269> pressure<00:03:25.629> if<00:03:25.959> your<00:03:26.199> place<00:03:26.470> then<00:03:26.829> you

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
of water pressure if your place then you

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.339 
of water pressure if your place then you
want<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.280> use<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.819> fabric<00:03:28.329> type<00:03:28.870> which<00:03:29.169> is<00:03:29.319> a

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
want to use the fabric type which is a

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.259 
want to use the fabric type which is a
synthetic<00:03:29.650> material<00:03:29.979> because<00:03:30.819> it'll<00:03:31.090> just

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
synthetic material because it'll just

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.599 
synthetic material because it'll just
last<00:03:31.510> longer<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.260> what<00:03:32.889> if<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.129> forget<00:03:33.459> about

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
last longer and what if I forget about

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.909 
last longer and what if I forget about
it<00:03:33.760> what<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.239> don't<00:03:34.540> shut<00:03:34.900> off<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.229> hose<00:03:35.379> huh

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
it what if I don't shut off the hose huh

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.830 
it what if I don't shut off the hose huh
well<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.489> know<00:03:36.639> we're<00:03:36.819> all<00:03:36.849> guilty<00:03:37.419> of<00:03:37.449> doing

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
well you know we're all guilty of doing

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.420 
well you know we're all guilty of doing
that<00:03:37.959> from<00:03:38.259> one<00:03:38.409> time<00:03:38.650> or<00:03:38.799> another<00:03:38.979> and<00:03:39.129> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
that from one time or another and the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.699 
that from one time or another and the
answer<00:03:39.759> would<00:03:39.939> be<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.120> timer<00:03:40.479> these<00:03:40.930> timers<00:03:41.259> are

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
answer would be a timer these timers are

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.649 
answer would be a timer these timers are
easy<00:03:42.189> to<00:03:42.400> use<00:03:42.579> they're<00:03:42.939> very<00:03:43.180> efficient

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
easy to use they're very efficient

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.319 
easy to use they're very efficient
they're<00:03:43.780> relatively<00:03:44.620> inexpensive<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.699> it'll

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
they're relatively inexpensive and it'll

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
cool product that rolls up when there's

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.470 
cool product that rolls up when there's
no<00:04:44.740> rain<00:04:45.040> but<00:04:45.310> under<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.910> pressure<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.390> the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
no rain but under the pressure of the

rain traveling down the downspout it
rolls<00:04:49.210> out<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:50.500> is<00:04:50.680> great<00:04:50.920> because

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
rolls out so this is great because

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
right and minimizes the potential for

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.770 
right and minimizes the potential for
flooding<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.370> pushes<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.970> water<00:04:58.090> five<00:04:58.510> feet

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
flooding and pushes the water five feet

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.300 
flooding and pushes the water five feet
