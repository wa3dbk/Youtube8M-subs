with<00:02:25.300> something<00:02:25.780> nikon<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.950> came<00:02:27.190> out<00:02:27.400> with

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
with something nikon just came out with

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.600 
with something nikon just came out with
a<00:02:27.810> d7000<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.560> has<00:02:29.740> somewhat<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.580> same

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
a d7000 and it has somewhat the same

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.160 
a d7000 and it has somewhat the same
feature<00:02:31.180> set<00:02:31.750> as<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.710> 7d<00:02:33.130> does<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.420> check<00:02:35.140> it

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
feature set as the 7d does so check it

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.440 
feature set as the 7d does so check it
out<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.160> good<00:02:36.340> camera<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:38.230> 7d<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:39.450> going

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
out it's a good camera the 7d is going

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.800 
out it's a good camera the 7d is going
to<00:02:40.600> feel<00:02:41.640> very<00:02:42.640> much<00:02:42.910> different<00:02:43.570> in<00:02:43.780> your

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
to feel very much different in your

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
hands from from other DSLRs it's very

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
hands from from other DSLRs it's very
very<00:02:49.930> well<00:02:50.530> built<00:02:50.950> we'll<00:02:51.910> put<00:02:52.270> together<00:02:52.420> well

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
very well built we'll put together well

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.710 
very well built we'll put together well
thought<00:02:53.800> out<00:02:53.830> it's<00:02:54.730> very<00:02:54.970> easy<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.360> change

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
thought out it's very easy to change

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.090

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
just good to use and after all that's

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.890 
just good to use and after all that's
what<00:03:03.070> it's<00:03:03.220> all<00:03:03.370> about<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:03.940> using<00:03:04.690> your

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
what it's all about it's using your

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.330 
what it's all about it's using your
equipment<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:07.300> take<00:03:07.570> an<00:03:07.810> image<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.500> look

equipment if you take an image and look

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.220 
equipment if you take an image and look
at<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.790> great<00:03:10.240> image<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:10.990> produced

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
at it a great image that you produced

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.130 
at it a great image that you produced
and<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:12.070> really<00:03:12.340> think<00:03:12.610> about<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.450> camera

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
and you really think about it the camera

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.940 
and you really think about it the camera
body<00:03:14.320> or<00:03:14.830> camera<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.150> used<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:17.080> probably

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
body or camera that you used is probably

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.370 
body or camera that you used is probably
a<00:03:18.070> very<00:03:18.310> small<00:03:18.880> percentage<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.750> what<00:03:19.960> it<00:03:20.080> took

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
a very small percentage of what it took

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
a very small percentage of what it took
to<00:03:20.680> create<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.580> image<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.890> lot<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.190> has<00:03:24.370> to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
to create that image a lot of it has to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.690 
to create that image a lot of it has to
do<00:03:24.760> with<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.450> lens<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.530> use<00:03:26.800> if<00:03:27.070> you're<00:03:27.580> going

the 24 to 105 the 17 to 55 f 2.8 which
is<00:05:30.930> probably<00:05:31.169> my<00:05:31.410> go-to<00:05:31.770> lens<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.690> then<00:05:33.690> I

a<00:05:37.889> variable<00:05:38.880> aperture<00:05:39.030> then<00:05:39.960> I<00:05:39.990> have<00:05:40.289> two

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
a variable aperture then I have two

millimeter<00:05:45.539> f<00:05:45.810> 2.8<00:05:47.120> so<00:05:48.120> a<00:05:48.449> good<00:05:48.810> lens<00:05:49.050> choice

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
millimeter f 2.8 so a good lens choice

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.129 
millimeter f 2.8 so a good lens choice
is<00:05:49.889> key<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:50.639> I'm<00:05:51.180> always<00:05:51.330> switching<00:05:51.780> back<00:05:52.110> and

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
is key and I'm always switching back and

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.279 
is key and I'm always switching back and
forth<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:53.000> but<00:05:54.000> but<00:05:54.330> it<00:05:54.449> is<00:05:54.570> nice<00:05:54.810> to<00:05:54.870> have

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
forth and but but it is nice to have

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.640 
forth and but but it is nice to have
something<00:05:55.680> like<00:05:55.800> at<00:05:56.130> 17<00:05:56.699> and<00:05:56.729> 55<00:05:57.360> f<00:05:57.690> 2.8<00:05:57.900> that

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
something like at 17 and 55 f 2.8 that

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.879 
something like at 17 and 55 f 2.8 that
it's<00:05:59.280> kind<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.580> an<00:05:59.699> all<00:05:59.849> around<00:06:00.210> good<00:06:00.599> lands<00:06:01.080> as
