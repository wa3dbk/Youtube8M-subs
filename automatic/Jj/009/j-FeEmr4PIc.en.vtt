there<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.139> as<00:00:13.500> few<00:00:13.980> simple<00:00:14.549> pointers<00:00:15.000> that

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
there are as few simple pointers that

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.870 
there are as few simple pointers that
you<00:00:15.360> need<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.750> follow<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.680> need<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.130> think

you need to follow you need to think

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880 
you need to follow you need to think
about<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.330> plants<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.260> about<00:00:19.590> things

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
about the plants and think about things

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
about the plants and think about things
like<00:00:20.330> shape<00:00:21.590> texture<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> color<00:00:23.369> now<00:00:24.359> for

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
like shape texture and color now for

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.189 
like shape texture and color now for
example<00:00:25.910> when<00:00:26.910> we're<00:00:27.060> looking<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.539> texture

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
example when we're looking at texture

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.070 
example when we're looking at texture
this<00:00:28.949> plant<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.789> jersey<00:00:30.119> ax<00:00:30.359> has<00:00:30.810> these

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
this plant or a jersey ax has these

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.549 
this plant or a jersey ax has these
fabulous<00:00:32.120> heavily<00:00:33.120> textured<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:34.260> quite

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
fabulous heavily textured really quite

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.000 
fabulous heavily textured really quite
solid<00:00:35.250> tropical<00:00:35.940> looking<00:00:36.270> leaves<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:37.680> also

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
solid tropical looking leaves it's also

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.889 
solid tropical looking leaves it's also
got<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> feature<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.420> new<00:00:39.600> growth

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
got the feature that the new growth

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.490 
got the feature that the new growth
comes<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.829> sort<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> red<00:00:42.239> flushed<00:00:42.870> bronze

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
comes up a sort of red flushed bronze

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.760 
comes up a sort of red flushed bronze
color<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.850> pretty<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> when<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
color which is really pretty so when I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.970 
color which is really pretty so when I
team<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.480> something<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.440> fern

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
team that with something like this fern

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.790 
team that with something like this fern
which<00:00:50.640> also<00:00:51.000> comes<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> bronze<00:00:52.379> flush

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
which also comes up with a bronze flush

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.790 
which also comes up with a bronze flush
then<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.180> difference<00:00:54.690> between<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.350> soft

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
then the difference between this soft

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.910 
then the difference between this soft
Lacey<00:00:56.219> frond<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.960> quite<00:00:58.469> solid

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
Lacey frond and this quite solid

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.549 
Lacey frond and this quite solid
corrugated<00:01:01.920> leaf<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.629> really<00:01:03.629> works<00:01:04.199> really

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
corrugated leaf is really works really

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
corrugated leaf is really works really
well<00:01:04.769> together<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.670> would<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.119> ideal

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
well together and this would be an ideal

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590 
well together and this would be an ideal
combination<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> shady<00:01:07.890> spot<00:01:08.479> then<00:01:09.479> we

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
combination for a shady spot then we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.550 
combination for a shady spot then we
think<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:10.140> color<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.299> of<00:01:12.299> course<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.350> can

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
think about color and of course you can

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.390 
think about color and of course you can
always<00:01:13.740> mix<00:01:14.580> things<00:01:15.350> that<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.470> close<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.220> one

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
always mix things that are close to one

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
always mix things that are close to one
another<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> color<00:01:18.390> spectrum<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
another in the color spectrum and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.690 
another in the color spectrum and
they'll<00:01:19.409> always<00:01:19.650> look<00:01:19.979> pretty<00:01:20.280> good<00:01:20.490> together

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
they'll always look pretty good together

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.810 
they'll always look pretty good together
but<00:01:21.500> don't<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.860> frightened

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
but don't be frightened

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.190 
but don't be frightened
of<00:01:24.000> taking<00:01:24.450> things<00:01:25.460> from<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> polar<00:01:27.450> opposite

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
of taking things from the polar opposite

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
of taking things from the polar opposite
side<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> color<00:01:28.950> wheel<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.520> mixing<00:01:30.450> them

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
side of the color wheel and mixing them

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.060 
side of the color wheel and mixing them
together<00:01:31.100> because<00:01:32.509> sometimes<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> fact<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
together because sometimes the fact that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.240 
together because sometimes the fact that
they're<00:01:35.400> complete<00:01:36.299> opposites<00:01:37.079> makes<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
they're complete opposites makes the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
they're complete opposites makes the
colors<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.509> vibrant<00:01:41.720> also<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:42.930> you're

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
colors really vibrant also when you're

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.620 
colors really vibrant also when you're
choosing<00:01:43.439> plants

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.529 

try<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.689> look<00:01:48.170> at<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.439> detail<00:01:49.039> so<00:01:49.880> for<00:01:50.090> example

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
try to look at the detail so for example

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.749 
try to look at the detail so for example
this<00:01:50.659> little<00:01:50.840> flocks<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:51.950> might<00:01:52.189> just<00:01:52.520> think

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
this little flocks you might just think

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.810 
this little flocks you might just think
oh<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.420> got<00:01:53.570> blue<00:01:53.780> flowers<00:01:54.259> but<00:01:55.159> if<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.610> look

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
oh it's got blue flowers but if you look

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.889 
oh it's got blue flowers but if you look
really<00:01:55.850> closely<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:57.619> can<00:01:57.799> see<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.369> rich<00:01:58.939> plum<00:01:59.509> I

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
really closely you can see a rich plum I

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.270 
really closely you can see a rich plum I
and<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.880> tells<00:02:02.240> me<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.289> phlox<00:02:03.829> is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
and that tells me that that phlox is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.800 
and that tells me that that phlox is
going<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.759> grow<00:02:04.939> really<00:02:05.240> well<00:02:05.979> with<00:02:06.979> something

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
going to grow really well with something

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.289 
going to grow really well with something
that's<00:02:08.810> got<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.759> plum<00:02:10.759> colored<00:02:11.150> flower<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.700> just

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
that's got a plum colored flower so just

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.910 
that's got a plum colored flower so just
for<00:02:14.480> an<00:02:14.540> example<00:02:14.660> something<00:02:15.440> like<00:02:15.590> this

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
for an example something like this

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.069 
for an example something like this
cirsium<00:02:16.430> here<00:02:17.079> it's<00:02:18.079> a<00:02:18.230> perfect<00:02:18.709> color<00:02:18.890> match

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
cirsium here it's a perfect color match

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.819 
cirsium here it's a perfect color match
even<00:02:21.079> things<00:02:21.769> like<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:24.019> linaria

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
even things like this linaria

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.539 
even things like this linaria
which<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.400> looking<00:02:25.819> beautiful<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:28.340> got<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
which is looking beautiful it's got the

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.580 
which is looking beautiful it's got the
purple<00:02:28.940> flowers<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:29.569> it's<00:02:29.720> also<00:02:30.049> developing

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
purple flowers but it's also developing

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.740 
purple flowers but it's also developing
these<00:02:30.799> really<00:02:31.370> dark<00:02:31.959> seed<00:02:32.959> pods<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:35.000> would

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
these really dark seed pods so I would
