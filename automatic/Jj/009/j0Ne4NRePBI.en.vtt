that history have something called
congenital<00:02:07.020> ptosis<00:02:07.289> ptosis<00:02:08.220> means<00:02:08.369> drooping

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
congenital ptosis ptosis means drooping

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.440 
congenital ptosis ptosis means drooping
so<00:02:09.479> its<00:02:09.630> eyelid<00:02:10.140> congenital<00:02:10.860> eyelid<00:02:11.190> ptosis

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
so its eyelid congenital eyelid ptosis

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.710 
so its eyelid congenital eyelid ptosis
now<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.660> means<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.500> muscle<00:02:14.040> that

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
now what that means is the muscle that

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.260 
now what that means is the muscle that
lifts<00:02:15.720> your<00:02:15.870> eyelid<00:02:16.380> did<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.280> develop<00:02:18.060> the

lifts your eyelid did not develop the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.190 
lifts your eyelid did not develop the
same<00:02:18.540> way<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.480> normal<00:02:21.480> eyelid<00:02:21.900> or<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
eyelid that has no droop it means that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.369 
eyelid that has no droop it means that
muscle<00:02:25.470> doesn't<00:02:25.709> fully<00:02:26.220> contract<00:02:26.970> nor<00:02:27.900> does

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
muscle doesn't fully contract nor does

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.990 
muscle doesn't fully contract nor does
it<00:02:28.410> fully<00:02:28.860> relax<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:31.190> when<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.670> deal<00:02:32.970> with

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
it fully relax so when we deal with

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.740 
it fully relax so when we deal with
congenital<00:02:33.690> ptosis<00:02:33.930> if<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.370> child<00:02:36.120> doesn't

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
congenital ptosis if the child doesn't

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.040 
congenital ptosis if the child doesn't
have<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.740> visually<00:02:38.670> significant<00:02:39.420> ptosis<00:02:39.810> where

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
have a visually significant ptosis where

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
functional issue now one of the things

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.050 
functional issue now one of the things
that<00:02:53.819> happens<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.569> congenital<00:02:55.050> ptosis<00:02:55.500> is

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
that happens with congenital ptosis is

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.870 
that happens with congenital ptosis is
that<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.350> worse<00:02:58.830> as<00:02:59.190> people<00:02:59.700> get

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
that it can get worse as people get

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.140 
that it can get worse as people get
older<00:03:00.330> as<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:01.170> facial<00:03:01.650> structure<00:03:02.310> changes

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
older as the facial structure changes

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.449 
older as the facial structure changes
and<00:03:03.470> one<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> things<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.280> also

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
and one of the things that we also

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.670 
and one of the things that we also
observe<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.790> lot<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.819> times<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
observe is that a lot of times the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.410 
observe is that a lot of times the
compensation<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.890> people<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:11.489> when<00:03:12.239> they

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
compensation that people do when they

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.720 
compensation that people do when they
have<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.600> drooping<00:03:13.050> eyelid<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:14.130> raise<00:03:14.400> their

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
have a drooping eyelid is to raise their

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.350 
have a drooping eyelid is to raise their
eyebrow<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.709> very<00:03:16.709> often<00:03:17.180> especially<00:03:18.180> when

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
eyebrow and very often especially when

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.259 
eyebrow and very often especially when
the<00:03:18.510> skin<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.050> more<00:03:19.530> tight<00:03:20.040> you're<00:03:20.910> able<00:03:21.209> to

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
the skin is more tight you're able to

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.900 
the skin is more tight you're able to
more<00:03:21.420> effectively<00:03:22.230> raise<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.130> eyebrow<00:03:23.610> and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
more effectively raise the eyebrow and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.449 
more effectively raise the eyebrow and
lift<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.510> eyelid<00:03:24.720> as<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:25.920> older<00:03:26.250> there's

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
lift the eyelid as you get older there's

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.479 
lift the eyelid as you get older there's
a<00:03:26.550> little<00:03:26.760> bit<00:03:26.880> more<00:03:27.060> stretch<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.810> that

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
a little bit more stretch and that

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.259 
a little bit more stretch and that
compensatory<00:03:29.489> action<00:03:30.269> doesn't<00:03:30.750> work<00:03:30.959> as<00:03:31.170> well

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
compensatory action doesn't work as well

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.330 
compensatory action doesn't work as well
it's<00:03:33.269> very<00:03:33.480> common<00:03:34.019> for<00:03:34.050> people<00:03:34.500> who<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.130> had

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it's very common for people who have had

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.640 
it's very common for people who have had
a<00:03:35.370> long<00:03:35.700> history<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:36.180> ptosis<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:37.260> say<00:03:37.470> it's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
a long history of ptosis to say it's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.420 
a long history of ptosis to say it's
worse<00:03:37.920> at<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.280> end<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> day<00:03:40.069> one<00:03:41.069> thing<00:03:41.100> to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
worse at the end of the day one thing to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.960 
worse at the end of the day one thing to
also<00:03:41.610> be<00:03:42.269> aware<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.440> my<00:03:44.069> experience<00:03:44.700> is

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
also be aware of in my experience is

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.050 
also be aware of in my experience is
that<00:03:45.660> people<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:46.350> ptosis<00:03:46.950> are<00:03:47.220> particularly

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that people have ptosis are particularly

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.080 
that people have ptosis are particularly
bothered<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.650> eye<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.850> being

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
bothered if that eye that is being

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.460 
bothered if that eye that is being
affected<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.900> their<00:03:52.140> dominant<00:03:52.739> eye<00:03:53.150> there<00:03:54.150> is

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
affected is their dominant eye there is

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.949 
affected is their dominant eye there is
typically<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.860> everyone<00:03:56.430> an<00:03:56.670> eye<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
typically in everyone an eye that is the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.670 
typically in everyone an eye that is the
preferred<00:03:58.680> eye<00:03:59.100> where<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.420> brain<00:04:00.750> wants<00:04:01.560> to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
preferred eye where the brain wants to

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.880 
preferred eye where the brain wants to
see<00:04:01.920> out<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.880> eye<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.510> was<00:04:04.110> referred<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.739> as

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
see out of that eye I was referred to as

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.390 
see out of that eye I was referred to as
ocular<00:04:05.370> dominance<00:04:05.610> or<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.510> dominant<00:04:06.720> eye<00:04:07.400> so

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
ocular dominance or the dominant eye so

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.900 
ocular dominance or the dominant eye so
it<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.329> possible<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:11.250> source<00:04:11.579> of<00:04:11.760> your

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
it is possible that the source of your

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.380 
it is possible that the source of your
headaches<00:04:12.359> is<00:04:12.900> related<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:14.579> activity<00:04:15.359> of

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
headaches is related to the activity of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.120 
headaches is related to the activity of
the<00:04:15.630> muscle<00:04:15.900> called<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> frontalis<00:04:16.890> muscle

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
the muscle called the frontalis muscle

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.870 
the muscle called the frontalis muscle
that<00:04:17.940> raises<00:04:18.630> your<00:04:18.870> eyebrow<00:04:19.669> having<00:04:20.669> some

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
advancement this way I can move the

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.870 
advancement this way I can move the
muscle<00:05:15.300> forward<00:05:15.810> but<00:05:16.350> not<00:05:16.530> sacrifice<00:05:17.280> any<00:05:17.580> of

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
muscle forward but not sacrifice any of

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.510 
muscle forward but not sacrifice any of
the<00:05:18.000> muscle<00:05:18.419> if<00:05:18.660> I<00:05:18.900> can<00:05:19.080> avoid<00:05:19.169> it<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.860> in

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
the muscle if I can avoid it and in

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.230 
the muscle if I can avoid it and in
terms<00:05:20.820> of<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.120> resection<00:05:21.690> or<00:05:22.169> shortening<00:05:23.240> so

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
terms of a resection or shortening so

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.320 
terms of a resection or shortening so
that<00:05:24.960> type<00:05:25.259> of<00:05:25.380> procedure<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:26.220> done<00:05:26.639> so<00:05:27.300> that

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
that type of procedure is done so that

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.719 
that type of procedure is done so that
the<00:05:27.990> eyelid<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:28.860> at<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.100> more<00:05:29.430> appropriate

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
the eyelid is at a more appropriate

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.240 
the eyelid is at a more appropriate
level<00:05:30.690> but<00:05:31.260> in<00:05:31.470> normal<00:05:32.070> social<00:05:32.580> interaction

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
level but in normal social interaction

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.189 
level but in normal social interaction
remember<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.639> muscle<00:05:36.090> doesn't<00:05:36.449> contract<00:05:36.900> or

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
remember that muscle doesn't contract or

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.310 
remember that muscle doesn't contract or
relax<00:05:37.400> like<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.430> normal<00:05:38.910> eyelid<00:05:39.630> muscle<00:05:40.020> or<00:05:40.229> the

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
relax like a normal eyelid muscle or the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.689 
relax like a normal eyelid muscle or the
normal<00:05:40.620> levator<00:05:40.919> muscle<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.570> will<00:05:43.260> be

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
normal levator muscle so it will be

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.340 
normal levator muscle so it will be
variable<00:05:44.699> in<00:05:45.000> terms<00:05:45.060> of<00:05:45.539> when<00:05:45.720> you<00:05:45.750> look<00:05:46.050> down

that the eyelid doing that kind of
surgery<00:06:13.710> can<00:06:14.190> become<00:06:14.580> me<00:06:14.849> to<00:06:15.240> open<00:06:15.690> too<00:06:16.199> low<00:06:16.470> or

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
my practice I always tell my patients

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.540 
my practice I always tell my patients
that<00:06:22.830> 95%<00:06:23.370> of<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:23.849> time<00:06:24.090> works<00:06:24.840> are<00:06:25.050> great

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
that 95% of the time works are great

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.149 
that 95% of the time works are great
after<00:06:26.550> one<00:06:26.729> surgery<00:06:26.970> but<00:06:27.510> 5%<00:06:28.169> of<00:06:28.229> the<00:06:28.289> time<00:06:28.530> you

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
after one surgery but 5% of the time you

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.810 
after one surgery but 5% of the time you
may<00:06:29.430> need<00:06:29.669> enhancement<00:06:30.539> and<00:06:31.430> that<00:06:32.430> being<00:06:32.639> said

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
may need enhancement and that being said

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.640 
may need enhancement and that being said
you<00:06:32.970> may<00:06:33.000> need<00:06:33.300> more<00:06:33.510> than<00:06:33.570> one<00:06:33.720> enhancement

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
you may need more than one enhancement

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.649

so you have to understand that going

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:42.320 
so you have to understand that going

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
into making that decision so again most
