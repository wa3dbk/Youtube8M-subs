really<00:00:11.670> fun<00:00:11.969> board<00:00:12.300> I've<00:00:12.570> had<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:13.110> my<00:00:13.139> tea<00:00:13.559> -

in<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.480> board<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.020> amazing

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
in this board it is amazing

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.210 
in this board it is amazing
same<00:00:23.369> again<00:00:24.230> like<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.470> most<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.859> these<00:00:26.010> small

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
same again like with most of these small

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.210 
same again like with most of these small
boards<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.510> wider<00:00:27.779> along<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.070> it's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
boards it's a wider along here but it's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.049 
boards it's a wider along here but it's
got<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> long<00:00:30.679> straight<00:00:31.679> plant<00:00:32.160> shape<00:00:32.460> still

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
got a long straight plant shape still

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.569 
got a long straight plant shape still
with<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> reasonably<00:00:33.840> wide<00:00:34.170> tail<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.610> tail

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
with a reasonably wide tail in that tail

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.940 
with a reasonably wide tail in that tail
we'll<00:00:38.579> put<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.719> diamond<00:00:40.020> tail<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.710> here

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
we'll put a little diamond tail in here

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.030 
we'll put a little diamond tail in here
so<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.719> makes<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.200> short<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> things<00:00:43.860> they

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so this makes it short the things they

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.310 
so this makes it short the things they
can<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.340> why<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.700> board<00:00:45.180> longer<00:00:46.140> than

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
can actually why this board longer than

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.700 
can actually why this board longer than
you<00:00:46.469> normally<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:47.600> as<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.140> nice

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you normally would as you can see nice

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.490 
you normally would as you can see nice
wide<00:00:50.100> tail<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.090> too<00:00:51.360> wide<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.140> doesn't

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
wide tail but not too wide so it doesn't

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.529 
wide tail but not too wide so it doesn't
slot<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.039> anything<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.850> flies

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
slot or anything like that it just flies

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.049 
slot or anything like that it just flies
down<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.170> line<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.160> smaller<00:00:56.489> things<00:00:56.850> in

down the line put your smaller things in

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.279 
down the line put your smaller things in
there<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.109> bit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
there if you want to make a little bit

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
there if you want to make a little bit
slide<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:59.070> put<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.489> big<00:00:59.670> things<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.300> if

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
slide or put your big things in there if

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.810 
slide or put your big things in there if

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
you want to make it really drive it

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
you want to make it really drive it
single<00:01:02.820> contact<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.690> different<00:01:04.170> concave

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
single contact it's a different concave

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.760 
single contact it's a different concave
it's<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> round<00:01:05.700> concave<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.780> flat<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it's not a round concave it's flat it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.480 
it's not a round concave it's flat it
goes<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.490> V<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.229> outcome<00:01:11.010> cable

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
goes it's like V in the outcome cable

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.510 
goes it's like V in the outcome cable
special<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.510> saw<00:01:12.840> made<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> board<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.250> long

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
special I saw made this board a long

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
special I saw made this board a long
time<00:01:14.850> ago<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.689> concave<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> I've

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
time ago this is this concave and I've

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
time ago this is this concave and I've
just<00:01:16.979> brought<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.119> when<00:01:18.299> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
just brought it back so when you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.999 
just brought it back so when you
actually<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.530> put<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> on

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
actually get out there and put it on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
when you surf this board you've really

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
when you surf this board you've really
got<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.520> push<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> surf

what thicken the round we like that this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.510 
what thicken the round we like that this
board<00:01:31.350> thick<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> run<00:01:32.009> because<00:01:32.159> we're

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
board thick in the run because we're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.490 
board thick in the run because we're
going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.759> write<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.150> lot<00:01:33.360> shorter<00:01:33.630> very

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
going to write up a lot shorter very

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.319 
going to write up a lot shorter very
similar<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.400> lot<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.850> people<00:01:36.240> are
