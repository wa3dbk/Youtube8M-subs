having a little bit of color underneath

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.630 
having a little bit of color underneath
of<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.630> look<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.320> varied<00:01:26.130> than

there's<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.320> little<00:03:42.590> bit<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.739> pink<00:03:42.980> swirling

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
there's a little bit of pink swirling

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.400 
there's a little bit of pink swirling
around<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:44.030> there<00:03:44.239> that's<00:03:44.480> nice<00:03:44.780> that's<00:03:45.110> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
around in there that's nice that's the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.320 
around in there that's nice that's the
reason<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.489> under<00:03:46.820> paint<00:03:47.060> with<00:03:47.239> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
reason that you under paint with the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.270 
reason that you under paint with the
first<00:03:47.570> color<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:48.050> don't<00:03:48.230> want<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.440> cover<00:03:49.040> it

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
first color you don't want to cover it

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.979 
first color you don't want to cover it
all<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.430> or<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:49.970> just<00:03:50.120> basically<00:03:50.570> wasting

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
all in or you just basically wasting

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.930 
all in or you just basically wasting
your<00:03:51.110> time<00:03:51.290> now<00:03:51.830> let's<00:03:52.070> see<00:03:52.220> what<00:03:52.400> happens<00:03:52.790> if

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
your time now let's see what happens if

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.600 
your time now let's see what happens if
we<00:03:53.140> under<00:03:54.140> paint<00:03:54.380> purple<00:03:54.680> which<00:03:55.130> is<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:55.340> lot

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
we under paint purple which is a lot

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.090 
we under paint purple which is a lot
cooler<00:03:55.970> than<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.989> magenta<00:03:57.560> it's<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.800> cooler

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
cooler than the magenta it's a cooler

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.199 
cooler than the magenta it's a cooler
color<00:03:58.580> let's<00:03:59.360> make<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.780> same<00:04:00.140> value<00:04:00.860> and

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
color let's make it the same value and

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.520 
color let's make it the same value and
paint<00:04:02.209> it<00:04:02.360> under<00:04:02.660> there<00:04:02.810> see<00:04:03.110> how<00:04:03.290> that

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
paint it under there see how that

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.030 
paint it under there see how that
affects<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.100> blue<00:04:04.580> on<00:04:04.820> top<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.860> you'll<00:04:06.860> be

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
affects the blue on top of it you'll be

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.310 
affects the blue on top of it you'll be
able<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.340> see<00:04:07.580> how<00:04:07.910> having<00:04:08.570> purple<00:04:09.050> under

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
able to see how having purple under

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.290 
able to see how having purple under
there<00:04:09.500> affects<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.280> differently<00:04:10.730> than<00:04:10.970> having

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
there affects it differently than having

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.729 
there affects it differently than having
magenta<00:04:11.810> under<00:04:12.110> there<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.410> I<00:04:12.500> don't<00:04:12.560> think

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
magenta under there and I don't think

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.670 
magenta under there and I don't think
that's<00:04:13.070> quite<00:04:13.310> dark<00:04:13.670> enough<00:04:14.350> there<00:04:15.350> we<00:04:15.530> go

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
that's quite dark enough there we go

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.500 
that's quite dark enough there we go
that's<00:04:15.950> better<00:04:16.070> okay<00:04:16.640> so<00:04:16.669> here's<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.180> purple

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
that's better okay so here's a purple

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.300 
that's better okay so here's a purple
under<00:04:17.930> painting<00:04:18.350> underneath<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.040> shape

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
under painting underneath of the shape

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.570 
under painting underneath of the shape
before<00:04:19.700> we<00:04:20.299> put<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.630> blue<00:04:20.840> on<00:04:20.870> top<00:04:21.229> of<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.620> now

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
before we put the blue on top of it now

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.659 
before we put the blue on top of it now
what<00:04:22.789> you<00:04:22.940> should<00:04:22.970> see<00:04:23.570> is<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:24.500> cool

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
what you should see is a cool

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.909 
what you should see is a cool
this<00:04:25.999> should<00:04:26.180> look<00:04:26.330> red<00:04:26.749> or<00:04:26.960> because<00:04:27.499> the<00:04:27.680> Reds

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
this should look red or because the Reds

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.709 
this should look red or because the Reds
coming<00:04:28.340> out<00:04:28.460> from<00:04:28.610> underneath<00:04:28.939> mixing<00:04:29.569> with

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 
coming out from underneath mixing with

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.709 
coming out from underneath mixing with
the<00:04:29.840> blue<00:04:30.069> now<00:04:31.069> we're<00:04:31.280> gonna<00:04:31.400> take<00:04:31.669> blue<00:04:32.060> put

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:32.719 
the blue now we're gonna take blue put

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:37.600 
the blue now we're gonna take blue put
that<00:04:32.930> on<00:04:33.110> top<00:04:33.789> of<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:35.419> purple<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.229> see<00:04:36.830> if<00:04:37.099> we

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
that on top of the purple and see if we

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.189 
that on top of the purple and see if we
can<00:04:37.789> do<00:04:37.939> that<00:04:38.120> without<00:04:38.300> getting<00:04:38.779> rid<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.050> all

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
can do that without getting rid of all

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.519 
can do that without getting rid of all
of<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.529> -<00:04:39.860> it's<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.520> little<00:04:40.789> bit<00:04:40.909> dark<00:04:41.409> trying<00:04:42.409> to

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:42.529 
of it - it's a little bit dark trying to

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:44.999 
of it - it's a little bit dark trying to
match<00:04:42.710> all<00:04:42.979> these<00:04:43.129> values<00:04:43.639> exactly<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.509> same

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
match all these values exactly the same

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.860 
match all these values exactly the same
and<00:04:46.009> we<00:04:46.219> do<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.520> same<00:04:46.550> thing<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.449> let<00:04:47.659> little

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
and we do the same thing we let little

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.689 
and we do the same thing we let little
bits<00:04:48.169> of<00:04:48.379> it<00:04:48.529> show<00:04:49.180> we<00:04:50.180> can<00:04:50.360> see<00:04:51.279> that<00:04:52.279> this<00:04:52.490> is

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
bits of it show we can see that this is

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.570 
bits of it show we can see that this is
more<00:04:52.849> purple<00:04:53.389> this<00:04:53.900> is<00:04:53.960> cooler<00:04:54.439> than<00:04:55.099> this<00:04:55.370> one

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
more purple this is cooler than this one

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.980 
more purple this is cooler than this one
because<00:04:55.849> little<00:04:56.150> bits<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.479> purple<00:04:56.900> are

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
because little bits of purple are

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.459 
because little bits of purple are
showing<00:04:57.409> through<00:04:57.590> instead<00:04:58.189> of<00:04:58.990> magenta<00:04:59.990> so

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
showing through instead of magenta so

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:01.869 
showing through instead of magenta so
that's<00:05:00.650> going<00:05:00.889> to<00:05:00.949> change<00:05:01.189> it<00:05:01.430> let's<00:05:01.610> see<00:05:01.729> what

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
that's going to change it let's see what

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.360 
that's going to change it let's see what
happens<00:05:02.210> if<00:05:02.330> we<00:05:02.479> put<00:05:02.750> yellow<00:05:03.529> or<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.009> green

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
happens if we put yellow or a green

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.089 
happens if we put yellow or a green
let's<00:05:04.759> put<00:05:04.909> a<00:05:04.939> green<00:05:05.210> under<00:05:05.599> there<00:05:05.949> all<00:05:06.949> right

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
let's put a green under there all right

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.730 
let's put a green under there all right
so<00:05:07.159> there's<00:05:07.610> sort<00:05:07.909> of<00:05:08.029> a<00:05:08.120> dirty<00:05:08.930> green<00:05:09.349> it<00:05:09.620> was

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
so there's sort of a dirty green it was

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.379 
so there's sort of a dirty green it was
like<00:05:09.919> magenta<00:05:10.490> with<00:05:10.639> a<00:05:10.669> little<00:05:10.939> bit<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.180> blue

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
like magenta with a little bit of blue

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.740 
like magenta with a little bit of blue
in<00:05:11.599> it<00:05:12.129> and<00:05:13.129> let's<00:05:13.610> put<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:13.969> light<00:05:14.150> blue<00:05:14.449> over

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
in it and let's put the light blue over

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.580 
in it and let's put the light blue over
top<00:05:14.960> of<00:05:14.990> it

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
top of it

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.559 
top of it
see<00:05:16.219> what<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.610> looks<00:05:16.909> like<00:05:17.000> that's<00:05:17.330> gonna

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
see what that looks like that's gonna

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.869 
see what that looks like that's gonna
have<00:05:17.779> a<00:05:17.810> whole<00:05:18.110> different<00:05:18.529> look<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.889> it<00:05:21.879> don't

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 
have a whole different look to it don't

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.110 
have a whole different look to it don't
let<00:05:23.000> little<00:05:23.210> bits<00:05:23.539> of<00:05:23.749> it<00:05:23.900> show<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.979> as<00:05:25.909> it's

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
let little bits of it show and as it's

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.730 
let little bits of it show and as it's
mix<00:05:26.419> see<00:05:26.599> it's<00:05:26.749> mixing<00:05:27.199> there's<00:05:27.409> no<00:05:27.560> way<00:05:27.680> you

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
mix see it's mixing there's no way you

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.379 
mix see it's mixing there's no way you
can<00:05:27.979> put<00:05:28.189> it<00:05:28.310> on<00:05:28.490> there<00:05:28.729> that<00:05:28.939> some<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.270> that

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
can put it on there that some of that

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.450 
can put it on there that some of that
doesn't<00:05:29.810> mix<00:05:29.990> in<00:05:30.259> with<00:05:30.469> it<00:05:30.620> but<00:05:31.069> it's<00:05:31.219> much

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
doesn't mix in with it but it's much

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.670 
doesn't mix in with it but it's much
more<00:05:31.669> interesting<00:05:32.150> than<00:05:32.449> just<00:05:32.659> the<00:05:33.379> plain

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
more interesting than just the plain

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.700 
more interesting than just the plain
blue<00:05:34.099> block<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:35.180> look<00:05:35.509> at<00:05:35.599> that<00:05:35.719> swirl<00:05:36.169> there's

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
blue block so look at that swirl there's

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.059 
blue block so look at that swirl there's
like<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:36.949> warm<00:05:37.930> yellow<00:05:38.930> ocher<00:05:39.409> in<00:05:39.560> there<00:05:39.800> so<00:05:40.009> you

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
like a warm yellow ocher in there so you

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.800 
like a warm yellow ocher in there so you
can<00:05:40.310> do<00:05:40.430> that<00:05:40.610> all<00:05:40.789> over<00:05:40.819> the<00:05:41.180> place<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:41.659> can

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
can do that all over the place you can

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.230 
can do that all over the place you can
do<00:05:41.930> it<00:05:42.080> with<00:05:42.199> every<00:05:42.560> color<00:05:42.770> on<00:05:43.039> this<00:05:43.279> on<00:05:43.789> this

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
do it with every color on this on this

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.579 
do it with every color on this on this
thing<00:05:44.509> now<00:05:44.659> watch<00:05:44.810> what<00:05:44.990> happens<00:05:45.289> if<00:05:45.439> we<00:05:45.560> put

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:45.589 
thing now watch what happens if we put

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:47.469 
thing now watch what happens if we put
green<00:05:46.039> under<00:05:46.430> there<00:05:46.580> that's<00:05:46.819> too<00:05:47.029> dark

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
green under there that's too dark

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:53.469 
green under there that's too dark
let's<00:05:48.110> put<00:05:48.639> Viridian<00:05:49.639> green<00:05:49.669> under<00:05:50.330> here<00:05:52.479> now

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
let's put Viridian green under here now

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:54.969 
let's put Viridian green under here now
you<00:05:53.539> can<00:05:53.779> see<00:05:53.960> that's<00:05:54.139> a<00:05:54.289> little<00:05:54.439> darker<00:05:54.949> than

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
you can see that's a little darker than

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.159 
you can see that's a little darker than
the<00:05:55.219> rest<00:05:55.490> so<00:05:55.610> let's<00:05:55.879> keep<00:05:56.060> it<00:05:56.240> all<00:05:56.389> even<00:05:56.870> we

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
around with this just get different

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.050 
around with this just get different
colors<00:06:11.779> and<00:06:11.990> put<00:06:12.649> different<00:06:13.250> squares<00:06:13.639> down

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
colors and put different squares down

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.499 
colors and put different squares down
and<00:06:14.360> just<00:06:15.050> paint<00:06:15.349> on<00:06:15.589> top<00:06:16.009> of<00:06:16.310> them<00:06:16.490> see<00:06:17.300> how

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
and just paint on top of them see how

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.360 
and just paint on top of them see how
I've<00:06:17.599> one<00:06:17.779> stroke<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.349> I<00:06:18.409> didn't<00:06:18.770> go<00:06:18.889> over<00:06:19.279> it

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
I've one stroke that I didn't go over it

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.249 
I've one stroke that I didn't go over it
and<00:06:19.490> over<00:06:19.879> it<00:06:20.089> and<00:06:20.330> over<00:06:20.479> it<00:06:20.719> and<00:06:20.779> I<00:06:20.990> let<00:06:21.229> a

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
and over it and over it and I let a

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.869 
and over it and over it and I let a
little<00:06:21.529> bit<00:06:21.830> of<00:06:22.099> that<00:06:22.789> green<00:06:23.180> show<00:06:24.050> through

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
little bit of that green show through

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.939 
little bit of that green show through
now<00:06:25.879> all<00:06:26.149> of<00:06:26.479> these<00:06:26.599> blocks<00:06:27.020> look<00:06:27.409> different

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
now all of these blocks look different

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.129 
now all of these blocks look different
but<00:06:28.550> they<00:06:28.669> have<00:06:28.699> swirls<00:06:29.240> in<00:06:29.659> them<00:06:29.779> see<00:06:29.960> this

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
but they have swirls in them see this

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.619 
but they have swirls in them see this
has<00:06:30.349> a<00:06:30.379> swirl<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:31.219> it's<00:06:31.399> just<00:06:31.729> better<00:06:32.270> than

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:32.629 
has a swirl and it's just better than

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.600 
has a swirl and it's just better than
that<00:06:32.870> one<00:06:33.139> that<00:06:33.349> one's<00:06:33.560> just<00:06:33.620> too<00:06:34.399> plain

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
that one that one's just too plain

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.420 
that one that one's just too plain
doesn't<00:06:35.300> look<00:06:35.539> good<00:06:35.779> if<00:06:36.649> you<00:06:36.830> did<00:06:37.039> your<00:06:37.190> skies

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
doesn't look good if you did your skies

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.920 
doesn't look good if you did your skies
like<00:06:37.789> this

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
like this

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.570 
like this
the<00:06:39.110> fact<00:06:39.380> that<00:06:39.500> you're<00:06:39.710> trying<00:06:40.009> to<00:06:40.100> cover<00:06:40.430> up

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
the fact that you're trying to cover up

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.999 
the fact that you're trying to cover up
that<00:06:40.880> pink<00:06:41.210> you<00:06:41.900> and<00:06:42.139> then<00:06:42.289> you<00:06:42.380> don't<00:06:42.560> hit<00:06:42.979> a

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
that pink you and then you don't hit a

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.040 
that pink you and then you don't hit a
stroke<00:06:43.520> twice<00:06:43.850> or<00:06:44.120> trying<00:06:44.360> to<00:06:44.389> cover<00:06:44.660> up<00:06:44.870> all

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
stroke twice or trying to cover up all

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.240 
stroke twice or trying to cover up all
the<00:06:45.080> pink<00:06:45.380> you'll<00:06:45.590> have<00:06:45.740> a<00:06:45.770> much<00:06:46.039> more

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
the pink you'll have a much more

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.580 
the pink you'll have a much more
interesting<00:06:46.310> sky<00:06:46.910> or<00:06:47.660> this<00:06:47.960> could<00:06:48.110> be<00:06:48.169> water

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
interesting sky or this could be water

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.129 
interesting sky or this could be water
or<00:06:48.770> sky<00:06:49.220> these<00:06:49.940> could<00:06:50.180> be<00:06:50.330> trees<00:06:50.720> you<00:06:50.990> could

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
or sky these could be trees you could

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.990 
or sky these could be trees you could
have<00:06:51.289> trees<00:06:51.680> you<00:06:51.919> could<00:06:52.039> do<00:06:52.220> green<00:06:52.580> we'll<00:06:52.880> do

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
have trees you could do green we'll do

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.740 
have trees you could do green we'll do
one<00:06:53.210> more

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
one more

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.439 
one more
you<00:06:53.990> could<00:06:54.139> do<00:06:54.320> green<00:06:54.620> and<00:06:55.550> then<00:06:56.180> you<00:06:56.300> can

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
you could do green and then you can

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.350 
you could do green and then you can
swirl<00:06:56.720> blue<00:06:57.110> into<00:06:57.500> it<00:06:57.680> and<00:06:57.910> don't<00:06:58.910> cover<00:06:59.240> it

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
swirl blue into it and don't cover it

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.640 
swirl blue into it and don't cover it
all<00:06:59.539> up<00:07:00.580> and<00:07:01.580> that<00:07:02.300> could<00:07:02.479> be<00:07:02.630> a<00:07:02.660> tree<00:07:02.990> green<00:07:03.289> so

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
all up and that could be a tree green so

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.230 
all up and that could be a tree green so
see<00:07:03.830> how<00:07:03.889> much<00:07:04.039> more<00:07:04.250> interesting<00:07:04.430> that<00:07:05.000> is

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
see how much more interesting that is

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.450 
see how much more interesting that is
then<00:07:05.509> if<00:07:05.690> I<00:07:05.810> just<00:07:05.840> mix<00:07:06.350> that<00:07:06.650> down<00:07:06.949> here<00:07:07.280> and

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
then if I just mix that down here and

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.640 
then if I just mix that down here and
put<00:07:07.610> it<00:07:07.729> on<00:07:07.850> like<00:07:08.060> like<00:07:08.840> it's<00:07:09.050> put<00:07:09.320> on<00:07:09.350> with<00:07:09.620> a

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
put it on like like it's put on with a

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.129 
put it on like like it's put on with a
roller<00:07:09.919> so<00:07:10.850> this<00:07:11.030> is<00:07:11.180> very<00:07:11.419> interesting<00:07:11.720> adds

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:12.139 
roller so this is very interesting adds

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.650 
roller so this is very interesting adds
a<00:07:12.440> lot<00:07:12.710> of<00:07:12.770> interest<00:07:13.160> to<00:07:13.310> your<00:07:13.460> paintings<00:07:14.389> so

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:14.660 
a lot of interest to your paintings so

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.770 
a lot of interest to your paintings so
