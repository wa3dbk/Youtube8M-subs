where brick was used and arranged in

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.730 
where brick was used and arranged in
spiral<00:01:40.450> Fibonacci<00:01:40.869> patterns<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.590> was

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
spiral Fibonacci patterns and it was

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.420 
spiral Fibonacci patterns and it was
really<00:01:42.009> striking<00:01:43.979> gravels<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.100> other<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.399> my

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
range of colors and the cost really

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.999 
range of colors and the cost really
depends<00:01:49.600> upon<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.990> color<00:01:50.200> combination<00:01:50.800> where

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
depends upon the color combination where

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.340 
depends upon the color combination where
the<00:01:51.130> gravel<00:01:51.430> comes<00:01:51.640> from<00:01:51.940> but<00:01:52.660> it's<00:01:53.080> really

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
the gravel comes from but it's really

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.590 
the gravel comes from but it's really
simple<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.950> install<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.610> even<00:01:55.180> if<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.360> get<00:01:55.479> an

expensive gravel if you have a small

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.070 
expensive gravel if you have a small
area<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.880> well<00:01:58.119> worth<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.450> cost

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080

my garden we chose DG because it's very
reasonable<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.420> because<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:37.870> easy<00:02:38.020> to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
reasonable and and because it's easy to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
done on a budget it makes good pathways

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.990 
done on a budget it makes good pathways
and<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.800> even<00:03:02.950> stack<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.580> make<00:03:03.730> dry

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
and you can even stack it to make dry

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.720 
and you can even stack it to make dry
stacked<00:03:04.360> walls<00:03:04.660> now<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.069> surface<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.610> the

stacked walls now the surface of the
concrete<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.239> hard<00:03:07.599> but<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.319> these<00:03:08.650> are

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
concrete is hard but because these are

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.470 
concrete is hard but because these are
broken<00:03:09.099> pieces<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.520> edges<00:03:09.790> are<00:03:09.910> very<00:03:10.060> regular

broken pieces the edges are very regular

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.360 
broken pieces the edges are very regular
and<00:03:10.510> make<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.810> look<00:03:10.930> very<00:03:10.959> informal<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:12.129> soften

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
and make it look very informal to soften

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.220 
and make it look very informal to soften
it<00:03:12.579> even<00:03:12.790> more<00:03:12.879> I<00:03:12.939> planted<00:03:13.390> dimande<00:03:14.019> in<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
it even more I planted dimande in the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.280 
it even more I planted dimande in the
cracks<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.769> between<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:15.250> pavers<00:03:15.610> that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
cracks in between the pavers that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.690 
cracks in between the pavers that
over<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.890> really<00:03:17.129> soften<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.640> edges<00:03:19.700> when

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
over it and really soften the edges when

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.490 
over it and really soften the edges when
you<00:03:20.790> create<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> path<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.230> consider

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
you create a path you have to consider

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.899 
you create a path you have to consider
the<00:03:22.680> plants<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.099> go<00:03:23.220> around<00:03:23.519> it

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
the plants that go around it

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.270 
the plants that go around it
what<00:03:24.299> makes<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.690> path<00:03:24.959> work<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.500> well<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.099> the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
what makes this path work so well is the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.070 
what makes this path work so well is the
repetition<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.849> plants<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.299> either<00:03:27.450> side<00:03:27.780> so

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
repetition of plants on either side so

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.440 
repetition of plants on either side so
for<00:03:28.769> example<00:03:29.190> we<00:03:29.519> have<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.700> salvia<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.269> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
for example we have the salvia on this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.300 
for example we have the salvia on this
side<00:03:30.659> and<00:03:31.049> we<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.470> same<00:03:31.650> salvia<00:03:32.069> over

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
side and we have the same salvia over

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.130 
side and we have the same salvia over
here<00:03:32.459> on<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:32.730> side<00:03:32.970> we<00:03:33.239> have<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.840> great

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
here on this side we have this great

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.589 
here on this side we have this great
green<00:03:34.590> jeweltone<00:03:35.099> euphorbia<00:03:35.790> down<00:03:36.000> here<00:03:36.330> and

on<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.080> opposite<00:03:37.470> side<00:03:37.680> we<00:03:37.830> had<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.010> same

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
on the opposite side we had the same

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.670 
on the opposite side we had the same
euphorbia<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.959> course<00:03:40.170> right<00:03:40.440> now

the jewel of the garden are these yellow
kangaroo<00:03:43.019> balls<00:03:43.290> which<00:03:43.890> looks<00:03:44.129> so<00:03:44.430> amazing
