boy any thoughts back but once your

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.480 
boy any thoughts back but once your
practice<00:06:05.110> then<00:06:05.289> you<00:06:05.530> can<00:06:05.770> become<00:06:06.039> more<00:06:06.250> and

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
practice then you can become more and

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.010 
practice then you can become more and
more<00:06:06.550> in<00:06:06.819> sync<00:06:07.150> with<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.419> music<00:06:07.449> with<00:06:07.990> the

bopping motion alright so that is the

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.930 
bopping motion alright so that is the
front<00:06:10.659> step
