00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 an external hard drive to extend the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.810
 storage capabilities do the console of 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.280
 this game is a good idea but is not 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.809
 not new on the ps3 we could 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.730
 easily change the internal hard drive 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.380
 and on the xbox 360 it was necessary in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.580
 revenge buy a disc sold out of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.080
 price by microsoft only 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.000
 today the games are monstrous 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.380
 often around 50 gigas then the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.210
 hard disk are filling up again public 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.680
 before the hard drive turns out so great 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.240
 useful if you want to move with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.710
 your games leaving your console 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.119
 if you land at a friend's house enough 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.680
 nice who wanted to connect your 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.240
 hard drive and that has the same 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.859
 console that you or connect with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 your account and so you have access to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.800
 all your games several brands have 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.969
 announced the specially designed discs 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 at xbox one and we test 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.530
 today the my passport x proposed by 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 western digital in my passport x le 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.899
 heat does not mean that there is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.489
 Content prohibited under 18 have 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.930
 marked on it no it's just that it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 is intended to extend the capacity of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.780
 storage an xbox one 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 western digital indicates that the disc 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 can be used on a windows pc or 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 on the xbox one is not at the same time 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.840
 after connecting the disc to the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.670
 console this one is recognized 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.320
 automatically by the xbox one but he 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 must be formatted 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.219
 once ready for the xbox om these are 1 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.390
 8 terabytes that are available and 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.710
 you can then choose to install 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.460
 all the next games on the disc 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.540
 external 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.220
 you can also copy or 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.880
 move your already installed games on the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 internal disk 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.820
 however the copy is not very 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.590
 fast even though we are talking about a record here 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 usb 3 it took us fifteen minutes 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.490
 to move a game of 15 ziga between the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.020
 xbox one and the western digital for 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.000
 compare we have format the disk 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.439
 my passport to x on a mac 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.689
 copying the same amount of data 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.439
 from the mac to my passport x is 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.000
 much faster 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.530
 about a minute and a half to get some 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.570
 the net heart we also compare 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.850
 a digital western my passport qu'ultra 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.680
 and the western digital my passport x the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.180
 performance are almost identical with 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.650
 our benchmark tool with maybe 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 a very slight advantage for my 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.090
 ultra brief passport a usb hard drive 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.320
 3 is imperative for the xbox one it will be 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.149
 far from achieving this performance 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159
 maximum when it is used on the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.140
 console in summary the presented hard drive 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.710
 as special xbox one is a hard drive 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.060
 classical 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.829
 it's a shame because if a game had been 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.509
 offered in bundle with the hard drive 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.250
 buying this special xbox version 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.659
 live would have been really justified and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.369
 blow we can take a hard drive 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.320
 classic cheaper than this famous my 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
 passport x the western digital my 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.909
 passport x is really useful on the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.200
 xbox live more than it is very compact and 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.340
 it is self-powered but the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.959
 performance in terms of speed 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.039
 writing are rather average on the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.230
 console he 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.750
 a total lack of added value to 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.180
 the denomination x for these reasons the my 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.769
 western digital passport x get 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.180
 another average of 3 out of 5 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.439
 if you liked this video remember 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.909
 not to put thumbs up in the air 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.379

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.670
