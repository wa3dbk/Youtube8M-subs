00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.549
 you people said john doe people do not 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 find themselves for a little video on 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.060
 from Estonia to waiting for you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.590
 that it's going very well as usual 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.789
 go nickel I have potato and konÃ© 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 left for a little video on 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 styles part 1 of this raid 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.260
 Haarde round of crop cropped to 12 and from 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.260
 fang you I make you video 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.280
 will appear on the 22 11 long the raid is 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.440
 released yesterday at 19h so off French is 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.030
 so directly 19 street we were in 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.320
 would obviously do and we were the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.040
 first to spend it at least the three 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.989
 first steps 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.620
 and I just you make a video 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.820
 for this first step I think that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.800
 in the day I want to play more or 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.149
 post and this in the morning in the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.190
 day in the evening I will post you 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.129
 step 2 and tomorrow I will post you 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.539
 step 3 so the priestesses and by the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.620
 next when we bite you because there 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.730
 we did not do it we did the three 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.109
 first steps and our three characters 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.690
 story of well garnering glamor and 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.100
 cetera weapons and we will make own rate 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.840
 by the end of the week ahead if 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.420
 everything is going well so here is first 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.010
 step the lights I will give you 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.080
 my tips for making lights in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.330
 hard who are also worth for their help 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
 for their normal help but who are 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.229
 really very very good as a tip to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 take into account to succeed the hard 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.909
 so you see people and me and ben 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.820
 I will make a dedication to all 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 world was there I'm going to make a 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.850
 dedication to myself is a little con 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.610
 but hey I was with I was with her 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.340
 because there was cooper there was 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.500
 rasta there were caids and there was 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.750
 francs merge forget the last 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.369
 I think it was no I even know 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.540
 more hello watch him look with 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.619
 who I was I'll maybe if I 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.180
 see the end I reject you but I 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.770
 completely zapped here I am sorry 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.740
 forgotten stories big poutous when 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.009
 same and so here's the trick is simple 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.270
 already we went to 2 with ben we are 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.140
 only two because we were hunters 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.750
 I want to clarify that I did I 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.939
 done on this step with my three 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.790
 persos so my level 32 hunters that 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.610
 here we are titan at level 30 2 and my bow 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.860
 at nice level 31 so you 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.680
 do not tell me yes but you are invisible 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 so it's easy and I do it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.530
 with all my characters so it's 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.790
 frankly the visibility I could 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.350
 not even use it that would change 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.820
 nothing if I do it is because 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.320
 necessarily it's better when you are 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.910
 hunter at least that makes you a point 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.080
 in less but when you are with the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.760
 other gelot characters guarantee that the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.540
 visibility invisibility is not 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.080
 essential 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.490
 so here is already a tip you've seen 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.950
 we went to two you can 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.750
 From 3 there is the other three 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.290
 to force parents to throw crazy 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.940
 I placed them in a place that is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.560
 really very strategic it's the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.970
 second door of the safe 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.709
 so then by the way this is they 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.910
 forgot because in this summer ben 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.950
 because I think he had a yes 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.209
 this is what I left 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.260
 you say ah ben left the party 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.180
 bricks so that means I'm 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.620
 all by myself I am alone there the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.360
 lights I will do them all alone and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.800
 I will succeed and I also 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.970
 so does the lights alone with 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.200
 my little time do they have time I have them 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.370
 did it alone so I left 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.320
 in front of the others waited for me I 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.940
 managed alone and that titan and with 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.989
 my arc and east level 31 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.080
 so that is to say that I had a level 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.489
 2 below I went to the Troyes 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.049
 my colleagues died roughly at the 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.640
 half light and I ended up alone 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.500
 with my nice bow 31 plays towards the bridge 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.850
 I passed unfortunately I have my 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.130
 and the cake has planted I completely 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.489
 zapped rice rope with the full sheikh 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.560
 but otherwise it's totally possible 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.790
 and frankly does the technique like 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.380
 at home with my cat sister it works with 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.090
 all the characters except basically you 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.880
 need to run and use 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.080
 stratagems cous finally pass around 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.600
 lights is that it is a little bit 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.120
 the mobs use your grenades often 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.200
 for example with the pianist 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.670
 they had the trick it is to run 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.560
 because when you are in the art of 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.450
 difference with the normal is that the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.019
 weight of darkness goes much faster 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.209
 to rise 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.560
 so you have to be faster 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.030
 your time running around the lights 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.739
 really to purge you as soon as you 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.880
 are at x 2 x 3 you have to go do not have to 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.400
 wait to be at zero, you have to run 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.390
 are chained and so that's it so I 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.030
 will go on lattes the trick 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.920
 now I have placed three people or 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.570
 two it depends what do you see in the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.890
 second door of the safe 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.000
 you have docked the doors when you 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.680
 start where there are the chests that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.730
 appear wanted to place in the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.230
 second door of the safe 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.030
 what will make the mauves are going to be 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.350
 attracted by these people and that the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.000
 people who went to do the 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.709
 lamps and well eventually are going to be 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.510
 quiet because the modes are going 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.979
 completely do not care they go over 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.799
 take care of the people who are on the 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.819
 teeth the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.740
 the first door of a man's body 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.509
 kof forgiveness that rather than those 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.860
 who left of course when you 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.720
 arrive on the last lights there 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.220
 the spawn mobs in front of you because 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.449
 you're at the end so it's not okay 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.159
 until the end it does not work until 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.909
 the end of May for three quarters of 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.919
 first lights 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.210
 if you put people in places there 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.199
 you will be totally quiet 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.909
 you saw him at one point is 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.139
 nothing and with my little time it's 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.090
 even more blatantly there was really 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.740
 nobody now second part 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.289
 of hints you saw him I'm on a 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.159
 stone and I'm totally safe the 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.780
 only thing to do that is going to be 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.919
 destroy the ogre who is here because 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.720
 it is he who breaks the balls year 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.740
 that he unfortunately there I had more 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.629
 of blades of snacks I was pretty sure 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.009
 6000 was dead and look at it and I put 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.139
 the package he still has a ball to him 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.569
 but I'm sure and I'm dying 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.620
 luckily the way was free in 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.810
 do I stay long enough to 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.159
 open so as the bridge was free all 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.900
 the world loses its weight from darkness and 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.639
 can run to cross the door 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.229
 so I'm dead is the hunter because 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.979
 that there you have seen I could measure more 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.449
 ammunition 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.800
 I did exactly this technique and 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.300
 clark hanister the titan I had my 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.969
 munitions their free will frankly y'a 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.960
 not to worry about it even in 31 he dies 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.419
 so fast there is not too much 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.250
 difference it's okay but hey you 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.380
 did you see the technique I wanted when 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.789
 even there clarified in oral you will trigger 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.139
 the bridge squeezes as you trigger the 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.099
 light that is right in front of me you 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.259
 triggered it once you arrive 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.930
 you go on the stele to open the 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.520
 bridge you wait on the stele in 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.289
 destroyed by killing all the slaves who 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.909
 happens to him that the light explodes 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.110
 and once the light ex klose goes 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.279
 you will go up on the small stone 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.529
 as I did you are totally 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.090
 safe there are just the ogres to care 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.409
 the furniture can not touch you 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.550
 unless you're on a ledge 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.319
 really have to get in the middle of the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.669
 stone scene there you saw it by 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.110
 o'shea up a tiny ledge his 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.460
 side you can jump same job 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.120
 summer is x 10 you go up I can 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.819
 guarantee you 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.930
 So here the same technique when 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.879
 you're all alone that makes the 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.379
 purple are you 36.6 you happen to 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.729
 shooter the others just saw you at 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.409
 wait for the path to open and you 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.120
 run here so it's frankly my 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.490
 trick for this first step so 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.409
 my two tips we place people to 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.699
 the second door of the safe for whom 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.259
 hold back slaves while those 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.789
 sales really earn a lot of 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:17.469
 ahead and once you've arrived 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.389
 you go up on the stone and then you 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.250
 wait must therefore manage I re-specify 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.330
 that I did this technique with my 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.529
 hunter you saw that sir hand 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.460
 invisible from time to time even if that 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.930
 did not serve much 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.150
 I make them my site burst of 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.349
 my bow at 31/100 the invisibility 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.880
 and I can guarantee you that I did not have 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.440
 no harm we made the first or the 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.820
 second shot each time there is 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.330
 really an evil even all alone and in 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.220
 hard 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.199
 it's super simple as a step if you 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.970
 have a little bit of strategy we're going 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.770
 say if you know you move between 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.689
 teeth the lights dodge the mobs 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.979
 to use your grenades stopped the 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.229
 strategy frankly this is the strategy 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.449
 after that it's up to you to play and it admits 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:52.120
 you defend it so soon the part 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.590
 precisely from this stage where I you 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.419
 will also give my tips some very 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.620
 very good and Iberian tips that that 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.969
 I go again alone and that 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.560
 it will work very well so here 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:01.509
 we'll see you later for 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.620
 this second part of this raid hard and 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:06.150
 I tell you to their next for a 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.150
 next video with shop boys
