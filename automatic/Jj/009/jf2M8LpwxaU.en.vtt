00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.250
 properties 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 and remove guys how are you and welcome 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.529
 to a new minecraft pocket video 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.329
 edition that I really wanted to record 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.360
 this map and well as you can see is a 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.160
 survival of a medieval town or village 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.689
 as you want to call it and then 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.880
 basically it 's all this that they see 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 around is very very well built and 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.890
 it is very beautiful and apart that is totally 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.220
 build a survival 2000 because not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.350
 know if it is not the case that this 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.040
 download the programs that change you 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.820
 nor so materials because because this map 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.339
 it's from a series of a famous youtuber and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.769
 American of course but the fact is 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.479
 I do not know if he built it I do not know how 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.280
 but I do know that if a series of him 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.170
 then it means that your web is made 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.830
 good has a lot of little things like 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.799
 you can see here this is a generator of 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.769
 generator not good if in turn that is 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.360
 enemy generator is also a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.009
 material collector here there is only 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.140
 color though right now go a lot of 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.670
 Little things, I'm going to show you a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.130
 little with what would be 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.700
 the city there run to the bottom as it was 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.700
 generated 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.909
 Well, great and there's a lot of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.830
 materials for all the houses the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.090
 which you can catch and all the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.310
 hours here we have a sword of 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.470
 diamond that I like but good as 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 can see there is a mill there is a castle 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.110
 here super huge and good basically is 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.580
 that there are some very nice crops that 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.080
 will teach them now and then how 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.619
 can see are those from there I'm going to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.440
 show them around here and how you can see 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.119
 they are there they are very beautiful and excuse me 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.030
 if at some point they listen to my voice 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.770
 that's why at all times looking at the screen 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.690
 from the camera to see if you're watching 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.830
 fine but if basically these are the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 crops that look very good there are 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.429
 little girls doing their thing good for 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.200
 here we would have sugar cane there 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.880
 in the background they see a balloon I do not know if 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.640
 they reach to see but if a balloon in these 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.860
 I do not know what those typical ones are called 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.050
 back to the world in 80 days the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.630
 good movie how can you see this is 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.459
 the castle that is huge but they will say 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.459
 take and taught inside I will tell you 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.500
 It's already pretty inside but it's the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.849
 I taught good not only will I dream because 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.370
 I want you to download the map 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.810
 and see everything this map has 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.549
 because the truth is that it is incredible 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.469
 of constructions that are here apart 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.750

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.319
