00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.870 
building on the side of a hill you can
see<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.900> little<00:03:35.170> bit<00:03:35.380> here<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:35.769> see<00:03:36.760> those

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
see a little bit here so see those

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.090 
see a little bit here so see those
little<00:03:37.000> outcroppings<00:03:37.750> usually<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:38.890> would<00:03:38.950> go

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
little outcroppings usually it would go

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.590 
little outcroppings usually it would go
all<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.580> way<00:03:39.610> across<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.940> road<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.540> would

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
all the way across the road it would

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.350 
all the way across the road it would
look<00:03:40.690> really<00:03:40.750> goofy<00:03:41.410> they<00:03:42.100> fix<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.850> majority

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
look really goofy they fix the majority

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.750 
look really goofy they fix the majority
of<00:03:43.390> those<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.500> try<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:44.980> build<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.400> road<00:03:45.580> that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
of those so I try to build the road that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.180 
of those so I try to build the road that
would<00:03:45.820> cause<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.360> most<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.810> was<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:47.470> not

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
would cause it the most and was like not

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.699 
would cause it the most and was like not
even<00:03:48.280> straight<00:03:48.700> up<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.120> hill<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.630> we<00:03:50.200> got<00:03:50.350> minor

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
even straight up a hill and we got minor

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.070 
even straight up a hill and we got minor
ones<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.489> see<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.850> nowhere<00:03:52.209> else<00:03:52.630> in<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.900> city

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
ones you see it nowhere else in the city

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.860 
ones you see it nowhere else in the city
so<00:03:53.830> I<00:03:54.130> think<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:54.820> is<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.120> biggest<00:03:55.269> fix<00:03:55.690> they

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
so I think this is the biggest fix they

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.150 
so I think this is the biggest fix they
did<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.350> biggest<00:03:56.650> thing<00:03:56.769> they<00:03:56.860> did<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.100> the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
did the biggest thing they did in the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.289 
did the biggest thing they did in the
patch<00:03:57.370> other<00:03:57.700> than<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.880> raise<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.090> lower

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
patch other than the raise and lower

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.960 
patch other than the raise and lower
roads<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.080> they<00:03:59.950> made<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.160> small<00:04:00.430> detail<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.910> it

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
roads and they made a small detail of it

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.300 
roads and they made a small detail of it
nobody's<00:04:01.480> been<00:04:01.630> talking<00:04:01.930> about<00:04:02.080> it<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.560> really

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310
