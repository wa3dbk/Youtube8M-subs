layer-by-layer but um thin shinies but

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.830 
layer-by-layer but um thin shinies but
the<00:00:29.369> algorithms<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.090> english<00:00:30.330> notation

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the algorithms are in english notation

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
which are nice so here is the cube it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.060 
which are nice so here is the cube it's
very<00:00:37.590> nice

as<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.309> said<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.670> preassembled<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:40.170> turns

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
as I said it's preassembled and it turns

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.660 
as I said it's preassembled and it turns
extremely<00:00:41.129> quick

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
extremely quick

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.600 
extremely quick
I'm<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.690> even<00:00:42.960> fast<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.920> my<00:00:44.040> finger<00:00:44.340> tricks

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but it's very quick and I actually had

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
but it's very quick and I actually had
to<00:00:47.760> tighten<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.329> when<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> took<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
to tighten it up when I took it out of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
to tighten it up when I took it out of
the<00:00:49.590> box<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:50.940> loose<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
hard to control way too fast then I was

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.889 
hard to control way too fast then I was
popping<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.120> over<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> place<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.719> not

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
popping all over the place it was not

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380

good<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.350> had<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> tighten<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> yes<00:00:57.090> this

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
good so I had to tighten it and yes this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
good so I had to tighten it and yes this
cube<00:00:57.780> does<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.199> screws<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> can

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
take one of the center pieces all six

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.640 
take one of the center pieces all six
centers<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:04.890> work<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.450> on<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.689> cube<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.320> had

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
centers will work and on this cube I had

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.890 
centers will work and on this cube I had
to<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> flathead<00:01:08.400> screwdriver<00:01:08.549> because<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to use a flathead screwdriver because I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.399 
to use a flathead screwdriver because I
bite<00:01:10.710> my<00:01:10.860> nails<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.700> too<00:01:11.820> hard

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
bite my nails and it was just too hard

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.039

but so you take that little screwdriver
and<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.650> take<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.700> caps<00:01:18.180> off

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850 
and you can take these little caps off
and<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.900> screws<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> can

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and they have screws here and you can

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
and they have screws here and you can
adjust<00:01:19.979> them<00:01:20.340> make<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.670> tighter<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.150> looser

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270

to<00:01:21.540> fit<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:21.780> preferences<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> had<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> make

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to fit your preferences so I had to make

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.179 
to fit your preferences so I had to make
mine<00:01:24.000> tighter<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.509> around<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.110> um<00:01:25.470> it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
mine tighter all around but um it's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.210 
mine tighter all around but um it's
really<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.600> way<00:01:27.930> too<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
really good now it was way too so at the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.480 
really good now it was way too so at the
start<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:30.180> okay<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> set<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> about

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
start that's okay so I set it to about

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.710 
start that's okay so I set it to about
here<00:01:33.439> which<00:01:34.439> i<00:01:34.590> think<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> good<00:01:35.310> tension<00:01:35.720> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
here which i think is a good tension so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.149 
here which i think is a good tension so
let<00:01:36.900> me<00:01:36.990> talk<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.409> some<00:01:37.590> good<00:01:37.799> things<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
let me talk about some good things and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.670 
let me talk about some good things and
bad<00:01:38.250> things<00:01:38.579> about<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.909> cube<00:01:39.210> um<00:01:40.020> let<00:01:40.619> me

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
bad things about this cube um let me

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.870 
bad things about this cube um let me
start<00:01:40.860> off<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.159> good<00:01:41.280> things<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.729> it's

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
start off with some good things so it's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.030 
start off with some good things so it's
really<00:01:42.180> nice<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.380> preassembled

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
really nice because it's preassembled

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.789 
really nice because it's preassembled
like<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.310> mentioned<00:01:44.700> um<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.619> need<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like I mentioned um so you don't need to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.740 
like I mentioned um so you don't need to
assemble<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.220> which<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.460> good<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.240> sticker<00:01:48.540> is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
assemble it which is good the sticker is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
assemble it which is good the sticker is
I<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.560> stickers<00:01:49.860> umm<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.430> at

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
I really like these stickers umm look at

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.149 
I really like these stickers umm look at
the<00:01:50.610> way<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> reflects<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> light<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:53.040> can

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the way it reflects the light you can

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.149 
the way it reflects the light you can
see<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.399> better<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.970> side<00:01:54.210> maybe<00:01:55.159> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
see it better on this side maybe the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
see it better on this side maybe the
stickers<00:01:56.490> feel<00:01:56.700> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.060> paper<00:01:57.360> they're

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
stickers feel kind of like paper they're

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
stickers feel kind of like paper they're
not<00:01:58.200> um<00:01:58.500> they're<00:01:59.189> very<00:01:59.219> difference<00:01:59.820> than<00:02:00.090> what

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
not um they're very difference than what

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
not um they're very difference than what
you're<00:02:00.600> probably<00:02:00.810> used<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> feeling<00:02:01.350> they

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you're probably used to feeling they

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.109 
you're probably used to feeling they
feel<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.340> good<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> nice

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
feel really good they have a nice

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.889 
feel really good they have a nice
texture<00:02:03.799> it's<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.310> good<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.899> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
texture it's really really good and the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
texture it's really really good and the
durability<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.680> stickers<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.160> pretty

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
durability on these stickers is pretty

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
durability on these stickers is pretty
good<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.179> peel<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:09.959> chip

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
good they don't peel but they do chip

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.160 
good they don't peel but they do chip
you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.739> see<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.629> one<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.750> these<00:02:12.930> pieces

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
you can see it on one of these pieces

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.740 
you can see it on one of these pieces
here

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
here

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.530 
here
let<00:02:14.170> me<00:02:14.260> focus<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:15.910> see<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.180> chipping

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
let me focus you can see that's chipping

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.080 
let me focus you can see that's chipping
there<00:02:16.840> but<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> guess<00:02:17.800> all<00:02:18.070> stickers<00:02:18.400> do<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
there but I guess all stickers do have a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.550 
there but I guess all stickers do have a
life<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.120> pretty<00:02:22.330> good<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
life but this one this is pretty good so

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.960 
life but this one this is pretty good so
those<00:02:24.040> are<00:02:24.190> some<00:02:24.340> good<00:02:24.490> things<00:02:24.520> about<00:02:24.790> this

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
those are some good things about this

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.730 
those are some good things about this
cube<00:02:25.300> let<00:02:25.840> me<00:02:25.900> talk<00:02:26.050> about<00:02:26.080> some<00:02:26.320> bad<00:02:26.470> things

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
cube let me talk about some bad things

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.730 
cube let me talk about some bad things
now<00:02:27.010> umm<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.450> mentioned<00:02:28.900> when<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.440> first

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
now umm like I mentioned when I first

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.260 
now umm like I mentioned when I first
took<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.010> keep<00:02:30.220> out<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.520> box<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.940> was<00:02:31.000> way

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
took this keep out of the box it was way

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.880 
took this keep out of the box it was way
too<00:02:31.300> loose<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.140> was<00:02:32.170> popping<00:02:32.650> all<00:02:32.770> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
too loose and it was popping all the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.920 
too loose and it was popping all the
time<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.340> i<00:02:33.970> did<00:02:34.150> adjust<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.630> it's<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.840> lot

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
time and i did adjust it it's a lot

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.630 
time and i did adjust it it's a lot
tighter<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.410> but<00:02:35.650> i've<00:02:35.770> still<00:02:35.980> found<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.550> it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
tighter now but i've still found that it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.540 
tighter now but i've still found that it
pops<00:02:36.880> like<00:02:37.290> not<00:02:38.290> very<00:02:38.560> often<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.310> still

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
pops like not very often but it still

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.280 
pops like not very often but it still
pops<00:02:39.760> which<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.120> not<00:02:40.270> good<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.750> pops<00:02:40.990> maybe

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
pops which is not good it pops maybe

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.390 
pops which is not good it pops maybe
like<00:02:41.680> one<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.100> every<00:02:42.340> 15<00:02:42.730> solves<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:43.990> uh<00:02:44.400> so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
like one and every 15 solves but uh so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.830 
like one and every 15 solves but uh so
it<00:02:45.550> pops<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.880> bit<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.480> know<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.630> can

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
it pops a bit but you know you can

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.300 
it pops a bit but you know you can
always<00:02:46.959> tighten<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.800> point<00:02:48.010> where<00:02:48.190> it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
always tighten it to the point where it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.420 
always tighten it to the point where it
won't<00:02:48.400> pop<00:02:48.670> whatsoever<00:02:50.160> another<00:02:51.160> thing

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
won't pop whatsoever another thing

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.910 
won't pop whatsoever another thing
that's<00:02:51.550> really<00:02:51.730> really<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:53.440> bad<00:02:53.620> about

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
that's really really really bad about

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.610 
that's really really really bad about
this<00:02:54.280> cube<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.730> its<00:02:55.390> lock<00:02:55.600> ups<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.110> hard<00:02:56.440> for

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
this cube is its lock ups it's hard for

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.240 
this cube is its lock ups it's hard for
me<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.800> show<00:02:57.010> you

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
me to show you

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.230 
me to show you
but<00:02:58.180> sometimes<00:02:59.170> it'll<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.680> walk<00:02:59.860> up<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:01.090> I

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
but sometimes it'll just walk up like I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.240 
but sometimes it'll just walk up like I
can't<00:03:01.480> really<00:03:01.810> show<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.110> right<00:03:02.380> now<00:03:02.530> but<00:03:02.830> it

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
can't really show you right now but it

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.970 
can't really show you right now but it
will<00:03:03.550> lock<00:03:03.730> up<00:03:04.000> sometimes<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.680> really

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
will lock up sometimes and it's really

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.050 
will lock up sometimes and it's really
frustrating<00:03:06.220> when<00:03:06.610> you're<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.850> middle<00:03:06.970> of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
frustrating when you're in the middle of

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.820 
frustrating when you're in the middle of
solves<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:08.620> right

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
solves and you have to like like right

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.350 
solves and you have to like like right
there<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.070> locked<00:03:09.280> up<00:03:09.430> slightly<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.180> there

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
there it locked up slightly and there

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.540 
there it locked up slightly and there
again<00:03:10.570> I'm<00:03:10.990> doing<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.740> algorithm<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.400> it's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
again I'm doing this algorithm and it's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.180 
again I'm doing this algorithm and it's
locking<00:03:13.300> up<00:03:13.570> so<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.320> cube<00:03:14.590> does<00:03:14.770> lock<00:03:15.010> up

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
locking up so this cube does lock up

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.650 
locking up so this cube does lock up
quite<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.459> bit<00:03:15.640> which<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.910> really<00:03:16.120> frustrating

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
quite a bit which is really frustrating

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.410 
quite a bit which is really frustrating
but<00:03:16.959> it's<00:03:17.530> very<00:03:17.950> very<00:03:18.280> fast<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:18.970> speed<00:03:19.269> is

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
but it's very very fast that speed is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.050 
but it's very very fast that speed is
pretty<00:03:19.630> much<00:03:19.780> unmatched<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:21.519> can<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.850> like

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
pretty much unmatched you can just like

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.949 
pretty much unmatched you can just like
see<00:03:23.310> with<00:03:24.310> one<00:03:24.489> finger<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.150> glides<00:03:25.510> like

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
see with one finger it just glides like

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.229 
see with one finger it just glides like
I<00:03:26.260> don't<00:03:26.320> feel<00:03:26.500> any<00:03:26.680> friction<00:03:27.100> at<00:03:27.190> all<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.580> the

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
I don't feel any friction at all and the

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.430 
I don't feel any friction at all and the
reason<00:03:28.450> why<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.570> don't<00:03:28.720> feel<00:03:28.870> any<00:03:29.019> friction<00:03:29.200> is

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
reason why I don't feel any friction is

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.930 
reason why I don't feel any friction is
because<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:29.920> part<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.430> I'll<00:03:30.489> show<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.730> an

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
because it's part so I'll show you an

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.810 
because it's part so I'll show you an
edge<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.800> here's<00:03:32.800> an<00:03:32.950> edge<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.430> can<00:03:33.580> see<00:03:33.730> it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
edge here here's an edge you can see it

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.400 
edge here here's an edge you can see it
has<00:03:33.970> these<00:03:34.090> little<00:03:34.180> ripples<00:03:34.510> on<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.110> that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
has these little ripples on it and that

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.500 
has these little ripples on it and that
reduces<00:03:35.800> friction<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.430> I'm<00:03:37.180> not<00:03:37.300> going<00:03:37.420> to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
reduces friction and I'm not going to

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.180 
reduces friction and I'm not going to
disassemble<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.170> completely<00:03:38.680> but<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.070> can

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
disassemble it completely but you can

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.710 
disassemble it completely but you can
see<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.430> core<00:03:39.670> in<00:03:39.790> there<00:03:39.940> nothing<00:03:40.480> special

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
see the core in there nothing special

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.140 
see the core in there nothing special
and<00:03:41.820> yeah<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.890> it's<00:03:45.430> key<00:03:45.640> comes<00:03:45.880> preassembled

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
and yeah so it's key comes preassembled

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.590 
and yeah so it's key comes preassembled
very<00:03:46.660> fast<00:03:47.019> too<00:03:47.739> fast<00:03:47.950> double<00:03:48.340> box<00:03:48.580> very<00:03:48.910> loose

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
very fast too fast double box very loose

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.009 
very fast too fast double box very loose
you<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.019> tighten<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.900> know

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
you have to tighten it and you know

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.680 
you have to tighten it and you know
stickers<00:03:53.530> are<00:03:53.739> good<00:03:53.980> locks<00:03:54.700> up<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:54.970> lot<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.420> did

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
stickers are good locks up a lot it did

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.180 
stickers are good locks up a lot it did
pop<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.930> bit<00:03:56.200> but<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.440> doesn't<00:03:56.650> pop<00:03:56.799> too<00:03:57.040> much

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
pop a bit but it doesn't pop too much

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.190 
pop a bit but it doesn't pop too much
anymore<00:03:57.430> but<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.790> still<00:03:58.000> does<00:03:58.209> one<00:03:58.989> good<00:03:59.170> thing

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
anymore but it still does one good thing

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.780 
anymore but it still does one good thing
about<00:03:59.410> this<00:03:59.560> cube<00:03:59.890> is<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.250> corner<00:04:00.580> cutting

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
about this cube is the corner cutting

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.320 
about this cube is the corner cutting
I'll<00:04:01.180> show<00:04:01.390> you<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.660> corner<00:04:01.930> cuts<00:04:02.140> here<00:04:03.330> like

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
I'll show you the corner cuts here like

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.800 
I'll show you the corner cuts here like
they're<00:04:04.660> about<00:04:05.200> line<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.709> line<00:04:05.860> no<00:04:06.519> problem<00:04:07.030> so

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
they're about line to line no problem so

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.990 
they're about line to line no problem so
yeah<00:04:08.080> this<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.650> an<00:04:08.769> excellent<00:04:09.070> cube<00:04:09.370> very<00:04:09.760> very

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
yeah this is an excellent cube very very

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.060 
yeah this is an excellent cube very very
inexpensive<00:04:10.180> -<00:04:10.690> it<00:04:10.959> ran<00:04:11.530> me<00:04:11.739> about<00:04:11.890> eight

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
inexpensive - it ran me about eight

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.650 
inexpensive - it ran me about eight
bucks<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.549> then<00:04:12.640> with<00:04:12.820> shipping<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.299> came<00:04:13.450> to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
bucks and then with shipping it came to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.050 
bucks and then with shipping it came to
a<00:04:13.690> total<00:04:13.900> about<00:04:14.200> thirteen<00:04:14.709> which<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:15.670> like

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
a total about thirteen which is like

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.449 
a total about thirteen which is like
more<00:04:16.450> cheap<00:04:17.049> than<00:04:17.320> an<00:04:17.620> actual<00:04:17.950> store-bought

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
more cheap than an actual store-bought

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.310 
more cheap than an actual store-bought
cube<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.180> don't<00:04:19.600> know<00:04:19.690> about<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.959> guys<00:04:20.109> but

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
cube I don't know about you guys but

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.870 
cube I don't know about you guys but
where<00:04:20.470> I'm<00:04:20.590> from<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:21.010> store-bought<00:04:21.430> rubik's

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
where I'm from a store-bought rubik's

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.490 
where I'm from a store-bought rubik's
cube<00:04:22.150> here<00:04:22.390> is<00:04:22.539> like<00:04:22.690> 20<00:04:23.080> bucks<00:04:23.200> it's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
cube here is like 20 bucks it's

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.620 
cube here is like 20 bucks it's
ridiculous<00:04:24.099> so<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:24.970> cube<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.419> would

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
ridiculous so this cube I would

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.690 
ridiculous so this cube I would
definitely<00:04:25.960> recommend

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
definitely recommend

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.930 
definitely recommend
some<00:04:27.120> flaws<00:04:27.360> but<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.690> guess<00:04:27.960> nothing's<00:04:28.680> perfect

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
some flaws but I guess nothing's perfect

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.280 
some flaws but I guess nothing's perfect
so<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:29.970> pick<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.480> up<00:04:30.570> link<00:04:30.960> will<00:04:31.050> be<00:04:31.170> in<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
so I pick it up link will be in the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.410 
so I pick it up link will be in the
description<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.920> highly<00:04:32.250> recommend<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:32.700> let's

description I highly recommend it let's

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.440 
description I highly recommend it let's
look<00:04:33.540> at<00:04:33.630> some<00:04:33.750> example<00:04:34.140> solves
