00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
a it is a relatively tight fit so you're

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.860 
a it is a relatively tight fit so you're
I'm<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.760> be<00:02:29.819> pretty<00:02:30.060> sure<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.420> your

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
I'm going to be pretty sure that your

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.400 
I'm going to be pretty sure that your
iPad<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.890> not<00:02:32.069> going<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.250> be<00:02:32.340> moving<00:02:32.580> around<00:02:33.410> in

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
iPad is not going to be moving around in

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.070 
iPad is not going to be moving around in
this<00:02:35.069> particular<00:02:35.340> case<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.660> little

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
this particular case is a little

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.119 
this particular case is a little
difficult<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.650> get<00:02:37.890> on<00:02:38.040> after<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.819> few<00:02:39.150> times

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
difficult to get on after a few times

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.680 
difficult to get on after a few times
you<00:02:41.129> know<00:02:41.220> once<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.640> put<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.660> you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
you know once you put it on you know you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.360 
you know once you put it on you know you
really<00:02:42.989> shouldn't<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.799> issue<00:02:43.980> going

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
really shouldn't have this issue going

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.369 
really shouldn't have this issue going
forward<00:02:44.489> but<00:02:45.060> putting<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.110> there's<00:02:46.349> a

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
forward but putting it on there's a

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.370 
forward but putting it on there's a
little<00:02:46.530> bit<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.860> chore<00:02:47.099> but<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.200> got

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
little bit of a chore but there you got

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.050 
little bit of a chore but there you got
it<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:49.769> really<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.610> going<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.849> kind<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
it it's really just going to kind of

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.259 
it it's really just going to kind of
squeeze<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> nice<00:02:54.120> tight<00:02:54.690> fit<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
squeeze it in it is a nice tight fit the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.360 
squeeze it in it is a nice tight fit the
only<00:02:57.810> issue<00:02:57.930> well<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:58.769> big<00:02:59.010> thing<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.310> should

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
only issue well one big thing I should

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.130 
only issue well one big thing I should
mention<00:02:59.519> right<00:02:59.910> now<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.209> does<00:03:00.390> not<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
mention right now it does not have the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
of just having you know a cover to

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.990

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
other downside to this was the was I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.129 
other downside to this was the was I
going<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.019> say<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:12.120> Smart<00:04:12.450> Cover<00:04:12.660> kind<00:04:13.019> of

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
going to say the the Smart Cover kind of

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.430 
going to say the the Smart Cover kind of
it<00:04:13.530> locks<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.250> place<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.669> it's<00:04:15.030> good<00:04:15.329> for<00:04:16.289> one

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
it locks in place so it's good for one

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.839 
it locks in place so it's good for one
instance<00:04:16.829> that<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.039> cover<00:04:17.310> won't<00:04:17.549> fall<00:04:17.820> off

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
instance that the cover won't fall off

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.990 
instance that the cover won't fall off
but<00:04:18.750> at<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> same<00:04:19.169> time<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:20.400> almost<00:04:20.700> seems

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
but at the same time it almost seems

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000 
but at the same time it almost seems
like<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.269> because<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.019> material<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.860> it

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
like it because of the material and it

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.790 
like it because of the material and it
kind<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.310> adheres<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.750> glass<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.409> ipad

kind of adheres to the glass of the ipad
2<00:04:26.300> wasn't<00:04:27.300> exactly<00:04:27.599> thrilled<00:04:28.140> with<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.560> I

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
2 wasn't exactly thrilled with that I

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.340 
2 wasn't exactly thrilled with that I
would<00:04:29.099> have<00:04:29.190> preferred<00:04:29.340> something<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:30.090> a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
would have preferred something like a

outlining or something like that versus

outlining or something like that versus
this<00:04:32.930> kind<00:04:33.260> of<00:04:33.350> tacky<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.980> actually<00:04:34.280> have<00:04:34.370> a
