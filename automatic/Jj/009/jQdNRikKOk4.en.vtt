Thank jaffe here welcome we're talking
about<00:00:07.799> triads<00:00:08.490> today<00:00:09.000> all<00:00:09.179> right<00:00:09.300> or<00:00:09.480> right

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
about triads today all right or right

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.950 
about triads today all right or right
now<00:00:09.900> just<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.500> general<00:00:10.530> all<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.490> time<00:00:11.759> um<00:00:12.179> I

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
now just in general all the time um I

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.379 
now just in general all the time um I
tried<00:00:13.920> as<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> three<00:00:14.370> note<00:00:14.549> chord<00:00:14.849> made<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.269> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
tried as a three note chord made up of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.450 
tried as a three note chord made up of
the<00:00:15.509> first<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.230> third<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.859> fifth<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the first the third and the fifth of the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.890 
the first the third and the fifth of the
root<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.940> third<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.420> fifth<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
root the third and the fifth of the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.140 
root the third and the fifth of the
scale<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.230> talked<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.529> degrees<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.730> another

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
scale we talked about degrees in another

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
scale we talked about degrees in another
video<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:21.840> scale<00:00:22.140> degrees<00:00:22.529> first

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
video these are all scale degrees first

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.519 
video these are all scale degrees first
third<00:00:23.670> fifth<00:00:24.180> okay<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.140> we're<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> use

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
third fifth okay so we're going to use

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.910 
third fifth okay so we're going to use
the<00:00:25.650> key<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.980> G<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> start<00:00:28.320> right<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.529> with

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the key of G and start right here with

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.290 
the key of G and start right here with
the<00:00:29.039> root<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.480> G<00:00:31.130> third<00:00:32.130> which<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> B

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the root so we have G third which is B

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.250 
the root so we have G third which is B
and<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:34.230> fifth<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.040> d<00:00:35.420> now<00:00:36.420> because<00:00:36.989> I'm

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and a fifth which is d now because I'm

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
and a fifth which is d now because I'm
so<00:00:37.440> close<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.610> nut<00:00:39.920> I'm<00:00:40.920> not<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
so close to the the nut I'm not going to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.740 
so close to the the nut I'm not going to
use<00:00:41.430> my<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:41.820> finger<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> fry<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:42.570> just

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
use my first finger to fry that I'm just

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
use my first finger to fry that I'm just
going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.930> let<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.230> an<00:00:43.320> open<00:00:43.559> string<00:00:44.059> but

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
going to let it be an open string but

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.049 
going to let it be an open string but
this<00:00:45.239> shape<00:00:45.510> looks<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.640> third<00:00:47.640> finger

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this shape looks like this third finger

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.670 
this shape looks like this third finger
on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> third<00:00:48.629> fret<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> sixth<00:00:49.469> string

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
on the third fret of the sixth string

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
on the third fret of the sixth string
middle<00:00:50.399> finger<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.940> second<00:00:51.300> fret<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
middle finger on the second fret of the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.410 
middle finger on the second fret of the
fifth<00:00:51.870> string<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.280> case<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.850> going

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
fifth string and in this case just going

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
fifth string and in this case just going
to<00:00:54.480> let<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> open<00:00:55.079> D<00:00:55.260> string<00:00:55.289> ring<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> here's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to let that open D string ring so here's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.220 
to let that open D string ring so here's
your<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.570> major<00:00:58.289> triad<00:00:59.359> on<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:01.020> low

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
your first major triad on this low

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.410 
your first major triad on this low
string<00:01:01.530> set<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> lowest<00:01:02.309> g<00:01:02.789> major<00:01:02.940> triad<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
string set the lowest g major triad you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179

something<00:01:05.519> called<00:01:05.700> inverting<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> cord<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
something called inverting the cord and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
something called inverting the cord and
what<00:01:06.990> inverting<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> cord<00:01:07.799> means<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.390> cycling

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
what inverting the cord means is cycling

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.670 
what inverting the cord means is cycling
notes<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.840> chord<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.229> putting<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.530> into

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
notes of the chord and putting them into

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.490 
notes of the chord and putting them into
different<00:01:10.860> orders<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.580> instead<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.909> starting

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
different orders so instead of starting

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.890 
different orders so instead of starting
on<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.400> route<00:01:14.670> we're<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> start<00:01:15.720> on

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
on the route we're now going to start on

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990 
on the route we're now going to start on
the<00:01:16.140> third<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.710> order<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> go

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the third and the order is going to go

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.429 
the third and the order is going to go
like<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.299> 3rd<00:01:19.580> 5th<00:01:20.750> root<00:01:21.750> putting<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> root

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
like this 3rd 5th root putting the root

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.399 
like this 3rd 5th root putting the root
on<00:01:22.560> top<00:01:22.860> ok<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.000> shape<00:01:24.240> looks<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:25.080> what

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
on top ok and the shape looks like what

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
on top ok and the shape looks like what
I'm<00:01:25.500> doing<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> third<00:01:26.280> finger<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
I'm doing here the third finger on the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.050 
I'm doing here the third finger on the
7th<00:01:27.689> fret<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.439> 6th<00:01:28.770> string<00:01:28.979> i'm<00:01:29.670> using<00:01:30.030> my

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
7th fret the 6th string i'm using my

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
7th fret the 6th string i'm using my
first<00:01:30.360> finger<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:31.200> bar<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.130> fifth<00:01:32.460> threats<00:01:32.729> on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
first finger to bar the fifth threats on

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.350 
first finger to bar the fifth threats on
the<00:01:33.329> 5th<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> 4th<00:01:33.900> strings<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the 5th and 4th strings so you have the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.570 
the 5th and 4th strings so you have the
exact<00:01:36.689> same

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
exact same

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.390 
exact same
Zack<00:01:39.570> same<00:01:39.780> chord<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> different<00:01:41.160> note

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
Zack same chord with a different note

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
Zack same chord with a different note
order<00:01:41.820> okay<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.080> different

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
order okay it's kind of like different

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
order okay it's kind of like different
ways<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:44.280> express<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.880> same<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.480> know

ways to express the same thing you know
how<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:45.990> word<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.940> can<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.090> many

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
how one word you know there can be many

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.020 
how one word you know there can be many
different<00:01:48.690> meanings<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.260> same<00:01:49.470> idea

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
different meanings of the same idea

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.960 
different meanings of the same idea
can't<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.120> one<00:01:51.300> right<00:01:51.480> now<00:01:51.630> um<00:01:52.880> all<00:01:53.880> right

now<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.750> our<00:01:54.930> final<00:01:55.770> inversion<00:01:56.280> because

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
now here is our final inversion because

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.200 
now here is our final inversion because
these<00:01:56.640> are<00:01:56.790> three<00:01:57.090> note<00:01:57.240> chords<00:01:59.090> we're<00:02:00.090> going

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
these are three note chords we're going

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.600 
these are three note chords we're going
to<00:02:00.270> put<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> fifth<00:02:00.900> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.650> base<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.490> have

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
to put the fifth in the base so you have

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.270 
to put the fifth in the base so you have
the<00:02:02.730> fifth<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:04.170> root<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:06.420> third<00:02:07.280> again

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the fifth the root and the third again

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the fifth the root and the third again
exact<00:02:08.759> same<00:02:08.970> chord<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> different

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
exact same chord just a different

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300 
exact same chord just a different
inversion<00:02:12.720> alright<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.380> my<00:02:13.650> middle<00:02:13.950> finger<00:02:14.190> is

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
inversion alright so my middle finger is

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.340 
inversion alright so my middle finger is
on<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.460> 10th<00:02:14.820> fret<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> sixth<00:02:15.660> string<00:02:15.720> my

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
on the 10th fret of the sixth string my

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
on the 10th fret of the sixth string my
third<00:02:16.590> finger<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.220> 10th<00:02:17.550> fret<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
third finger is on the 10th fret of the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.270 
third finger is on the 10th fret of the
fifth<00:02:18.270> string<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:19.050> first<00:02:19.290> finger<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
fifth string my first finger is on the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.120 
fifth string my first finger is on the
ninth<00:02:20.670> fret<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:22.050> 4th<00:02:22.320> string<00:02:22.709> all<00:02:22.950> right

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
ninth fret of the 4th string all right

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.280 
ninth fret of the 4th string all right
it<00:02:23.970> gives<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.390> sound<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:25.050> right<00:02:25.170> so

let's<00:02:25.380> go<00:02:25.590> through<00:02:25.620> these<00:02:25.950> inversions<00:02:26.280> really

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
let's go through these inversions really

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.210 
let's go through these inversions really
quick<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.150> your<00:02:28.070> root<00:02:29.070> position<00:02:31.220> first

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
quick you have your root position first

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.980 
quick you have your root position first
inversion<00:02:34.220> second<00:02:35.220> inversion<00:02:35.810> try<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.870> in

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
inversion second inversion try it in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.780 
inversion second inversion try it in
version<00:02:37.320> it's<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.560> beautiful<00:02:37.890> thing<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.670> this
