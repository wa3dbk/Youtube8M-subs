00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:10.170
 What reason is that people who have a say gold today is very much 6 system that can earn 1.5 times as compared to the night shift there is no person 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.060
 I will speak 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.550
 Oh my, my first 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:24.580
 I was working in the slot while doing that office worker, but at that time there was a night shift 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:29.500
 Well because Tachimaware quite advantageous in that could go from a morning Tteyuu could go from morning Te 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:33.050
 I think people I talk to say Therefore, it is amazing lucky that there is that if night shift 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.880
 How to do even if of course there is no station of mate in a nutshell 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.830
 There are a lot of things to say 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:44.840
 Well, I can do it in various ways, but I wonder if I can go in the morning or not 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.800
 I thought let's take towards the considerable importance'm kind of people Well, because it is important to say 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.080
 I will 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.690
 Well , what's good about it? Well, I came in, but I'm saying I'm aiming for a reset 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:00.949
 I think I'm good because can be taking the the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.500
 I think it's kind of feeling after all though it is said that the reset aim 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:10.140
 Well I specifically did it actually 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 We will continue to talk about the Tteyuu method was doing to the minute office worker era Oh dig the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.680
 It also depends on you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.370
 Well it's gotten in response to that ad hoc 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.350
 Us to Node summer reference Tteyuu I'd want to have a method that I had actually met 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.530
 I think that it is good in the degree 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.890
 Yes So in we go 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 I used to work late at night and I thought at around 6 o'clock if there was no Asano Mai overtime work 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.080
 There may be lunch break, but there are many 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.420
 At the same time, the company at that time 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.540
 Nde break was in about it Well wonder if it was 12 o'clock 12 at 6 o'clock 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.650
 Well I can see the data of the day All 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.280
 Since it is data robot site seven, it is Eva first 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.780
 Of the lever 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.610
 If it is 2, you may not be a web Basilisk 2 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.299
 It would be a time of determination that there would have been front teeth as well. 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.440
 Well there was such a thing , but I think that I don't think so much at the time now, so I should not look 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.490
 I may not 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.270
 In I think that there is a place that remains even Well Well now basilisk 2 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.360
 First of all, Basilisk 2 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.810
 I see from the history so well 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:23.570
 Please see all stores where you can see the history 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.410
 First of all, to go to the place that looks like some of the stores where you can go 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:31.010
 Right 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.810
 In course, there is also a time amazing delicious to the time I think you also waiting oc when no 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.350
 In Well Tokoro the reference if there 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.600
 Please enter from the length First of all 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.960
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.070
 After all if not 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:47.120
 I'm going to a shop where pre-sacrifice or reset is taking place 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:51.800
 And so much without me Dema course the previous squirrel shop 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.590
 But is especially But Well Maari that I know I better not to have only about one store 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.390
 I don't think there is anything in particular in the country , but that's where you go 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.680
 I think it 's easy to get around 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.660
 It is fine if you get in , but basically it is basic to take merge set first 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.950
 I think 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.540
 Is 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.410
 And if it is possible to examine me reset the expected value window of Lisa time we even outside leaves the floor and to open 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.870
 When it comes out 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:22.040
 It will feel like you're going to take turns 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:27.470
 Well I have to go to bed because I work at night. 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.680
 I had been open to Toka 3 o'clock be or Well 12 o'clock Toka late Na soooo also b 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.860
 Ne 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.730
 Apparently until about it 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.810
 Ha Well if its rt hit 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.080
 Then, is not it does not stop anymore When you have or whether normal to not familiar little Well Nunn 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.770
 I can not sleep 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.350
 Please be prepared there 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.880
 I think I want you to do it 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:56.350
 So first of all, let's check it and say that 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:00.940
 Nde is Well now not so much because Toka by Yoshika hear pedestal that basilisk 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:06.880
 I think it is a basilisk 2. Basically, if you take a reset from there 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:10.030
 After all, and off the coast and When was the fact that in no Well reset Tiger not do reset point 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.870
 It means that the reset will go the way it will be in the future 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.910
 It is basic 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:21.290
 In principle, it is only the hamari stand to be reset and the basic is really good 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.170
 When there is something like a strong event, there is also a reset or something like that with this model alone 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.150
 but 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:32.340
 I think that it is really all around 80 % 70 % 80 % 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.110
 I'd Well appropriate feeling or rather rough estimate but is my approximate Well it about is addicted who 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.810
 And cut set 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:42.780
 For example, if you already hear it, you will say 128. If you reset it, reset it 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:48.050
 After that I always made do if there are 510 people 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:53.060
 Is n't it delicious? If you have 510 guitars, the shop side 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:57.470
 I do not need to make a delicious place yet, so if it was 128, I will keep going 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:03.680
 There is no expectation value if you turn it, but probably from 128 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:06.610
 So Well, the day before if there is no value to reset hole is basically 1 and fine but you all 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.870
 You may think that you do not do that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:15.159
 500 whether though is roughly Well in is I think you think whether the border 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.629
 Even the I mean is above or thing is above 500 Toka Well god Toka to comes to a little more 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.700
 There is 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.820
 Yes 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.380
 That way except that hamari stand 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:30.510
 Hamari stand to say resetç‹™ Utte 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:35.070
 On the day also grinded not stand me Jissueoki Hama hamari is at roughly If Toka 500 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:40.590
 Yes, I guess I feel it 's going migrated to Fu say so because in many cases are 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:42.710
 So at first I would like to reset and turn somebody in the meantime 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.820
 I think it would be better 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:50.600
 Yes 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:54.290
 Well night work night work but I really mean the very first time during the break of the station 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.320
 Oh, I teach and hear flame with Mr. Pachipro 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:02.870
 Is Toka 5 times faster entered Well 2-fold speed 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.840
 Because time is useless, I can say that I think that I hear it and I can do it with 5 sheets. 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.129
 It can be a while soon 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.319
 I understand 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:13.889
 It would be fine if I could listen to the buried story without looking at my face 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:18.689
 So yeah 1.5 times twice or recently 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:24.430
 I don't know because it's new, but I can say 1.5 times 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:30.070
 Was and is more and more heard I think to hear a lot more and more be heard at double speed that way 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:33.500
 I feel that he's right and I think it is Well hear what the first time and want to go doing that 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:36.500
 But how many times I remember more naturally 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:40.480
 Now or asked to go to remember in such a feeling 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:45.610
 Whether and do you'll I break time to use 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:51.000
 Then I think I think I can go into advantage, but of course if you are a person with tax accountability 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.000
 But I think that should I hit from saying it is reset expectations high in order 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:59.940
 I think with all means want to go with reference Nde I was doing now in such a feeling 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.980
 Really say there is a Beijing 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:09.920
 It's a very good thing. It really changes quite there alone 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:14.410
 Those who have immunity do their best and do their best 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.410
 I would like you to understand that it is delicious 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.370
 Then 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.370
 Thank you
