the crusher the big whatever the hell I
I<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:26.970> looking<00:00:27.269> at<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.960> I'm

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
I was just looking at it actually I'm

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.019 
I was just looking at it actually I'm
not<00:00:28.800> sure<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.250> called<00:00:29.490> i'm<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
not sure what it's called i'm going to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.370 
not sure what it's called i'm going to
call<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> crusher<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> have

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
call it the crusher you need to have

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.450 
call it the crusher you need to have
that<00:00:31.410> break<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.220> biodome<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:34.739> needs<00:00:35.220> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that break the biodome and it needs to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.650 
that break the biodome and it needs to
become<00:00:35.900> zero<00:00:36.900> gravity<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.970> will<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.480> able

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
become zero gravity so you will be able

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.610 
become zero gravity so you will be able
to<00:00:40.550> do<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.700> glitch<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:43.350> glitch<00:00:43.590> is
