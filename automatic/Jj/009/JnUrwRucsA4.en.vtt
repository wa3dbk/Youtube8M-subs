00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
portal and you need water instead of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.330 
portal and you need water instead of
fire<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.360> like<00:01:20.570> that<00:01:20.750> up<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:21.560> jump<00:01:21.950> on<00:01:22.130> in

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.020 
and here we are in the beautiful aether
2<00:01:26.810> world<00:01:27.260> so<00:01:28.040> as<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.370> can<00:01:28.460> see<00:01:28.520> we<00:01:29.000> are

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
2 world so as you can see we are

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.850 
2 world so as you can see we are
floating<00:01:29.900> up<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.230> heavens<00:01:30.409> we're

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
floating up in the heavens we're

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.020 
floating up in the heavens we're
floating<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.490> sky

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
floating in the sky

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.240 
floating in the sky
I<00:01:32.060> guess<00:01:32.990> those<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:33.350> be<00:01:33.380> clouds<00:01:33.710> over<00:01:34.040> there

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
I guess those can be clouds over there

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.540 
I guess those can be clouds over there
I'm<00:01:34.880> not<00:01:34.940> really<00:01:35.150> sure<00:01:35.510> when<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.380> do<00:01:36.830> come<00:01:37.520> to
