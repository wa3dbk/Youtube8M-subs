leftover proved pretty handy i crunch it

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.369 
leftover proved pretty handy i crunch it
after<00:01:00.350> one<00:01:00.530> dragon<00:01:01.129> dance<00:01:01.339> and<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:02.300> does<00:01:02.540> less

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
after one dragon dance and it does less

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.590 
after one dragon dance and it does less
and<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> half<00:01:03.829> which<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.430> okay<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.360> gyro

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
and a half which is okay and it gyro

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.820 
and a half which is okay and it gyro
ball<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:07.430> doesn't<00:01:07.790> do<00:01:08.000> all<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.509> much<00:01:08.830> so

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
ball and it doesn't do all that much so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.590 
ball and it doesn't do all that much so
I'm<00:01:09.979> thinking<00:01:10.009> maybe<00:01:10.670> she'll<00:01:11.300> switch<00:01:11.540> out<00:01:11.750> and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
I'm thinking maybe she'll switch out and

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.450 
I'm thinking maybe she'll switch out and
that<00:01:14.600> would<00:01:14.720> be<00:01:14.750> good<00:01:15.050> so<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> dragon<00:01:16.310> dance

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
that would be good so I dragon dance

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.660 
that would be good so I dragon dance
again<00:01:17.350> but<00:01:18.350> she<00:01:18.680> doesn't<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.190> she<00:01:19.220> stays<00:01:19.490> and

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
again but she doesn't and she stays and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.190 
again but she doesn't and she stays and
goes<00:01:19.789> for<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:20.000> second<00:01:20.300> get<00:01:20.570> her<00:01:20.660> law<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.080> that's
