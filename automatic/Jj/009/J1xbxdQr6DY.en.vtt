 gym animal then don't do it 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.279
 case in my eyes 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.010
 this is the result of only four 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.389
 hours of sleep the other night are nice that 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.740
 stoned however that does not prevent me 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.780
 to make a video for you that brings a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 moment of patience because what I have from

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.330

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 a casino to make these videos part a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.809
 propose useful material later 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.039
 because in 2015 it will really be 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 electrifying I will bring more material 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.410
 other useful things you will need do 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 also things very funny initiatives 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.199
 for example another transformation though 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.400
 this time of mass we see 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.080
 ok thanks also to those few rosikons 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 creeping beings that you break the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 fuck from time to time for now thanks to 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.439
 you got more visibility you have 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.080
 helped increase mine 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.000
 popularity so thank you and you too 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.400
 stay tuned because I just 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 I will recover from my injury will be more 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.270
 big stronger than before and there yes that there 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.189
 will be fun 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.350
 beyond this we are about to dive 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.310
 in 2015 so this year is almost 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.020
 finished you have to jump behind and 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 the important thing is that we must 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.729
 start the new year and continue with 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 it is a sample mentality 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.780
 Fitness in the career or 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.030
 nations it is important to have that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.250
 positive attitude with mentality 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.790
 from winning to reach yours 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 target 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.990
 and by this it does not mean it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.060
 nothing how great your strength is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.340
 how many pounds you get up to 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.770
 all this does not count a single cock 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.700
 what matters is that it gives 110 percent 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.470
 of yourself 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.470
 then everything you need to achieved 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.410
 your dream short story about a year 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.620
 a boy of his own enters the gym 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.600
 I 'm not mistaken 17 years completely out 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.850
 dry but gross form like a cane 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.020
 bamboo, however, with a bit of bachata 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.330
 evidently they saw it for a year 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.400
 I saw it almost every day 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.110
 train in the gym and 5 times a 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.510
 week every day for at least 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.850
 an hour trained in the gym and the most 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.520
 sometimes he came out of the gym almost 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.350
 crawling or giving all that 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.209
 he gave to the soul in his 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.800
 workouts he was not afraid to make himself 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.410
 bad he wasn't even afraid of throwing up 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.930
 at the gym doing them squats gave everything 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.170
 what he had and after one year 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.959
 I saw it a couple of days ago while 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.180
 I did my leg training 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.190
 I see that completely changed 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.740
 clearly visually I can say that 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.140
 put on 18 plus or minus 8 kg of mass 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.780
 and I went to talk to him about the first one 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.640
 time I told him and the compliments I have 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.990
 first seen last year 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.640
 when you entered the gym yesterday 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.620
 completely different how many pounds he has 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.410
 issued then we started one 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.959
 conversation told me that 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:21.540
 since it was discarded by his 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.540
 a football team 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.900
 It served as motivation for 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.610
 prove to everyone the opposite for 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.180
 prove that it is practically not a 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.610
 failed that is not a useless person but 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.030
 who can make it can excel in his 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.769
 sport 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.360
 so the one served there as 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.269
 motivation told me he was tired 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.070
 he felt completely disappointed as if 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.110
 everyone had abandoned him too 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.090
 team friends had it completely 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.310
 abandoned because he announced he had it 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.820
 made to be selected in the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.350
 team for which that really is 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.930
 something to admire a person 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.200
 completely out of shape 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.209
 who gave himself wholly for 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.299
 reaching his dream is that for me 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.650
 is a sample has nothing to do with what 6 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.110
 as big as if seen 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.049
 lots of people in my life with a 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.610
 perfect physique all very well 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.530
 really big quartered really 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.450
 an admirable physique but over the years 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.970
 they have not changed they have remained so 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.520
 while other people instead have 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.790
 pushed into the gym they all have a hundred 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.890
 cyan towards 110 percent and have 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.380
 changed from day to day to them 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.790
 physical in which a sample in the eyes does not 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.950
 has a person who only wants 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.150
 appear to be better than others e 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.000
 tease the weakest 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.160
 indeed a champion a real champion one 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.350
 person who not only wants to improve if 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.990
 same day by day but try 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.240
 also to improve others do not throw 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.700
 down the weakest but indeed of sun and 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.330
 beat to have an impact on 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.760
 their life 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.950
 try to contribute that that is a 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.860
 champion is a leader for whom in my 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.510
 notice body building doesn't have to be 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.630
 a superficial sport made only 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.850
 of races trophies poses etc. 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.470
 even if I have nothing against those 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.010
 in fact they have some friends who compete 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.070
 however they compete what is attractive 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.380
 perfect for the judges of that race 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.050
 it is not necessarily perfect attractive 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.700
 so for me what I define 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.950
 perfect is not necessarily something you 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.479
 define perfect everyone has tastes 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.360
 different then the prohibition of with one 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.820
 We must focus on what is subjective and 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.100
 compete with ourselves by day in 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.530
 day and especially contribute to 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.840
 back to the community trying to have 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.120
 an impact on others as well 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.870
 improving others this for me is the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.419
 body building 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.210
 having said that this is all I wish you a happy new year 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.190
 thanks again for following me and there 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.640
 we soon feel then amused and 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.640
 breaks everything
