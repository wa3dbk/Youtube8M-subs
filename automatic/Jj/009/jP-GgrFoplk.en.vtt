00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.809
 the world in 100 days at foosball a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.040
 moment it amused to put two balls to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.059
 put three balls and played that's 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.130
 play with three balls at the same time 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.570
 it's all human questions 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 want to make a moment in your life 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.070
 not necessarily to total anarchy but to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.990
 want to break rules a moment 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.730
 with a lifetime estimated between 4 and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.439
 6 years video games are one of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 most subject consumer products 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 at the planned obsolescence then at 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 the ecluse cultural creation workshop 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.079
 and digital in the center of paris 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.379
 the artist Antonin furneaux fight against 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.450
 time thanks to him a simple umbrella 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.460
 revives a thirty-year old game 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 hunting ducks and his pistol 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 of consoles in this work of art 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 called rain shooting the material 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.489
 first of this artist of 34 years 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 passed by the arts deco of paris 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.850
 his personal collection and the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.530
 trash cans in his neighborhood 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.530
 stuffed with relics from the digital age 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.549
 and that's the multiplayer for playing 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 4 on the nintendo ds we did this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.310
 piece in ten years and what's going on 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.710
 would pass though instead of playing pacman 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.539
 alone we play pacman 8 same 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 time but he nobody controls the same 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:25.259
 pac man and so we have very simply 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 close two multi score friends together 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 we hooked him up the joystick is actually 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.850
 these eight controllers there is only one 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.069
 cable that leaves in a single player so 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.539
 people actually you play at 8 may 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.590
 control a single pacman so all the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.429
 world must agree to the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.270
 right everyone to put themselves 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.959
 okay to go left 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.959
 insecurity 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.240
 in the street fighter of Antonin 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:58.420
 joysticks are changed to make the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.189
 shots that we give when I pick up a 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.299
 old I know I take it as a 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.640
 black box I tell myself I'm not going 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.470
 to touch the graphics is rather 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.200
 how are people almost an 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.729
 kind of relational devices to the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.090
 time it's a game that has an age that is 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.550
 of retrogaming so people it touches to 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 his touch to their children it touches a 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 link they have an affection that are 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.370
 with this game and I tell myself she 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.760
 is the little brick is mechanical that 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.530
 I add more 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.970
 the antonin works are created for 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.230
 to be played at events that he 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.040
 conceives as fairgrounds 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.230
 digital 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.879
 the public finds there machines that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.980
 thought it had fallen into the oblivion of the 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.920
 digital world like prehistoric 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.540
 tennis fortwo key in 58 from a 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.690
 oscilloscope by a physicist who 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.579
 was bored it's the precursor of pong 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.500
 the first game that popularized the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.110
 home console then the arcade game 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.440
 in the 70's the following is from 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.440
 the story 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.900
 tyson a prehistoric game 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.250
 we were a prehistoric man we 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.930
 walk and it was the universe was 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.530
 almost infinite the progression was 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.299
 hyper slow 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.069
 he plays a week to pass 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.500
 stone age one two three weeks 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.819
 to raise the age ax and fire 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.129
 did not know what we're doing helping I put 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.579
 it was just a curiosity tool 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.069
 I happened to let the cursor 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.379
 on advanced by blocking it with tape 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.750
 and let him advance just to see where 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.980
 it was the end of the world 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.659
 invited to the house of visual arts 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.819
 at chevilly larue in eastern Paris 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.859
 for the exhibition obsolescence of 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.930
 programs and the artist flourish from 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.370
 laws reconstituted a salon of the years 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.830
 80 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.629
 this old diffuse cathode ray TV 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.959
 day after day the log of links 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.599
 exactly 30 years old another vestige of the past 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.890
 a diverted version of the tetris game in 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.170
 using recognition software 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.360
 voice placed in an old phone 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.700
 commands are executed with 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.769
 melenchon or trotsky keywords for 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.519
 go left sarkozy or the pen for 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.950
 turn right 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.849
 promise of franÃ§ois hollande allows him 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.950
 to turn back 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.150
 so I'm really bad at maths 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.099
 finally I have a 3rd level in maths 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.810
 and I started to program 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.579
 late late I would have never thought 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.329
 I 'll make a code eventually 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:18.560
 programming has more to do with the 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.970
 literature the language that with maths 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.979
 that is to say finally when we do 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.030
 programming when we make code 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:30.630
 we have a grammar a vocabulary we 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.919
 are we going to actually use for for 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.960
 be understood 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:38.130
 so there it is not by a reader finally 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.690
 the reader rather it is the machine for 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.850
 his installation we have hamster 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.620
 to reign on the earth florent replay the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.020
 Planet of the monkeys in rodent version 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.000
 in this imaginary universe the hamsters 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.979
 which roughly have the same hope of 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.660
 life that a video game runs in their 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.560
 wheels while visitors gallop 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.479
 on a treadmill 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.729
 a game that did not please the activists 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.120
 animal rights no man stearns a 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.039
 been injured for the duration of 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.720
 the exposure that had been fed 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.780
 he had small meals that was 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.380
 prepared by three chefs 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.199
 stars 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.610
 we had we had killer coaches and 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.620
 massages when they had some 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.720
 aches force to run in their 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.919
 little too how they were finally they 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.210
 have a rodent life dream what 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.919
 exhibition obsolescence programs 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.199
 and is meant as a reflection on the 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.039
 digital waste by recycling its 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.570
 old machines 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.639
 the artists are nick to their 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.409
 designers who flood the market 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.430
 ephemeral mode for better frustrated 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.250
 potential buyers 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.409
 the singstar karaoke game of the artist 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.810
 gaspard valerian was worried for 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.520
 become the work evolve all 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.500
 clip images have been replaced by 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.980
 revolutionary propaganda while 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.050
 that the words suffered the same fate 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.810
 I was talking about the device just like 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.700
 a system a moment that poses a moment 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.380
 a frame but that offers precisely a 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.940
 space of freedom going in his ways 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.830
 to reactivate questions from 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.630
 problematic it's mostly that so 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.940
 less the approach as an artist like 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.740
 plastic artist is not to deliver a 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.290
 message is rather to pose the 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.430
 conditions of reflection of a message 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.150
 and I know what it would be 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.150
 this message from elsewhere
