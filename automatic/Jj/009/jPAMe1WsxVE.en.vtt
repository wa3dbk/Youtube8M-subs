00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.690
 hello all welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.600
 mister will know everything today I'm going to 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.250
 show a video in which I will present 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.630
 the best free games for 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.540
 windows 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.950
 we started with giving the cndh it's a 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.750
 game in which we play in mode 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.300
 horizontal 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.090
 with which we have to go jumping and 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.430
 killing bugs during a series of 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.150
 scenarios because doing a bit like it is 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.150
 so you can see 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.010
 but the whole game we have to jump 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.410
 as we see on the screen avoiding this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.060
 crossing and killing 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.060
 is the teacher to do my job 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.500
 and I'm going to tell you that I could not 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.450
 you know that low is quite entertaining 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.660
 and especially big free so for 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.660
 what not 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.930
 it is not too difficult provided that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.930
 it's a bit skillful color of 2 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.329
 but even the air we have new 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:27.280
 demanding the game they teach me 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.830
 He is called extreme fort lifting 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 it's a game in which we have to 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.310
 pick up the cargo with a crane 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.990
 and take it to its destination 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.799
 in the same game quite difficult 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.770
 because we have no skill in terms of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.510
 drive 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 said that these 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.180
 but the same as before has so 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.180
 why not doubt it 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.170
 a little 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.719
 as the merchandise 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.700
 we already arrive to where he says 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.700
 the arrows 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.710
 up there we have to change the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.720
 cameras 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.620
 or just sliding your finger across the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.580
 screen 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580
 we change the angle of vision 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.390
 As you know it is a bit difficult 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.980
 but it's with a little monastery 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.480
 practice and I think that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.959
 that we can train quite well and 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.959
 become 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.319
 the third and last game is called 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.680
 word with rabbit I told him 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.810
 is a game in which we are the leader of 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.870
 a 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.640
 no way 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.500
 of rabbits 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.450
 and we have to get 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.470
 more energy and food to attract more 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.470
 rabbits to our burrow 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.590
 when we start the game we simply have 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.240
 this part of the burrow and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.240
 as more rabbits arrive and 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.700
 we are building more rooms 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.280
 we are going to have the levels that 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.580
 let's get 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.330
 this gentlemen here are they need 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.950
 for fun or sleep according to what we 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.650
 say anyway this is not going 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.160
 saying in the tutorial that we have to 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.160
 beginning of the game 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.180
 we are moving the rabbits to a 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.329
 room to another to manufacture then 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.499
 energy in this case or food in the 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.499
 case of the green rooms 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.989
 if we make the gesture of chaff 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.330
 inside we see here in my mind the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.940
 happiness that our rabbits have 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.630
 how many floors we have and the depth 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.940
 the one we are arriving 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.410
 he was in the room 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.410
 out then again we go back 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.209
 when we reach a high level of having 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.730
 many rabbits we have to do 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.650
 rounds of rest between them because if 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.220
 do not get tired and get angry and it's not going to 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.220
 Do nothing 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.440
 where he spent his time playing hooks to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.980
 me at least and well you know that 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.130
 I have 12 floors and you start with 1 so 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.130
 what 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.919
 why not try it also it's 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.169
 free so I think it's a game 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.590
 pretty good to at least give it a 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.590
 opportunity 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.100
 well so far the three games 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.540
 I bring you today for a sweet 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.490
 the three are free to leave in the
