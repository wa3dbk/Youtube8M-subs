2 and its little brother the samsung
galaxy<00:00:09.480> s3<00:00:09.630> which<00:00:10.080> also<00:00:10.260> launched<00:00:10.710> earlier

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
galaxy s3 which also launched earlier

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.820 
galaxy s3 which also launched earlier
this<00:00:11.280> year<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:12.300> as<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.510> can<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.080> s3<00:00:13.559> and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
this year so as you can see the s3 and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.950 
this year so as you can see the s3 and
we<00:00:14.099> node<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.370> follow<00:00:15.090> a<00:00:15.210> same<00:00:15.570> design

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
we node to follow a same design

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.170 
we node to follow a same design
principle<00:00:16.470> very<00:00:16.710> similar<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.790> see<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
principle very similar you can see the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.710 
principle very similar you can see the
bezel<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.840> white<00:00:19.110> chrome<00:00:20.420> finished<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
bezel the white chrome finished and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
bezel the white chrome finished and
everything<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.680> home<00:00:22.859> button<00:00:23.130> looks

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
everything and the home button looks

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.599 
everything and the home button looks
like<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> different<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.330> too<00:00:24.539> so

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
like a different on the not too so

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.580 
like a different on the not too so
screens<00:00:26.609> look<00:00:27.060> pretty<00:00:27.449> similar<00:00:27.630> were<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
screens look pretty similar were the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.000 
screens look pretty similar were the

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.940 
zero acs it's getting an update to jelly
beans<00:01:03.780> soon<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.260> software<00:01:07.260> story

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
beans soon so that's the software story

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.069 
beans soon so that's the software story
so<00:01:08.640> let's<00:01:08.789> go<00:01:08.939> back<00:01:08.969> to<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.390> hardware<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.930> get

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
so let's go back to the hardware we get

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.990 
so let's go back to the hardware we get
one<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.259> funny<00:01:13.560> water<00:01:14.219> our

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
one so so that's the funny water our

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.219 
one so so that's the funny water our
human<00:01:16.280> design<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.520> humans<00:01:18.020> coming<00:01:19.020> into

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
human design for humans coming into

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
human design for humans coming into
action<00:01:19.590> any<00:01:19.859> other<00:01:20.070> water<00:01:20.340> droplets<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
action any other water droplets and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.690 
action any other water droplets and
everything<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.049> each<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.189> every<00:01:23.310> time<00:01:23.429> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
everything so each and every time this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.190 
everything so each and every time this
comes<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.570> there's<00:01:24.869> water<00:01:25.079> leaking

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
comes up I think there's water leaking

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
comes up I think there's water leaking
somewhere<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.039> room<00:01:26.070> especially<00:01:26.789> we<00:01:27.149> have

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
somewhere in my room especially we have

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.789 
somewhere in my room especially we have
rings<00:01:27.750> over<00:01:28.109> here<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.500> part<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
rings over here in this part of the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
rings over here in this part of the
world<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:30.320> that's<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.090> galaxy<00:01:33.090> s<00:01:33.200> galaxy<00:01:34.200> note

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
world so that's the galaxy s galaxy note

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.279 
world so that's the galaxy s galaxy note
2<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> left<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> SP<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.630> so

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
2 on the left and the SP on the right so

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.609 
2 on the left and the SP on the right so
if<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.460> picked<00:01:38.700> them<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:39.289> in<00:01:40.289> s3

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
if you can see this picked them up in s3

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.310 
if you can see this picked them up in s3
which<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.789> felt<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> big<00:01:42.929> phone

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
which actually felt like a big phone

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.919 
which actually felt like a big phone
when<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> launched<00:01:44.520> feels<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> tiny<00:01:45.659> toy

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
when it launched feels like a tiny toy

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.690 
when it launched feels like a tiny toy
named<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.499> the<00:01:46.530> next<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.100> next<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> not

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
named to the next right next with a not

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
named to the next right next with a not
do<00:01:49.759> not<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.999> is<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.299> fast<00:01:51.869> pretty<00:01:52.319> fast

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
do not do is really fast pretty fast

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.200 
do not do is really fast pretty fast
actually<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.130> would<00:01:53.249> say<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.520> pretty<00:01:53.729> fast

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
actually I would say it's pretty fast

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.480 
actually I would say it's pretty fast
jicama<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:55.170> even<00:01:55.380> more<00:01:55.499> faster<00:01:55.890> than<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.130> s3

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
jicama it's even more faster than the s3

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.669 
jicama it's even more faster than the s3
in<00:01:56.999> terms<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> operation<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.499> like

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
in terms of operation but I really like

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.520 
in terms of operation but I really like
the<00:01:58.920> nine<00:01:59.130> size<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.179> st<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.719> lot<00:02:01.049> more<00:02:01.319> now

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the nine size of the st a lot more now

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.140 
the nine size of the st a lot more now
because<00:02:02.399> he<00:02:02.729> s

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
because he s

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.600 
because he s
the<00:02:03.540> node<00:02:03.690> 2<00:02:03.900> is<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.320> big<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:05.160> quick<00:02:05.460> look

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the node 2 is really big so quick look

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.340 
the node 2 is really big so quick look
at<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.760> Harbor<00:02:06.180> between<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.170> node

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
at the Harbor between the node

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.960 
at the Harbor between the node
comparison<00:02:08.070> between<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> node<00:02:08.490> 2<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.850> s3

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
comparison between the node 2 on the s3

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.810 
comparison between the node 2 on the s3
so<00:02:09.690> as<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:09.990> see<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.470> s3<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:10.979> pretty<00:02:11.580> small

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
so as you can see the s3 is pretty small

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.400 
so as you can see the s3 is pretty small
compared<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:13.050> node<00:02:13.620> 2<00:02:15.140> looks<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.380> a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
compared to the node 2 looks like a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.930 
compared to the node 2 looks like a
miniature<00:02:16.650> version<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> node<00:02:17.580> 2<00:02:17.760> right

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
miniature version of the node 2 right

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.970 
miniature version of the node 2 right
next<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> both<00:02:19.080> are<00:02:19.410> running<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> same

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
next to it both are running the same

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.360 
next to it both are running the same
TouchWiz<00:02:20.550> UI<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:22.950> terms<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
TouchWiz UI and so in terms of the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.000 
TouchWiz UI and so in terms of the
hardware<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.690> 5.5<00:02:25.380> inch<00:02:25.500> display<00:02:25.830> on

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
hardware you have a 5.5 inch display on

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.860 
hardware you have a 5.5 inch display on
the<00:02:26.130> galaxy<00:02:26.490> note<00:02:26.520> 2<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.180> four<00:02:27.510> point<00:02:27.780> eight

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the galaxy note 2 and a four point eight

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.540 
the galaxy note 2 and a four point eight
inch<00:02:28.080> display<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> galaxy<00:02:29.580> s3<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:31.550> pretty

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
inch display on the galaxy s3 and pretty

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.730 
inch display on the galaxy s3 and pretty
much<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.000> same<00:02:33.210> cameras<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.260> both<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.470> them

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
much the same cameras on both of them

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.000 
much the same cameras on both of them
you<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.900> 8<00:02:36.900> megapixel<00:02:36.930> camera<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.709> both<00:02:37.980> of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
you have a 8 megapixel camera on both of

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.490 
you have a 8 megapixel camera on both of
them<00:02:38.220> under<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> 2<00:02:38.970> megapixel<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> front

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
them under a 2 megapixel on the front

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.030 
them under a 2 megapixel on the front
facing<00:02:40.830> camera<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.360> these<00:02:43.040> you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
facing camera and you have these you

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.540 
facing camera and you have these you
have<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> home<00:02:44.459> button<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.910> bottom<00:02:46.550> so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
have the home button on the bottom so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.960 
have the home button on the bottom so
thats<00:02:47.820> also<00:02:48.150> used<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.540> multitasking<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.970> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
thats also used for multitasking so the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.610 
thats also used for multitasking so the
same<00:02:51.320> case<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:54.140> galaxy<00:02:55.140> note<00:02:55.290> 2<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
same case with the galaxy note 2 the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.650 
same case with the galaxy note 2 the
note<00:02:55.740> 2<00:02:55.920> runs<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:56.250> jellybean<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.480> have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
note 2 runs on jellybean so you have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.210 
note 2 runs on jellybean so you have
some<00:02:57.900> software<00:02:58.260> improvements<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> front

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
some software improvements in the front

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.510 
some software improvements in the front
you<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.520> task<00:02:59.820> manager<00:03:01.400> accessible<00:03:02.400> from

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
you have a task manager accessible from

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.750 
you have a task manager accessible from
here<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> pretty<00:03:03.209> similar<00:03:03.570> stuff<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.760> you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
here it's a pretty similar stuff so you

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.970 
here it's a pretty similar stuff so you
have<00:03:06.050> way<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.110> access<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.739> active

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
have way to access the active

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.560 
have way to access the active
applications<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.790> everything<00:03:09.120> right<00:03:09.390> from

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
applications and everything right from

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.320 
applications and everything right from
the<00:03:11.300> right<00:03:12.300> by<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> press<00:03:12.810> top<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.260> model<00:03:13.500> so

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
the right by a press top of a model so

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.229 
the right by a press top of a model so
just<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.660> pic<00:03:16.560> look<00:03:16.739> at<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> hardware<00:03:17.489> side

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
just the pic look at the hardware side

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.690 
just the pic look at the hardware side
of<00:03:18.420> things<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.989> front<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.400> sides

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
of things in the front so on the sides

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.840 
of things in the front so on the sides
you<00:03:21.239> have<00:03:21.480> pretty<00:03:22.170> much<00:03:22.290> very<00:03:23.160> similar<00:03:23.519> design

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
you have pretty much very similar design

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.460 
you have pretty much very similar design
the<00:03:24.540> node<00:03:25.200> 2<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.830> bit<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.750> block<00:03:27.750> form<00:03:28.110> factor

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the node 2 is a bit of block form factor

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.509 
the node 2 is a bit of block form factor
whereas<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.130> s-phase<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.550> bit<00:03:29.790> gooey<00:03:31.519> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
whereas the s-phase a bit gooey the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.610 
whereas the s-phase a bit gooey the
volume<00:03:32.820> keys<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.269> still<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.810> same<00:03:34.260> side

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
volume keys are still on the same side

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.640 
volume keys are still on the same side
and<00:03:35.239> on<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.420> left<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.590> right<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:38.670> have

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
and on the left so on the right you have

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.890 
and on the left so on the right you have
the<00:03:40.650> same

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
the same

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.720 
the same
you<00:03:42.110> have<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.470> power<00:03:42.650> lock<00:03:43.099> switch<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.579> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
you have the power lock switch on the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.080 
you have the power lock switch on the
right<00:03:45.129> so<00:03:46.129> on<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.340> bottom<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:46.760> have<00:03:46.790> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
right so on the bottom you have the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.259 
right so on the bottom you have the
micro<00:03:47.590> USB<00:03:48.590> important<00:03:49.189> interesting<00:03:49.909> thing<00:03:50.090> on

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
micro USB important interesting thing on

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.729 
micro USB important interesting thing on
the<00:03:50.420> nod<00:03:50.689> to<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:50.930> gives<00:03:51.349> you<00:03:51.439> have<00:03:51.560> the

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
the nod to that gives you have the

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.929 
the nod to that gives you have the
stylus<00:03:52.189> which<00:03:54.010> not<00:03:55.010> sure<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.489> works<00:03:55.700> with

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
stylus which not sure if it works with

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.410 
stylus which not sure if it works with
the<00:03:57.819> I<00:03:58.819> don't<00:03:59.599> think<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.140> would<00:04:00.290> work<00:04:00.319> with<00:04:00.650> the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the I don't think it would work with the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.660 
the I don't think it would work with the
s3<00:04:02.420> let's<00:04:02.780> give<00:04:03.079> it<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.200> try<00:04:03.349> that's<00:04:04.340> not<00:04:04.489> what

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
s3 let's give it a try that's not what

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.710 
s3 let's give it a try that's not what
whereas<00:04:05.359> it<00:04:05.569> does<00:04:05.780> work<00:04:06.049> on<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:07.989> one<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.480> is

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
whereas it does work on the one so it is

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.869 
whereas it does work on the one so it is
a<00:04:11.840> science<00:04:12.019> which<00:04:12.260> works<00:04:12.500> only<00:04:12.680> on<00:04:12.859> the<00:04:13.129> North

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
a science which works only on the North

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.620 
a science which works only on the North
family<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.799> devices<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.639> yeah<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.269> that's<00:04:17.449> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
family of devices so yeah so that's the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.199 
family of devices so yeah so that's the
huge<00:04:17.810> difference<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:19.010> apart<00:04:19.519> from<00:04:19.609> that<00:04:19.760> on

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
huge difference so apart from that on

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.620 
huge difference so apart from that on
the<00:04:20.359> back<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.989> have<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:22.300> speaker<00:04:23.300> grill<00:04:23.510> on

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
the back you have the speaker grill on

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.570 
the back you have the speaker grill on
the<00:04:23.660> top<00:04:24.020> on<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.350> HP<00:04:24.650> whereas<00:04:24.889> at<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.250> bottom

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
the top on the HP whereas at the bottom

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.050 
the top on the HP whereas at the bottom
on<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.110> node<00:04:27.110> two<00:04:27.350> other<00:04:28.340> big<00:04:28.580> difference<00:04:28.940> is

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
on the node two other big difference is

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.600 
on the node two other big difference is
a<00:04:29.090> battery<00:04:29.360> of<00:04:29.600> course<00:04:30.020> so<00:04:30.530> let's<00:04:31.039> open<00:04:31.250> up<00:04:31.460> the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
a battery of course so let's open up the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.140 
a battery of course so let's open up the
back<00:04:31.789> cover<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.300> i'll<00:04:33.260> show<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:34.150> battery

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
back cover and i'll show you the battery

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.999 
back cover and i'll show you the battery
strength<00:04:35.630> difference

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:47.699 

so<00:04:42.009> as<00:04:42.879> you<00:04:43.059> can<00:04:43.179> see<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:45.809> node<00:04:46.809> do<00:04:47.259> has<00:04:47.679> a

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:47.709 
so as you can see the node do has a

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:50.179 
so as you can see the node do has a
micro<00:04:48.159> SIM<00:04:48.339> card<00:04:48.579> tray<00:04:48.639> very<00:04:49.149> similar<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.629> the

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
micro SIM card tray very similar to the

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.059 
micro SIM card tray very similar to the
galaxy<00:04:51.189> s3<00:04:51.579> and<00:04:52.110> also<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.199> micro<00:04:53.469> SD<00:04:53.769> card

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
galaxy s3 and also the micro SD card

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.829 
galaxy s3 and also the micro SD card
slot<00:04:54.159> is<00:04:54.610> wrapped<00:04:54.909> so<00:04:55.029> the<00:04:55.209> arrangement<00:04:55.689> is

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:55.839 
slot is wrapped so the arrangement is

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:56.969 
slot is wrapped so the arrangement is
the<00:04:56.019> battery<00:04:56.319> on<00:04:56.409> the<00:04:56.529> top<00:04:56.709> and<00:04:56.889> the

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
the battery on the top and the

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.159 
the battery on the top and the
microwaves<00:04:57.399> and<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.729> trades<00:04:58.629> at<00:04:58.779> the<00:04:58.809> bottom

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
microwaves and the trades at the bottom

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.779 
microwaves and the trades at the bottom
of<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.379> SG<00:04:59.649> whereas<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.189> trays<00:05:00.489> are<00:05:00.639> on<00:05:00.699> the

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
of the SG whereas the trays are on the

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.549 
of the SG whereas the trays are on the
top<00:05:00.999> and<00:05:01.269> the<00:05:01.449> batteries<00:05:01.809> on<00:05:01.929> the<00:05:02.019> bottom<00:05:02.319> of

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:02.559 
top and the batteries on the bottom of

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.909 
top and the batteries on the bottom of
the<00:05:03.360> node<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:04.989> the<00:05:05.079> big<00:05:05.259> difference<00:05:05.559> here<00:05:05.709> is

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
the node so the big difference here is

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.699 
the node so the big difference here is
that<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.159> node<00:05:06.399> 2<00:05:06.729> has<00:05:07.059> a<00:05:07.349> 3100<00:05:08.349> mAh<00:05:08.679> battery

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:08.709 
that the node 2 has a 3100 mAh battery

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.149 
that the node 2 has a 3100 mAh battery
right<00:05:09.699> as<00:05:09.879> keynote<00:05:10.299> whereas<00:05:11.259> the<00:05:11.409> galaxy<00:05:11.799> s3

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
right as keynote whereas the galaxy s3

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.229 
right as keynote whereas the galaxy s3
has<00:05:12.369> just<00:05:12.999> thousand<00:05:16.259> for<00:05:17.259> 2,000<00:05:17.739> mAh<00:05:18.039> battery

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:18.239 
has just thousand for 2,000 mAh battery

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:22.139 
has just thousand for 2,000 mAh battery
so<00:05:19.619> not<00:05:20.619> sure<00:05:20.769> if<00:05:20.949> the<00:05:21.129> two<00:05:21.279> thousand<00:05:21.610> image<00:05:21.879> or

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:22.149 
so not sure if the two thousand image or

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:25.469 
so not sure if the two thousand image or
a<00:05:22.179> thousands<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:22.809> fifty<00:05:23.110> imaged<00:05:23.759> it's<00:05:24.759> a<00:05:24.939> 2000

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
a thousands and fifty imaged it's a 2000

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.929 
a thousands and fifty imaged it's a 2000
2100<00:05:26.439> mAh<00:05:26.860> battery<00:05:27.029> so<00:05:28.619> that's<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:30.729> main

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939 
2100 mAh battery so that's the main

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.309 
2100 mAh battery so that's the main
difference<00:05:30.969> between<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.749> two<00:05:31.929> but<00:05:32.169> i'm

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
difference between the two but i'm

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.899 
difference between the two but i'm
pretty<00:05:32.529> much<00:05:32.649> impressed<00:05:33.099> with<00:05:33.279> the<00:05:33.399> battery

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
pretty much impressed with the battery

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.179 
pretty much impressed with the battery
life<00:05:34.029> of<00:05:34.269> the<00:05:34.539> galaxy<00:05:35.169> s<00:05:35.319> three<00:05:35.559> as<00:05:35.589> well<00:05:35.860> so<00:05:36.159> i

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 
life of the galaxy s three as well so i

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.469 
life of the galaxy s three as well so i
don't<00:05:36.429> think<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.669> should<00:05:36.789> be<00:05:36.819> a<00:05:36.909> big<00:05:37.149> problem

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
don't think it should be a big problem

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.989 
don't think it should be a big problem
so<00:05:38.469> that's<00:05:38.939> the<00:05:39.939> quick<00:05:40.299> look<00:05:40.509> at<00:05:40.689> the<00:05:41.639> rear<00:05:42.639> of

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:42.999 
so that's the quick look at the rear of

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:48.239 
so that's the quick look at the rear of
the<00:05:43.209> both<00:05:43.959> the<00:05:43.989> devices<00:05:44.849> so<00:05:45.849> the<00:05:46.479> new<00:05:47.249> metal

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:48.249 
the both the devices so the new metal

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:51.239 
the both the devices so the new metal
portion<00:05:48.879> on<00:05:49.179> the<00:05:49.209> back<00:05:49.839> think<00:05:50.679> it's<00:05:50.829> probably

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:51.249 
portion on the back think it's probably

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:57.899 
portion on the back think it's probably
for<00:05:51.819> the<00:05:51.899> slightest<00:05:55.800> so<00:05:56.800> that<00:05:57.369> was<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.639> quick

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
for the slightest so that was a quick

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.479 
for the slightest so that was a quick
comparison<00:05:58.300> between<00:05:58.809> the<00:05:59.019> galaxy<00:05:59.649> note<00:05:59.679> 2<00:06:00.309> in

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:00.489 
comparison between the galaxy note 2 in

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:03.959 
comparison between the galaxy note 2 in
the<00:06:00.610> galaxy<00:06:01.029> s3<00:06:01.409> the<00:06:02.409> two<00:06:02.589> thousand<00:06:03.069> flagship

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
the galaxy s3 the two thousand flagship

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.049 
the galaxy s3 the two thousand flagship
devices<00:06:04.239> from<00:06:04.649> samsung<00:06:05.649> so<00:06:07.649> if<00:06:08.649> you<00:06:08.889> are<00:06:09.819> using

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:10.059 
devices from samsung so if you are using

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.850 
devices from samsung so if you are using
a<00:06:10.239> galaxy<00:06:10.689> s2<00:06:10.839> still<00:06:11.319> you<00:06:11.589> should<00:06:11.709> probably

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
a galaxy s2 still you should probably

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.909 
a galaxy s2 still you should probably
upgrade<00:06:12.369> to<00:06:12.519> an<00:06:12.639> s3<00:06:12.879> or<00:06:12.969> not<00:06:13.419> to<00:06:14.049> or<00:06:14.409> if<00:06:14.769> you're

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
upgrade to an s3 or not to or if you're

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.609 
upgrade to an s3 or not to or if you're
still<00:06:15.039> using<00:06:15.099> the<00:06:15.610> original<00:06:15.939> note<00:06:16.869> one<00:06:17.289> you

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:17.619 
still using the original note one you

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:21.239 
still using the original note one you
should<00:06:17.829> probably<00:06:19.499> would<00:06:20.499> be<00:06:20.709> interested<00:06:21.159> in

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:21.249 
should probably would be interested in

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.069 
should probably would be interested in
the<00:06:21.369> note<00:06:21.549> one<00:06:21.879> or<00:06:22.179> you<00:06:22.689> would<00:06:22.779> be<00:06:22.899> probably

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:23.079 
the note one or you would be probably

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:24.869 
the note one or you would be probably
just<00:06:23.319> in<00:06:23.409> the<00:06:23.439> node<00:06:23.649> 2<00:06:23.919> or<00:06:24.459> if<00:06:24.579> you<00:06:24.669> want<00:06:24.819> a

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
just in the node 2 or if you want a

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.069 
just in the node 2 or if you want a
smaller<00:06:25.179> device<00:06:25.329> you<00:06:25.629> should<00:06:25.749> probably

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:26.079 
smaller device you should probably

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.209 
smaller device you should probably
consider<00:06:26.409> the<00:06:27.419> not<00:06:28.419> the<00:06:28.989> s3<00:06:29.349> or<00:06:29.559> if<00:06:30.069> you're

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219 
consider the not the s3 or if you're

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.069 
consider the not the s3 or if you're
looking<00:06:30.459> at<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.669> change<00:06:31.119> of<00:06:31.360> platforms<00:06:31.929> you

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:32.079 
looking at a change of platforms you

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:32.999 
looking at a change of platforms you
want<00:06:32.229> to<00:06:32.319> go<00:06:32.439> the

iphone<00:06:33.729> side<00:06:33.939> of<00:06:34.059> things<00:06:34.240> then<00:06:34.539> probably<00:06:34.809> you

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
iphone side of things then probably you

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.070 
iphone side of things then probably you
should<00:06:35.020> look<00:06:35.259> at<00:06:35.439> the<00:06:35.619> iphone<00:06:36.369> 5<00:06:37.029> or<00:06:37.419> if<00:06:37.990> you

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
should look at the iphone 5 or if you

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.629 
should look at the iphone 5 or if you
