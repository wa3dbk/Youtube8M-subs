 m 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.730
 whoever is causing him 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.529
 the honorary president jacques 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.509
 lottery of the friendly lay of valence-d'agen welcome from 1 to 3 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.520
 July 2011 the French Championships in speed skating on track near 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.250
 500 skaters of the most fervent to the Lord were present for 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.430
 compete in one of the approximately 180 trophies awarded in total six specialties 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.770
 poorer a bit like in cycling or athletics the specialties of 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.820
 sprint speed with the 360 ​​millimeters a background specialty 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 with the races to point to elimination and the American 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.410
 I wish it's going to happen in the standings thanks to the help comes to 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.660
 to stay in the water is shameful 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.800
 and it's very strategic for me what I prefer 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.850
 other about sprint races 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.350
 because I simply always had a hard time staying focused 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 very long port-to-prince if they have preferences the majority of 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.040
 skaters take the start of all the specialties 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.740
 but it is true that each requires technical physical qualities and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.540
 very different tactics 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.810
 starting with speed specialties 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.940
 obviously it takes qualities to sprinter qualities of waves of 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.930
 muscle fibers exposed his session of the beautiful physical qualities 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.020
 % then 7 very technical actually not what do we do it 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.470
 no time to think too much about what we are going to do we need to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.070
 decisions very quickly even a good decision that is taking ricardo 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.370
 have too late it's 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.999
 it's the race you lose among the long distance races 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.999
 motlaq for his faith is unanimously recognized as the most difficult 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.540
 both extremely hard physically with sprints every two rounds 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.000
 for assigning points to the first two but also very tactical 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.369
 with a bit of experience we get to know a little bit what are the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.850
 runners who are not going to ask you hours 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.990
 which are the runners who go alone who will rather make tests from 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.460
 the beginning we were escaping so leave for many who confronted their 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 points count on the equation waiting for the finish and from there we'll 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.390
 decide for what I attack I do what I am someone or what I 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.319
 do my race - tactical and the elimination race is also less 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.979
 physical 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.319
 provided that he succeeds in keeping his place in the top five as soon as 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.059
 departure 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.939
 finally the American race dana vollmer played by teams of three 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.069
 it's just the most spectacular specialty the skaters get 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.459
 passing the baton at châteaubourg france no longer organize a race that 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.049
 will see what is going very very fast now what's on 3 km 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.169
 the part of the turn of the aude of observation time 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.469
 and then after 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:39.829
 the bottom 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.829
 showed great technical skills of agility 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.560
 I do not care about being 2002 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.459

 two international competitions in which France intends to shine 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.379
 for the Japanese 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.379
 since four European titles among seniors 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.399
 it is clear the levels of the loads of the world championships it is necessary to aim at the 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.709
 title maurel &amp; prom on is able to make a small capital is the answer 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.049

 of the world so have won a gold medal title even if we know 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.609
 that it will be hard because my soul and conscience in its stadium before us

 and after I tried I put all the forces of the NATO are the 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.759
