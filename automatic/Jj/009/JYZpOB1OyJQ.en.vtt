reconfiguring the look and feel of both
your<00:00:04.500> driver<00:00:04.740> information<00:00:05.400> system<00:00:05.790> and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
your driver information system and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.909 
your driver information system and
you're<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:06.569> vehicle<00:00:06.960> infotainment<00:00:07.200> system<00:00:07.830> in

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
you're in vehicle infotainment system in

you're in vehicle infotainment system in
your<00:00:08.010> vehicle<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:09.420> we've<00:00:09.570> done<00:00:09.750> is

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
your vehicle and what we've done is

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.370 
your vehicle and what we've done is
we've<00:00:10.170> essentially<00:00:10.530> taken<00:00:10.950> our<00:00:11.190> k1<00:00:11.790> device<00:00:12.630> we

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
we've essentially taken our k1 device we

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.250 
we've essentially taken our k1 device we
have<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:13.769> behind<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.240> cluster<00:00:15.630> here

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
have one behind the the cluster here

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.710 
have one behind the the cluster here
that's<00:00:16.800> rendering<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:17.640> nice<00:00:17.760> 1920<00:00:18.600> x

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
that's rendering this really nice 1920 x

that's rendering this really nice 1920 x
720<00:00:19.289> resolution<00:00:19.320> panel<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.369> then<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
720 resolution panel and then we have a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.720 
720 resolution panel and then we have a
second<00:00:21.660> k<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.050> device<00:00:22.350> that's<00:00:22.980> down<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.490> on

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
second k one device that's down here on

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.179 
second k one device that's down here on
our<00:00:23.910> tablet<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.650> running<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
our tablet and this is running a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.189 
our tablet and this is running a
configuration<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.390> essentially<00:00:27.900> allows

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
configuration that essentially allows

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.710 
configuration that essentially allows
you<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> pick<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.789> physical<00:00:30.090> materials

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
you to pick it the physical materials

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.380 
you to pick it the physical materials
that<00:00:30.960> will<00:00:31.050> become<00:00:31.199> part<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.340> gauge<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that will become part of the gauge that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
that will become part of the gauge that
is<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:34.649> question<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
is actually up here in your question is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.490 
is actually up here in your question is
the<00:00:35.130> idea<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.960> owner<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the idea that the the the owner of the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
the idea that the the the owner of the
car<00:00:37.710> would<00:00:37.890> kind<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.250> change<00:00:38.579> stuff<00:00:38.850> yes

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
car would kind of like change stuff yes

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.479 
car would kind of like change stuff yes
is<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> manufacturer<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> car

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
is it for the manufacturer of the car

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.549 
is it for the manufacturer of the car
who's<00:00:41.850> using<00:00:42.329> estus<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> idea<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.290> really

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
who's using estus so the idea is really

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
who's using estus so the idea is really
both<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.760> first<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.059> foremost<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
both so so first and foremost it's the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.950 
both so so first and foremost it's the
way<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.350> us<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.950> give<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> methodology<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> OEMs

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
way for us to give a methodology to OEMs

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
way for us to give a methodology to OEMs
to<00:00:49.140> customize<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.070> actual<00:00:50.370> look<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.640> feel<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to customize the actual look and feel of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
to customize the actual look and feel of
their<00:00:51.000> vehicles<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.570> define<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.739> sort

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
their vehicles and define you know sort

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.619 
their vehicles and define you know sort
of<00:00:53.010> custom<00:00:53.489> presets<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
of custom presets you know for the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
of custom presets you know for the
particular<00:00:54.989> types<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.920> vehicles<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.399> they

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
particular types of vehicles that they

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.639 
particular types of vehicles that they
might<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.420> second<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.020> potentially<00:00:58.590> in

look<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.600> feel<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.869> your<00:01:45.020> car<00:01:45.440> prior<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.040> it

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
look and feel of your car prior to it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.740 
look and feel of your car prior to it
even<00:01:46.460> being<00:01:46.759> built<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.299> you<00:01:47.390> could<00:01:47.509> really

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
even being built so you could really

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.390 
even being built so you could really
physically<00:01:48.170> see<00:01:48.409> what<00:01:48.619> these<00:01:48.770> materials

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
physically see what these materials

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.450 
physically see what these materials
might<00:01:49.580> look<00:01:49.790> like<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:50.420> head<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.869> time<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.130> for

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
might look like a head of time so as for

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.340 
might look like a head of time so as for
sales<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.509> for<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:56.270> security<00:01:56.930> listen

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
sales it's for is this security listen

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.460 
sales it's for is this security listen
it<00:01:57.710> being<00:01:58.040> real<00:01:58.600> compared<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.899> being<00:02:00.080> that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
it being real compared to it being that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.460 
it being real compared to it being that
 diem<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.729> more<00:02:01.909> secure<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.479> I

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
 diem is a more secure and I

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.810 
 diem is a more secure and I
don't<00:02:03.770> know<00:02:03.830> what<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.100> even<00:02:04.340> more<00:02:04.490> secret

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
don't know what you even more secret

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.340 
don't know what you even more secret
don't<00:02:04.970> get<00:02:05.119> confused<00:02:05.479> by<00:02:05.899> something<00:02:06.170> that

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
don't get confused by something that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.639 
don't get confused by something that
might<00:02:06.619> not<00:02:07.179> so<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.869> yes<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.410> from<00:02:09.500> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
might not so so yes so from a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.020 
might not so so yes so from a
visualization<00:02:10.250> standpoint<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.000> know

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
visualization standpoint you know

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.720 
visualization standpoint you know
displays<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.170> vehicles<00:02:12.709> are<00:02:12.920> becoming<00:02:13.459> more

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
displays in vehicles are becoming more

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.729 
displays in vehicles are becoming more
and<00:02:13.910> more<00:02:14.150> present<00:02:14.870> right<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.410> you're<00:02:15.530> seeing

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
and more present right so you're seeing

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.130 
and more present right so you're seeing
the<00:02:16.430> size<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.150> resolution<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.780> panels

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the size and resolution of panels

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.340 
the size and resolution of panels
included<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.100> vehicles<00:02:19.459> today<00:02:19.640> growing<00:02:20.350> and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
included in vehicles today growing and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.710 
included in vehicles today growing and
the<00:02:22.280> need<00:02:22.640> for<00:02:22.970> creating<00:02:23.450> more

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
the need for creating more

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.930 
the need for creating more
photorealistic<00:02:24.190> content<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.310> those<00:02:25.489> displays

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
photorealistic content on those displays

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300 
photorealistic content on those displays
has<00:02:26.510> been<00:02:26.720> what's<00:02:26.900> driving<00:02:27.200> us<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.769> really<00:02:28.069> do

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
has been what's driving us to really do

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.430 
has been what's driving us to really do
this<00:02:28.489> there<00:02:29.269> is<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> notion<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.080> basically

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
this there is a notion that basically

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.050 
this there is a notion that basically
says<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.769> if<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.130> make<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.610> more

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
says that if you make this more

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.630 
says that if you make this more
photorealistic<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:33.350> becomes<00:02:34.069> something<00:02:34.280> that

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
photorealistic it becomes something that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.880 
photorealistic it becomes something that
could<00:02:34.819> be<00:02:34.850> considered<00:02:35.450> more<00:02:35.780> glanceable<00:02:36.380> so

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
could be considered more glanceable so

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.620 
could be considered more glanceable so
essentially<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> notion<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.360> looks

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
essentially the notion is that it looks

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.390 
essentially the notion is that it looks
like<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> real<00:02:39.140> accurate<00:02:39.410> material<00:02:40.190> or<00:02:40.340> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
like a real accurate material or it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800 
like a real accurate material or it
looks<00:02:40.579> like<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> real<00:02:40.970> physically<00:02:41.450> rendered

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
looks like a real physically rendered

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.680 
looks like a real physically rendered
part<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.799> then<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.280> easier<00:02:44.060> for<00:02:44.269> our<00:02:44.390> brains

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
part that then is easier for our brains

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.960 
part that then is easier for our brains
to<00:02:44.900> actually<00:02:45.350> interpret<00:02:45.739> which<00:02:46.519> means<00:02:46.820> that

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
to actually interpret which means that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.940 
to actually interpret which means that
it<00:02:47.269> is<00:02:47.420> something<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.200> potentially<00:02:48.440> could

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
it is something that potentially could

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.460 
it is something that potentially could
make<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.900> easier<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.110> us<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.200> really

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
make it easier for us to really

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.360 
make it easier for us to really
cognitively<00:02:52.190> understand

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
cognitively understand

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.550 
cognitively understand
and<00:02:53.909> I'm<00:02:54.030> gonna<00:02:54.390> have<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.629> get<00:02:54.750> distracted<00:02:54.959> me

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and I'm gonna have to get distracted me

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.649 
and I'm gonna have to get distracted me
correct<00:02:56.250> attention<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.239> could<00:02:57.360> draw<00:02:57.510> that

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
correct attention you could draw that

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.690 
correct attention you could draw that
conclusion<00:02:57.810> right<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.459> idea<00:02:59.670> that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
conclusion right and is the idea that

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.850 
conclusion right and is the idea that
there's<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.090> k1<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.409> came<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.650> there

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
there's a k1 here and it came on there

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.740 
there's a k1 here and it came on there
or<00:03:01.890> both<00:03:02.220> running<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.819> same<00:03:02.970> k<00:03:03.180> 1<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.599> right

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
or both running the same k 1 all right

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.509 
or both running the same k 1 all right
so<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> idea<00:03:04.319> right<00:03:04.709> now<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.250> there's<00:03:05.459> a

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
so the idea right now is that there's a

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.339 
so the idea right now is that there's a
key<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.299> your<00:03:06.480> cluster<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.170> there's

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
key one in your cluster and that there's

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.430 
key one in your cluster and that there's
a<00:03:07.409> k1<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.190> broadened<00:03:08.549> device<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.440> two

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
a k1 in your broadened device and two

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.229 
a k1 in your broadened device and two
separate<00:03:10.829> devices<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.579> could<00:03:11.730> use<00:03:11.879> any<00:03:12.060> other

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
separate devices you could use any other

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.369 
separate devices you could use any other
phone<00:03:12.540> maybe<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.959> remotely<00:03:13.379> access<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.310> k1

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
phone maybe and remotely access the k1

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.750 
phone maybe and remotely access the k1
engine<00:03:16.379> in<00:03:16.530> your<00:03:16.560> car<00:03:16.680> or<00:03:16.860> that's<00:03:17.489> another

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
engine in your car or that's another

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.989 
engine in your car or that's another
idea<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.390> another<00:03:18.599> idea
