00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:23.919

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.189

 Trying to tell you how to make this it's jazz-ish a certain page 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.910
 It is a story 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.090
 So this is already followed the last time and why suddenly I introduce confirmation or confirmation of Ponson 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.090
 Let's go 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.530
 The last time assuming so-called c major 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:53.050
 It is real is it, but it was a story that put a major 7 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:56.500
 The other chords of the player or a Well bassist in the case of jazz 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:02.010
 I'm holding down from the large resistance route who 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.299

 Even though I had entered as it is the root put the sound of Nante God Otone When you sleep major 7 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 It is Doi's but this Sonomanma 9 cun 0 I

 Doing arpeggio in accordance with N Uson to udono station c major steal major chord 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.360
 I turned to the sound of the boot purposely 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.110
 It is common to say that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.350
 So I abolish it and sell it 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.320
 After the cat 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.340

 And the finger changes and with the index finger 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:14.450
 The 5th fret of the string and the 8 pet stern fingers of the finger are reduced to the same with the little finger changed into a forefinger 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.460
 Look at the 7th fret with your finger 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.610
