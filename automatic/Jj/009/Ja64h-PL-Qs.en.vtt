00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.320
 he usually scared another chapter 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.390
 last days you'll be scared 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.000
 because I do not know if you 've seen it but it's 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.339
 that is up to a second the skin would be 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.699
 of steve and has changed suddenly to mine 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:24.490
 I mean, I got a shock from the ciborium 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:28.910
 therefore good that I bring today we 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:33.670
 put here I bring you three mod in one 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.670
 in initial version change 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.250
 for good 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.710
 I bring you 3 bikes in 1 to start 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.070
 tell him it 's two bikes are for 1.7 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.810
 points and they need Jorge so if 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.780
 you want to use them you know what it should be 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.210
 install because and drag these to the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.960
 motorcycle folder on the other hand this mode 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.320
 you need a universal core that is called 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.780
 fsp kr s anyway you will have it in 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.900
 the description since on the page 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.320
 minecraft forum comes all this well 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.850
 we start first as you see above what 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.670
 what you play is falling and it will not sound 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.310
 quite that if you have this that weird is 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.380
 this is war stringel not good you have 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.869
 there an indicator that is from the mod 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.369
 direction hub is pretty good because 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:34.540
 it indicates us north northeast east southeast 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.280
 south and west and it is logically 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.040
 pretty good since it had happened to me 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.650
 many times of what I say I will go towards 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.659
 North is here with rats and 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.659
 north and that you have to dodge something 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.760
 you do not know if he 's going to 2 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.400
 of gold 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.400
 many people fuck 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.680
 Many people are guided by the sun but I 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.900
 I am very useless for that and good for 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 people like me this mod is pretty 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.770
 okay but it's the address 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.770
 the following is what you see 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.470
 the next what you see at the corner 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:25.030
 lower left gives a wolf in the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.030
 darkness that is love been that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.709
 indicates the skill height of the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.380
 objects that I have equipped in this case 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.990
 the armor the diamond armor me 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.110
 kisses and by you see the helmet the boots and 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.720
 it's good now they're full because no 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.160
 I'm doing nothing shit did not come no 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.989
 I'm doing the formula there is not the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.360
 sword has already been spent a little 558 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.680
 it's pretty good because many times a 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.680
 I happened to be looking 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.890
 ending and suddenly use the de of 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.470
 iron for nonsense 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.870
 and ends up breaking which is a pain in the ass 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.600
 instead we see here how much is and if 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 Then she's very pretty. Wait, let's go 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.569
 to save it because it's going to break but 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.330
 you can do another but imagine that 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.570
 is delighted and think that it will hold 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.200
 to break that diamond block and 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.050
 it turns out that it's not a bit annoying 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.060
 true and also for the arrows is 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.120
 to the component because this indicates the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.489
 durability of the arch and the durability of 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.550
 the arrows that you have in the inventory 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.400
 I do not know how it will work with your infinity 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.190
 mouth will not mark the arrows that have the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.590
 inventory anyway and it 's cool 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.019
 because they are made the envelope mola a 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.510
 I think that these things should 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.390
 be that will never be but should 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.110
 be in full minecraft be 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.660
 minecraft vanilla is not too broken 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.700
 but hey it's interesting we have there 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.180
 meters be you will imagine that I 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.160
 right now I jump here 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.470
 the falls not because I'm seeing 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.480
 but they are going to imagine that I have little left 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.460
 for the breastplate for better take it off and 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.270
 repair it before they break if it is 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.210
 a good way to see how it goes without having 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.420
 to be giving ft ch or a sheep 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.700
 brown out journalist you have 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.860
 bodyguards will not save you good 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.800
 let's go for the next one the next one is 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.220
 how is it called for status 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.920
 efe that is the one that indicates stress of 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.750
 force boom you see there on the right that 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.030
 puts strength and I stay a minute 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.290
 strength is fine because many times 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.990
 especially with the position of 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.870
 resistance to fire that they imagine we are 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.600
 in the middle with our little resistance 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.820
 to fire and we have realized that 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.970
 we have finished with this 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.850
 because we do not have visibly there is not 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.850
 typical that it completely breaks you 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.280
 maikel this simply is therefore with the 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.530
 clueless humor to confuse us for 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.849
 people like me also tell you the 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.300
 negative by visual 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:25.740
 position quickly but we have 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:29.999
 slowness is all done at speed and 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.339
 they cancel each other too 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:35.849
 indicates the legs of the birds 3 108 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:39.119
 192 potato doing the right thing quite 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.770
 well and everything that I have walked 

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:45.370
 gone hungry are you that I know I'm 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:48.310
 on facebook I knew with him like that 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.380
 and these are the three votes that came to 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.510
 teaching you is one thing that to me 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57.420
 I particularly like it very much 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.060
 and what was said and I do not think that many people 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.720
 will interest you, I will use it in some 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.720
 what another series 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.010
 what happens is that I series are 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:13.790
 Stop 1.6 points 5.4 and watch for 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.350
 1.7 points good up to here the meeting 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.139

 like these favorite lady videos 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.950
 leave a comment 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.230

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.450
 you need to install this are in 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.580

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.820
 part macarÃ¡ force and see you in 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.150

 two
