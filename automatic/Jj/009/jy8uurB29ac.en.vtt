speaking<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.080> pincer<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.740> that's<00:00:22.919> one

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
speaking about pincer I think that's one

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.829 
speaking about pincer I think that's one
of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> best<00:00:23.460> meg<00:00:23.669> is<00:00:23.759> available<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.779> now

being a thunder wave square set but

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.920 
being a thunder wave square set but
fortunately<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.640> me<00:00:41.670> he's<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.060> support<00:00:42.750> set

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

fortunately for me he's the support set
with<00:00:43.080> reflect<00:00:43.530> light<00:00:43.620> screen<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.220> maybe<00:00:44.340> a

with reflect light screen and maybe a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090 
with reflect light screen and maybe a
couple<00:00:44.610> other<00:00:44.880> moves<00:00:45.500> if<00:00:46.500> he<00:00:46.650> did<00:00:46.830> have<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
couple other moves if he did have the

couple other moves if he did have the
magico<00:00:47.460> didn't<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.480> bother<00:00:48.600> me<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.900> much

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.440

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
lot better than Moultrie says obviously

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.260 
lot better than Moultrie says obviously
so<00:01:14.219> I'm<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.429> gonna<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> Dragon<00:01:15.149> Claw

be<00:01:17.159> able<00:01:17.219> to<00:01:17.369> take<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.789> substitute<00:01:18.299> so

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
be able to take it with a substitute so

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
believe that a mega Gardevoir could be

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.129 
believe that a mega Gardevoir could be
able<00:01:43.859> to<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.130> i'm<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.579> too<00:01:44.789> sure<00:01:45.139> my

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
able to take it i'm not too sure my

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.989 
able to take it i'm not too sure my
guard<00:01:46.469> wars<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.829> defensive<00:01:47.549> boost<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
guard wars a defensive boost that it

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.940 
guard wars a defensive boost that it
could<00:01:48.179> get<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.569> I<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.590> confident

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
could get but I was pretty confident

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.289 
could get but I was pretty confident
that<00:01:50.039> I<00:01:50.159> would<00:01:50.639> be<00:01:50.729> able<00:01:50.789> to<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:50.999> it<00:01:51.090> out<00:01:51.179> with

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that I would be able to take it out with

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.179 
that I would be able to take it out with
another<00:01:51.450> iron<00:01:51.719> it<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.469> now<00:01:52.679> he<00:01:52.740> goes<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
another iron it so now he goes out to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.590 
another iron it so now he goes out to
his<00:01:53.280> greninja<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> biggest<00:01:54.240> starts<00:01:54.539> to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
his greninja one the biggest starts to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.569 
his greninja one the biggest starts to
my<00:01:54.689> team<00:01:54.929> so<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.619> my<00:01:56.039> plan<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.429> go

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
out to star me I could go out to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
out to star me I could go out to
tyranitar<00:01:58.679> but<00:01:58.859> if<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.340> pretty<00:01:59.639> sure<00:01:59.759> that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
tyranitar but if I'm pretty sure that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.340 
tyranitar but if I'm pretty sure that
he's<00:01:59.939> gonna<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> ice<00:02:00.539> cream<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.959> if

trinitron<00:03:04.160> was<00:03:04.280> not<00:03:04.460> too<00:03:04.640> important<00:03:05.090> on<00:03:05.150> my

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
trinitron was not too important on my

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.080 
trinitron was not too important on my
team<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.200> did<00:03:06.410> get<00:03:06.590> some<00:03:06.860> damage<00:03:07.820> on<00:03:07.910> my

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
team but I did get some damage on my

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.120 
team but I did get some damage on my
star<00:03:08.360> me<00:03:08.510> which<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.780> did<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:08.960> like<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.500> really

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
star me which I did not like I really

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.470 
star me which I did not like I really
wish<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.370> would<00:03:10.550> have<00:03:10.580> just<00:03:10.700> sag<00:03:11.000> trying<00:03:11.300> to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
wish I would have just sag trying to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.670 
wish I would have just sag trying to
instead<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.870> taking<00:03:12.140> taking<00:03:12.500> damage

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
instead of taking taking damage

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.770 
instead of taking taking damage
obviously<00:03:13.190> from<00:03:13.340> my<00:03:13.430> star<00:03:13.670> me<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.420> now<00:03:14.690> I'm

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
obviously from my star me but now I'm

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.420 
obviously from my star me but now I'm
gonna<00:03:14.900> be<00:03:15.080> able<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.410> go<00:03:15.530> out<00:03:15.650> into<00:03:15.680> my<00:03:16.040> Pinter

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
gonna be able to go out into my Pinter

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.280 
gonna be able to go out into my Pinter
and<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:17.060> fire<00:03:17.240> off<00:03:17.270> a<00:03:17.570> coke<00:03:17.810> attack<00:03:18.050> with<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
and just fire off a coke attack with the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.930 
and just fire off a coke attack with the
area<00:03:18.650> late<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.010> was<00:03:19.160> really<00:03:19.370> hoping<00:03:19.490> that<00:03:19.760> he

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
area late I was really hoping that he

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.790 
area late I was really hoping that he
could<00:03:20.090> stay<00:03:20.270> in<00:03:20.300> doesn't<00:03:21.170> really<00:03:21.290> have<00:03:21.440> a

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
could stay in doesn't really have a

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.880 
could stay in doesn't really have a
switching<00:03:22.490> to<00:03:22.730> pincer<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.560> pretty<00:03:24.710> good

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
switching to pincer so it's pretty good

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.610 
switching to pincer so it's pretty good
that<00:03:25.130> he<00:03:25.370> went<00:03:25.850> out<00:03:25.970> into<00:03:26.210> his<00:03:26.750> or<00:03:27.290> he<00:03:27.470> just

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
that he went out into his or he just

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.720 
that he went out into his or he just
stayed<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:27.950> with<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.160> screen<00:03:28.340> user<00:03:28.520> because

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
stayed in with the screen user because

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.830 
stayed in with the screen user because
that's<00:03:28.880> when<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.120> biggest<00:03:29.360> hurts<00:03:29.480> my<00:03:29.660> team

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
that's when the biggest hurts my team

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.600 
that's when the biggest hurts my team
gone<00:03:30.050> generally<00:03:30.920> had<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.130> worry<00:03:31.310> about<00:03:31.400> that

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
gone generally had to worry about that

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.780 
gone generally had to worry about that
anymore<00:03:32.110> so<00:03:33.110> greineder<00:03:33.740> goes<00:03:33.920> down<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.430> he's

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
anymore so greineder goes down and he's

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.670 
anymore so greineder goes down and he's
gonna<00:03:34.940> go<00:03:35.150> out<00:03:35.270> into<00:03:35.630> his<00:03:35.810> gengar<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.290> believe

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.450 
gonna go out into his gengar I believe
after<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.190> turn<00:03:37.490> and<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:39.590> pretty<00:03:39.980> confident

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
that I should be able to take Eddie hit

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.740 
that I should be able to take Eddie hit
from<00:03:42.320> his<00:03:42.500> gengar<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:43.910> am<00:03:44.090> just<00:03:44.120> gonna<00:03:44.450> go

from his gengar so I am just gonna go
for<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:46.060> d<00:03:47.060> return<00:03:47.240> as<00:03:47.690> he<00:03:47.810> switches<00:03:48.050> out

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
for the d return as he switches out

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.250 
for the d return as he switches out
double<00:03:48.710> switches<00:03:49.040> into<00:03:49.280> klefki<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:50.090> as<00:03:51.050> you

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
double switches into klefki and as you

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.530 
double switches into klefki and as you
can<00:03:51.350> see<00:03:51.380> right<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:51.950> here<00:03:52.310> my<00:03:52.700> penser<00:03:53.150> really

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
can see right here here my penser really

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.560 
can see right here here my penser really
just<00:03:53.750> not<00:03:53.900> like<00:03:54.170> me<00:03:55.210> haven't<00:03:56.210> had<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.420> best

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
just not like me haven't had the best

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.570 
just not like me haven't had the best
experience<00:03:56.720> with<00:03:57.170> my<00:03:57.320> pincer<00:03:57.680> let<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.430> fade<00:03:58.550> a

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
experience with my pincer let it fade a

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.130 
experience with my pincer let it fade a
couple<00:03:58.880> times<00:03:59.030> while<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.390> was<00:03:59.480> he<00:03:59.690> be<00:03:59.810> training

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
couple times while I was he be training

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.070 
couple times while I was he be training
it<00:04:00.260> but<00:04:00.530> oh<00:04:00.760> well<00:04:01.760> doesn't<00:04:02.570> like<00:04:02.840> me<00:04:03.020> it

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
it but oh well doesn't like me it

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.500 
it but oh well doesn't like me it
doesn't<00:04:03.350> like<00:04:03.500> me<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.150> return<00:04:05.150> obviously

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
doesn't like me so return obviously

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.530 
doesn't like me so return obviously
doesn't<00:04:05.810> do<00:04:05.870> too<00:04:05.990> much<00:04:06.020> damage<00:04:06.200> because<00:04:06.470> I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
doesn't do too much damage because I

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.420 
doesn't do too much damage because I
didn't<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.960> proper<00:04:09.470> bond<00:04:09.770> with<00:04:09.950> my<00:04:10.070> pincer

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
didn't have a proper bond with my pincer

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.250 
didn't have a proper bond with my pincer
so<00:04:10.910> I'm<00:04:10.970> gonna<00:04:11.090> switch<00:04:11.300> out<00:04:11.420> into<00:04:11.750> Cal<00:04:12.080> do

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
so I'm gonna switch out into Cal do

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.680 
so I'm gonna switch out into Cal do
because<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.860> wanted<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:13.940> go<00:04:14.060> for<00:04:14.240> this<00:04:14.360> or<00:04:14.540> i'm

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
because I wanted to go for this or i'm

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.390 
because I wanted to go for this or i'm
pretty<00:04:14.990> sure<00:04:15.200> that<00:04:15.230> i<00:04:15.440> guard<00:04:16.010> squad<00:04:16.160> could<00:04:16.250> not

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
pretty sure that i guard squad could not

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.789 
pretty sure that i guard squad could not
be<00:04:16.520> able<00:04:16.580> to<00:04:16.700> take<00:04:16.820> out<00:04:16.910> his<00:04:17.000> klefki<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.660> if<00:04:18.620> i

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
be able to take out his klefki and if i

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.080 
be able to take out his klefki and if i
went<00:04:18.980> for<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.220> source<00:04:19.430> dance<00:04:19.670> and<00:04:19.880> he<00:04:19.940> could

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
went for the source dance and he could

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.940 
went for the source dance and he could
get<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.270> first<00:04:20.540> turn<00:04:20.720> wake<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.170> thunder<00:04:21.859> away

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
get the first turn wake and thunder away

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.020 
get the first turn wake and thunder away
from<00:04:22.130> me<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> didn't<00:04:22.640> want<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:22.910> happen

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
from me so I didn't want that to happen

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.090 
from me so I didn't want that to happen
so<00:04:23.420> I<00:04:23.870> switched<00:04:24.200> out<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.470> quell<00:04:24.650> do<00:04:24.800> because

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
so I switched out to quell do because

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.880 
so I switched out to quell do because
Cal<00:04:25.370> do<00:04:25.520> is<00:04:25.670> modest<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:27.380> only<00:04:27.500> thing<00:04:27.590> that

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
Cal do is modest and the only thing that

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.010 
Cal do is modest and the only thing that
I<00:04:27.919> would<00:04:28.070> out<00:04:28.370> speed<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:29.390> I<00:04:29.450> wouldn't

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
I would out speed that I wouldn't

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.410 
I would out speed that I wouldn't
normally<00:04:30.169> have<00:04:30.410> speed

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
normally have speed

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.030 
normally have speed
like<00:04:31.540> being<00:04:31.870> Kiwi<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.350> was<00:04:32.470> important<00:04:32.890> would

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
like being Kiwi that was important would

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.070 
like being Kiwi that was important would
be<00:04:33.160> his<00:04:33.280> Moltres<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:34.000> I've<00:04:34.390> answers<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:35.020> his

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
prior damage on it so I've Keldeo which

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.690 
prior damage on it so I've Keldeo which
is<00:07:07.290> not<00:07:07.560> going<00:07:07.680> to<00:07:07.740> be<00:07:07.860> too<00:07:08.010> useful<00:07:08.220> in<00:07:08.520> case

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
is not going to be too useful in case

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.190 
is not going to be too useful in case
that<00:07:08.880> thing<00:07:08.910> is<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:09.450> sub<00:07:09.630> disabled<00:07:10.020> set

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
that thing is the sub disabled set

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.290 
that thing is the sub disabled set
because<00:07:10.680> I'm<00:07:10.980> specs<00:07:11.400> and<00:07:11.670> I<00:07:11.910> don't<00:07:12.090> think<00:07:12.240> I

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
because I'm specs and I don't think I

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.000 
because I'm specs and I don't think I
took<00:07:12.360> any<00:07:12.690> prior<00:07:12.960> to<00:07:13.110> image<00:07:13.290> on<00:07:13.410> my<00:07:13.530> cal<00:07:13.710> do<00:07:13.860> at

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
took any prior to image on my cal do at

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.240 
took any prior to image on my cal do at
that<00:07:14.040> point<00:07:14.160> but<00:07:15.150> I<00:07:15.800> really<00:07:16.800> don't<00:07:16.980> want<00:07:17.100> to<00:07:17.190> go

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
that point but I really don't want to go

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.740 
that point but I really don't want to go
out<00:07:17.310> into<00:07:17.580> cal<00:07:17.760> deal<00:07:17.940> unless<00:07:18.120> it's<00:07:18.450> the<00:07:18.570> last

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
out into cal deal unless it's the last

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.450 
out into cal deal unless it's the last
attack<00:07:19.020> that<00:07:19.170> I<00:07:19.260> have<00:07:19.440> and<00:07:19.710> he's<00:07:19.800> below<00:07:20.070> 25

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
attack that I have and he's below 25

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.400 
attack that I have and he's below 25
percent<00:07:20.880> so<00:07:21.540> I'm<00:07:21.810> just<00:07:21.960> gonna<00:07:22.050> go<00:07:22.230> out<00:07:22.320> to

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
percent so I'm just gonna go out to

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.140 
percent so I'm just gonna go out to
pincer<00:07:22.740> hoping<00:07:23.280> that<00:07:23.400> maybe<00:07:23.550> a<00:07:23.700> quick<00:07:23.940> attack
