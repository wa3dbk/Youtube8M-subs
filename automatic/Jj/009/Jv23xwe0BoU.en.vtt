when<00:00:35.720> looking<00:00:35.960> at<00:00:36.079> China<00:00:36.380> I<00:00:36.530> was<00:00:36.770> looking<00:00:37.130> at

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
when looking at China I was looking at

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.920 
when looking at China I was looking at
that<00:00:37.520> place<00:00:37.850> where<00:00:38.030> all<00:00:38.090> these<00:00:38.210> materials<00:00:38.720> are

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
that place where all these materials are

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.750 
that place where all these materials are
coming<00:00:39.140> in<00:00:39.350> from<00:00:39.620> all<00:00:39.920> around<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.370> world

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
coming in from all around the world

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.549 
coming in from all around the world
and<00:00:40.850> then<00:00:41.059> these<00:00:41.210> factories<00:00:41.630> are<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:41.989> place

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
and then these factories are this place

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.230 
and then these factories are this place
where<00:00:42.829> all<00:00:42.950> these<00:00:43.100> materials<00:00:43.520> get<00:00:43.730> formed

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
where all these materials get formed

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.820 
where all these materials get formed
into<00:00:44.360> products<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:44.900> sent<00:00:45.170> back<00:00:45.350> out<00:00:45.530> around

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
into products and sent back out around

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.560 
into products and sent back out around
the<00:00:46.130> world<00:00:46.310> a<00:00:48.460> lot<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.730> recycled

the world a lot of the recycled
materials<00:00:50.990> that<00:00:51.080> are<00:00:51.230> collected<00:00:51.530> here<00:00:51.560> are

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
materials that are collected here are

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.920 
materials that are collected here are
being<00:00:52.130> taken<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.820> China<00:00:53.090> they're<00:00:53.540> trying<00:00:53.840> to

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
get all the value metals out of those

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:06.570 
get all the value metals out of those
components

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:26.800

were<00:01:29.580> doing<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.060> planet<00:01:30.480> then<00:01:30.840> people

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
were doing to the planet then people

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.680 
were doing to the planet then people
will<00:01:31.650> either<00:01:31.800> agree<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.370> disagree<00:01:32.520> by<00:01:33.240> not

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
will either agree or disagree by not

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.540

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
saying what you should see that may

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.850 
saying what you should see that may
allow<00:01:36.330> them<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.870> see<00:01:37.110> their<00:01:37.290> world<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.740> little

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
allow them to see their world a little

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
allow them to see their world a little
differently<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:41.430> looks<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> bombed

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
differently it looks like a bombed

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
differently it looks like a bombed
landscape<00:01:42.900> but<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.140> isn't<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.830> what<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.400> is

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
landscape but it isn't it what it is

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.360 
landscape but it isn't it what it is
it's<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.060> landscape<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.770> an<00:01:46.920> intentional

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
it's a landscape that is an intentional

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.770 
it's a landscape that is an intentional
one<00:01:51.260> it's<00:01:52.260> not<00:01:52.620> a<00:01:52.680> simple<00:01:53.430> right<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.000> wrong<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
one it's not a simple right or wrong it

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
one it's not a simple right or wrong it
needs<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.290> whole<00:01:55.470> new<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:55.830> of<00:01:55.860> thinking

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
needs a whole new way of thinking

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.180 
needs a whole new way of thinking
