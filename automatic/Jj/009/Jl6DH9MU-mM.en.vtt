00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
bit lower now the old HD PVR 1 which

bit lower now the old HD PVR 1 which
uses<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> component<00:01:25.350> cables<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.580> probably

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
uses a component cables you can probably

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.130 
uses a component cables you can probably
find<00:01:26.970> pretty<00:01:27.270> cheap<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.540> now<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
find pretty cheap right now but the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
find pretty cheap right now but the
Roxio<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.860> still<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.430> HD<00:01:29.820> via

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
Roxio you can still do some HD via

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
Roxio you can still do some HD via
component<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> bad<00:01:32.130> deal<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
component and that's not a bad deal I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.100 
component and that's not a bad deal I
think<00:01:32.610> those<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.240> around<00:01:33.329> 100<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
think those are going for around 100 you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.450 
think those are going for around 100 you

configuration<00:03:38.280> are<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.669> a<00:03:38.760> better<00:03:38.910> USB<00:03:39.660> mic

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
how do you capture your gameplay and

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.159 
how do you capture your gameplay and
it's<00:05:29.900> through<00:05:30.169> an<00:05:31.010> H<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:32.150> old<00:05:32.330> term<00:05:32.600> was<00:05:32.780> an<00:05:32.870> HD

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
didn't really like it that much but it

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.580 
didn't really like it that much but it
was<00:05:44.450> when<00:05:44.630> it<00:05:44.660> first<00:05:44.930> came<00:05:45.110> out<00:05:45.229> so<00:05:45.410> it<00:05:45.470> could

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
was when it first came out so it could

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.810 
was when it first came out so it could
have<00:05:45.680> been<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> little<00:05:45.950> finicky<00:05:46.280> it<00:05:46.490> could<00:05:46.669> be

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
have been a little finicky it could be

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.580 
have been a little finicky it could be
different<00:05:47.030> now<00:05:47.300> but<00:05:47.510> I've<00:05:47.930> had<00:05:48.140> the<00:05:48.290> elgato

different now but I've had the elgato
for<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.010> while<00:05:49.250> now<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.700> I<00:05:49.970> really<00:05:50.270> enjoy<00:05:50.570> it<00:05:50.720> a

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
for a while now and I really enjoy it a

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.770 
for a while now and I really enjoy it a
heaven<00:05:51.400> in<00:05:52.400> ever<00:05:52.610> media<00:05:52.940> card<00:05:53.150> that<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.390> haven't

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
heaven in ever media card that I haven't

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.350 
heaven in ever media card that I haven't
even<00:05:53.990> opened<00:05:54.200> yet<00:05:55.000> it's<00:05:56.000> kind<00:05:56.090> of<00:05:56.180> like<00:05:56.330> a

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
even opened yet it's kind of like a

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.130 
even opened yet it's kind of like a
backup<00:05:56.690> for<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.200> elgato<00:05:57.880> so<00:05:58.880> maybe<00:05:59.780> one<00:06:00.020> day

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
backup for the elgato so maybe one day

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.750 
backup for the elgato so maybe one day
I'll<00:06:00.260> pop<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:00.500> in<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:00.979> see<00:06:01.130> how<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:01.460> works

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
I'll pop that in and see how that works

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.870 
I'll pop that in and see how that works
but<00:06:03.550> another<00:06:04.550> aspect<00:06:04.669> of<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.419> as<00:06:05.630> well<00:06:06.880> while

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
but another aspect of it as well while

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.020 
but another aspect of it as well while
I'm<00:06:08.000> on<00:06:08.120> the<00:06:08.240> topic<00:06:08.419> of<00:06:09.790> recording<00:06:10.790> gameplay

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
I'm on the topic of recording gameplay

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.510 
I'm on the topic of recording gameplay
now<00:06:11.720> the<00:06:11.780> Xbox<00:06:12.290> one<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:12.560> ps4<00:06:12.860> said<00:06:13.430> they're

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
now the Xbox one and ps4 said they're

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.370 
now the Xbox one and ps4 said they're
gonna<00:06:13.640> have<00:06:13.850> built-in<00:06:14.270> recorders<00:06:14.780> right<00:06:15.140> into

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
gonna have built-in recorders right into

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.230 
gonna have built-in recorders right into
the<00:06:15.500> system<00:06:15.890> but<00:06:16.100> we<00:06:16.280> really<00:06:16.820> don't<00:06:17.060> know

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
the system but we really don't know

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.030 
the system but we really don't know
right<00:06:17.270> now<00:06:17.660> how<00:06:17.960> much<00:06:18.140> time<00:06:18.200> that's<00:06:18.650> gonna<00:06:18.800> be

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
right now how much time that's gonna be

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.580 
right now how much time that's gonna be
where<00:06:19.220> it's<00:06:19.400> gonna<00:06:19.520> be<00:06:19.700> able<00:06:19.790> to<00:06:19.940> save<00:06:20.210> so<00:06:21.050> you

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
where it's gonna be able to save so you

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.740 
where it's gonna be able to save so you
know<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:21.950> best<00:06:22.100> bet<00:06:22.460> when<00:06:22.700> recording<00:06:23.090> is<00:06:23.419> to

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
know the best bet when recording is to

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.180 
know the best bet when recording is to
use<00:06:23.900> an<00:06:24.050> external<00:06:24.320> capture<00:06:24.860> card

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
use an external capture card

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.640 
use an external capture card
because<00:06:25.760> the<00:06:26.330> space<00:06:26.630> on<00:06:26.900> the<00:06:27.200> consoles

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
because the space on the consoles

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.440 
because the space on the consoles
themselves<00:06:28.100> the<00:06:28.460> harddrive<00:06:28.700> space<00:06:28.940> is<00:06:29.240> going

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
themselves the harddrive space is going

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.840 
themselves the harddrive space is going
to<00:06:29.570> be<00:06:29.660> limited<00:06:30.050> as<00:06:30.200> well<00:06:30.560> as<00:06:30.950> you're<00:06:31.700> not

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
to be limited as well as you're not

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.820 
to be limited as well as you're not
going<00:06:32.000> to<00:06:32.090> be<00:06:32.360> able<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.630> use<00:06:32.870> the<00:06:33.080> software<00:06:33.680> of

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
going to be able to use the software of

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.570 
going to be able to use the software of
your<00:06:33.860> choice<00:06:34.100> while<00:06:34.970> editing<00:06:35.480> your<00:06:36.170> video<00:06:36.580> so

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
your choice while editing your video so

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.340 
your choice while editing your video so
like<00:06:37.700> I<00:06:37.820> said<00:06:38.030> I<00:06:38.060> use<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.330> Sony<00:06:38.630> product<00:06:39.050> to<00:06:39.110> edit

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
like I said I use a Sony product to edit

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.350 
like I said I use a Sony product to edit
you<00:06:39.710> know<00:06:39.770> some<00:06:40.010> other<00:06:40.160> people<00:06:40.430> may<00:06:40.580> use<00:06:40.610> a

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
you know some other people may use a

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.230 
you know some other people may use a
final<00:06:42.080> cut<00:06:42.290> or<00:06:42.470> a<00:06:42.530> higher-end<00:06:43.160> Sony<00:06:43.580> maybe

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
final cut or a higher-end Sony maybe

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.820 
final cut or a higher-end Sony maybe
even<00:06:44.600> Adobe<00:06:45.080> so<00:06:45.290> that's<00:06:45.500> another<00:06:45.710> thing

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
even Adobe so that's another thing

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.110 
even Adobe so that's another thing
you'll<00:06:46.040> have<00:06:46.130> to<00:06:46.190> look<00:06:46.400> at<00:06:46.520> as<00:06:46.640> well<00:06:46.790> like<00:06:47.000> I've

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
you'll have to look at as well like I've

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.240 
you'll have to look at as well like I've
mentioned<00:06:47.480> before<00:06:47.650> so<00:06:48.650> that's<00:06:48.890> one<00:06:49.100> thing

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
mentioned before so that's one thing

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.140 
mentioned before so that's one thing
that's<00:06:49.340> up<00:06:49.550> in<00:06:49.640> the<00:06:49.760> air

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
that's up in the air

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.300 
that's up in the air
definitely<00:06:50.840> the<00:06:50.930> external<00:06:51.470> way<00:06:51.590> is<00:06:51.830> to<00:06:52.040> go<00:06:52.160> if

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
definitely the external way is to go if

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.790 
definitely the external way is to go if
you<00:06:52.460> want<00:06:52.610> to<00:06:52.730> capture<00:06:53.020> I<00:06:54.020> know<00:06:54.560> you're

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
you want to capture I know you're

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.500 
you want to capture I know you're
probably<00:06:54.920> gonna<00:06:55.190> see<00:06:55.430> a<00:06:55.460> boom<00:06:55.730> of<00:06:55.910> people<00:06:56.240> at

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
probably gonna see a boom of people at

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.170
