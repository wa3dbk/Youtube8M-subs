for<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.100> next<00:00:11.340> assignment<00:00:11.790> let's<00:00:12.150> begin

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
for this next assignment let's begin

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.080 
for this next assignment let's begin
we're<00:00:12.870> drawing<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.320> circle<00:00:13.799> by<00:00:14.340> specifying<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
we're drawing a circle by specifying a

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.880 
we're drawing a circle by specifying a
center

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
center

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.030 
center
radius<00:00:16.870> will<00:00:17.870> draw<00:00:18.080> this<00:00:18.260> first<00:00:18.530> circle

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
radius will draw this first circle

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.300 
radius will draw this first circle
having<00:00:19.340> a<00:00:19.430> radius<00:00:19.820> of<00:00:19.970> 130<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:21.410> then<00:00:22.160> we'll

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
having a radius of 130 and then we'll

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.970 
having a radius of 130 and then we'll
draw<00:00:22.610> a<00:00:22.880> concentric<00:00:23.600> circle<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:24.740> has<00:00:24.950> a

and<00:01:00.140> it'll<00:01:00.829> have<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.129> diameter<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:02.030> 45<00:01:06.040> I'm

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
and it'll have a diameter of 45 I'm

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.000 
and it'll have a diameter of 45 I'm
going<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.460> draw<00:01:07.640> another<00:01:07.910> circle<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:09.890> it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
going to draw another circle so that it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.970 
going to draw another circle so that it
is<00:01:10.190> tangent<00:01:10.910> to<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.090> circle<00:01:11.770> tangent<00:01:12.770> to

is tangent to that circle tangent to
that<00:01:13.010> circle<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.660> will<00:01:14.840> have<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.050> radius<00:01:15.470> of

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
that circle and it will have a radius of

that circle and it will have a radius of
50<00:01:16.700> units<00:01:18.040> let's<00:01:19.040> use<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.490> trim<00:01:19.790> tool<00:01:20.119> and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
50 units let's use the trim tool and

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.060 
50 units let's use the trim tool and
make<00:01:21.680> those<00:01:21.860> objects<00:01:22.700> cutting<00:01:23.450> edges<00:01:24.070> then

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
make those objects cutting edges then

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.440 
make those objects cutting edges then
we'll<00:01:25.340> trim<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.909> part<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.900> circle<00:01:27.320> off

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
we'll trim that part of the circle off

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.380 
we'll trim that part of the circle off
on<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.470> want<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:30.829> line<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.159> be<00:01:31.430> tangent<00:01:32.240> to

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
on and I want this line to be tangent to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.700 
on and I want this line to be tangent to
that<00:01:32.420> circle<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.570> tangent<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.140> circle

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.640 

now<00:01:40.250> we'll<00:01:40.460> use<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.640> offset<00:01:41.330> tool<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:42.500> I'll

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
now we'll use the offset tool and I'll

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.950 
now we'll use the offset tool and I'll
make<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.400> offset<00:01:43.850> distance<00:01:44.770> 125<00:01:46.750> offset<00:01:47.750> that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
make the offset distance 125 offset that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.680 
make the offset distance 125 offset that
line<00:01:48.320> over<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.710> there<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.940> now<00:01:53.120> I'm<00:01:53.270> going<00:01:53.600> to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
line over to there and now I'm going to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.440 
line over to there and now I'm going to
draw<00:01:53.930> another<00:01:53.960> circle<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.070> make<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.850> tangent

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
draw another circle and make it tangent

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.830 
draw another circle and make it tangent
to<00:01:56.600> that<00:01:56.630> line<00:01:57.280> tangent<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.700> circle<00:01:59.479> and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
to that line tangent to that circle and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.910 
to that line tangent to that circle and
it's<00:02:00.619> going<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.979> have<00:02:01.190> radius<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.240> 25<00:02:02.780> units

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.590 

now<00:02:06.920> let's<00:02:07.160> select<00:02:07.460> everything<00:02:08.090> using<00:02:08.479> our

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
now let's select everything using our

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.690 
now let's select everything using our
crossing<00:02:09.110> window<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.590> make<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.310> cutting

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
crossing window to make it a cutting

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.150 
crossing window to make it a cutting
edge<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:12.080> we'll<00:02:12.260> just<00:02:12.620> do<00:02:12.860> some

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
edge and then we'll just do some

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:26.290 
edge and then we'll just do some
judicious<00:02:13.790> trimming

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.160 

and<00:02:26.570> now<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.410> flat<00:02:27.920> hook
