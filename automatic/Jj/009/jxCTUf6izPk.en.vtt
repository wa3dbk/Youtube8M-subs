00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
can get a triangle a two one two looks

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.440 
can get a triangle a two one two looks
like<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.560> pyramid<00:01:24.800> it's<00:01:25.580> how<00:01:25.700> we<00:01:25.759> kind<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.240> we

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
like a pyramid it's how we kind of we

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.940 
like a pyramid it's how we kind of we
break<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.229> gelcoat

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
break the gelcoat

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.620 
break the gelcoat
edge<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.729> we<00:01:28.850> don't<00:01:28.970> have<00:01:29.030> any<00:01:29.210> sharp<00:01:29.450> edges

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
edge so we don't have any sharp edges

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.690 
edge so we don't have any sharp edges
and<00:01:29.840> propagate<00:01:30.320> fractures<00:01:30.890> there<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:31.250> it's

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
and propagate fractures there so it's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.060 
and propagate fractures there so it's
very<00:01:31.820> simple<00:01:32.149> I'll<00:01:32.509> just<00:01:32.720> come<00:01:32.930> in<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:33.410> can<00:01:33.979> do

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
very simple I'll just come in I can do

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.440 
very simple I'll just come in I can do

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.590 
on I want to make sure I put down I push
on<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.490> fairly<00:01:40.700> hard<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.090> I'll<00:01:41.180> go<00:01:41.270> ahead<00:01:41.390> pull

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
on it fairly hard and I'll go ahead pull

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.410 
on it fairly hard and I'll go ahead pull
tape<00:01:41.810> back<00:01:42.050> here<00:01:42.520> double-check<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.700> here<00:01:43.910> just

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
tape back here double-check it here just

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.380 
tape back here double-check it here just
to<00:01:44.720> make<00:01:44.899> sure<00:01:44.930> we're<00:01:45.380> good<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:46.030> like<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.060> little
