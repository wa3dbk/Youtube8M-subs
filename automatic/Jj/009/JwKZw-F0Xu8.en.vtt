00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.210
 which I will tell general tips on the game 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.179
 for viking 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.010
 passing for king harald i will show 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.779
 how his son became the emperor of Scandinavia 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.590
 the background will twist with becoming 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.539
 feathers 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.019
 and we start with the general features for the Vikings 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.359
 later we will go over each of the countries for 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.699
 which you can play in general play for 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.130
 the nords like all pagans pretty 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.500
 easy from what you can unleash 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.510
 war for territory only because 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 the territory is near you and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 religion state does not match your 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.899
 raise states you can very 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 quickly you should not be afraid of the fact that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.059
 before the reform of religion, all titles are divided 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.760
 equally important between sons 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.489
 rule is if some title only 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 one he gets older that is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.430
 your character is enough to follow 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.320
 so that the highest de tu was one create 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.840
 an empire for the Vikings simple 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.750
 it also helps the fact that vast lands 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.710
 finnish busy states with faith 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.900
 norway or swedencia for education 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.810
 empires need to have 80 percent of all 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.090
 empire lands make it very easy 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.140
 choosing a weaker target and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.720
 taking advantage of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.299
 religion reforms back secondly 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 adversely affect the strength of religion 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.320
 successful religious uprisings 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960

 country for this we break them into three 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.100
 difficulty groups are light medium and hard 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.950
 Light countries I will take all the territories 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.410
 Norway in particular the islands king 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.410
 harvey ladies fair and sweden 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.030

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.940
 zheleznobokh these areas are 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.100
 far from strong opponents and their land 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.340
 the kingdom is fragmented so their easy 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.090
 grab one by one 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.340
 located 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.200
 Finland which is very easy 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.160
 is captured as she is also 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.110
 fragmented and has very few troops to 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.850
 average complexity countries can 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.220
 refer territory to it namely 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.410
 zealand with king sigurd snake 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.750
 eyes and Jutland with King Bahs 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.940
 the ground is close enough 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.820
 Catholics who often become 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.210
 sources of major trouble besides 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.820
 Togo 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.930

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.360
 almost equal 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.710
 so itâ€™s not so easy 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.200
 combine well 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.900
 the only thing that can help is if 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.690
 suddenly the Catholics will forget about you and start 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.060

 difficult countries will cope completely 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.920
 these are small lands on the territory 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.650
 islands uk this york 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.350
 headed by a viking named fix 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.990
 nicknamed in white and dublin with 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.090
 ruler and boneless thief both 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.250
 historical characters turned up on 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.380
 island uk after death 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.170
 their father for which they swore 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.750
 revenge as a result of them is seen as 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.400
 many English cities and the thief found 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.490
 and he gave an agonizing death killer 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.570
 his father's problem is that first 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.240
 games you fight 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.489
 not for their homeland which means that 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.430
 in front of a huge series of uprisings and 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.770
 holy wars besides these lands are not 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.690
 go at the expense of the Scandinavian empire and 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.000
 you will not be a long time 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.520
 holy land of yours 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.860
 religions 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.430
 and further complicates the already 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.840
 the difficult task of reforming religions 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.360
 the only thing that saves is good 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.300
 reserve bonus troops at the beginning of the game 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.819
 but if you lose them then this game 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.159
 for you may end well, that I 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.150
