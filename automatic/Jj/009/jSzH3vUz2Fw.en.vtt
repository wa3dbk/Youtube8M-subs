00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 It is half of the holiday half 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.309
 I can bring you the head and the team 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.330
 and the head you have to part 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.259
 I can do it myself, of course 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.889
 try to motivate and everyone can 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.320
 to make it 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 but it has come too 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.300
 really want to and now it's because of that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.400
 to really training to foliage and to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.539
 Let's go out the same way 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 hello people we are back now 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.160
 outside and again so i was 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 similar to outside so i am 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.070
 Now outside again and now I start 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 also to balance the techniques too 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 but again show a thing the whole 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.270
 importantly it does not just come on so 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.739
 I come to your attitude on the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.840
 have muscles and as I said 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.129
 on the body fat percentage and can 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.980
 While exercising it by determined but 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.350
 also mainly by what 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.730
 Of course, it is important in protein 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.140
 muscle building and also here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.000
 here too is ai muscles 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.680
 Definitely useful but I have to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 be true protein because there are many 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.949
 many different types of protein and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.949
 in the protein shakes is not the best 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.899
 good he could at are a good way 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.909
 in which it makes itself with nuts 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.100
 Cashew kernels, for example, are quite good 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.979
 if we do not taste good the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 Also not that tastes you start but 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.259
 Lenenka represented these cores here 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.630
 amount of protein in it 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.799
 and they make your muscles and is 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.899
 just like you can from it 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.909
 and that does not make dick just bring 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.380
 protein and thus builds up your muscles 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.030
 and that's important and I mean that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.490
 I also wanted the abdominals and 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.590
 to be able to walk for a long time and abroad 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 the rest is head thing and a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 a bit of training and we do that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.380
 a step speed and just that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.380
 Of course, pay attention 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:25.120
 after all, just the right one 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.790
 you should have found one 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 search the route that is as far as possible 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.989
 you there then I mean it works too 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.190
 but there was a lot going on very soon 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.260
 Oxygen and there we will continue 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 come you want to train better 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.120
 then a little more endurance later 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.200
 of course you can 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.359
 he could make anywhere else in 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.590
 triple always but especially in the woods 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.060
 it is particularly good the world wide 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.620
 you too fast but just more 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.819
 you have successes there you can 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.760
 Of course, even a light one 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.650
 hill or mountain make your train and 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.420
 So you're holding a real school something 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.470
 small challenge have naturally 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.609
 this on the other side of berg 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.280
 back down there you can already 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:03.340
 happy times and then also has this 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.599
 mental thing that since I namely 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.250
 also a lot is if you look at it 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.599
 Come here I said I can do it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.280
 About this mountain we say it is 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.349
 maybe three kilometers in the beginning 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.630
 not much, but it does 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.430
 then you you have a successful experience 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.139
 and most important that we always 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.910
 a sense of achievement never stops 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.620
 if you have made one on 1 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.510
 jogging uphill or something like that 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.760
 rather a little bit longer maybe that's how 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.889
 this one just in the middle of it and 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.049
 then say that because that's exactly what 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.849
 wrong then then is not coming forward 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.310
 there must always be a sense of achievement 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.540
 so that you then have the courage and the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.180
 power to continue if you then 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.470
 first you should have job then you can 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.150
 that's the best way to do it 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.699
 friends because then the motivation 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.299
 just the biggest and the 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.440
 Probably bigger that you 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.599
 persevere because then I have each other 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.760
 just want to give up 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.349
 or so, but what is very important is different 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.680
 I should here dogg castle itself 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.680
 talk 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.780
 Finally, it just stops 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.130
 on that speed here 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.630
 you would keep going downhill again 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.800
 quite fast value and some time with 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.270
 sting everything tried yes there is 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.470
 one last thing on which the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.410
 maybe should pay attention 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.330
 it is not right at the beginning 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.870
 at the beginning very fast and violently too 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.760
 organize 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.169
 because it's the dangerous thing if that 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.940
 Applicant yes, he says so completely 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.739
 fast out of breath because a few dreams 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.810
 so much to do that they do not have any 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.030
 had more power somehow still different 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.020
 continue to run and therefore tried 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.300
 to take a deep breath 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.590
 who inhales deeply and calms down 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.840
 of course you will then also 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.120
 come to the conclusion so again 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.090
 briefly together what matters it is 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.729
 the training of individual muscle groups 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.590
 then it is the right diet and 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.090
 Also something important is the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.040
 proper breathing technique and the right one 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.050
 Lauftechnik still pick up running technology 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.780
 pay attention to nutrition by eating protein 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.370
 natural albers and there with the 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.030
 little training and you will already 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.710
 with a bit of endurance really long 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.940
 I can run and that's what I mean now 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.440
 not the stamina of the only one 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.380
 because he's going to learn it, I mean 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.390
 exercise but you have to every day 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.010
 Think that is just important to her 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.289
 your does not do any exercise and all two 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.150
 Days makes her a bit bigger 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.400
 Run and it is also important that you 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.440
 because in between simply a tag space 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.720
 can also rest and 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.070
 have time to continue to generate up 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.520
 next time I will show you 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.990
 new tricks and exercise and hope 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.280
 it helped you and I like it 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.590
 felt about a few likes or 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.789
 Comments also look forward to something 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.940
 I would like to know the happy to 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.940
 disposal
