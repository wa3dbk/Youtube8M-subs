more taut and then i just creep the
curler<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.320> close<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.619> possible<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.850> by

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
curler in as close as possible and by

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.499 
curler in as close as possible and by
doing<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.530> should<00:01:37.560> avoid<00:01:38.509> pinching

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
doing this you should avoid pinching

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
doing this you should avoid pinching
your<00:01:39.689> lid<00:01:40.140> area<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:40.829> I've<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> admit<00:01:41.100> when<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
use like the backside of this finger and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.200 
use like the backside of this finger and
I<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.299> kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.810> press<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.040> gently<00:01:59.310> on

I just kind of like press it gently on
their<00:02:01.020> lid<00:02:01.259> area<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.850> does<00:02:03.119> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
their lid area and what that does is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.719 
their lid area and what that does is
that<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.530> kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> helps<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.490> lash<00:02:05.700> line

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that it kind of helps the lash line

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.479 
that it kind of helps the lash line
protrude<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.229> bit<00:02:07.409> more<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:08.220> way

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
protrude out a little bit more that way

when I'm trying to fit this into their
eye<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.930> much<00:02:12.959> easier

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
eye it's just it's so much easier

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
eye it's just it's so much easier
at<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.130> vote<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.520> know<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> helps<00:02:15.120> avoid<00:02:15.450> the

first and then I inch my curl or upwards
and<00:02:58.380> then<00:02:58.620> clamp<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.100> down<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.520> few

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and then clamp it down in a few

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.199 
and then clamp it down in a few
different<00:02:59.820> spots<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:02.459> way<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.670> get<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.970> much

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
different spots that way you get a much

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.660 
different spots that way you get a much
nicer<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.780> more<00:03:03.990> natural-looking<00:03:04.410> curl<00:03:04.860> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
nicer and more natural-looking curl and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.340 
nicer and more natural-looking curl and
there<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.940> go<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.540> lashes<00:03:06.870> are<00:03:06.990> standing<00:03:07.290> up

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
there you go the lashes are standing up

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.680 
there you go the lashes are standing up
so<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.520> for<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.150> quick<00:03:09.390> tips
