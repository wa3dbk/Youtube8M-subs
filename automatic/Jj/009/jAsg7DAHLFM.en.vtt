okay he's cut he's gonna mark that short
piece<00:00:03.210> above<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.080> header<00:00:04.259> there<00:00:04.529> and

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
piece above the the header there and

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.680 
piece above the the header there and
he's<00:00:05.460> gonna<00:00:05.609> cut<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.120> then<00:00:06.420> it<00:00:06.569> will

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
he's gonna cut it and then it will

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.660 
he's gonna cut it and then it will
install<00:00:07.020> it<00:00:07.230> but<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:08.069> can<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.550> this

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
install it but you can see that this

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.660 
install it but you can see that this
one's<00:00:08.910> eight<00:00:09.179> inches<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.980> I<00:00:10.980> think<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.519> now

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
one's eight inches and I think right now

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.249 
one's eight inches and I think right now
it's<00:00:11.910> three<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.240> three<00:00:12.570> quarters<00:00:12.990> something

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
it's three and three quarters something

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.690 
it's three and three quarters something
like<00:00:13.349> that's<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.710> actual<00:00:14.099> measurement<00:00:14.610> on

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
like that's the actual measurement on

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.039 
like that's the actual measurement on
the<00:00:14.820> last<00:00:15.030> house<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.450> want<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> say<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.929> was

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the last house I want to say it was

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.990 
the last house I want to say it was
almost<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.529> five<00:00:16.949> or<00:00:17.310> seven<00:00:17.850> inches

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
almost like five or seven inches

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.029 
almost like five or seven inches
somewhere<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.539> there<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> made<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.680> slightly

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
somewhere in there so I made it slightly

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.920 
somewhere in there so I made it slightly
bigger<00:00:20.310> again<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.390> thought<00:00:21.720> is

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
bigger again this kind of a thought is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.810 
bigger again this kind of a thought is
to<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.529> allow<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.220> adjustments

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
to you know to allow for adjustments

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.660 
to you know to allow for adjustments
sake<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> every<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.189> there's<00:00:26.400> subtle

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
sake so every you know there's subtle

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.370 
sake so every you know there's subtle
differences<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> window<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.260> going

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
differences on where a window is going

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.169 
differences on where a window is going
to<00:00:28.439> be<00:00:28.590> installed<00:00:28.830> by<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> manufacturer<00:00:29.939> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
to be installed by a manufacturer so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
to be installed by a manufacturer so
this<00:00:30.689> gives<00:00:30.960> us<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.260> adjustment<00:00:31.769> capability

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
this gives us that adjustment capability

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.690 
this gives us that adjustment capability
again<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> mindset<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.649> window<00:00:35.219> trim

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
again just as a mindset that window trim

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
again just as a mindset that window trim
on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> left<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.719> not<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.079> place

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
on the left and right is not in place

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.959 
on the left and right is not in place
yet<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.649> we've<00:00:37.980> left<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> space<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
yet and we've left the space for it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.209 
yet and we've left the space for it
currently<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.809> radius<00:00:40.320> corner<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
currently this radius corner and the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
currently this radius corner and the
three<00:00:41.430> by<00:00:41.579> five<00:00:41.790> panel<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
three by five panel to the right of it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.889 
three by five panel to the right of it
is<00:00:43.020> installed<00:00:43.410> they're<00:00:44.190> marking<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
is installed they're marking out the the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
is installed they're marking out the the
other<00:00:46.050> three<00:00:46.320> by<00:00:46.469> five<00:00:46.680> panel<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.579> going

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
other three by five panel that's going

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
other three by five panel that's going
to<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.780> window<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.700> then

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to be right of that window and then

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.860 
to be right of that window and then
they'll<00:00:50.879> install<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> again<00:00:51.449> we're<00:00:51.750> going

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
they'll install it again we're going

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.920 
they'll install it again we're going
across<00:00:52.289> from<00:00:52.530> left<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> right<00:00:53.129> row<00:00:53.430> after<00:00:53.670> row

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
across from left to right row after row

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.209 
across from left to right row after row
so<00:00:54.930> now<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.109> panel<00:00:58.109> three<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:58.980> five

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
so now this is the panel three by five

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.270 
so now this is the panel three by five
panel<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.379> there's<00:01:01.379> two<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.770> them<00:01:01.859> there's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
panel and there's two of them there's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.830 
panel and there's two of them there's
the<00:01:02.399> corner<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.149> there's<00:01:03.329> another<00:01:03.449> one

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the corner and then there's another one

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
the corner and then there's another one
and<00:01:04.080> another<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.739> where<00:01:04.890> scholar<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and another one right where scholar is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.190 
and another one right where scholar is
now<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.180> three<00:01:06.390> by<00:01:06.570> five<00:01:06.780> panels

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
now so it's two three by five panels

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.070 
now so it's two three by five panels
plus<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> interlocking<00:01:08.340> corner<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.080> checks

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
plus the interlocking corner and checks

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
plus the interlocking corner and checks
getting<00:01:10.380> ready<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.920> place<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> other

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
getting ready to place the other

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
getting ready to place the other
interlocking<00:01:12.600> corner<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.630> that's<00:01:15.630> those

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
interlocking corner and that's those

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.510 
interlocking corner and that's those
that's<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> corner<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.280> speaking

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that's the corner that I was speaking

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.880 
that's the corner that I was speaking
about<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.000> needed<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.540> trimmed<00:01:18.960> around

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
about that needed to be trimmed around

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.149 
about that needed to be trimmed around
that<00:01:20.159> eave<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.680> as<00:01:22.680> he<00:01:22.950> gets

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that eave you can see it as he gets

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.399 
that eave you can see it as he gets
closer<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:24.180> I'll<00:01:24.299> zoom<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.259> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
closer there I'll zoom in and but that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.090 
closer there I'll zoom in and but that
that<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.299> left<00:01:27.540> gable<00:01:27.990> another<00:01:28.829> row<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that is the left gable another row and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
that is the left gable another row and
it's<00:01:29.520> done<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it's done and then this one now is the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
it's done and then this one now is the
final<00:01:31.290> row<00:01:31.470> notice<00:01:32.159> we're<00:01:32.340> making<00:01:32.579> the

particular<00:01:41.220> side<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:42.030> cut<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.320> hard<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
particular side we cut it was hard to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.069 
particular side we cut it was hard to
mark<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.640> corners<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> ground<00:01:45.630> were<00:01:45.930> on

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
mark the corners on the ground were on

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.600 
mark the corners on the ground were on
this<00:01:46.259> other<00:01:46.439> gable<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.920> had<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> laying<00:01:47.369> flat

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
this other gable we had it laying flat

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.039 
this other gable we had it laying flat
on<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> ground<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> was<00:01:48.329> easy<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.720> mark<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
on the ground it was easy to mark the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.109 
on the ground it was easy to mark the
corbels<00:01:49.380> out<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.490> cut<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:50.909> right

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
corbels out but here we cut it up right

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.109 
corbels out but here we cut it up right
in<00:01:51.270> place<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.020> next<00:01:52.200> grout<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.820> above

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
in place the next grout this one above

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.100 
in place the next grout this one above
the<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> gable<00:01:55.290> cuts<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.969> top<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.479> row

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the the gable cuts a on top of this row

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.350 
the the gable cuts a on top of this row
you're<00:01:58.680> gonna<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.549> cut<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> right

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you're gonna see them just cut it right

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.940 
you're gonna see them just cut it right
on<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> ground<00:02:00.780> they'll<00:02:01.320> cut<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> corbels

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
on the ground they'll cut the corbels

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.219 
on the ground they'll cut the corbels
out<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.670> again<00:02:03.540> they're<00:02:03.750> sliding<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
out of it so again they're sliding that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.899 
out of it so again they're sliding that
in<00:02:04.469> place<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.159> then<00:02:05.280> they'll<00:02:05.460> screw<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
in place now and then they'll screw it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.459 
in place now and then they'll screw it
in<00:02:06.000> place<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.540> then<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.719> next<00:02:07.079> row<00:02:07.140> will<00:02:07.290> be

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
in place and then the next row will be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.219 
in place and then the next row will be
good<00:02:07.680> ready<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> you're<00:02:09.750> gonna<00:02:09.869> steam

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
good ready to go so you're gonna steam

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.020 
good ready to go so you're gonna steam
as<00:02:10.560> soon<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.310> piece<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.819> then

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
as soon as they get that piece and then

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.460 
as soon as they get that piece and then
we're<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
we're going to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.740 
we're going to
be<00:02:12.670> doing<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.760> shot<00:02:13.970> where<00:02:14.270> there<00:02:14.450> you're

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
be doing a shot where there you're

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.510 
be doing a shot where there you're
getting<00:02:14.960> an<00:02:15.050> overview<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.800> three<00:02:16.250> pieces

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
getting an overview of that three pieces

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.250 
getting an overview of that three pieces
that<00:02:16.760> make<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.240> gable<00:02:17.690> end<00:02:17.840> above<00:02:18.110> where

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
that make that gable end above where

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.590 
that make that gable end above where
check<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.680> now<00:02:19.060> you'll<00:02:20.060> see<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.360> right<00:02:20.540> there

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
check is now you'll see it right there

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.810 
check is now you'll see it right there
so<00:02:21.050> there's<00:02:21.230> there's<00:02:21.620> two<00:02:21.680> smaller<00:02:22.160> pieces<00:02:22.490> on

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
so there's there's two smaller pieces on

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.460 
so there's there's two smaller pieces on
each<00:02:23.000> side<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.630> have<00:02:24.020> already<00:02:24.200> been

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
each side that have already been

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.910 
each side that have already been
somewhat<00:02:25.480> fabricated<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.140> pitch<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.680> the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
somewhat fabricated to the pitch of the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.560 
somewhat fabricated to the pitch of the
gable<00:02:28.280> they're<00:02:28.520> just<00:02:28.730> about<00:02:29.000> two<00:02:29.240> inches

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
gable they're just about two inches

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.610 
gable they're just about two inches
taller<00:02:29.960> so<00:02:30.620> we<00:02:30.770> have<00:02:30.920> adjustment<00:02:31.520> there<00:02:31.730> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
taller so we have adjustment there and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.380 
taller so we have adjustment there and
there<00:02:33.620> they've<00:02:34.220> got<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.640> pieces<00:02:35.000> laid<00:02:35.180> out

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
there they've got the pieces laid out

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.790 
there they've got the pieces laid out
they've<00:02:35.540> got<00:02:35.750> their<00:02:35.900> measurement<00:02:36.320> left<00:02:36.530> right

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
they've got their measurement left right

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.200 
they've got their measurement left right
in<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.160> center<00:02:37.460> and<00:02:37.580> then<00:02:37.700> they're<00:02:37.820> gonna<00:02:37.910> pop

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
in the center and then they're gonna pop

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.420 
in the center and then they're gonna pop
a<00:02:38.270> blue<00:02:38.600> chalk<00:02:38.870> line<00:02:39.170> cut<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:39.920> then<00:02:40.280> before

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
a blue chalk line cut it and then before

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.950 
a blue chalk line cut it and then before
they<00:02:40.790> actually<00:02:41.240> bring<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.600> up<00:02:41.720> they're<00:02:41.870> going

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
they actually bring it up they're going

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.990 
they actually bring it up they're going
to<00:02:42.020> cut<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.350> Korbel<00:02:42.740> areas<00:02:43.130> out<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.730> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
to cut the Korbel areas out of that and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.230 
to cut the Korbel areas out of that and
that'll<00:02:44.780> be<00:02:44.900> done<00:02:50.740> so<00:02:51.740> now<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> piece<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:53.000> going

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
that'll be done so now a piece is going

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.720 
that'll be done so now a piece is going
to<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.540> cut<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.410> now<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:55.010> installed

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
to be cut and now it's installed

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.400 
to be cut and now it's installed
actually<00:02:56.600> that'll<00:02:56.840> be<00:02:56.930> two<00:02:57.140> pieces

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
actually that'll be two pieces

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.470 
actually that'll be two pieces
unfortunately<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.459> Korbel<00:02:58.880> came<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.300> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
unfortunately the Korbel came in and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.990 
unfortunately the Korbel came in and
intersected<00:03:00.170> that's<00:03:00.890> where<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.400> just<00:03:01.610> cut<00:03:01.790> out

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
intersected that's where it just cut out

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.850 
intersected that's where it just cut out
like<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.480> triangle<00:03:02.959> piece<00:03:03.170> was<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:03.590> cut<00:03:03.770> in

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
like that triangle piece was just cut in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.410 
like that triangle piece was just cut in
half<00:03:04.040> because<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.550> horrible<00:03:07.240> okay<00:03:08.240> now

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
half because of that horrible okay now

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.420 
half because of that horrible okay now
the<00:03:08.480> pieces<00:03:08.870> are<00:03:09.080> up<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.680> install<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
the pieces are up and install that the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.040 
the pieces are up and install that the
core<00:03:10.610> ball<00:03:10.730> has<00:03:10.820> been<00:03:10.850> cut<00:03:11.150> out<00:03:11.300> but<00:03:11.480> notice

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
core ball has been cut out but notice

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.840 
core ball has been cut out but notice
that<00:03:12.080> sheykh<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.500> wrapping<00:03:13.100> up<00:03:13.190> some<00:03:13.430> panels

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
that sheykh is wrapping up some panels

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.080 
that sheykh is wrapping up some panels
we<00:03:14.030> took<00:03:14.270> them<00:03:14.570> from<00:03:15.110> Kennewick<00:03:15.650> Washington

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
we took them from Kennewick Washington

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.699 
we took them from Kennewick Washington
we<00:03:17.090> went<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.420> Marlatt<00:03:17.840> homes<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.350> Hermiston

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
we went to Marlatt homes and Hermiston

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.070 
we went to Marlatt homes and Hermiston
Oregon<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.489> we<00:03:20.000> did<00:03:20.150> an<00:03:20.300> installation<00:03:20.510> on<00:03:21.050> a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
Oregon and we did an installation on a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.600 
Oregon and we did an installation on a
prototype<00:03:21.709> which<00:03:21.950> you'll<00:03:22.130> see<00:03:22.160> right<00:03:22.340> here

prototype which you'll see right here

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.540 
prototype which you'll see right here
this<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.750> brand<00:03:24.080> new<00:03:24.170> modular<00:03:24.590> home<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:25.400> we

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
this is a brand new modular home that we

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.120 
this is a brand new modular home that we
did<00:03:25.820> three<00:03:26.510> pieces<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.019> 15-foot<00:03:27.920> nine

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
did three pieces the 15-foot nine

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.590 
did three pieces the 15-foot nine
underneath<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.700> window<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.150> then<00:03:29.239> we<00:03:29.330> did<00:03:29.480> on

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
underneath the window and then we did on

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.780 
underneath the window and then we did on
each<00:03:29.630> side<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.050> garage<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.489> was<00:03:31.610> at

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
each side of the garage but it was at

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.940 
each side of the garage but it was at
about<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.209> half<00:03:32.450> an<00:03:32.600> hour<00:03:32.720> each<00:03:32.870> way<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.530> we<00:03:33.890> were

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
about a half an hour each way so we were

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.560 
about a half an hour each way so we were
gone<00:03:34.160> an<00:03:34.340> hour<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:34.700> travel<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.239> then<00:03:35.330> we<00:03:35.450> were

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
gone an hour in travel and then we were

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.020 
gone an hour in travel and then we were
there<00:03:35.780> about<00:03:36.019> three<00:03:36.320> hours<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.519> 11-hour

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
there about three hours so the 11-hour

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.360 
there about three hours so the 11-hour
installation<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.050> I<00:03:39.110> spoke<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.709> earlier<00:03:39.860> was

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
installation that I spoke of earlier was

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.940 
installation that I spoke of earlier was
really<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.670> misnomer<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.630> we<00:03:41.930> took<00:03:42.350> me<00:03:42.769> and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
really a misnomer in that we took me and

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.250 
really a misnomer in that we took me and
Shaq<00:03:43.160> went<00:03:43.430> away<00:03:43.519> from<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.000> job<00:03:44.239> left<00:03:44.780> Skylar

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
Shaq went away from the job left Skylar

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.050 
Shaq went away from the job left Skylar
there<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.620> finish<00:03:45.769> up<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.160> details<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.820> clean

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
there to finish up the details and clean

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.289 
there to finish up the details and clean
up<00:03:47.299> but<00:03:48.080> this<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> brand<00:03:49.640> new<00:03:49.790> prototype

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
up but this is a brand new prototype

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.150 
up but this is a brand new prototype
like<00:03:50.480> any<00:03:50.720> new<00:03:50.989> prototype<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.799> mean<00:03:51.950> we<00:03:52.070> had

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
like any new prototype I mean we had

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.830 
like any new prototype I mean we had
made<00:03:52.340> pictures<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.060> drawings<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.690> they

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
made pictures to the drawings that they

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.780 
made pictures to the drawings that they
had<00:03:53.959> submitted<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:55.100> know<00:03:55.220> when<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.580> got

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
had submitted and you know when we got

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.940 
had submitted and you know when we got
there<00:03:56.060> there<00:03:56.209> was<00:03:56.420> some<00:03:56.570> issues<00:03:57.049> that<00:03:57.380> from

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
there there was some issues that from

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.009 
there there was some issues that from
the<00:03:58.100> siding<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.880> trim<00:03:59.330> pieces<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.930> were

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
the siding to the trim pieces that were

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.080 
the siding to the trim pieces that were
on<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.440> working<00:04:01.010> with<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.430> staff<00:04:01.670> there<00:04:01.970> at

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
on so working with the staff there at

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.210 
on so working with the staff there at
Marlette<00:04:02.510> we<00:04:02.780> all<00:04:02.959> came<00:04:03.230> up<00:04:03.260> with<00:04:03.440> conclusions

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
Marlette we all came up with conclusions

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.449 
Marlette we all came up with conclusions
to<00:04:04.940> set<00:04:05.840> problems<00:04:06.320> and<00:04:06.530> we<00:04:06.590> now<00:04:06.739> have<00:04:06.769> standard

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
to set problems and we now have standard

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.400 
to set problems and we now have standard
pieces<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.150> will<00:04:08.269> go<00:04:08.450> for<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.810> model<00:04:09.230> home

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
pieces that will go for this model home

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.530 
pieces that will go for this model home
and<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.830> should<00:04:10.040> take<00:04:10.220> no<00:04:10.400> more<00:04:10.430> than<00:04:10.700> about<00:04:10.940> 15

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
and it should take no more than about 15

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.170 
and it should take no more than about 15
minutes<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.500> install<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:13.310> think<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:13.970> 15

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
minutes to install I think it's 15

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.500 
minutes to install I think it's 15
pieces<00:04:14.780> altogether<00:04:15.769> that<00:04:16.580> make<00:04:16.850> this<00:04:17.060> system

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
pieces altogether that make this system

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.539 
pieces altogether that make this system
there's<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.870> 15<00:04:18.290> foot<00:04:18.560> 9<00:04:18.830> underneath<00:04:19.310> this

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
there's the 15 foot 9 underneath this

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.580 
there's the 15 foot 9 underneath this
window<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.419> sides<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:20.959> then<00:04:21.380> where

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
window to the sides of it then where

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.710 
window to the sides of it then where
Scheck<00:04:21.859> is<00:04:21.890> that's<00:04:22.310> four<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:22.729> a<00:04:22.760> half<00:04:22.970> feet

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
Scheck is that's four and a half feet

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.740 
Scheck is that's four and a half feet
and<00:04:23.960> then<00:04:24.590> there's<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:24.919> this

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
and then there's a this

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.240 
and then there's a this
here<00:04:26.050> on<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.290> right<00:04:26.470> side<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> garage<00:04:27.010> which

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
here on the right side the garage which

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.670 
here on the right side the garage which
i<00:04:27.370> think<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.670> about<00:04:27.790> 18<00:04:28.360> inches<00:04:28.390> but<00:04:29.260> any<00:04:29.470> rate

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
i think is about 18 inches but any rate

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.220 
i think is about 18 inches but any rate
that<00:04:29.980> that's<00:04:30.880> an<00:04:31.090> installation<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:31.720> we<00:04:31.960> did

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
that that's an installation that we did

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.110 
that that's an installation that we did
the<00:04:32.470> same<00:04:32.710> day<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.100> we<00:04:33.460> were<00:04:33.610> doing<00:04:33.790> this

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
the same day that we were doing this

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.390 
the same day that we were doing this
this<00:04:35.080> other<00:04:35.650> house<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:35.980> you<00:04:36.280> were

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
this other house that you were

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.090 
this other house that you were
previously<00:04:36.880> viewing<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:38.170> just<00:04:38.890> thought<00:04:39.040> I

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
previously viewing so I just thought I

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.040 
previously viewing so I just thought I
would<00:04:39.340> throw<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.580> into<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.060> mix<00:04:40.180> but<00:04:40.720> again

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
would throw that into the mix but again

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.890 
would throw that into the mix but again
as<00:04:41.410> as<00:04:41.740> any<00:04:42.070> builder<00:04:42.550> comes<00:04:42.850> before<00:04:43.120> us<00:04:43.360> we<00:04:43.750> are

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
as as any builder comes before us we are

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.810 
as as any builder comes before us we are
gonna<00:04:44.080> make<00:04:44.320> whatever<00:04:44.770> they're<00:04:45.100> needing<00:04:45.670> to

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
gonna make whatever they're needing to

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.030 
gonna make whatever they're needing to
make<00:04:46.000> at<00:04:46.210> what's<00:04:46.450> shapes<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.200> lengths<00:04:47.890> and

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
make at what's shapes and lengths and

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.910 
make at what's shapes and lengths and
Heights<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.700> colors<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.360> textures<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.140> again

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920
