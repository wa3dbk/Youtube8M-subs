00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
it's just how good clue scrolls are for

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.770 
it's just how good clue scrolls are for
starting<00:04:11.120> out<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.540> bank<00:04:11.989> now<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:13.269> did<00:04:14.269> cluing

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
starting out a bank now I did cluing

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.400 
starting out a bank now I did cluing
until<00:04:15.440> like<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:17.180> 10<00:04:17.479> mil<00:04:17.720> or<00:04:17.900> something<00:04:18.260> and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
until like the 10 mil or something and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.110 
until like the 10 mil or something and
then<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:18.650> dumped<00:04:18.979> third<00:04:19.370> email<00:04:19.549> from<00:04:19.880> another

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
then I dumped third email from another

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.930 
then I dumped third email from another
account<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.630> akers<00:04:20.870> free<00:04:21.049> trade<00:04:21.289> returned

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
account and akers free trade returned

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.520 
account and akers free trade returned
most<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.120> guys<00:04:23.180> won't<00:04:23.870> probably<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.320> able

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
most of you guys won't probably be able

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.110 
most of you guys won't probably be able
to<00:04:24.590> do<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.830> so<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.099> would<00:04:25.340> recommend<00:04:25.490> just

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
to do that so I would recommend just

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.460 
to do that so I would recommend just
flew<00:04:26.659> in

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
flew in
