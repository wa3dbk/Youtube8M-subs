00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.230
 How are you? 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.789
 they have several types of lousy schools 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.010
 here plus the girl jorge alexandre 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.550
 things well 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.550
 the table 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.760
 we do not have this culture happens unitary 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.450
 of walls 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.450
 Let's try to do this on a wall. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.250
 if the kiss 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.250
 face are already 26 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.210
 away from home 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.780
 but it was nothing 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.420
 so let's say you closed the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.489
 your kiss on a luiza 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.940
 there you will see when giving kiss will 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.940
 put that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.830
 I left it near here 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.310
 The goal is a kiss, call me in the afternoon. 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.430
 It is interesting that it was in a key of 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.570
 trash mouth to help me close well 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.380
 best 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.380
 the kiss 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.409
 op caco versus daughter the day 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:07.619
 but let's get this structure said 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:09.360
 Teacher call will fly there, too. 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.880
 easy game to do 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:19.270
 there is the record of the table 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.270
 It's like rain 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.010
 Key won two plates of 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:30.230
 machinery and a penny is called 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.849
 as we see here 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.970
 the bruise but very much facilitates 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.239
 radio you go 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.260
 rafael Brazil is right and still 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.129
 global 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.799
 the country the cell 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.189
 I want her to come out today. 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.379
 combining that way and I'll adjust and 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.840
 You had to make it stay in place. 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:02.629
 Where I wish the boot is well 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.629
 enough and that's where we have the 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.459
 end bolts 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.549
 they must vote on the trail here behind 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.760
 comes the side screw it touches on the 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.370
 trio and a screw crosshead to escape 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.609
 central it should lean on the engine city 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.920
 Doing this right from now on either 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.859
 to say humor i know if it will regulate 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.720
 laterality of the land what I want 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.030
 to say with this let's explain better 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.299
 let's suppose the drawing is on the screen 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.400
 decentralize there what you can do 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:43.889
 you put the most populated machete and 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.730
 You can play on the screen but pro to eac. 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.730
 stamping understood as that we 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.780
 we work as the key is the same 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.709
 exactly 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.959
 It is the open key to whoever is 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.990
 starting with a little more complicated 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.080
 Why do you need to do this year? 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.860
 The way we have it here 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.860
 so I'll show 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:16.510
 We'll regulate here again and then 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.580
 logically here I'm showing you 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.730
 you do not 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.560
 but for there to be no confusion you are 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.570
 stay different here 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.570
 where was mine by day had taken days? 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:39.040
 You're going to stall the shirt. 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.380
 that of the lake covers the cell with 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.240
 and then changed the shirt here from 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.490
 Good bass and he showed me here to 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.060
 but we will not logically use 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.300
 when was his grave obese shed 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.620
 patent for its role we garrify and 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.199
 we 'll zoom in 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.300
 We're going to pass on permanent glue reminder. 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:08.470
 We'll pass the glass stay here. 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:14.310
 let's wear some family t-shirt 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.310
 g1 that are longer and her adult 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:29.260
 click here to enjoy in the humor section 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:33.729
 he uses the side screws on the trio 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:37.389
 and there booths I came back cover she thinks she has 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.660
 not dry the screen and there 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.270
 I changed the shirt, that's what I 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.760
 to know if this is the way it should be 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.760
 mounted until the next day of the counter
