00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
right there you see proof that's our

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.330 
right there you see proof that's our
joke<00:02:03.390> he's<00:02:03.630> really<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> best<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:04.920> he

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
joke he's really not the best of what he

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980 
joke he's really not the best of what he
works<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> took<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.810> out

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
works on it but when you took it out

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.540 
works on it but when you took it out
right<00:02:07.140> around<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:07.979> dirty<00:02:08.250> right

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
right around it was pretty dirty right

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550 
right around it was pretty dirty right
at<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> collective<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:10.080> really<00:02:10.379> dirty

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
at a collective it is it's really dirty

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
at a collective it is it's really dirty
in<00:02:10.739> fact<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.310> still<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.849> my<00:02:11.910> carbon<00:02:12.360> testing

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
in fact it's still in my carbon testing

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.090 
in fact it's still in my carbon testing
it<00:02:12.959> out<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
it out for you and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.860 
it out for you and
actually<00:02:14.400> found<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:15.060> better<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
actually found it it's better for the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
actually found it it's better for the
kids<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.470> far<00:02:16.710> as<00:02:16.830> protecting<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.400> seat<00:02:17.610> from

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
kids as far as protecting the seat from

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.880 
kids as far as protecting the seat from
children<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:18.810> there's<00:02:19.170> an<00:02:19.320> extra<00:02:19.590> advantage

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
children so there's an extra advantage

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.980 
children so there's an extra advantage
that<00:02:20.400> folks<00:02:21.390> might<00:02:21.570> want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.780> think<00:02:21.870> about

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
that folks might want to think about

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.240 
that folks might want to think about
keep<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.560> mind<00:02:22.590> though<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.920> need<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
keep in mind though you need that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.250 
keep in mind though you need that
adjustable<00:02:23.850> headrest<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.690> bench<00:02:24.930> style

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
adjustable headrest and that bench style

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.660 
adjustable headrest and that bench style
seat<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.070> work<00:02:26.310> has<00:02:26.520> other

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
seat for it to really work has other

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.130 
seat for it to really work has other
people<00:02:26.970> who<00:02:27.120> don't<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.660> do<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.080> have

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
people who don't have that do not have

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.740 
people who don't have that do not have
as<00:02:28.620> good<00:02:28.800> things<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.310> say<00:02:29.340> about<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.450> think

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
as good things to say about that I think

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.720 
as good things to say about that I think
it<00:02:31.020> would<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> failing<00:02:31.620> grade<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.250> think

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it would be a failing grade but I think

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.600 
it would be a failing grade but I think
Stefan<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.180> Melvin<00:02:33.510> Jim<00:02:34.070> quick<00:02:35.070> question<00:02:35.520> i

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
Stefan and Melvin Jim quick question i

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.940 
Stefan and Melvin Jim quick question i
missed<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:36.000> maybe<00:02:36.210> i<00:02:36.330> missed<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.590> good

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
missed it maybe i missed it is it good

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.000 
missed it maybe i missed it is it good
for<00:02:37.980> leather<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.880> cloth<00:02:39.210> seats<00:02:40.020> i<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.920> it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
for leather and cloth seats i think it

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
for leather and cloth seats i think it
would<00:02:41.130> work<00:02:41.160> i<00:02:41.760> think<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.240> because<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.660> covers

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
would work i think so because it covers

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.810 
would work i think so because it covers
it<00:02:43.110> entirely<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.190> protects<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
it entirely and so it protects it and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.970 
it entirely and so it protects it and
it's<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.180> really<00:02:45.360> thick<00:02:45.690> canvas<00:02:46.170> no<00:02:46.350> i<00:02:46.380> think<00:02:46.650> it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
it's a really thick canvas no i think it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.200 
it's a really thick canvas no i think it
would<00:02:47.130> work<00:02:47.160> as<00:02:47.490> long<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.820> you've<00:02:47.940> got<00:02:47.970> that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
would work as long as you've got that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.180 
would work as long as you've got that
headrest<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.840> attach<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.320> that's<00:02:49.830> good<00:02:50.010> are

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
headrest to attach it that's good are

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400 
headrest to attach it that's good are
