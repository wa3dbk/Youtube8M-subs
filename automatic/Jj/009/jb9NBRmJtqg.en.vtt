don't actually see what happens when I
do<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.010> let's<00:03:41.160> look<00:03:41.459> at<00:03:41.580> these<00:03:41.670> things<00:03:41.940> get

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
do it so let's look at these things get

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.060 
do it so let's look at these things get
about<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.420> get<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:43.260> guess<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:44.040> just

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
about to get I guess this is just

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.150 
about to get I guess this is just
insane<00:03:44.490> damage<00:03:45.330> oh<00:03:45.660> look<00:03:46.290> at<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.920> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
insane damage oh look at all that I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.220 
insane damage oh look at all that I
don't<00:03:47.760> really<00:03:48.000> feel<00:03:48.270> like<00:03:48.300> I'm<00:03:48.570> moving<00:03:48.660> faster

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
don't really feel like I'm moving faster

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.610 
don't really feel like I'm moving faster
and<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:50.100> don't<00:03:50.250> really<00:03:50.400> see<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.970> or<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:52.500> know

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
and I don't really see it or you know

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.100 
and I don't really see it or you know
notice<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.250> go<00:03:53.430> away<00:03:53.580> either<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:54.480> well<00:03:54.990> way

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
notice it go away either but well way

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.449 
notice it go away either but well way
the<00:03:55.260> other<00:03:55.350> that's<00:03:55.620> what<00:03:55.770> it<00:03:55.860> claims<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.250> do

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
the other that's what it claims to do

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.580 
the other that's what it claims to do
I'm<00:03:56.880> sure<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.630> either<00:03:57.930> working<00:03:58.290> as<00:03:58.410> intended

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
I'm sure it's either working as intended

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.040 
I'm sure it's either working as intended
or<00:03:58.980> broken<00:03:59.459> one<00:03:59.640> or<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.880> other<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.060> those<00:04:00.900> are

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
or broken one or the other but those are

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.910 
or broken one or the other but those are
the<00:04:01.140> buffs<00:04:01.350> now<00:04:01.530> let's<00:04:01.740> talk<00:04:01.860> about

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
the buffs now let's talk about

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.590 
the buffs now let's talk about
implications<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.820> way<00:04:02.970> I'm<00:04:03.120> looking<00:04:03.270> at<00:04:03.540> it

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
implications the way I'm looking at it

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.300 
implications the way I'm looking at it
is<00:04:03.780> no<00:04:04.260> matter<00:04:04.410> if<00:04:04.620> you're<00:04:04.709> playing<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.010> new<00:04:05.160> new

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
is no matter if you're playing a new new

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.640 
is no matter if you're playing a new new
jungle<00:04:05.640> new<00:04:06.300> new<00:04:06.420> topper<00:04:06.870> med<00:04:07.050> still<00:04:07.380> or

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
jungle new new topper med still or

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.010 
jungle new new topper med still or
perhaps<00:04:07.830> even<00:04:08.100> new<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.520> support<00:04:09.000> all<00:04:09.360> these

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
perhaps even new to support all these

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.510 
perhaps even new to support all these
buffs<00:04:10.320> are<00:04:10.470> relevant<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.040> think<00:04:11.310> about<00:04:11.489> it

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
buffs are relevant and think about it

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.790 
buffs are relevant and think about it
this<00:04:11.670> way<00:04:11.730> right<00:04:11.970> say<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.470> know<00:04:13.590> this

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
this way right say you you know this

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.860 
this way right say you you know this
tower<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.190> down<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.820> lot<00:04:15.300> of<00:04:15.420> team<00:04:15.600> fights

seeds in this tower you come in here you

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.030 
seeds in this tower you come in here you
get<00:04:21.540> this<00:04:21.720> book<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.169> eat<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.890> guy

get a bit of health back come back it
makes<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.470> big<00:04:25.650> difference<00:04:25.710> if<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.669> don't<00:04:26.850> have

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
makes a big difference if you don't have

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.470 
makes a big difference if you don't have
the<00:04:27.120> buff

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
the buff

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.150

all the team fights you're doing it

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.380 
all the team fights you're doing it
wrong<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.490> be<00:04:29.610> honest<00:04:29.850> for<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.270> what<00:04:30.360> I

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
wrong to be honest for you know what I

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.930 
wrong to be honest for you know what I
mean<00:04:30.420> I<00:04:30.810> guess<00:04:31.560> unless<00:04:31.740> your<00:04:32.010> support<00:04:32.460> then

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
mean I guess unless your support then

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.610 
mean I guess unless your support then
you<00:04:33.060> really<00:04:33.270> should<00:04:33.420> probably<00:04:34.020> just<00:04:34.200> focus<00:04:34.530> on

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
you really should probably just focus on

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.530 
you really should probably just focus on
getting<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:35.010> but<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.760> don't<00:04:36.000> have<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> kill

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
getting that but you don't have to kill

the<00:04:36.720> minions<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.230> don't<00:04:37.500> have<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.680> kill<00:04:38.010> the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
the minions you don't have to kill the

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.280 
the minions you don't have to kill the
creeps<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.520> get<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:39.330> could<00:04:39.540> easily<00:04:39.720> all

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
creeps to get it you could easily all

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.320 
creeps to get it you could easily all
these<00:04:40.920> targets<00:04:41.370> have<00:04:41.520> one<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.000> can<00:04:42.180> kill

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
another thing you you survive the buffs
