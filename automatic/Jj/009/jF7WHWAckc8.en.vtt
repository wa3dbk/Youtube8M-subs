00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello guys robe sell and today i am 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 here with a new one I wanted to explain to you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.000
 that how we think that I don't know why 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.369
 there is still that screenflow window 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 here we close many males think 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.750
 maybe someone is already there for many 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.789
 they think what kind of image like this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 I let it run either by hand 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.800
 with gigantic constructions also in 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.840
 survival has nothing to do with it 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.850
 survival is always with a program 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.790
 are made that pours some you will see 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 what do I show you this way 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.770
 it would have taken 50,000 years to do it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 life poured out a life but seriously the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.649
 life according to him i put faraway stuff 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.930
 stannard ata here maybe there is that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.910
 change a little from inside is like I did 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.820
 here type that one modified a little 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.260
 I did not like that is not where the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.890
 I have yet to change growth of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.360
 days you see here was open for 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 first show that you go down that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.000
 maybe I want to do a kustom up or 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.270
 modified a little then I will also modify 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.030
 a little here have already modified a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.150
 but the bridge did not do it a little 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 I did when this piece here 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.380
 as on a little bit of blocks you see 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.140
 I would have no news around doing it but 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.360
 also in survival you can do and to do 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:41.549
 this one uses a program named me 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.530
 kate in fact now seeing then one 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.030
 kind of tutorial is flooded everything 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:54.570
 so practically take you move yes 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:02:00.530
 they use the vas keys in their eggs even at 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:04.170
 left of right s left and left 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.550
 if back seen with acting then 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.350
 let's recap or forward left s 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.350
 back right 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.230
 then if we press the right we move 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.010
 so if we press the ds mou by mail 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.160
 mouse now I'm finished a mess 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.980
 here now here are the blocks of 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.920
 earth, however, does nothing let them lose 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.710
 it's practically you have to download 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.450
 medical now this was the others are not 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.020
 also what they are 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:43.160

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:45.950
 let's leave it, you have to go to import 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:52.380
 download that first all the schematic 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.030

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.010
 everything here is imported sails put 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.680
 here centa that in the world you open that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.830
 at the beginning there should be more than 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.770
 program and reopen it so I do 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:25.080
 see while we check three minutes 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:30.540
 It opened we have this window 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:34.080
 this is the 0.85 64 bit 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.400

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:49.200
 this charm and lumino where the will be born 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.770
 your least when entering the world you 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.010
 go ahead and choose now I don't 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.840
 I put nothing for nothing 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:08.430
 I leave it if I leave you and do 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:11.670
 so crushed amount and then later after 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.230
 having done in the harbor crushed you will do 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.000
 a whole load this one we have 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.630
 put 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.870
 quite a lot even so though for sure 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.530
 so sure we will put more of it up here 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:30.430
 some are four cubes if you do 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.430
 you are on the mac cmd if you are suillus cdl 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.500
 ctrl would not know why it is called not 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:45.770
 I always called her figures there 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:48.830
 we find the cucumber fate save solves 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.930
 in the world and now he saved me so 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.090
 but not imported so it didn't 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.940
 put nothing to save me 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.340
 Important minecraft does not have to be 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.280
 open when you do these things you work 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.320
 or if you have this minecraft behind 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.860
 open in the door whether it is on the world 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:11.919
 whether it is here it must be closed by 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.919
 all I call it still so it must be 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.979
 I practically do it imported e 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.910
 then close or leave too 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.260
 open 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.110
 go to minecraft in yours 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.580
 construction will be completely executed 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.580
 without any problem 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.820
 this is all from and Arabic 92 20 is a 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.200
 small a little explanation then 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.479
 maybe they are also the tutorial of 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.090
 meredith 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.870
