00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.940
 9 million here in england, too, i wanted 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.670
 do not give up my plants too 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.380
 when it's going to be the cold season now 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.480
 I thought maybe I can 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.719
 a few tomatoes and a cucumber on 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.590
 breeding windows and I 'm up for it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.020
 so sorts brought the very small 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.750
 stay so only 30 cm high 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.470
 or so that's the tiny turner 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 and the microform they need too 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.700
 a while until they come up 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.620
 I find myself a f1 hybrid cucumber variety 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.770
 got the has been very nice 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.700
 developed so far and the two here 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.559
 are for today's so the name is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 apparently also everything 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.270
 Sown at the same time and the 42 days 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.170
 versions here are already clear 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.430
 continue to get as the two here 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.780
 this corner but also a small one 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.790
 a little more light yes the problem is 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 I'm more or less on the here 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.200
 north side in my room and have too 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 none in the rest of the apartment 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.790
 really good opportunity found mine 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.229
 to represent plant 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.840
 that means yes it is a double 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.299
 Experiments are enough 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.070
 winter sun out and then reaches in the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.689
 principle completely in direct sun 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 that's what the plants do 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.659
 become 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.390
 I have a bit of liquid fertilizer 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.369
 taken and the plants get 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.420
 also under water 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.060
 otherwise I will not care much there 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 but I'm completely so far 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.220
 Excited because it seems pretty good 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.540
 fold 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.140
 I am now for about a week 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.700
 here and as the plants 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.409
 they took it there 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 very small cyclical had just the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.710
 first two little leaves here sees 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.140
 you are still here it here so now times 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.700
 curious if that will be 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.280
 keep you informed so keep it up 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.100
 It's been a month now 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.080
 and yes I was lucky september 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.950
 extremely mild 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.209
 Now you can see the plants are one 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.630
 whole piece grown 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.450
 all but the microform here it is 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.870
 not so much but that happens 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.870
 cucumber 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.880
 It's a bit difficult to do 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:41.420
 get the hammer that grows and grows 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:46.370
 and growing has countless ones 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.930
 female flowers allegedly all 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.800
 already feared to be 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.420
 So the cucumber had only two male 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.260
 flowers right at the beginning 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.680
 that's exactly where I did it off and on 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.680
 yes, you can also see here 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:17.030
 focus is a bit difficult na ja 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.750
 right now already the first bloom of the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.750
 tomato 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:32.090
 and in this case even the basf 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.380
 moment exactly so soon it starts 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.760
 not only with the cucumber but also with 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.400
 the tomatoes and I'm really curious 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.730
 unfortunately, from the end of the week then too 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.030
 that means a lot of rain again 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.130
 then yes on time with the october comes 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.290
 Not so much as I am 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.069
 really curious 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.640
 Maybe it will be with the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.400
 experiment the pots are pretty small 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.870
 but I use liquid fertilizer and that 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 to balance a bit and so far 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.980
 do you like this window seat 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.610
 possible very well so here again 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.590
 is the microform it is such a 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.720
 I think it's a bush tomato one 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.380
 sees that too very different than that 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.160
 the others 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.610
 here a bit tall 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:27.539
 Unfortunately I have for today's name 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.830
 forget any hybrid cucumber that 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:34.190
 Here is the tiny tim that makes itself 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.190
 quite well 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.479
 Oh , he already has flowers cool and 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.300
 this is the other one for today's that 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.810
 has a bit more shade 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.300
 but I 'm also okay yes 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.570
 the next video then hopefully if 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.950
 I can show some fruits 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.950
 That's my greetings from the north
