00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
become warped in two sections right

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.789 
become warped in two sections right
around<00:02:12.510> where<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> plug<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.290> into<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.650> air

headphones<00:02:16.830> I'm<00:02:17.100> not<00:02:17.430> sure<00:02:17.610> how<00:02:17.790> these<00:02:17.940> became

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
headphones I'm not sure how these became

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
headphones I'm not sure how these became
warped<00:02:18.660> because<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:18.989> don't<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.620> use<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> wire

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
warped because I don't really use a wire

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.220 
warped because I don't really use a wire
connection<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.730> much<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.090> typically<00:02:21.510> tend<00:02:22.079> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
connection that much I typically tend to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.930 
connection that much I typically tend to
use<00:02:22.410> these<00:02:22.590> wirelessly<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.489> listen<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> their

music the part of the headphone that I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.979 
music the part of the headphone that I
think<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.010> become<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.549> biggest<00:02:26.970> issue<00:02:27.450> as

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
think can become the biggest issue as

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.780 
think can become the biggest issue as
far<00:02:28.049> as<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> design<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.799> concerned<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.549> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
far as the design is concerned is the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.789 
far as the design is concerned is the
air<00:02:29.970> cylinder<00:02:30.269> now<00:02:30.900> these<00:02:31.110> are<00:02:31.260> over<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> ear

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
air cylinder now these are over the ear

air cylinder now these are over the ear
headphones<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.610> they<00:02:33.150> said<00:02:33.450> find<00:02:33.720> over<00:02:33.959> my

headphones and they said find over my

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.590 
headphones and they said find over my
ear<00:02:34.380> but<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> pretty<00:02:35.430> close<00:02:35.730> fit<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.329> my

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
ears on the smaller side so I can see

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.460 
ears on the smaller side so I can see
somebody<00:02:38.820> with<00:02:39.150> bigger<00:02:39.450> ears<00:02:39.780> possibly

where<00:02:51.239> they<00:02:51.329> lose<00:02:51.600> points<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
where they lose points is that the

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.970 
where they lose points is that the
auxiliary<00:02:53.670> cord<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.420> warped<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:55.769> see

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
auxiliary cord is warped and I can see

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.130 
auxiliary cord is warped and I can see
that<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.640> air<00:02:56.940> cut<00:02:57.299> can<00:02:57.570> be<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> little<00:02:57.959> bit

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
that this air cut can be a little bit

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.960 
that this air cut can be a little bit
uncomfortable<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:58.799> some<00:02:59.010> people<00:02:59.640> after<00:02:59.940> a

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.650 

okay<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.669> only<00:04:24.820> do<00:04:25.000> these<00:04:25.120> headphones<00:04:25.540> get

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
okay so not only do these headphones get

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.120 
okay so not only do these headphones get
the<00:04:25.810> shortest<00:04:26.259> bluetooth<00:04:26.620> distance<00:04:26.979> that

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
the shortest bluetooth distance that

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.370 
the shortest bluetooth distance that
I've<00:04:27.220> ever<00:04:27.430> tested<00:04:27.850> but<00:04:28.540> they<00:04:28.810> constantly

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
I've ever tested but they constantly

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.090 
I've ever tested but they constantly
chip<00:04:29.710> out

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
chip out

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.920 
chip out
I<00:04:30.130> mean<00:04:30.490> indoors<00:04:30.910> outdoors<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.539> doesn't<00:04:31.810> make

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
I mean indoors outdoors it doesn't make

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.300 
I mean indoors outdoors it doesn't make
a<00:04:31.960> difference<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.800> seems<00:04:33.070> like<00:04:33.190> you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
a difference and it seems like you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.370 
a difference and it seems like you
almost<00:04:33.460> have<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.729> sit<00:04:33.970> entirely<00:04:34.449> still<00:04:34.900> to

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
almost have to sit entirely still to

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.990 
almost have to sit entirely still to
guarantee<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.889> they<00:04:36.009> won't<00:04:36.190> chip<00:04:36.460> out<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.850> I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
guarantee that they won't chip out and I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.850 
guarantee that they won't chip out and I
still<00:04:37.389> don't<00:04:37.600> feel<00:04:37.690> confident<00:04:38.229> now<00:04:38.590> these

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
still don't feel confident now these

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.620 
still don't feel confident now these
headphones<00:04:39.039> do<00:04:39.370> have<00:04:39.610> airplane<00:04:40.270> mode<00:04:40.449> which

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
headphones do have airplane mode which

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.820 
headphones do have airplane mode which
basically<00:04:40.660> activates<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.590> sound

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
basically activates the sound

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.770 
basically activates the sound
cancellation<00:04:42.130> but<00:04:42.850> doesn't<00:04:43.300> utilize<00:04:43.600> the

18 hours of battery life now there's

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.860 
18 hours of battery life now there's
this<00:04:47.919> pressure<00:04:48.280> sensor<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:49.030> also<00:04:49.270> mutes<00:04:49.810> the

these are some cool headphones and if

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.240 
these are some cool headphones and if
you<00:07:13.080> want<00:07:13.259> to<00:07:13.319> test<00:07:13.469> them<00:07:13.650> out<00:07:13.740> I<00:07:13.949> mean<00:07:14.099> that's

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
you want to test them out I mean that's

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.730 
you want to test them out I mean that's
up<00:07:14.400> to<00:07:14.550> you<00:07:14.699> but<00:07:15.240> these<00:07:15.750> overall<00:07:16.229> get<00:07:16.409> a<00:07:16.440> six

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
up to you but these overall get a six

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.490 
up to you but these overall get a six
point<00:07:17.009> six<00:07:17.340> and<00:07:17.610> you<00:07:18.389> know<00:07:18.539> they're<00:07:19.080> not<00:07:19.289> for

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
point six and you know they're not for

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.230 
point six and you know they're not for
everybody<00:07:19.740> but<00:07:20.009> I<00:07:20.370> think<00:07:20.460> some<00:07:20.849> people<00:07:20.940> will

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240

love<00:07:21.419> them
