00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
 we are in the presence 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.880
 two-piece moving usually 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.970
 in a case like the one you have on your screens or before a 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.749
 elastic bungalow that is mounted 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.000
 so for wax 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.090
 of the tree you know very well that mounting the elastic nanny 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.970
 requires obligatorily 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.330
 therefore this game is translated to the big apparently by a displacement therefore 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.060
 alternate 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.740
 by a displacement of the hub in this case since we are in the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.930
 neighborhood is a medium-round system in circles 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 a displacement of the hub on the right and on the left 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.620
 we are of course always concerned by the minimum value he 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.250
 so the game will be minimal when 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.270
 so the hub will be 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.760
 pushed to the far left therefore we European contact 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.670
 the left roll 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.730
 shoulder 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.220
 so let's start the route 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.620
 of this string of odds 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.160
 we're going to start at the origin of the coast conditions on 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.400
 the benchmarks tree 1 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.090
 that we are going so 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.590
 take for steps up 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 until first contact with the reperd bearing 2 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.509
 we will then take 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.020
 The thickness of the loctudy bearing of the badr spacers reperd 4 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 the second bearing 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.430
 followed 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
 the dimension relative to the lid 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.600
 and there we will of course have determined 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.580
 the rating 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.800
 minimums returning to the main currencies 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.390
 turn to the main menu and take the example a word that is relative to the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.350
 bearing assembly rotating shafts 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.289
 so there for you see it we are in the presence of a system 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.590
 arnaud turning 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590
 on which we have 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.970
 the same constraint so 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.800
 a piece on the hold% we are forced to provide a game to ensure 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.400
 a good functioning 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.790
 as you see the tree 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 so rezo colors 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.770
 the opportunity to move 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.940
 from left to right 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.000
 because of the essential game so the operation at the rings 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.969
 outside 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.499
 of the bearing 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.849
 as always we are concerned with the minimum game 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.529
 the condition she is between 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.239
 there the benchmarks piece and the lid 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.129
 we find two 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.249
 the origin of the rib conditions and that on the crate 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.089
 so we'll start from that room 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.539
 to take first place the first coast that is 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.159
 on 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.709
 at the first dimension so the shoulder up to reach the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.459
 first piece which is the late bearing 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.069
 we will then take the thickness of the bearing 3 the spacer ring 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.599
 ropert 4 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.729
 the last 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:51.069
 so where the mans at the far right who of course is in contact with the 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.519
 cover which we take the thickness 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.379
 we also predict the thickness of the rods of settings quickly 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.120
 we will return with 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.180
 the dimension relative to the key 5 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.819
 which represents the building 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.809
 of course we close the string of odds with the thickness of the last 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.039
 cover late 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:15.109
 so we will have obtained of course the minimum value of the game 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.689
 what is the value that interests us
