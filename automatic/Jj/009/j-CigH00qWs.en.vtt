00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.650
 the main risk 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.440
 help the school 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 and 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.680
 an important find a nice atmosphere is reasonably important 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.570
 what's going on 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.570
 tip the newspaper 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 is a fall but I don't think there is 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.780
 What is that then 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 very cosy 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.850
 but the approach 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.970
 most important thing is to vote differently 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.899
 what is this 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.899
 he is done with learning the new child again 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.220
 it all the most important 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280
 that I harvest something 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 that can mean 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 I thought so too 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.870
 the rotterdammers 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.130
 currently wearing 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
 a bit busy 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.540
 yes i will go later in the future 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.540
 that follows an earlier theft 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.130
 the Department 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.130
 and people make the school 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.470
 earlier 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 because come to us and then anyway 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.239
 the players and drivers with shoes 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.379
 the Christian Union is European football 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.819
 the knee that he got did not get through his debt often 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.689
 that is quite possible 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.779
 that's why I'm completely different 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.659
 passed away 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.859
 very good following 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.859
 I suppose you can't agree 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:35.879
 of the children 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.909
 he did that 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.779
 ex scolded 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.199
 and 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.900
 I know myself too 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.630
 as a kennedy streaming service agenda authenticity all in all a week 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.309
 that does not anticipate in a start-up phase 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.309
 are you a connoisseur effective 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.799
