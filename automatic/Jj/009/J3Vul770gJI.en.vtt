00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.650 

the<00:02:11.760> very<00:02:11.970> lowest<00:02:12.209> string

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.000 

and<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:46.970> really<00:02:47.360> always<00:02:47.810> very<00:02:48.319> exciting<00:02:48.890> as

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
and it's really always very exciting as

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.740 
and it's really always very exciting as
a<00:02:49.040> performer<00:02:49.670> because<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.150> really<00:02:50.600> never

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
a performer because you really never

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.000 
a performer because you really never
know<00:02:50.990> if<00:02:51.110> you're<00:02:51.230> going<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.380> hit<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.560> top

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
know if you're going to hit that top

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.640 
know if you're going to hit that top
notes<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.630> actually<00:02:53.780> counted<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.410> think

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
notes and I actually counted I think

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.449 
notes and I actually counted I think
it's<00:02:54.800> five<00:02:55.459> hundred<00:02:55.489> half<00:02:56.030> octaves<00:02:57.459> this

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it's five hundred half octaves this

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.880 
it's five hundred half octaves this
scale<00:02:58.970> all<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.300> way<00:02:59.450> up<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.930> top<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.770> I

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
scale all the way up to the top and I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.290 
scale all the way up to the top and I
think<00:03:00.950> really<00:03:01.220> they're<00:03:01.520> very<00:03:01.550> very<00:03:02.090> few

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
think really they're very very few

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.600 
think really they're very very few
instruments<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.170> can<00:03:03.739> actually<00:03:03.980> achieve

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
instruments that can actually achieve

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:16.870 
instruments that can actually achieve
that<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:06.100> hey<00:03:07.150> cello

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.940 

you
