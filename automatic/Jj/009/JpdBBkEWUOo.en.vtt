lately I like to make more frit and I
like<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> fruit<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.160> enric

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
like to make a lot of fruit and enric

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.330 
like to make a lot of fruit and enric
who<00:00:38.370> come<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.329> device<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.170> has<00:00:43.340> an

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
who come out with this device it has an

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.569 
who come out with this device it has an
opening<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> pipe<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> foot<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
opening like a pipe with a foot on the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
opening like a pipe with a foot on the
bottom<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.690> best<00:00:48.930> part<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.590> actually

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
bottom and the best part is actually

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.150 
bottom and the best part is actually
this<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.510> hollow<00:00:52.050> inside<00:00:52.230> so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this here this is hollow inside so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.850 
this here this is hollow inside so
whatever<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.840> frit<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> go

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
whatever you do the frit is going to go

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.139 
whatever you do the frit is going to go
in<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.550> which<00:00:57.030> makes<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.539> easy<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
in here which makes it really easy to

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
in here which makes it really easy to
pound<00:01:00.149> glass<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.899> course<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.650> iron

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
pound glass and then of course it's iron

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.609 
pound glass and then of course it's iron
and<00:01:05.400> iron<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.090> give<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:07.290> rust

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and iron can give you some rust

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
and iron can give you some rust
particles<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.580> we're<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.180> rid<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
particles and we're going to get rid of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719 
particles and we're going to get rid of
them<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.110> little<00:01:10.500> magnet<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.580> I'll

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
them with this little magnet and I'll

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.340 
them with this little magnet and I'll
show<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> how<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> use<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.840> too

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
show you how to use that too

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
about this tool is this here the sifters

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
about this tool is this here the sifters
and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.210> who<00:01:33.420> said<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.990> need

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
lifters I like the frit to be all

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.330 
lifters I like the frit to be all
different<00:01:37.829> sizes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
different sizes

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.260 
different sizes
yeah<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.560> sifters<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:41.579> favorite

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
yeah right the sifters are my favorite

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.380 
yeah right the sifters are my favorite
part<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.990> tool<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:44.460> come<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.909> four

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
part of this tool now they come in four

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.389 
part of this tool now they come in four
different<00:01:45.420> sizes<00:01:46.790> course<00:01:49.040> little<00:01:50.040> finer

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
different sizes course little finer

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.160 
different sizes course little finer
again<00:01:53.450> somewhat<00:01:54.450> finer<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.219> like<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> screen

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
again somewhat finer and like a screen

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.410 
again somewhat finer and like a screen
what<00:01:58.170> helps<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> sifter<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.060> really

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
what helps with the sifter is the really

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.190 
what helps with the sifter is the really
finest<00:02:00.990> powder<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
finest powder and

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.649 
finest powder and
so<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.469> most<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.070> rest<00:02:03.280> powder<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:04.030> going

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
so the most of the rest powder is going

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.009 
so the most of the rest powder is going
to<00:02:04.780> go<00:02:04.990> in<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:05.439> final<00:02:06.329> through<00:02:07.329> this<00:02:07.479> final

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
to go in this final through this final

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.259 
to go in this final through this final
screen<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.679> most<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.489> its<00:02:09.640> going<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.910> be<00:02:10.030> gone

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
screen and most of its going to be gone

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.160 
screen and most of its going to be gone
and<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.950> will<00:02:12.010> show<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:12.819> they<00:02:13.180> all<00:02:13.390> fit<00:02:13.930> in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
and I will show you so they all fit in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.400 
and I will show you so they all fit in
the<00:02:14.410> right<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.950> directions<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.239> one<00:02:16.510> here

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
the right of directions of this one here

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.970 
the right of directions of this one here
wouldn't<00:02:17.769> be<00:02:17.830> too<00:02:18.129> good<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:18.430> please<00:02:19.980> the

wouldn't be too good for please the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.320 
wouldn't be too good for please the
screen<00:02:21.610> went<00:02:21.849> down<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:23.050> next<00:02:23.410> finer<00:02:23.739> down

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.270 
then the next size and the force one and
touch<00:02:28.660> that's<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.560> always<00:02:29.799> want<00:02:30.190> to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
touch that's what you always want to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.910 
touch that's what you always want to
have<00:02:31.060> them<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.750> that's<00:02:31.989> always<00:02:32.500> when<00:02:32.830> you

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
have them in and that's always when you

00:02:32.920 --> 00:03:00.230 
have them in and that's always when you
store<00:02:33.250> them<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.640> then<00:02:33.790> becomes<00:02:34.590> easy

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:38.290 

I<00:03:24.470> wanna<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.220> how<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.640> little<00:03:26.880> goal<00:03:27.770> m15

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.970 

put<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.600> trip<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.320> here<00:03:44.510> this<00:03:45.510> summer<00:03:46.140> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
put this trip in here this summer and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.820 
put this trip in here this summer and
you<00:03:47.010> can<00:03:47.130> see<00:03:47.670> maybe<00:03:48.240> I'm<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.380> sure<00:03:49.440> maybe<00:03:49.980> not

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
you can see maybe I'm not sure maybe not

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.460 
you can see maybe I'm not sure maybe not
there<00:03:52.830> are<00:03:52.950> little<00:03:53.130> black<00:03:53.610> dots<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.270> here<00:03:54.570> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
there are little black dots in here and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.320 
there are little black dots in here and
those<00:03:55.710> would<00:03:55.980> come<00:03:56.220> out<00:03:56.340> with<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.610> magnet<00:03:57.150> but

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
those would come out with a magnet but

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.360 
those would come out with a magnet but
I'm<00:03:57.450> cleaning<00:03:57.960> this<00:03:58.200> here<00:03:58.500> first<00:04:00.560> with<00:04:01.560> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
I'm cleaning this here first with the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.110 
I'm cleaning this here first with the
magnet<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:04.680> forgot<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.490> read<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
magnet and I forgot to read the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.600 
magnet and I forgot to read the
instruction<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:07.350> when<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.560> first<00:04:07.830> did<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.370> net

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
instruction so when I first did it a net

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.370 
instruction so when I first did it a net
took<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.970> magnet<00:04:09.360> out<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> little<00:04:10.140> bat

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
took the magnet out of the little bat

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.450 
took the magnet out of the little bat
and<00:04:11.510> put<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.870> my<00:04:12.900> glass<00:04:13.380> what<00:04:13.800> happened<00:04:14.280> was

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
and put it in my glass what happened was

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.729 
and put it in my glass what happened was
I<00:04:14.490> had<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.820> hardest<00:04:15.300> time<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.870> clean<00:04:16.170> the<00:04:16.320> magnet

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
I had a hardest time to clean the magnet

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.670 
I had a hardest time to clean the magnet
so<00:04:17.340> keep<00:04:17.670> it<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> plastic<00:04:18.210> and<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.900> will

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
so keep it in the plastic and you will

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.170 
so keep it in the plastic and you will
have<00:04:19.950> easy<00:04:20.340> cleanup<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.580> magnet<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.150> a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
have easy cleanup so the magnet is a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.450 
have easy cleanup so the magnet is a
very<00:04:24.480> strong<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:25.290> it'll<00:04:25.680> take<00:04:26.010> care<00:04:26.040> of

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
very strong one so it'll take care of

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.280 
very strong one so it'll take care of
all<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.780> iron<00:04:28.590> dust<00:04:29.420> I've<00:04:30.420> done<00:04:30.930> several

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
all the iron dust I've done several

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.620 
all the iron dust I've done several
fruit<00:04:31.770> cookies<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.520> they<00:04:32.640> were<00:04:32.700> pretty<00:04:33.180> clean

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
fruit cookies and they were pretty clean

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.890 
fruit cookies and they were pretty clean

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
tell here two sizes mix I'm not sure but

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.629 
tell here two sizes mix I'm not sure but
when<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:05.100> my

when up my
is<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.389> have<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.689> scepters<00:05:07.199> you<00:05:07.349> can

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:07.499 
is that you have the scepters you can

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:10.249 
is that you have the scepters you can
always<00:05:07.710> separate<00:05:08.639> them<00:05:08.849> again<00:05:09.180> but<00:05:09.900> this<00:05:10.050> is

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259
