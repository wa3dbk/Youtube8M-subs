 You are here and I'm taking a video of the answer right now. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.150

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.720
 I made it. 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 The question is, what effect does it have now 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.710
 If you want it , this letter goes through the second arm 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:26.320
 This is not the end of the 1500s when required, it continues to do so, leading to continuous 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:31.970
 You were curious about the effect. 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:37.540
 So I made this effect once in a while. 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:41.800
 The process of making it is not so difficult. 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:48.580
 I also'm going to be easy to make 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.210

 If this causes a problem that is now pressing on the overlap so that walk 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 To prevent 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:01.769
 Because of the point letter and the second white white night, 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.930
 I will do it in white and underneath. 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:09.469

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.469

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:18.560

 Amway speed is this speed 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:16.160
