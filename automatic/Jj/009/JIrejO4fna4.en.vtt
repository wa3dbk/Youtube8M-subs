think<00:01:44.050> in<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.230> style<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.620> mark<00:01:44.800> -<00:01:45.010> midget

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
think in the style of the mark - midget

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.180 
think in the style of the mark - midget
and<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.510> allows<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.410> hood<00:01:47.890> frame

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
and it allows it to have the hood frame

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.830 
and it allows it to have the hood frame
conversion<00:01:48.880> on<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.150> which<00:01:49.240> allows<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.660> hood
