00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.010 
and talked to one of the acting managers
there<00:03:57.810> and

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
there and

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.830 
there and
by<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.650> time<00:03:59.950> I<00:03:59.980> finished<00:04:00.460> my<00:04:00.640> schpeel<00:04:00.970> she

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
by the time I finished my schpeel she

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.450 
by the time I finished my schpeel she
sounded<00:04:02.140> really<00:04:02.260> interesting<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:03.010> again<00:04:03.250> she

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
sounded really interesting but again she

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.740 
sounded really interesting but again she
has<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.670> talk<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.030> next<00:04:04.210> person<00:04:04.540> above

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
has to talk to the next person above

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.360 
has to talk to the next person above
which<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.410> we<00:04:05.500> usually<00:04:05.800> when<00:04:05.920> all<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> stuff

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
which is we usually when all the stuff

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.520 
which is we usually when all the stuff
falls<00:04:06.610> apart<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.420> this<00:04:07.960> is<00:04:08.110> why<00:04:08.230> it's<00:04:08.440> really

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
falls apart so this is why it's really

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.800 
falls apart so this is why it's really
hard<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.340> get<00:04:09.490> into<00:04:09.670> restaurants<00:04:10.420> especially
