max<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.319> doing<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.069> really<00:02:50.400> think<00:02:50.519> he

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
max is doing but I really think he

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.759 
max is doing but I really think he
should<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.209> too<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:51.720> when<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.620> do

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
should do that too because when you do

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.650 
should do that too because when you do
creative<00:02:53.160> stuff<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.120> makes<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
creative stuff it really just makes the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.110 
creative stuff it really just makes the
team<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.980> brings<00:02:56.220> its<00:02:56.459> name<00:02:56.670> like

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
team it's it that brings its name like

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.210 
team it's it that brings its name like
obey<00:02:57.540> has<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.230> name<00:02:58.380> obey<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.980> when<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.130> think

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
obey has the name obey and when I think

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.039 
obey has the name obey and when I think
of<00:02:59.370> obey<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.640> think<00:02:59.880> of<00:02:59.940> creativity<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.660> think<00:03:00.900> of

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
of obey I think of creativity I think of

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.770 
of obey I think of creativity I think of
great<00:03:01.890> leaders<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.400> think<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.670> people<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
great leaders I think of people the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
great leaders I think of people the
leaders<00:03:04.080> especially<00:03:04.380> who<00:03:04.980> love<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.489> interact

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
leaders especially who love to interact

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.910 
leaders especially who love to interact
with<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.269> players<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.599> interact<00:03:07.140> with<00:03:07.349> their

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
with the players and interact with their

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.190 
with the players and interact with their
subscribers<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.580> do<00:03:08.700> live<00:03:08.940> streams<00:03:09.450> scarce

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
subscribers and do live streams scarce

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.530 
subscribers and do live streams scarce
and<00:03:10.380> agony<00:03:10.709> both<00:03:10.920> do<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> lot<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> live<00:03:12.090> streams

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
and agony both do a lot of live streams

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.930 
and agony both do a lot of live streams
and<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.160> look<00:03:14.310> at<00:03:14.400> myself<00:03:14.519> in<00:03:14.819> this

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
and as I look at myself in this

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.580 
and as I look at myself in this
community<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.360> think<00:03:15.420> about<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:16.110> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
community I think about all the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.380 
community I think about all the
experience<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.220> I've<00:03:17.370> had<00:03:17.400> my<00:03:18.150> leading

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
experience that I've had my leading

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.990 
experience that I've had my leading
teams<00:03:18.720> leading<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.170> seven<00:03:19.709> being<00:03:20.010> an<00:03:20.130> SB<00:03:20.549> being

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
teams leading a seven being an SB being

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.180 
teams leading a seven being an SB being
in<00:03:21.150> dere<00:03:21.480> being<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.079> super<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.620> think<00:03:23.040> about

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
in dere being in super I think about

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.860 
in dere being in super I think about
each<00:03:23.370> one<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.760> these<00:03:23.910> teams<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.540> really

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
each one of these teams and I really

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.080 
each one of these teams and I really
think<00:03:25.019> deeply<00:03:25.440> about<00:03:25.709> what<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.670> liked<00:03:26.970> most

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
think deeply about what I liked most

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.360 
think deeply about what I liked most
about<00:03:27.420> these<00:03:27.720> teams<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.320> what<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.799> brought<00:03:29.310> to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
about these teams and what I brought to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.449 
about these teams and what I brought to
the<00:03:29.579> team<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.450> whole<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.160> I'm<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.340> really

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
the team and a whole and I'm not really

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.130 
the team and a whole and I'm not really
sure<00:03:32.549> if<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.239> leaders<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.780> was<00:03:33.989> leading

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
sure if the leaders that I was leading

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.300 
sure if the leaders that I was leading
with<00:03:34.350> agree<00:03:34.709> with<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.980> things<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.250> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
to bring in as much creativity I try to

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.080 
to bring in as much creativity I try to
come<00:03:48.989> up<00:03:49.019> with<00:03:49.109> ideas<00:03:49.290> with<00:03:50.040> dare<00:03:50.400> when<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:50.910> was

come up with ideas with dare when I was

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.940 
come up with ideas with dare when I was
in<00:03:51.120> there<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.690> really<00:03:52.109> wanted<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.410> use<00:03:52.680> their

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
in there I really wanted to use their

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.710 
in there I really wanted to use their
second<00:03:53.370> channel<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.239> people<00:03:54.630> could

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
second channel so that people could

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.330 
second channel so that people could
start<00:03:54.870> uploading<00:03:55.319> gaming<00:03:55.769> content<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.310> that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
start uploading gaming content so that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.949 
start uploading gaming content so that
the<00:03:56.519> players<00:03:56.790> could<00:03:57.120> start<00:03:57.359> exposing<00:03:57.690> their

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
the players could start exposing their

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.170 
the players could start exposing their
channels<00:03:58.260> more<00:03:58.410> with<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.709> huge<00:03:59.180> 250,000

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180

subscribers<00:04:00.269> channel<00:04:00.959> because<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.560> channel

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
subscribers channel because that channel

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.020 
subscribers channel because that channel
is<00:04:01.829> not<00:04:01.920> being<00:04:02.069> used<00:04:02.160> for<00:04:02.489> anything<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.940> I

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
before that was possible so I wasn't

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
like I don't actually think that it's
