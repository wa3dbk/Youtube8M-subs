00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hi to all these rooms guys 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 welcome to this new video on 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.340
 joseph games to start a new one 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.380
 series or on flash floods d'aver in 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 lots of you asked me to do one 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.000
 series so guys are just having 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.039
 urged so much to approve it in 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.720
 past but really given by the bo five 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.369
 together then play for a reason or for 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.529
 another I had no time to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.150
 continue I was obviously still 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 at the beginning of the game but here I would like 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 carry on the series precisely in the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.720
 over time maybe with a maximum one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 two episodes and week however a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.960
 apparently this is our village 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.090
 life here would be perfect if not 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.629
 were it for what it is between giuseppe and another 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.309
 small hand but has it with me or 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.770
 what is it that I have to do or not load of goblin 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 soon we place a fee to defend 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 the village expects what is the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.940
 I remember I really played too long 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.770
 so you have to forgive me if still 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 I have a bit of difficulty understanding 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.359
 how to do it we see a little freight plan are 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 on the computer then be able to 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.260
 to understand how it is done is rather 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.450
 difficult is not the case of being stingy 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.240
 spend a few gems to speed up a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.070
 operations so please remember sta 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
 thing you can say you had 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.150
 use read orta of copies 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 from the attack that no this is not good 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.619
 give yourself a moment is not that the beginning a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.320
 thus record the video on flash of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.729
 we prestige attack and then from when 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.159
 it is still possible to play online 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.520
 rather fine things then guys me 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.170
 I recommend trying to exceed 700 800 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.549
 I like this video in this way 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.710
 to be able to continue the series mi 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.930
 I recommend stupid me so there is more 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.150
 missed a little thank you boss that river is 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 we were pretty we built 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.810
 the village on an underground aquifer 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 this means that the cannon will repair itself 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.670
 alone with the passage of time e 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.540
 even magic good sorcerers 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.680
 of the ivory tower they came 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.630
 our help we destroy the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.870
 goblin bell 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.930
 ok attack then touch several times 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.140
 an empty area to deploy troops 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.050
 we believe start like this or wait wait 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.050
 all forces deployed then grow 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.340
 them the elixir I think you really call 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.980
 guys got me a little difficult 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.360
 understand the game mechanics because 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.880
 I just started 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.620
 however in any case over time I will have to 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.930
 better understand how it works but 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.370
 especially so we won and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.140
 they have total 100 percent we have 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.510
 received a little gold a bit of that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.820
 stuff that looks like shaped 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.770
 water droplets and as I was really saying 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.450
 in many boys you have to give me gods 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.220
 tips because as you have 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.050
 understand they are rather scarce 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.050
 wow good starting now we have to 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.220
 prepare the village for battles 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.500
 Hiring another manufacturer will be able to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.720
 start two buildings 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.390
 simultaneously then shop 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.790
 I owe the builder's hut 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.640
 there is already some admission 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.020
 so let's put it so close 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.730
 the other is the two manufacturers 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.400
 they can live happily together 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.410
 the elixir is essential for training 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.090
 troops build many structures ok 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.930
 it was called elixir the names are wrong 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.780
 then pump or yacob you want elixir appears 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.880
 from the underground stratum we try more for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.400
 this pumping pisa a little I don't know 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.410
 something strange where we put it 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.290
 so guys but leave it here goes 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.209
 complete now together wi fi already consume 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.090
 gems the extract can contain only 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.830
 a small amount of elixir 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.780
 we build storage so you can 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.360
 keep or call I have to build of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.760
 I continue here really guys 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.730
 absolutely give me some advice you have 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.739
 understood that those are scarce 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.690
 you have to help me boy I expect them 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.640
 brothel of comments we also need a 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.340
 safe place to store ours 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.290
 gold reserves builds a deposit but 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.780
 I have to build continuously here then 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.580
 here it is use the boys mouse 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.080
 for me still a little difficult there 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.000
 it takes some time but I can 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.970
 ensure that with some time I will 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.500
 I will get used to it so there are less foreigners 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.690
 goblin dribbling we love gold but not 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.360
 I had no doubt head we need an army 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.629
 to fight goblins let's build one 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.790
 barracks then the barracks and this me 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.040
 requires but does not require me money but me 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.640
 requires the elixir where we put it 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.199
 let 's put it on in this area 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.820
 complete now dropped a man level 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:25.280
 we train troops so that we can 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.870
 pressed doing shit I hope not 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.360
 right group training is completed 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.070
 boys at the beginning is not easy benfatto 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.789
 we're going to punch some snouts 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.550
 green or we start the big attack 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.889
 goblin forest you can deploy more 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.919
 troops at a time holding down with the 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.340
 finger then in my case you will have to keep 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.620
 pressed the mouse button and I think of 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.479
 have done the crap that will last all 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.250
 the troops at the same time because I have 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.669
 held down like it has me 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.039
 recommended the game is therefore I think 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.310
 we are already winning, among other things, guys 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.620
 this is a series I want to propose 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.320
 solely on 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.090
 i second channel just james why 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.830
 I don't think it's a game suitable for 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.050
 first channel however if you want 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.090
 maybe specials or something 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.650
 similar on the first channel until command 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.130
 let me know in the comments 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.660
 back to the village we see then a little 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.790
 how it went the thing was one 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.770
 great battle as we could 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.870
 commemorated in our history 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.490
 tell me you sisters I even have to 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.320
 put a man and attention oh well 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.380
 boy do we put a nice joseph on it 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.110
 so we are all happy here is when 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.440
 and now with them we took the 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.199
 goblin we can improve the town hall 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.410
 so how many true money goes 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.050
 well or 2,500 we make it stingy 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.720
 it improves it's fine as it seems to me 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.520
 takes about a minute from what I know 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.740
 guys I'm game of having always requires 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.199
 long time to complete processes and 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.419
 what of this kind we will know here ok mi 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.789
 he gives money and then I should spend 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.979
 indeed I know eternal that from various 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.620
 many visits joseph do not waste the 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.750
 I know this gems because I really do 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.669
 so many have told me my friends 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.320
 they told me not to consume them though 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.820
 however at the beginning we use 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.039
 good job now you can build 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.360
 new buildings thanks some foods or 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.510
 improved 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.660
 whoever is in the sixth hieratic circle seeks new challenges 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.789
 and touch here and I will please you well 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.400
 with which among other things are strange things 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.560
 so these are the challenges to be faced 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.660
 b now a gold deposit up to level 2 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.370
 win ten stars on the players map 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.440
 single told the council to the boys 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.139
 we have already done so here is how you can 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.780
 note the goals in total are 66 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.490
 boss obviously knows his stuff and has 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.530
 not so much the whole journey 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.410
 indeed the village is what I am traveling 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.410
 then count on you well 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:54.010
 here I can get another elixir here 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.289
 a maximum limit can then train 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.599
 other troops can kiss a bullshit 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:00.490
 training the troops but you precisely 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.860
 continue to attack for the rest 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.590
 I believe we should also start 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.840
 improve something but first 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.480
 episode really are many 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.210
 undecided we look at the store and there are 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.360
 here type other resources other extractors 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.190
 of elixir this could possibly help me 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.870
 you guys have to tell me if I'm doing 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.330
 bullshit or not 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.580
 obviously I believe there will be way to note 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.260
 retrace our steps and understand 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.030
 what is the right strategy for 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.960
 start a little to grow the 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.910
 our village 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.290
 so let's see what they are like 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.930
 we can do something else to improve 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.150
 obviously the deposit of elixirs e 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.340
 this could indeed be a lot 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.530
 very useful so guys get better a 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.930
 flight of course I repeat you must 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.000
 absolutely give me some advice 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.979
 so for now I would say that it can go like this 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.990
 obviously this is a game that 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.240
 takes a long time to get started 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.370
 and therefore it also takes me time to 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.500
 understand how it works though 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.630
 guys through your lines and through
