this is gonna go down so I put my thumb
through<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.249> loop<00:00:39.429> and<00:00:39.609> that<00:00:39.879> seam<00:00:40.210> goes<00:00:40.480> down

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
through the loop and that seam goes down

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.319 
through the loop and that seam goes down
so<00:00:41.890> from<00:00:42.070> here<00:00:42.249> now<00:00:42.309> I'm<00:00:42.670> going<00:00:42.789> to<00:00:42.910> focus<00:00:43.089> on
