 the society in which 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.410
 and that's what they do 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.140
 at the ico chain as institutions like

 I think that's what 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.909
 on the other hand that in 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.659
 apart from the interesting work they may have 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:48.630

 the bird's commitment 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.470
 the attitude they have towards their work is particularly important so 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.469
 the best could be done by much 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.370
 good afternoon

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.680
 well no chance for us again for me 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.610

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.209
 great you can come here and share 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.349

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.539
 and also many congratulations for the session 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.509
 of just a quarter of an hour ago 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.649
 that I really think that has surprised us all very pleasantly see 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.859
 how to get in order 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.109
 a little bit a situation that in what in texas tantín 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.149
 new less 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.959
 and the christ after being videoconferencing and really the agility of how he has 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:41.779
 operated 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.259
 and what I do extensible has not only paid act itself 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.409
 but also to how things 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.969
 have you been organizing that I think it also covered events 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.999
 It is also part of the work of 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.600
 from the cirque architect that not only 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.609
 the ediles of the zone titular this Saturday to the table 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.329
 that there were other architectures 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.010
 among them the texture of the paper that is mental exercise that we do every time 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.659
 what do we do a contest 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.629
 we do not have much confidence in winning it, I have positive confidence, but if not 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.239
 we won lolo we add it to earthquakes in our professional work 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:19.879
 and also 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.919
 this ability of some architects to carry out events 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.269
 d 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.269
 extend your professional work and share it 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.119
 and in that aspect also 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:33.430
 I would like to congratulate 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.400
 every 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.919
 begin 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.660
 that this association the centenary 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.099
 to Barcelona 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.089
 that organizes these awards that have you here exposed 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.709
 i also emphasizes a section that is almost never talked about and that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.549
 also comes from what has gone 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.680
 commenting on the table are opportunities for young people 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.719
 architects 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.859
 how to make your way safely 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.009
 I think the contest is a soto way because it's well supported 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.799
 of the publications not 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.799
 It is also a way to exercise as we said before but he 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.379
 one thing that you have told us today that I believe is part of our 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.049
 curriculum and I think also from many of the young people who 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:14.989
 starts 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.729
 to work is what she goes the ephemeral architecture 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.170
 that there is a section represented 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.100
 and that age is fixed and surely 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.729
 of the people who deliver 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.050
 these contests 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
 now you have to deliver the work avn to this contest 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.460
 they are tragically younger people to contests 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.080
 the elders earn that we all know 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.070
 I also despise cobresal projects which I still consider myself not because 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:40.669
 young 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.900
 but because they say that those of two young people 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.840
 six horns 40 pits like that a few years ago 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.460
 to do it 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.680
 so 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.190
 the almost the only chance we have of doing things not exercising in 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.729
 the contest but to make them 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.159
 is through 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.710
 the scenic montages 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.509
 do not become part of the context in which we are here 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.319
 is a great example of not having walked 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.450
 He has given a lot but 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.529
 I think there's a lot to do yet 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.679
 and there's a lot of work for a lot of young people 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:11.819
 stansted and out 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.460
 most have been developed by very young people and have been his first works 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.089
 and I think that the output that may have that sps his first works is part of a 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:25.610
 well from our first résumés these first steps and that give you access 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.879
 to other self projects 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.789
 we of course 91 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:31.809
 with 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:32.909
 very young 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.630
 taha kashin 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.020
 Lara showed the possibility of presenting to the Fatah 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.860
 our first hour that we consult we build that we consider it an hour 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.760
 even worse than it is 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.219
 nanny r aunt but 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.710
 percent in any case 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.720
 yes brown is very important among other things because I knew my two 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.360
 partners 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.900
 together we introduce you without knowing a contest and from the 91 zone 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.610
 we follow 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.479
 together we have made the race points of muslera worked in the same 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:05:59.639
 offices and at the end
