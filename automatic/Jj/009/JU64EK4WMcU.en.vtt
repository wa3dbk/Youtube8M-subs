with their loading screens right right
wrong<00:02:09.609> now<00:02:10.299> this<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.659> the<00:02:10.689> loading<00:02:11.109> screen<00:02:11.139> at

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:11.529

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:12.180 
wrong now this is the loading screen at
rule<00:02:11.769> that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
rule that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.910

war<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.640> then<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.270> one<00:02:13.630> is<00:02:13.900> from<00:02:14.440> black<00:02:14.680> ops

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
war and then this one is from black ops

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.430 
war and then this one is from black ops
1<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.670> they<00:02:15.820> updated<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.480> little<00:02:16.510> bit<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.230> then

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
1 so they updated a little bit but then

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.200 
1 so they updated a little bit but then
this<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.520> they<00:02:18.580> should<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
this is the one that they should in the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
this is the one that they should in the
conference<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.020> different<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:21.430> more<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.910> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
conference it's different it's more of a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
conference it's different it's more of a
upgraded<00:02:23.230> version<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.830> if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.460> look<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.820> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
upgraded version and if you look in the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.870 
upgraded version and if you look in the
top<00:02:25.210> left<00:02:25.810> corner<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:26.980> sorry<00:02:27.610> for<00:02:27.850> the

top left corner of it and sorry for the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.610 
top left corner of it and sorry for the
quality<00:02:28.150> but<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.630> kind<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.230> looks<00:02:29.410> like<00:02:29.470> I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
quality but it kind of looks like I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.500 
quality but it kind of looks like I
pulled<00:02:29.800> this<00:02:29.920> out<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.100> my<00:02:30.250> asshole<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:30.940> it's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
pulled this out of my asshole but it's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.080 
pulled this out of my asshole but it's
kind<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.260> layout<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.280> black<00:02:33.550> ops<00:02:33.820> 2

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
kind of the layout that the black ops 2

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.850 
kind of the layout that the black ops 2
zombies<00:02:34.120> maps<00:02:34.660> were<00:02:34.870> with<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.200> orange<00:02:35.380> text

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
zombies maps were with the orange text

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.340 
zombies maps were with the orange text
in<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.220> says<00:02:36.520> der<00:02:37.180> riese<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.870> could<00:02:38.050> see<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
in it says der riese you could see the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.650 
in it says der riese you could see the
last<00:02:38.530> parts<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> reefs<00:02:39.490> and<00:02:39.760> then<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.450> says

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
last parts of the reefs and then it says

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.200 
last parts of the reefs and then it says
Germany<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.250> same<00:02:42.520> layout<00:02:42.820> as<00:02:43.120> a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
Germany and that's the same layout as a

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.560 
Germany and that's the same layout as a
black<00:02:43.840> ops<00:02:44.140> 2<00:02:44.500> zombies<00:02:44.530> loading<00:02:45.520> screen<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.330> it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
black ops 2 zombies loading screen so it

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.840 
black ops 2 zombies loading screen so it
leaves<00:02:46.810> us<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.290> believe<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.400> was<00:02:48.610> going

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
leaves us to believe that this was going

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.240 
leaves us to believe that this was going
to<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.090> in<00:02:49.450> black<00:02:49.690> ops<00:02:49.900> 2<00:02:50.050> but<00:02:50.410> there<00:02:50.590> wasn't<00:02:50.860> it

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
to be in black ops 2 but there wasn't it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.930 
to be in black ops 2 but there wasn't it
wasn't<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:52.270> so<00:02:52.300> maybe<00:02:52.990> we<00:02:53.920> could<00:02:54.130> hugely

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
wasn't in there so maybe we could hugely

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.840 
wasn't in there so maybe we could hugely
assume<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.020> these<00:02:56.800> old<00:02:56.830> maps<00:02:57.370> are

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
assume that this these old maps are

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.930 
assume that this these old maps are
going<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.510> black<00:02:58.960> ops<00:02:59.170> 3<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.860> mean<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.790> makes

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
going in black ops 3 I mean it makes

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.200 
going in black ops 3 I mean it makes
sense<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.570> new<00:03:02.020> console<00:03:02.710> in<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.550> next<00:03:04.030> gen

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
sense a new console in the next gen

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.550 
sense a new console in the next gen
consoles<00:03:04.810> with<00:03:05.650> all<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.760> zombie<00:03:07.180> maps<00:03:07.560> plus

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
consoles with all the zombie maps plus

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.970 
consoles with all the zombie maps plus
the<00:03:09.160> new<00:03:09.400> zombie<00:03:09.610> maps<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:11.380> would<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.710> great

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
the new zombie maps it would be a great

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.830 
the new zombie maps it would be a great
idea<00:03:12.010> entre<00:03:12.640> ex<00:03:12.790> parte<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.390> believe<00:03:13.810> that

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
idea entre ex parte and I believe that

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.570 
idea entre ex parte and I believe that
the<00:03:14.140> old<00:03:14.290> zombie<00:03:14.680> maps<00:03:14.860> are<00:03:15.010> returning<00:03:15.340> maybe

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
the old zombie maps are returning maybe

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.130 
the old zombie maps are returning maybe
not<00:03:15.820> all<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.030> them<00:03:16.300> not<00:03:16.600> all<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.900> way<00:03:17.020> from

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
not all of them not all the way from

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.070 
not all of them not all the way from
notch<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:18.340> moon<00:03:18.610> maybe<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.270> favorable<00:03:19.870> ones

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
notch to moon maybe the favorable ones

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.260 
notch to moon maybe the favorable ones
maybe<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.770> ones<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.160> we<00:03:21.280> want<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.670> see<00:03:22.000> our

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
maybe the ones that we want to see our

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.580 
maybe the ones that we want to see our
most<00:03:23.260> favorite<00:03:23.530> ones<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.750> maybe<00:03:26.020> even<00:03:26.260> the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
most favorite ones so it maybe even the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.090 
most favorite ones so it maybe even the
only<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.400> world<00:03:28.300> at<00:03:28.420> war<00:03:28.600> maps<00:03:29.140> since<00:03:29.800> we<00:03:29.950> saw

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
only the world at war maps since we saw

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.580 
only the world at war maps since we saw
der<00:03:30.310> riese<00:03:30.489> we<00:03:30.670> didn't<00:03:30.850> see<00:03:30.970> anything<00:03:31.180> else

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
der riese we didn't see anything else

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.870 
der riese we didn't see anything else
