00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
products but that doesn't mean that

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.330

bunch of different companies young group

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.860 
bunch of different companies young group
so<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.460> problem<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:26.970> we<00:03:27.240> have<00:03:27.480> sort<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.780> a

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so the problem is that we have sort of a

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.480 
so the problem is that we have sort of a
systemic<00:03:28.260> issue<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:28.830> not<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.190> with<00:03:29.340> this

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
systemic issue it's not just with this

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.920 
systemic issue it's not just with this
Factory<00:03:29.940> it's<00:03:30.120> with<00:03:30.210> many<00:03:30.360> factories<00:03:30.810> we

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
Factory it's with many factories we

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.120 
Factory it's with many factories we
don't<00:03:31.140> know<00:03:31.260> what<00:03:31.410> we're<00:03:31.530> getting<00:03:31.710> there's<00:03:32.070> a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
don't know what we're getting there's a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.950 
don't know what we're getting there's a
lack<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.760> transparency<00:03:33.240> and<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.630> think<00:03:33.810> this

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
lack of transparency and I think this

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.420 
lack of transparency and I think this
brings<00:03:34.290> awareness<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.920> us<00:03:35.040> now<00:03:35.190> they've

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
