00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.920
 hello mr star ralf of ireland today 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.060
 I would like to show you how to get one 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.000
 petrowa maybe started shortly to the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.980
 individual components first petro 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.369
 max such with their DC fault 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.570
 in it 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:38.989
 important to start are pressure gauges 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:42.620
 but pump starter lever here and 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.260
 adjusting wheel for the accompaniment of the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.620
 storm badly for the beginning of the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.040
 lace is a dazzling up 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.059
 show 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:58.309
 then the supply from the participation to 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.879
 shrink generator 1, the nose 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.649
 above 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.080
 very important then if no printer case 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.649
 at the table and no fuel in it 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.280
 then I have to tank first 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.210
 It makes sense that I use alkane that I 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.909
 fast 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.700
 cleaned the petroleum with 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.189
 child safety and thus burns the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:33.979
 Lamp relatively clean that means I have to 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:36.420
 little maintenance ultimately operate like this 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.020
 not too much but not too little 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.020
 otherwise be in it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.829
 the empty tanks are needed longer 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.069
 until I build up the necessary pressure 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.659
 can and I have to pump all the longer 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.420
 more often it has to go up that means one 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.899
 well-filled tank while saving 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 Half the point work should too 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.479
 this pressure release valve can be there 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.330
 I can take it home 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.240
 unscrew and then go 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:17.910
 it display to here at the castle only once 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:21.510
 15 bar to produce so then we have the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.920
 15 bar hammer produced you need 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.920
 lighter and staring here 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.460
 b 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.310
 here the burner for at least 90 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:46.660
 seconds and points 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.660
 because the pressure is faster 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.490
 this burner has the task 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800
 generator in the lamp to the heat so that 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.790
 if afterwards then petroleum through this 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.430
 generator current 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.040
 he will forget it will be with humans 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.480
 emphasize steam and this eventually 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.480
 then bring the electricity 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.630
 so what was done now was after 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.260
 me from cooler the generator says me 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.350
 I make the books hot enough and 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.110
 Immediately this setting with the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.410
 tip down 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.140
 and in the moment the lamp then begins 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.600
 also to shine in that this gas through 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.640
 this hull greets accordingly 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.760
 burns and that's it 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.760
 kerosene lamp on 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:06.269
 so if the lamp then burns then 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:15.209
 I bring the pressure indication on the 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:17.040
 operating pressure of about 2 was the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:23.220
 Markets but also the lamp clearly 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.070
 brighter and so I can now too 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.449
 to burn for a while 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.220
 If I notice the pressure decreases 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.440
 Westphalia's something about the brightness 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.450
 of each other when the pressure subsides 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.350
 then i have to talk to him after customer 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:41.160
 also back to the 2.5 bar and if I am 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.889
 I want to turn off the lamp then I can 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.560
 here real adjustment wheel of course 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.120
 The lamp should close again then 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.690
 but also the pressure 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.760
 easter country pale and so it would indeed be 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.120
 again portable and she just 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.539
 continue 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.260
 you have other operators or you 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:04.229
 carry away 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.889
 Accordingly, I say thank you very much 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.889
 spectator 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.139
 I hope your pedro max gets in the future 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.229
 just as fast safe and easy 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:16.430
 who learn more about the peter marx 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.410
 would like to drive is with us 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.660
 schottenland.de on our homepage and 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.940
 who like to see more of our videos 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.450
 would now subscribe to ours 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.060
 channel 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.440
 we are happy to see something and me 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.560
 I wish you much fun until the next 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.560
 times
