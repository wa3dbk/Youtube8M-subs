00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi friends from youtube and my 8 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.500
 subscribers to my channel of eric olive trees 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.719
 today I bring you a criticism to nexus 2013 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 the nexus will remind you who they are for 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.370
 if you forgot the nexus will be a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.529
 team that will do a full year 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.630
 I hit everyone outside because of whoever was 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
 it did not matter if it was a legend 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.949
 chief of them is locked 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 Equally they were 8 members but 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.060
 They made 7 with the resignation of Daniel 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.070
 Bryan but that did not matter so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.170
 let's start with the criticism first 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.100
 we criticized ryback that before when 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 was nexus was called skip to be faithful 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 faithful esquiche before he was a cowboy 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.129
 he liked horses and was a farmer 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.590
 after he got rid of nexus he did not know 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 he knew nothing about him and a year later he came back 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.190
 with another name and new techniques 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 He came back with the name of King Bach and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.660
 He is currently a fighter who came to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.050
 be more famous than good batiste that's 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.329
 everything about rybak let's continue then 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 so it was rybak followed if he destined for himself 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 alone and had a great success now is in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.229
 pay-per-view covers are in 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.050
 stellar fights and already it has its 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.450
 own dolls 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.730
 now let's move on to criticize another member 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.070
 of nexus named daniel bryan he was a 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.140
 novice without experience but he knew how to do 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.270
 surrender keys but he withdrew a 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.970
 time after they took him out of the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.510
 lx back five months later to 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.370
 attack your ex friends the nexus after 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.430
 his return two months later he 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.560
 became champion of the USA and reigned 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.990
 for nine months and three months after 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.390
 of losing it was a pay-per-view called 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.400
 money in they see you and guess that he was the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.650
 winner of the fight money in the bank and 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.600
 six months later he made his 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.900
 contract and became champion 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.120
 heavy global your destiny is good since 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.250
 that after he lost it currently 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.710
 is champion in pairs with the monster 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.870
 red that in its destiny is equally good 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.300
 than the rival since it is also in 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.610
 pay-per-view covers if in toys 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.580
 dolls fate good now let's go 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.740
 with another now let's move on with another member 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.930
 called dare nyon is a little black guy who does not 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.970
 he has shown nothing and that he almost does not fight and 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.920
 when he fights, he fights in pairs with a 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.140
 friend that has that is another black that 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.630
 they have a team that they do not catch and one 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.400
 the sealed team play time players 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.500
 but he does not talk much like that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.900
 that your destiny more or less and if it will not be 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 bad fate bad now let's go with 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.040
 michael maybe this is a black that does not 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 I know what happened to him just now 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.990
 he lost and they did not see him again 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.450
 destiny no idea now the next one is 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.459
 david otunga this guy if he fights a lot 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.140
 in red but it's both good and 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.480
 Once bad because because it has not had 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.730
 no more championships than couples 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 but he's still a good fighter he is 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.650
 of the only ones who supported nexus 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.989
 but what more your good destiny now 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.970
 let's go with michael mcgillicutty this is 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.010
 a guy who only fought in red when 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.080
 it was nexus and now he only fights in 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.940
 superstars and just like twice has 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.830
 fought in main event but he like 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.230
 who says he has a little less than 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.750
 otunga because otunga if he fights and he fights 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.610
 but not followed only in real battles to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.280
 something like that but it also has its 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.019
 little dolls his destiny more or less now 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.360
 let's go with the ones that aris he was a 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.489
 novice like the lx of which I entered 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.530
 together with michael mcgillicutty and not 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.630
 he has friends he retired because great 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.100
 quality and bullying haha ​​and that's why 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.890
 but he withdrew while 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.110
 in nexus he was very half destiny fighter 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.330
 more or less because he never achieved anything or 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.690
 he even had his destiny dolls 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.790
 bad now let's go with justin gabriel he 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.030
 is a flying boy who has a great 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.490
 key called the 450 turn he is very 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.710
 great that we say is not on covers 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.140
 of pay-per-view and maybe I did not fight very 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.940
 but he is a good fighter and if he does 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.980
 has had championships that is the one of 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.720
 couples also now is in team 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.930
 with tyson kidd and he does have his 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.360
 dolls destination good now the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.520
 next is his later aka the wing 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.710
 disc since Jon dinner put him like that haha 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.510
 well this is a good fighter and the 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.670
 bad time because because almost always 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.650
 fight in pairs and bad that the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.630
 most times it has lost but it is a 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.700
 good fighter he does have friends from 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.470
 done right now has a team called 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.100
 the rockers and have won lately 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.650
 but he's a good fighter because he's been 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.799
 three times champion of couples and apart 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.930
 he does have his dolls now let's go 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.120
 with the last good member not last 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.250
