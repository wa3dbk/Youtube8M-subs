understanding of anna-marie standards
how<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:22.920> work<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.460> why<00:00:23.670> they're<00:00:23.850> important

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
how they work and why they're important

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.810 
how they work and why they're important
to<00:00:24.360> modelers<00:00:25.040> what<00:00:26.040> we're<00:00:26.160> hoping<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
to modelers what we're hoping to do is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.750 
to modelers what we're hoping to do is
dispel<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> few<00:00:27.300> myths<00:00:27.480> about<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.020> standards

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
dispel a few myths about the standards

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.279 
dispel a few myths about the standards
mainly<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.180> that<00:00:30.360> there<00:00:30.600> there's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
mainly one is that there there's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
mainly one is that there there's
something<00:00:31.530> wrong<00:00:31.770> with<00:00:31.920> them<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.220> actually

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
something wrong with them and actually

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
something wrong with them and actually
there's<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.510> nothing<00:00:33.600> wrong<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
there's there's nothing wrong with the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.950 
there's there's nothing wrong with the
standards<00:00:34.470> they<00:00:35.190> work<00:00:35.400> very<00:00:35.430> well<00:00:35.879> I<00:00:36.390> think

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
standards they work very well I think

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
standards they work very well I think
the<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.470> biggest<00:00:37.770> problem<00:00:38.100> over<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.580> years

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the the biggest problem over the years

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.750 
the the biggest problem over the years
is<00:00:39.379> people<00:00:40.379> misinterpreting<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> standards

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
is people misinterpreting the standards

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.530 
is people misinterpreting the standards
and<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:43.020> applying<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.620> properly<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
and not applying them properly and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.880 
and not applying them properly and
hopefully<00:00:45.540> with<00:00:45.660> us<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.110> video<00:00:46.290> we<00:00:46.620> can

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
hopefully with us this video we can

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500 
hopefully with us this video we can
clear<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.310> some<00:00:47.579> misconceptions<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
clear up some misconceptions about the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.410 
clear up some misconceptions about the
standards<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.050> how<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.350> work

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
standards and how they work

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
standards and how they work
mainly<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> standards<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.160> all

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
mainly that the standards are all

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
mainly that the standards are all
interrelated<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:54.059> each<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.500> numbers

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
interrelated with each other the numbers

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.520 
interrelated with each other the numbers
you<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:55.950> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.309> screen<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:57.350> every<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you see on the screen here every one of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.799 
you see on the screen here every one of
those<00:00:58.710> numbers<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.430> relative<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> number

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
those numbers is relative to the number

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.430 
those numbers is relative to the number
beside<00:01:01.290> it<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> can't<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.600> adjust<00:01:03.840> one

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
beside it so you can't really adjust one

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.530 
beside it so you can't really adjust one
number<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.790> affect<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.270> others

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
number and not affect the others

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.830 
number and not affect the others
especially<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> flange<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.690> we<00:01:09.690> hope

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
especially in the flange way and we hope

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240 
especially in the flange way and we hope
to<00:01:09.869> explain<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.860> video

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to explain that in this video

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.920 
to explain that in this video
yeah<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.910> we'll<00:01:12.060> summarize<00:01:12.300> with<00:01:12.690> a<00:01:12.720> case

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
yeah and we'll summarize with a case

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.320 
yeah and we'll summarize with a case
study<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.320> an<00:01:13.890> actual<00:01:14.039> turnout<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.820> show<00:01:15.060> how

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
study of an actual turnout and show how

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.109 
study of an actual turnout and show how
the<00:01:15.390> numbers<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.340> moved<00:01:17.340> around<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.940> how

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the numbers can be moved around and how

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.070 
the numbers can be moved around and how
they<00:01:18.330> relate<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> each<00:01:18.780> other

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.930

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
I'm just going to do a quick summary of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.490 
I'm just going to do a quick summary of
the<00:01:30.060> terminology<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.810> gonna<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.380> these

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the terminology I'm gonna use in these

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.680 
the terminology I'm gonna use in these
videos<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:33.600> I'm

talking about when I refer to various
parts<00:01:35.190> of<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> turnout<00:01:36.470> what<00:01:37.470> we're<00:01:37.590> looking<00:01:37.799> at

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890

parts of a turnout what we're looking at
here<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.190> an<00:01:38.310> 800<00:01:38.580> scale<00:01:38.940> number<00:01:39.570> 8<00:01:39.690> coded<00:01:40.259> d3

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
here is an 800 scale number 8 coded d3

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.469 
here is an 800 scale number 8 coded d3
turnout<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.400> nice<00:01:41.580> generic<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
turnout and it's a nice generic one and

and they work they have a relationship

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.810 
and they work they have a relationship
between<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.170> two<00:05:26.810> for<00:05:27.810> our<00:05:28.220> purposes<00:05:29.220> we

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
between the two for our purposes we

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.090 
between the two for our purposes we
really<00:05:30.180> aren't<00:05:30.600> concerned<00:05:31.170> with<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.830> number

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.610 
really aren't concerned with that number
really<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:33.300> best<00:05:33.480> we<00:05:33.660> can<00:05:33.810> do<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.170> just<00:05:34.200> set

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
really is the best we can do is just set

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.520 
really is the best we can do is just set
the<00:05:34.770> wheel<00:05:34.919> gauge<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.820> nra<00:05:36.180> standards<00:05:36.750> and

the wheel gauge to the nra standards and

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.970 
the wheel gauge to the nra standards and
using<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.100> standards<00:05:38.460> Cajun<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.540> should

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
using the standards Cajun that should

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.350 
using the standards Cajun that should
give<00:05:40.980> us<00:05:41.100> a<00:05:41.280> set<00:05:41.700> of<00:05:41.790> wheels<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.030> will<00:05:42.150> run

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
give us a set of wheels that will run

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.270 
give us a set of wheels that will run
great<00:05:42.630> on<00:05:42.780> any<00:05:43.020> turnout<00:05:43.380> that's<00:05:43.680> built<00:05:43.950> around

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
great on any turnout that's built around

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
backpacker measurement and like it

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 
backpacker measurement and like it
sounds<00:05:51.060> that's<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:51.690> distance<00:05:52.140> from<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.530> back

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710
