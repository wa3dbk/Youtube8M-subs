00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.559
 so we had to designate a head to be posted this year at the biennial 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.750
 lyon we would be she caroline carcassonne new york dancer and 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.600
 meetic choreographer returns to lyon and it's an event she presents the 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.449
 revisited version two ends the show edile that built its legend 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.230
 except today that it is no longer the one that the dancer has offered him 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.989
 just for the biennale but it's true it's pretty clear and it's very 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.120
 interesting to see which and dancers who takes up the choreography 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.810
 brings his own experience that's why it's called louis a 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.370
 ironically it's like receiving a guest in the house 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.960
 Samarrai 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 it must be said that this year the biennale a same ministry and the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.090
 back again the opportunity for the 43 companies present to revisit 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.170
 the history of contemporary dance in all its forms 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 we wanted to take a look without nostalgia 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.670
 and the caroline approach to give this hour staff where the idea 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.969
 to offer it to an exceptional dancer like bodywork itself that's exactly 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210
 the theme of this biennale 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.480
 to travel in the past so at random and in disorder we can 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.140
 follow maggie sailor who presents big pub on a music of beethoven 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.980
 a lens we can not afford 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.170
 claira all vivien sheets tell these little stories com 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.400
 without forgetting mourad merzouki who at 35 this place will present no less than 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.580
 three shows why a choreography inspired by an era 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.729
 circus art martial arts 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.780
 this biennale is a bit like hers so obviously today it is a 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.409
 little stressed stressed by these pieces that waited it's a piece was 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.509
 climb so not so simple what I worked at rio in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.039
 conditions not always obvious 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.159
 but in any case I cross my fingers because from the start on his account 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.859
 this wonderful Sunday the verdict for mourad merzouki it will be Sunday evening 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.929
 by then and for those who would not want to lock themselves in a room 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.950
 of show a little tour on the course lafayette will suffice 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.320
 the quebecois paul andrÃ© fortier invested the places is every day 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.570
