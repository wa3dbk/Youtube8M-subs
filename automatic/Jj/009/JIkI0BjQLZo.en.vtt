very little horizontal recoil so if

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020 
very little horizontal recoil so if
you're<00:00:46.410> aiming<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.860> people<00:00:47.160> best<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.850> aim<00:00:48.000> for

like the stomach kind of area knowing

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.319 
like the stomach kind of area knowing
that<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.550> kick<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.000> little<00:00:51.090> bit

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that it's gonna kick up a little bit

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.029 
that it's gonna kick up a little bit
especially<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.289> aiming<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.649> people

from a distance and then you can see me

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
from a distance and then you can see me

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that this kind of distance they're not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.080 
that this kind of distance they're not
that<00:01:10.680> effective<00:01:11.220> only<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> little

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that effective only when I get a little

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
that effective only when I get a little
bit<00:01:12.299> closer<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.890> most

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
bit closer there can you see that most

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.530 
bit closer there can you see that most
of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> bullets<00:01:14.880> end<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.240> hitting<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
of the bullets end up hitting the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.060 
of the bullets end up hitting the
targets<00:01:15.960> although<00:01:16.350> they're<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.590> deadly

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
targets although they're very deadly

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.249 
targets although they're very deadly
they<00:01:17.640> spew<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.180> lot<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> damage<00:01:18.930> very

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
they spew out a lot of damage very

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
they spew out a lot of damage very
quickly<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.369> very<00:01:20.610> accurate<00:01:20.820> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
quickly they are not very accurate so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
quickly they are not very accurate so
only<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.020> very<00:01:22.290> close<00:01:22.619> quarters<00:01:22.979> I'd<00:01:23.220> say

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
only for very close quarters I'd say

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.770 
only for very close quarters I'd say
only<00:01:23.670> when<00:01:23.759> you're<00:01:23.909> actually<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.390> into

the crap out of people really makes this

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.160 
the crap out of people really makes this
completely<00:02:43.280> deadly<00:02:43.850> it's<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.300> bad<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.930> its

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
completely deadly it's not bad on its

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.530 
completely deadly it's not bad on its
own<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.340> has<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.730> small<00:02:47.000> magazine<00:02:47.360> size

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
own but it has that small magazine size

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.690 
own but it has that small magazine size
so<00:02:47.780> though<00:02:47.990> it's<00:02:48.140> as<00:02:48.290> deadly<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:48.710> an<00:02:48.830> mp7<00:02:49.520> or<00:02:49.670> a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
so though it's as deadly as an mp7 or a

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.060 
so though it's as deadly as an mp7 or a
vector<00:02:50.150> at<00:02:50.240> close<00:02:50.450> range<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.080> does<00:02:51.530> only<00:02:51.800> have

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
vector at close range it does only have

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.760 
vector at close range it does only have
that<00:02:52.250> small<00:02:52.610> 15<00:02:53.210> bullet<00:02:53.930> magazine<00:02:54.320> size<00:02:54.560> I

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
that small 15 bullet magazine size I

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.560 
that small 15 bullet magazine size I
believe<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.220> goes<00:02:55.370> up<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.670> 20<00:02:55.940> with<00:02:56.090> extended

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
believe it goes up to 20 with extended

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.840 
believe it goes up to 20 with extended
mags<00:02:56.600> which<00:02:56.960> is<00:02:57.140> why<00:02:57.290> extended<00:02:57.830> mags<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.220> also

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
mags which is why extended mags is also

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.760 
mags which is why extended mags is also
a<00:02:58.880> good<00:02:59.180> thing<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.990> used<00:03:00.200> with<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:00.500> it's

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
a good thing it's used with this it's

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.260 
a good thing it's used with this it's
only<00:03:00.890> really<00:03:01.190> built<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.460> take<00:03:01.670> out<00:03:01.850> one<00:03:02.060> person

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
only really built to take out one person

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.030 
only really built to take out one person
at<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.570> time<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:02.990> you<00:03:03.290> can't<00:03:03.530> probably<00:03:03.860> take

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
at a time but you can't probably take

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.310 
at a time but you can't probably take
out<00:03:04.220> two<00:03:04.550> people<00:03:04.820> before<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.690> have<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.990> reload

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
out two people before you have to reload

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.900 
out two people before you have to reload
the<00:03:06.530> reload<00:03:06.830> by<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.070> way<00:03:07.220> isn't<00:03:07.640> really

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
the reload by the way isn't really

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.400 
the reload by the way isn't really
anything<00:03:08.120> special<00:03:08.240> it's<00:03:08.750> pretty<00:03:08.990> much<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.350> par

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
anything special it's pretty much on par

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.560 
anything special it's pretty much on par
with<00:03:09.770> most<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.670> other<00:03:10.850> pistols<00:03:11.300> and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
with most of the other pistols and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.600 
with most of the other pistols and
secondaries<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.800> in<00:03:12.950> these<00:03:13.100> clips<00:03:13.400> you're

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
secondaries so in these clips you're

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.520 
secondaries so in these clips you're
watching<00:03:13.940> me<00:03:14.060> use<00:03:14.240> my<00:03:14.420> preferred<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.080> sniping

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
watching me use my preferred a sniping

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.830 
watching me use my preferred a sniping
setup<00:03:15.890> with<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.280> kap-40<00:03:16.730> dual<00:03:17.360> wield<00:03:17.600> as<00:03:17.780> a

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
setup with the kap-40 dual wield as a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.480 
setup with the kap-40 dual wield as a
backup<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.470> as<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.650> can<00:03:18.740> see<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.100> does<00:03:19.280> a

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
backup and as you can see it does a

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.910 
backup and as you can see it does a
great<00:03:19.730> job<00:03:19.910> at<00:03:20.420> taking<00:03:20.780> out<00:03:20.870> anyone<00:03:21.140> who<00:03:21.740> just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
great job at taking out anyone who just

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.190 
great job at taking out anyone who just
happens<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> run<00:03:22.640> up<00:03:22.790> on<00:03:22.970> me<00:03:23.030> or<00:03:23.330> anyone<00:03:23.570> who's

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
happens to run up on me or anyone who's

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.140 
happens to run up on me or anyone who's
kind<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.530> near<00:03:24.800> me<00:03:24.980> if<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.310> decide<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.790> move<00:03:25.970> from

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
kind of near me if I decide to move from

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.820 
kind of near me if I decide to move from
an<00:03:26.270> area<00:03:26.330> like<00:03:26.720> for<00:03:26.930> example<00:03:27.020> here<00:03:27.560> I'm

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
an area like for example here I'm

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.560 
an area like for example here I'm
probably<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:28.400> gonna<00:03:28.550> use<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.940> need<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:29.360> use

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
probably not gonna use to need to use

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.090 
probably not gonna use to need to use
the<00:03:29.720> dual<00:03:29.960> wield<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.680> someone<00:03:30.950> just

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
the dual wield and this someone just

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.500 
the dual wield and this someone just
pops<00:03:31.370> up<00:03:31.610> from<00:03:31.700> one<00:03:31.880> of<00:03:31.970> those<00:03:32.060> little<00:03:32.360> areas

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
pops up from one of those little areas

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.050 
pops up from one of those little areas
so<00:03:32.900> I'm<00:03:33.170> swapping<00:03:33.680> out<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.250> dual<00:03:34.850> wield

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
so I'm swapping out to the dual wield

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.760 
so I'm swapping out to the dual wield
only<00:03:35.360> when<00:03:35.480> people<00:03:35.810> are<00:03:35.870> either<00:03:35.930> close<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.350> me

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
only when people are either close to me

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.800 
only when people are either close to me
or<00:03:37.040> say<00:03:37.610> if<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.850> need<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.150> run<00:03:38.360> through<00:03:38.780> a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
or say if I need to run through a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.510 
or say if I need to run through a
building<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.560> get<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.860> somewhere<00:03:40.160> else<00:03:40.340> to

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
building to get to somewhere else to

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.370 
building to get to somewhere else to
snipe<00:03:40.730> that's<00:03:41.270> another<00:03:41.600> time<00:03:41.870> when<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.140> dual

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
snipe that's another time when the dual

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.320 
snipe that's another time when the dual
wield<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.770> gonna<00:03:42.980> be<00:03:43.130> really<00:03:43.340> useful<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.180> here

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
wield is gonna be really useful so here

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.880 
wield is gonna be really useful so here
you<00:03:44.420> can<00:03:44.600> see<00:03:44.810> I'm<00:03:45.020> just<00:03:45.050> popping<00:03:45.380> caps<00:03:45.710> with

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
you can see I'm just popping caps with

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.200 
you can see I'm just popping caps with
the<00:03:46.010> sniper<00:03:46.280> when<00:03:46.640> they're<00:03:46.790> about<00:03:47.060> the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
the sniper when they're about the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.150 
the sniper when they're about the
distance<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.990> that<00:03:48.200> house<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.680> away<00:03:48.920> and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
distance that that house is away and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.260 
distance that that house is away and
then<00:03:49.250> when<00:03:49.370> they<00:03:49.460> get<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:49.640> little<00:03:49.910> bit<00:03:50.030> closer

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
then when they get a little bit closer

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.690 
then when they get a little bit closer
move<00:03:50.870> out<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.380> dual<00:03:51.590> wield<00:03:51.830> now<00:03:52.190> all<00:03:52.490> of

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
move out to the dual wield now all of

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.580 
move out to the dual wield now all of
the<00:03:52.820> pistols<00:03:53.240> in<00:03:53.420> black<00:03:53.630> ops<00:03:53.810> 2<00:03:53.900> are<00:03:54.230> actually

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
the pistols in black ops 2 are actually

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.650 
the pistols in black ops 2 are actually
really<00:03:54.980> good<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:55.490> you<00:03:55.520> could<00:03:55.880> do<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.210> with

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
really good so you could do this with

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.690 
really good so you could do this with
any<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.170> them<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:57.680> it's<00:03:57.860> just<00:03:58.070> great<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.430> have

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
any of them but it's just great to have

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.510 
any of them but it's just great to have
that<00:03:58.880> kind<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.270> spray-and-pray<00:04:00.310> ability<00:04:01.310> that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
that kind of spray-and-pray ability that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.040 
that kind of spray-and-pray ability that
you<00:04:01.640> do<00:04:01.820> these<00:04:02.060> cap<00:04:02.300> forties<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.720> don't<00:04:02.930> have

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
you do these cap forties you don't have

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.600 
you do these cap forties you don't have
to<00:04:03.170> think<00:04:03.290> about<00:04:03.410> how<00:04:03.710> fast<00:04:04.010> your<00:04:04.190> trigger<00:04:04.430> is

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
to think about how fast your trigger is

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.460 
to think about how fast your trigger is
pulling<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.210> just<00:04:05.390> kind<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.720> aim<00:04:06.050> in<00:04:06.320> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
pulling you just kind of aim in the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.740 
pulling you just kind of aim in the
general<00:04:06.830> direction<00:04:06.860> of<00:04:07.370> people<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:07.880> hold<00:04:08.600> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
general direction of people and hold the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.090 
general direction of people and hold the
triggers<00:04:09.050> down<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.560> normally<00:04:09.830> at<00:04:09.920> close

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
triggers down and normally at close

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.470 
triggers down and normally at close
range<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.490> will<00:04:10.640> get<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:10.850> kill<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.150> long<00:04:11.270> as<00:04:11.360> you

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
range you will get a kill as long as you

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.270 
range you will get a kill as long as you
were<00:04:11.630> your<00:04:12.020> aim<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.440> pretty<00:04:12.740> decent

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
were your aim is pretty decent

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.640 
were your aim is pretty decent
now<00:04:13.640> these<00:04:13.880> cap<00:04:14.180> forties<00:04:14.570> Kimbo<00:04:14.990> did<00:04:15.350> get<00:04:15.620> a

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
now these cap forties Kimbo did get a

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.740 
now these cap forties Kimbo did get a
little<00:04:15.830> bit<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.220> nerf<00:04:16.489> mainly<00:04:17.299> due<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:17.630> their

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
little bit of a nerf mainly due to their

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.110 
little bit of a nerf mainly due to their
overuse<00:04:18.230> in<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> competitive<00:04:19.580> community<00:04:19.820> it

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
overuse in the competitive community it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.789 
overuse in the competitive community it
tends<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.420> you<00:04:20.930> tend<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.200> find<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.560> lot<00:04:21.710> of

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
tends to you tend to find that a lot of

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.380 
tends to you tend to find that a lot of
these<00:04:21.950> patches<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.030> things<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.240> are

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
these patches and things that are

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.030 
these patches and things that are
changed<00:04:23.660> because<00:04:23.870> competitive<00:04:24.500> people<00:04:24.650> tend

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
changed because competitive people tend

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.469 
changed because competitive people tend
to<00:04:25.100> overuse<00:04:25.460> things<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:25.940> for<00:04:26.060> some<00:04:26.180> reason

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
to overuse things and for some reason

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.680 
to overuse things and for some reason
they<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:26.900> seem

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
they just seem

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.300 
they just seem
to<00:04:27.750> do<00:04:28.170> whatever<00:04:28.350> they<00:04:28.620> want<00:04:28.920> whatever<00:04:29.160> the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
to do whatever they want whatever the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.340 
to do whatever they want whatever the
competitive<00:04:29.790> people<00:04:29.940> want<00:04:30.300> but<00:04:31.200> they

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
competitive people want but they

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.810 
competitive people want but they
probably<00:04:31.530> did<00:04:31.830> need<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.040> little<00:04:32.340> bit<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.610> nerf

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
probably did need a little bit of a nerf

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.490 
probably did need a little bit of a nerf
they<00:04:33.030> are<00:04:33.300> extremely<00:04:33.780> powerful

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
they are extremely powerful

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.230 
they are extremely powerful
now<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.830> nerf<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.310> say<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.790> damage<00:04:36.060> was

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
now the nerf to say that the damage was

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.690 
now the nerf to say that the damage was
reduced<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.470> was<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.070> sense<00:04:38.370> but

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
reduced and it was in the sense but

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.420 
reduced and it was in the sense but
let's<00:04:39.030> not<00:04:39.210> get<00:04:39.480> it<00:04:39.570> confused<00:04:39.600> with<00:04:40.220> what<00:04:41.220> some

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
let's not get it confused with what some

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.800 
let's not get it confused with what some
people<00:04:41.520> might<00:04:41.790> think<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:42.300> means<00:04:42.540> so

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
people might think that means so

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.140 
people might think that means so
although<00:04:43.410> this<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.740> 3<00:04:44.010> shot<00:04:44.220> kill<00:04:44.280> at<00:04:44.790> close

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
although this is a 3 shot kill at close

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150 
although this is a 3 shot kill at close
range<00:04:45.420> they<00:04:45.630> didn't<00:04:45.930> change<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.650> 3<00:04:46.860> shot<00:04:47.130> kill

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
range they didn't change the 3 shot kill

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.280 
range they didn't change the 3 shot kill
you<00:04:47.760> can<00:04:47.940> still<00:04:48.180> get<00:04:48.420> a<00:04:48.450> 3<00:04:48.630> shot<00:04:48.810> kill<00:04:48.870> with<00:04:49.140> it

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
you can still get a 3 shot kill with it

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.780 
you can still get a 3 shot kill with it
what<00:04:49.440> they<00:04:49.560> did<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:50.010> they<00:04:50.130> just<00:04:50.340> made<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.520> do

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
what they did is they just made it do

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.600 
what they did is they just made it do
less<00:04:51.030> damage<00:04:51.110> over<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.140> longer<00:04:52.620> distance<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.310> it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
less damage over a longer distance so it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.340 
less damage over a longer distance so it
doesn't<00:04:54.000> mean<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.180> it's<00:04:54.450> really<00:04:54.840> bad<00:04:55.050> now

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
doesn't mean that it's really bad now

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.260 
doesn't mean that it's really bad now
just<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:55.980> they<00:04:56.130> did<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.460> damage<00:04:56.970> reduction

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
just because they did a damage reduction

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.750 
just because they did a damage reduction
it's<00:04:57.750> still<00:04:58.080> as<00:04:58.320> good<00:04:58.500> as<00:04:58.740> ever<00:04:58.920> it's<00:04:59.370> just<00:04:59.460> at

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
it's still as good as ever it's just at

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.160 
it's still as good as ever it's just at
long<00:05:00.030> range<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.600> not<00:05:00.690> gonna<00:05:00.900> be<00:05:01.050> as

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
long range it's not gonna be as

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.020 
long range it's not gonna be as
effective<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:01.710> you<00:05:01.740> have<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.190> use<00:05:02.370> it<00:05:02.580> how<00:05:02.880> it

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
effective so you have to use it how it

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.640 
effective so you have to use it how it
was<00:05:03.060> really<00:05:03.420> meant<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.810> be<00:05:03.960> used<00:05:04.170> and<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.590> is

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
was really meant to be used and that is

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.520 
was really meant to be used and that is
as<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.100> real<00:05:05.460> like<00:05:05.640> close-quarters<00:05:06.480> kind<00:05:07.380> of

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
as a real like close-quarters kind of

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.380 
as a real like close-quarters kind of
emergency<00:05:08.220> things<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.880> nicely<00:05:09.090> will

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
emergency things that nicely will

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.120 
emergency things that nicely will
noscope<00:05:09.840> there<00:05:10.050> had<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.590> get<00:05:10.770> that<00:05:10.920> one<00:05:11.100> in

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
noscope there had to get that one in

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.430 
noscope there had to get that one in
there<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:11.640> it<00:05:11.940> still<00:05:12.420> is<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.630> really<00:05:13.290> good

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
there so it still is a really good

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.010 
there so it still is a really good
secondary<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:14.100> use<00:05:14.310> even<00:05:14.610> with<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.690> recent

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
secondary to use even with the recent

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.750 
secondary to use even with the recent
patch<00:05:16.260> nerves<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:16.860> I'm<00:05:16.980> gonna<00:05:17.160> give<00:05:17.340> it<00:05:17.430> an<00:05:17.520> 8

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
patch nerves so I'm gonna give it an 8

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.660 
patch nerves so I'm gonna give it an 8
out<00:05:17.790> of<00:05:17.970> 10<00:05:18.300> they<00:05:18.750> did<00:05:18.930> also<00:05:19.140> reduce<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.040> dual

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
out of 10 they did also reduce the dual

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.910 
out of 10 they did also reduce the dual
wield<00:05:20.910> hipfire<00:05:21.390> accuracy<00:05:21.810> but<00:05:22.470> like<00:05:22.740> I<00:05:22.890> just

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
wield hipfire accuracy but like I just

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.590 
wield hipfire accuracy but like I just
said<00:05:23.280> that's<00:05:23.580> not<00:05:23.880> really<00:05:24.120> going<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.330> affect

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
said that's not really going to affect

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.180 
said that's not really going to affect
you<00:05:24.780> if<00:05:24.960> you're<00:05:25.140> using<00:05:25.170> this<00:05:25.620> in<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.010> manner

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
which it's meant to be used which is at

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.320 
which it's meant to be used which is at
close<00:05:28.530> quarters<00:05:28.980> and<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.250> situations<00:05:29.460> where

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
close quarters and in situations where

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.520 
close quarters and in situations where
people<00:05:30.510> gonna<00:05:30.810> be<00:05:30.900> right<00:05:31.140> up<00:05:31.170> in<00:05:31.380> your<00:05:31.440> face

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
you just spray the crap out of them so

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.600 
you just spray the crap out of them so
definitely<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.050> very<00:05:34.290> good<00:05:34.380> secondary<00:05:34.980> try<00:05:35.430> out

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
definitely a very good secondary try out

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
really useful as a perk to be at swap

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.700 
really useful as a perk to be at swap
out<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:44.970> secondary<00:05:45.330> really<00:05:46.080> quickly<00:05:46.470> so
