00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.490
 in justice what samÃ¡n tries to make a 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.160
 great fighting game with the characters 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.650
 most popular of the universe of dc comics 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.100
 where heroes and villains face off in 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.200
 a spectacular battle 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.600
 the plot is based on a conflict between 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.550
 the joke and superman that leads to the sound 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.860
 confrontation between batman and man 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.990
 of steel we can say that the plot is 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.970
 fairly simple although the fact of 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.130
 mix the different personalities of 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.400
 the heroes and villains in a single line 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.950
 Time makes it very attractive 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.800
 gameplay is not so complicated ideal for 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.020
 those who are not into the genre 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.300
 the way to attack is very simple 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.640
 besides the blows in their different 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.129
 intensities we can make powers 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.680
 characteristics of each character and 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.530
 be of attack or defense although not 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.629
 They are not complex or varied the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.000
 combos a key pair of each bout 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.739
 although they already have a predefined mix 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.230
 with some possibilities for 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.390
 increase the number of blows this 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.850
 allows very spectacular movements 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.330
 with little practice but unfortunately 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.190
 without much space to improvise a 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.619
 of the interesting novelties are the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.869
 scenarios and their interactivity as 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.810
 long of all the levels we see objects 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.160
 placed in specific zones 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 depending on the character will be the way 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.720
 to interact with the object details 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.910
 very well cared for by the logic of the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.070
 characters and that is really a 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.750
 very attractive element that can us 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.860
 help in a good way in the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.170
 combats 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.300
 visually looks good without getting to 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.610
 excel scenarios and elements 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.980
 around the fight are fine 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.720
 designed but they are very few in 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.570
 occasions we notice as if the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.300
 animations were incomplete and a 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.690
 inconsistent character design already 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.300
 that some characters do not look so good 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.400
 the sound aspect is remarkable music and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.380
 the sound effects are pretty 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.840
 good but the voice work for 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.390
 Latin America is one of the best 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.250
 we have heard all the heroes and 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.520
 villains have the characterization 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.050
 adequate and everyone imposes presence 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.860
 the fireworks is to a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.890
 safe distance but since you're here 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.560
 because we do not dance a fine 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.350
 in justice gotcha mangas is not the best 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.330
 game of its genre it's still fun 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.400
 a good option for those who want 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.830
 start in the fighting games and on 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.459
 everything for those who like the universe of 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.459
 dc comics final rating 75
