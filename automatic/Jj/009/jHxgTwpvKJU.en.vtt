I have so let's start with a bed that's
closer<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.180> house<00:00:25.519> this<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.699> call<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
closer to the house this I call the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.400 
closer to the house this I call the
green

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.769

we have some collard greens right here
which<00:00:32.020> we've<00:00:32.619> already<00:00:32.739> started<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:33.370> i'm

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
which we've already started so i'm

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.750 
which we've already started so i'm
mostly<00:00:34.000> harvested<00:00:34.690> out<00:00:34.810> I<00:00:35.590> mean<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.580> got

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
mostly harvested out I mean you got

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.799 
mostly harvested out I mean you got
sturgeons<00:00:37.830> lettuce<00:00:38.830> Swiss<00:00:39.370> chard<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
sturgeons lettuce Swiss chard now the

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.920 
sturgeons lettuce Swiss chard now the
big<00:00:41.200> challenge<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.680> this<00:00:41.800> bed<00:00:42.070> is<00:00:42.370> that<00:00:42.400> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
big challenge with this bed is that I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.740 
big challenge with this bed is that I
planted<00:00:43.930> these<00:00:44.320> grains<00:00:44.650> so<00:00:44.920> densely<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:46.150> as

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
planted these grains so densely that as

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.689 
planted these grains so densely that as
they're<00:00:47.350> growing<00:00:47.500> in<00:00:47.890> there<00:00:48.129> getting<00:00:48.309> kind<00:00:48.610> of

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
they're growing in there getting kind of

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.150 
they're growing in there getting kind of
leggy<00:00:48.910> and<00:00:49.239> things<00:00:50.230> need<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.530> make<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.710> gap<00:00:50.949> and

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
leggy and things need to make a gap and

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.090 
leggy and things need to make a gap and
get<00:00:51.280> thinned<00:00:51.610> out<00:00:51.790> which<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:53.410> recommended

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
get thinned out which is recommended

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.150 
get thinned out which is recommended
because<00:00:54.280> when<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:54.940> comes<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.239> greens<00:00:56.160> thinning

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
because when it comes to greens thinning

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.850 
because when it comes to greens thinning
is<00:00:57.400> actually<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.850> harvest<00:00:58.300> as<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.500> can<00:00:59.589> see<00:00:59.830> I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
is actually a harvest as you can see I

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.150 
is actually a harvest as you can see I
can<00:01:00.040> eat<00:01:00.309> this<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.790> so<00:01:01.480> not<00:01:02.440> only<00:01:02.500> am<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:02.920> giving

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
can eat this and so not only am I giving

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.540 
can eat this and so not only am I giving
the<00:01:03.700> plants<00:01:04.089> more<00:01:04.239> space<00:01:04.570> between<00:01:04.809> each<00:01:05.140> other

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
the plants more space between each other

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.410 
the plants more space between each other
for<00:01:06.550> better<00:01:06.580> air<00:01:06.910> circulation<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:09.300> so<00:01:10.300> they

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
for better air circulation and so they

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.180 
for better air circulation and so they
could<00:01:10.600> have<00:01:10.780> more<00:01:10.960> some<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.289> each<00:01:11.440> plant<00:01:11.740> more

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
could have more some of each plant more

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.700 
could have more some of each plant more
sunlight<00:01:12.490> space<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:13.090> grow<00:01:13.440> I'm<00:01:14.440> also

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
sunlight space to grow I'm also

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.550 
sunlight space to grow I'm also
producing<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.490> myself

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.840 

rather<00:01:19.560> delicious

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
rather delicious

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.020 
rather delicious
so<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.479> like<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.869> grow<00:01:23.310> varieties<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.340> are

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
so I like to grow varieties that are

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.960 
so I like to grow varieties that are
kind<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:26.549> things<00:01:27.549> that<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.729> can't

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
kind of things that you can't

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.330 
kind of things that you can't
necessarily<00:01:28.150> find<00:01:28.780> at<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.990> grocery<00:01:29.170> store<00:01:29.409> for

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
necessarily find at a grocery store for

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.270 
necessarily find at a grocery store for
example<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.720> like<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.200> blueblood<00:01:32.830> tomato

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
example this is like a blueblood tomato

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.789 
example this is like a blueblood tomato
which<00:01:33.549> is<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> Bulgarian<00:01:34.180> heirloom<00:01:34.649> to<00:01:35.649> be<00:01:35.770> a

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
which is a Bulgarian heirloom to be a

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.550 
which is a Bulgarian heirloom to be a
spawn<00:01:36.100> trap<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:37.600> actually<00:01:37.869> not<00:01:37.990> doesn't

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
spawn trap it's actually not doesn't

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.609 
spawn trap it's actually not doesn't
seem<00:01:38.649> like<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:38.979> doing<00:01:39.130> pretty<00:01:39.250> well<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:40.619> have

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
seem like it's doing pretty well I have

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.920 
seem like it's doing pretty well I have
a<00:01:41.649> speculation<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.909> soil<00:01:43.210> here<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.659> to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
a speculation that the soil here is to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.399 
a speculation that the soil here is to
nutritious<00:01:44.440> for<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.420> mean<00:01:47.259> that's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
nutritious for it and so I mean that's

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
nutritious for it and so I mean that's
why<00:01:47.530> it's<00:01:47.649> carnivore<00:01:48.100> because<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.520> usually

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
why it's carnivore because it usually

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.430 
why it's carnivore because it usually
refers<00:01:50.049> so<00:01:50.560> it's<00:01:50.920> not<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.369> nutritious<00:01:52.440> right

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
refers so it's not so nutritious right

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.350 
refers so it's not so nutritious right
there<00:01:54.569> because<00:01:55.569> what<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.319> usually<00:01:56.560> didn't

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
there because what I usually didn't

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.480 
there because what I usually didn't
garden<00:01:58.360> most<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.200> best<00:01:59.409> i<00:01:59.679> transplanted

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
garden most of the best i transplanted

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.160 
garden most of the best i transplanted
something<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:01.330> then<00:02:01.420> i<00:02:01.509> seated<00:02:01.840> something

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
something and then i seated something

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.149 
something and then i seated something
between<00:02:03.569> so<00:02:04.569> here<00:02:05.229> are<00:02:05.259> transplanted<00:02:05.979> for

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
between so here are transplanted for

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.639 
between so here are transplanted for
example<00:02:06.520> peppers<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.210> i<00:02:07.479> seeded<00:02:08.110> onions<00:02:08.500> in

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
example peppers and i seeded onions in

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.309 
example peppers and i seeded onions in
between<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:10.149> distortion<00:02:10.690> as<00:02:10.810> well<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.019> little

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
between and distortion as well a little

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.750 
between and distortion as well a little
bit<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.709> their<00:02:14.709> companion<00:02:15.250> plants<00:02:15.640> they

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
bit and so their companion plants they

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.160 
bit and so their companion plants they
helped<00:02:16.000> her<00:02:16.090> out<00:02:16.269> onions<00:02:16.690> are<00:02:16.750> very<00:02:16.900> pungent

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
helped her out onions are very pungent

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.030 
helped her out onions are very pungent
so<00:02:17.470> they<00:02:17.560> repel<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> lot<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.160> passes<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.010> a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
so they repel a lot of passes this is a

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.090 
so they repel a lot of passes this is a
very<00:02:21.160> smart<00:02:21.430> companion<00:02:21.910> planting<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.480> do

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
very smart companion planting to do

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.420 
very smart companion planting to do
carrots<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.870> leeks<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.230> all<00:02:26.709> obviously<00:02:27.220> some

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
carrots and leeks and all obviously some

carrots and leeks and all obviously some
onions<00:02:27.730> over<00:02:27.940> there<00:02:28.260> they<00:02:29.260> confuse<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:30.130> leeks

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
onions over there they confuse the leeks

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.720 
onions over there they confuse the leeks
confuse<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> carrot<00:02:31.390> flies<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:35.019> know

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
confuse the carrot flies and you know

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.130 
confuse the carrot flies and you know
onions<00:02:36.730> are<00:02:36.820> just<00:02:37.030> general<00:02:37.329> general<00:02:37.900> pest

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140

repellent<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.239> have<00:02:40.390> different

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
repellent so and they have different

repellent so and they have different
spatial<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.410> nutrient<00:02:41.799> requirements<00:02:42.370> so

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
spatial and nutrient requirements so

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.229 
spatial and nutrient requirements so
they're<00:02:43.150> planted<00:02:43.570> well<00:02:43.780> together<00:02:44.850> as<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.120> can

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
they're planted well together as you can

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.880 
they're planted well together as you can
see<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> carrots<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.109> are<00:02:47.230> off<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.530> their

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
see the carrots that are off on their

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.580 
see the carrots that are off on their

inning<00:02:50.980> ends<00:02:51.250> with<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.060> carrots<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.600> are

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
inning ends with the carrots that are

further away from other carrots are

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.120 
further away from other carrots are
generally<00:02:56.799> bigger<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.810> know<00:02:59.130> some

cuz<00:03:11.170> they<00:03:11.470> spiral<00:03:12.069> shell<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:12.930> they<00:03:13.930> they

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
cuz they spiral shell but they they

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.750 
cuz they spiral shell but they they
liked<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.800> bunch<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:16.989> also<00:03:17.140> have<00:03:17.260> okra

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
liked a bunch and we also have okra

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.040 
liked a bunch and we also have okra
interspersed<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.060> bed<00:03:19.269> as<00:03:19.569> well<00:03:19.629> as<00:03:19.900> some

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
interspersed in this bed as well as some

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.050 
interspersed in this bed as well as some
rosemary<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:20.830> okra<00:03:21.550> wasn't<00:03:21.819> doing

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
rosemary and the okra wasn't doing

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.670 
rosemary and the okra wasn't doing
really<00:03:22.239> well<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.629> what<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.810> did<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.050> I<00:03:23.260> mashed<00:03:23.500> up

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
really well so what I did is I mashed up

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.580 
really well so what I did is I mashed up
some<00:03:23.890> banana<00:03:24.190> peels<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.750> dug<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.170> up<00:03:26.290> into

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
some banana peels and I dug it up into

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.589 
some banana peels and I dug it up into
the<00:03:26.680> soil<00:03:26.890> around<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.239> potassium

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
the soil around it and the potassium

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.990 
the soil around it and the potassium
really<00:03:29.200> helped<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.769> okra<00:03:30.430> deal<00:03:30.670> with<00:03:30.879> a<00:03:30.910> lot

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
really helped the okra deal with a lot

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.789 
really helped the okra deal with a lot
of<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.330> stress<00:03:31.569> from<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.870> transplant<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.620> so

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
of the stress from the transplant and so

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:39.150 
of the stress from the transplant and so
on<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:34.769> it's<00:03:35.769> doing<00:03:36.069> much<00:03:36.160> better<00:03:36.340> now<00:03:36.489> oh<00:03:38.160> look

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
on so it's doing much better now oh look

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.809 
on so it's doing much better now oh look
at<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.310> beautiful<00:03:40.150> zucchini<00:03:40.900> flower<00:03:41.819> it's

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
at that beautiful zucchini flower it's

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.710 
at that beautiful zucchini flower it's
just<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.890> star<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:46.150> beautiful<00:03:48.720> that's

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
just a star that is beautiful that's

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.289 
just a star that is beautiful that's
great<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.579> was<00:03:51.579> kind<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.760> mad<00:03:51.880> at<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.269> a

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
great I was kind of mad at this is a

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.220 
great I was kind of mad at this is a
teeny<00:03:52.510> earlier<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.370> after<00:03:54.370> seeing<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:55.230> is

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
teeny earlier but after seeing that is

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.990 
teeny earlier but after seeing that is
our<00:03:56.470> herb<00:03:56.590> spiral<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:59.110> reason<00:04:00.000> planting

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
our herb spiral the reason planting

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.460 
our herb spiral the reason planting
herbs<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.480> spiral<00:04:01.959> is<00:04:02.019> always<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.290> good

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
herbs and the spiral is always a good

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.800 
herbs and the spiral is always a good
idea<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:03.040> because<00:04:03.489> they<00:04:04.360> have<00:04:04.390> different

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
idea is because they have different

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.470 
idea is because they have different
water<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.560> sunlight<00:04:05.799> requirements<00:04:06.610> and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
water and sunlight requirements and

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.690 
water and sunlight requirements and
you'll<00:04:07.660> notice<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.290> spiral<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> pattern

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
you'll notice the spiral is a pattern

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.569 
you'll notice the spiral is a pattern
that<00:04:09.879> occurs<00:04:10.120> very<00:04:10.599> often<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.110> nature<00:04:11.579> for

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
that occurs very often in nature for

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:13.949 
that occurs very often in nature for
example<00:04:12.609> that<00:04:13.060> snail<00:04:13.389> shell<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.870> we

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
example that snail shell that we

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.379 
example that snail shell that we
interacted<00:04:14.410> with<00:04:14.530> earlier<00:04:15.180> while<00:04:16.180> i<00:04:16.209> was

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
interacted with earlier while i was

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.420 
interacted with earlier while i was
building<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.470> looked<00:04:17.919> under<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> lot<00:04:18.400> of

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
building it this I looked under a lot of

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.210 
building it this I looked under a lot of
rocks<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.910> saw<00:04:19.350> millipedes<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.739> spiral

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
rocks and saw millipedes and the spiral

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.529 
rocks and saw millipedes and the spiral
I<00:04:21.430> mean<00:04:21.609> our<00:04:21.700> galaxy<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.630> even<00:04:22.990> in<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.169> spiral<00:04:23.470> so

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
I mean our galaxy is even in a spiral so

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.540 
I mean our galaxy is even in a spiral so
it<00:04:25.539> makes<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.870> lot<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.020> sense<00:04:26.169> to<00:04:26.710> mimic<00:04:27.520> that

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
it makes a lot of sense to mimic that

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.480 
it makes a lot of sense to mimic that
pattern<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:29.139> use<00:04:29.440> it<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:30.389> your<00:04:31.389> benefit<00:04:31.840> so

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
pattern and use it to your benefit so

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.159 
pattern and use it to your benefit so
here<00:04:33.490> we<00:04:33.639> have<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.940> rosemary<00:04:34.450> on<00:04:34.630> top<00:04:34.900> if

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
here we have the rosemary on top if

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.550 
here we have the rosemary on top if
you're<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.380> prefers<00:04:35.770> dry<00:04:36.099> soil<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.930> then<00:04:37.930> it

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
you're the prefers dry soil and then it

about Brussels sprouts is that same look
similar<00:05:35.630> with<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.930> artichoke<00:05:36.380> is<00:05:36.560> that<00:05:37.130> once

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
similar with the artichoke is that once
