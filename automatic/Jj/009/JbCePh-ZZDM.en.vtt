00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
game that you bought so each missions

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.790 
game that you bought so each missions
are<00:02:48.370> different<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.880> lot<00:02:49.150> more<00:02:49.450> Verity<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:50.590> it's

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
are different a lot more Verity so it's

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.470 
are different a lot more Verity so it's
not<00:02:51.040> about<00:02:51.280> doing<00:02:51.670> investigation<00:02:52.330> than

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
not about doing investigation than

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.600 
not about doing investigation than
assassination<00:02:53.230> nine-time<00:02:53.770> it's<00:02:54.040> really<00:02:54.370> more

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
assassination nine-time it's really more

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.030 
assassination nine-time it's really more
like<00:02:54.670> each<00:02:55.120> time<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.660> mission<00:02:56.230> can<00:02:56.530> lead<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:57.010> a

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
like each time a mission can lead to a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.580 
like each time a mission can lead to a
depletion<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:58.360> lead<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.750> chase<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.080> escape

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
depletion can lead to a chase and escape

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.570 
depletion can lead to a chase and escape
can<00:03:00.190> lead<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.670> an<00:03:00.760> assassination<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:03.190> quite

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
can lead to an assassination it's quite

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.300 
can lead to an assassination it's quite
overwhelming<00:03:04.270> amount<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.810> stuff<00:03:04.990> that<00:03:05.020> is

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
overwhelming amount of stuff that is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.580 
overwhelming amount of stuff that is
well<00:03:06.310> having<00:03:06.700> more<00:03:07.090> missions<00:03:07.690> requires<00:03:08.320> us

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
well having more missions requires us

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.320 
well having more missions requires us
ultimately<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.430> more<00:03:09.670> cut<00:03:09.910> scenes<00:03:10.120> and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
ultimately to have more cut scenes and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.970 
ultimately to have more cut scenes and
more<00:03:10.390> cinematics<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.350> think<00:03:11.590> we're<00:03:11.710> adding

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
more cinematics but I think we're adding

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.950 
more cinematics but I think we're adding
a<00:03:12.070> lot<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.370> value<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.000> these<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.720> player

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
a lot of value to these to the player

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.740 
a lot of value to these to the player
and<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.290> couple<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.830> examples<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.490> is

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
and I a couple of examples of this is

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.630 
and I a couple of examples of this is
you<00:03:16.750> could<00:03:16.870> still<00:03:17.140> control<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.770> camera<00:03:18.100> like

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
you could still control the camera like

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.070 
you could still control the camera like
you<00:03:18.790> did<00:03:18.910> in<00:03:19.030> AC<00:03:19.180> one<00:03:19.480> people<00:03:19.750> like<00:03:19.900> that

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
you did in AC one people like that

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.130 
you did in AC one people like that
feature<00:03:20.320> will<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:21.000> we<00:03:22.000> also<00:03:22.150> have<00:03:22.270> many

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
feature will I we also have many

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.520 
feature will I we also have many
branching<00:03:24.070> cutscenes<00:03:25.050> where<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.320> player

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
branching cutscenes where the player

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.160 
branching cutscenes where the player
will<00:03:26.739> have<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.120> interact<00:03:28.120> at<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> specific<00:03:28.690> time

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
will have to interact at a specific time

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.310 
will have to interact at a specific time
and<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.790> may<00:03:31.000> have<00:03:31.270> two<00:03:31.660> different<00:03:31.870> effects

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
and this may have two different effects

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.770 
and this may have two different effects
so<00:03:32.410> if<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.790> hit<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.910> cinematic<00:03:34.360> at<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.600> wrong

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
so if you hit the cinematic at the wrong

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.130 
so if you hit the cinematic at the wrong
time<00:03:35.080> then<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.980> might<00:03:36.130> just<00:03:36.310> hug<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.610> lady

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
time then you might just hug a lady

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.090 
time then you might just hug a lady
whereas<00:03:38.140> if<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.350> hit<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.709> right<00:03:38.920> time

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
whereas if you hit it on the right time

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.870 
whereas if you hit it on the right time
well<00:03:39.280> who<00:03:39.400> knows<00:03:39.520> what's<00:03:40.030> gonna<00:03:40.180> happen

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
well who knows what's gonna happen

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.940 
well who knows what's gonna happen
