00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 No, I do not speak in the same year 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.040
 we are in another video not only 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.780
 I agree with the case and I'm going to speak today. 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.780
 how to work with complex numbers 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.000
 a video showing how to release 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.150
 new functions in the calculator case 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.070
 If you have not seen yet, I'll do it then. 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 the procedure to release 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.410
 work as the complexes and I also did 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.539
 a video showing how to do with actions 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.780
 second and third graders and work 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.730
 its linear ones that can be seen here 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.610
 this link is here looking here at 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.280
 screen now beauty 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.800
 so that's it, let's give up the mass 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.809
 or before you start 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.579
 there are some things here that he has to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.789
 comment to work as the complexes 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:59.129
 we go here in cast and press option 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.879
 number 2 here the beauty and only companies 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.729
 that we have to be careful and not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.950
 the calculator until the option to work 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.820
 with angles and radius years and angles in 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.619
 degrees 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:19.080
 so stay only colander is working 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:23.820
 with mold degrees and again a two 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 three four here four times of the mold and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.970
 choose the options here then to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.220
 first choice number 1 degrees radian 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.549
 years and serious 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.159
 we will use here then the option that 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.640
 and degrees 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.460
 and then placed therein are now yes 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.899
 prepared there began to make 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.770
 operations as in the beauty complexes 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.500
 so sure right happy then 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.170
 let's remember that to work as 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.710
 two forms have the form 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.549
 popular that way here with r but the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.479
 angle and a rectangular shape that 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:11.629
 way here is more vehicle from real 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.819
 eb and part ii maggi in the beauty 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.450
 quiet then we will not be like the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:21.830
 your operations things full numbers 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.829
 I'm going to kick a number here five and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 work with a popular first form 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.549
 to insert that shape symbol 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.420
 popular favor there we tighten the 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.880
 pee but between relatives and between 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.340
 relatives who met in the middle and 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.239
 I type angle so here we people 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.450
 would you like 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.099
 the operation you want to put me here 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.329
 plus another number 3 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.120
 shift + between relatives contracted in the 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.970
 Middle and I'm walking here again 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.170
 before confirming that it works ok you have 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:07.060
 choosing the answer is going to be 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.180
 popular form as favors or in the form 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.810
 rectangular with a + b ii 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.630
 let's select a popular way even 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.609
 For this then we tighten the shift and 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:28.359
 one more button you can see that already 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:31.430
 It seems right with is and the angle here 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.519
 that we want in the popular way 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.510
 Now, we can give the ok then the 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:41.959
 equal here of equal to that first 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.690
 appears 8 that ours is to know the 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.410
 Angle, we squeeze Shishin has the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.329
 Like button and it seems here to 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.579
 people can see that here in the corner 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.579
 left has the favor symbol 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:02.090
 Here our world then that's it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.900
 if you want the answer in that way 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.319
 rectangular rather you tighten jitin and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:15.519
 button unless he comes here on ground 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:20.329
 and in the formula but came from the oneok one ok 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:23.180
 and here it is in the rectangular formula 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.830
 This is the soul part and to know part 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.789
 imagine the same thing 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.259
 shift and you can see that here 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:36.860
 appears the part imaginary beauty and 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:40.070
 come back again in the part is to the whip 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.150
 equal quiet lan 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.340
 good is this today holds as edict 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.580
 with a foolish form 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.360
 now if you want to type is the number 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.870
 in the most bee form to do this then the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.639
 people place between walls edit that the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.440
 real part 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:06.620
 I'll put four more and I'll kick one 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.449
 number here three that the imaginary part 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.180
 to place imaginary part open 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:17.110
 this button here in of puts the button that 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.130
 there appears the wii the imaginary party 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:35.830
 closed relatives 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:35.830
 let's put another 155 is two more 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:43.159
 so we have the part to the part and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.070
 then choose what you want to be in with 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:51.229
 part the answer if you will want or 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.249
 rectangular good to want here in shape 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:58.429
 triangular same answer from ok 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:01.339
 is not equal and jael that point to 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:04.729
 people are from the royal court to know part 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:09.349
 imaginary shift equal to anyone here 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:12.949
 Our part imagine if you want 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:18.709
 know this in the popular way you open 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:21.109
 shift + science and the popular form gives a 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:26.599
 equal and beauty 

00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:32.299
 It is that ours is the shift angle equal and 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:35.239
 here looks like a peaceful sleep then bora 

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:38.179
 is going to pass if you have any questions and 

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:43.519
 eat hard the video do not know so 

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:46.549
 popular and complex rectangle that I 

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:51.229
 I told him he left one question and his 

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:55.069
 comment on the blog and gives a young 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.659
 liked the wii on the channel sign up 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.119
 also our channel to receive 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:03.019
 updates and continues to follow 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:05.329
 our blog short our page and follow 

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:10.689
 on twitter also a great 

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:10.689
 I hug the field over here in even more
