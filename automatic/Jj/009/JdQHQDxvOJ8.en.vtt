through it man it'll get them no doubt
about<00:00:27.449> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
about it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.589 
about it
you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.189> only<00:00:29.189> when<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> had<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.880> big<00:00:30.210> tree

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you know only when I had this big tree

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.540 
you know only when I had this big tree
that<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.470> wanted<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> protect<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that I really wanted to protect as I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.910 
that I really wanted to protect as I
start<00:00:32.790> thinking<00:00:33.329> lightning<00:00:34.020> protection<00:00:34.290> but

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
start thinking lightning protection but

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.350 
start thinking lightning protection but
there's<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> lot<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.489> reasons<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.149> makes

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
there's a lot of reasons that it makes

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
there's a lot of reasons that it makes
sense<00:00:36.660> oh<00:00:37.050> no<00:00:37.469> doubt<00:00:37.680> yeah

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
sense oh no doubt yeah

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
sense oh no doubt yeah

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
if you lose a shade tree like this a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950 
if you lose a shade tree like this a
huge<00:00:40.649> tree<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.760> plus<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.210> pull<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
huge tree and a plus you pull up and you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
huge tree and a plus you pull up and you
see<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.260> big<00:00:43.530> nice-looking<00:00:44.250> tree<00:00:44.399> man<00:00:44.579> I'd

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
see this big nice-looking tree man I'd

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.619 
see this big nice-looking tree man I'd
hate<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> lose<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.210> too

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
hate to lose it too

hate to lose it too
yeah<00:00:45.809> yeah<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.559> aesthetic<00:00:47.039> reasons

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
yeah yeah so for aesthetic reasons

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.950 
yeah yeah so for aesthetic reasons
they're<00:00:47.730> important<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.629> course<00:00:48.809> the

they're important but then of course the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.170 
they're important but then of course the
energy<00:00:49.140> savings<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:51.000> all

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
energy savings that you can have up all

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.819 
energy savings that you can have up all
the<00:00:51.270> shade<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.870> sayd<00:00:52.140> it'll<00:00:52.379> make<00:00:52.530> sure<00:00:52.680> your

house<00:00:52.980> yeah<00:00:53.340> why<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.210> two<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
house yeah why I think about two of I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.240 
house yeah why I think about two of I
mean<00:00:54.899> by<00:00:54.989> losing<00:00:55.379> these<00:00:55.500> things<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.920> mean<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
mean by losing these things I mean to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
mean by losing these things I mean to
take<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.640> tree<00:00:56.940> down<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.930> killed

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
take that tree down that that was killed

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
take that tree down that that was killed
I<00:00:58.320> mean<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> cost<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.210> have

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I mean the cost there it's you you have

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
I mean the cost there it's you you have
to<00:01:00.420> cost<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.809> lighting<00:01:01.109> protection<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.559> pay

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to cost a lighting protection would pay

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
to cost a lighting protection would pay
for<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.820> save<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.449> money<00:01:03.480> than

cutting it man running and all right
being<00:01:06.180> proactive<00:01:06.540> rather<00:01:07.320> than<00:01:07.680> waiting<00:01:08.280> for

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
being proactive rather than waiting for

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
being proactive rather than waiting for
it<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> happen<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> find<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.650> are
