island riptide so what made you decide

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.490 
island riptide so what made you decide
to<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.550> another<00:01:00.000> zombie<00:01:00.239> game<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to do another zombie game but with a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.840 
to do another zombie game but with a
slightly<00:01:01.829> different<00:01:02.070> spin<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.789> time

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
slightly different spin on it this time

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.299 
slightly different spin on it this time
around<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.960> came<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.589> concept<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
around we came up with this concept that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
around we came up with this concept that
if<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.850> add<00:01:06.030> some<00:01:06.390> new<00:01:06.810> elements<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.470> zombie

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
if we add some new elements the zombie

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.020 
if we add some new elements the zombie
Jenna<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.369> create<00:01:08.580> something<00:01:08.880> new

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
Jenna we can create something new

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.090 
Jenna we can create something new
something<00:01:09.479> fresh<00:01:09.780> something<00:01:09.900> unique<00:01:10.530> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
something fresh something unique so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
something fresh something unique so
that's<00:01:11.400> really<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that's really that's that that's the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.359 
that's really that's that that's the
idea<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.930> decided<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.100> we

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
idea we decided to go with it because we

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
idea we decided to go with it because we
thought<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.610> hey<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.420> something<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
thought that hey this is something that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.420 
thought that hey this is something that
hasn't<00:01:16.080> been<00:01:16.259> done<00:01:16.350> before<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.009> these

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
hasn't been done before and these

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
hasn't been done before and these
elements<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.509> our<00:01:18.630> game<00:01:18.869> decide

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
elements that we have in our game decide

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.320 
elements that we have in our game decide
things<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.970> general

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
things that I think don't be general

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
things that I think don't be general
funds<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.340> that's<00:01:23.580> that's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
funds really will like and that's that's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
funds really will like and that's that's
really<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.299> simple<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.140> thought<00:01:25.439> it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
really that simple we just thought it's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.429 
really that simple we just thought it's
a<00:01:25.740> great<00:01:25.950> idea<00:01:26.250> yeah<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.140> third

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
a great idea yeah this is the the third

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
a great idea yeah this is the the third
zombie<00:01:28.770> survival<00:01:29.369> game<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> some<00:01:30.090> sort<00:01:30.119> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
zombie survival game of some sort that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.670 
zombie survival game of some sort that
you've<00:01:30.630> done<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:30.990> quite<00:01:31.200> frankly<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.560> doesn't

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you've done but quite frankly it doesn't

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.520 
you've done but quite frankly it doesn't
really<00:01:31.979> resemble<00:01:32.189> dead<00:01:32.790> island<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.600> many<00:01:34.229> ways

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
really resemble dead island in many ways

your agility you have

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.650 
your agility you have
using<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.370> intelligence<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.300> think<00:02:15.510> that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
using that intelligence and I think that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.480 
using that intelligence and I think that
using<00:02:16.140> your<00:02:16.410> intelligence<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.220> most

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
using your intelligence is the most

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.860 
using your intelligence is the most
important<00:02:17.970> thing<00:02:18.090> because<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.660> each

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
important thing because in each

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.449 
important thing because in each
situation<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.709> many<00:02:19.950> options<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
situation you have many options to

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.190 
situation you have many options to
choose<00:02:20.700> from<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.840> make<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
choose from and you have to make the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.800 
choose from and you have to make the
decision<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.040> speed<00:02:23.430> seconds<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.060> watch

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
decision in like speed seconds and watch

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.130 
decision in like speed seconds and watch
that<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.280> decisions<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.030> make<00:02:27.209> they're

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that the decisions that you make they're

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.620 
that the decisions that you make they're
like<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.800> add<00:02:28.980> either<00:02:29.430> live<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.000> die<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
like you add either live or you die and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.020 
like you add either live or you die and
yeah<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.590> yeah<00:02:32.340> absolutely<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:33.000> should

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
yeah that's it yeah absolutely we should

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.060 
yeah that's it yeah absolutely we should
we<00:02:33.300> definitely<00:02:33.600> saw<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.170> demo<00:02:34.590> very

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
we definitely saw that in the demo very

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.580 
we definitely saw that in the demo very
much<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.209> park<00:02:36.780> or<00:02:36.959> system<00:02:37.290> i<00:02:37.380> think

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
much so now the park or system i think

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.290 
much so now the park or system i think
is<00:02:37.740> probably<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.459> something<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.180> a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
is probably going to be something that a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.030 
is probably going to be something that a
lot<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.480> people<00:02:39.570> focus<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.260> because<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.680> one

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
lot of people focus on because it's one

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
lot of people focus on because it's one
of<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.190> more<00:02:41.340> unique<00:02:41.580> elements<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.450> game

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
of the more unique elements of the game

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.330 
of the more unique elements of the game
Parker<00:02:43.440> systems<00:02:43.770> have<00:02:43.920> been<00:02:44.040> done<00:02:44.220> before

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
Parker systems have been done before

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.310 
Parker systems have been done before
they<00:02:44.819> haven't<00:02:45.209> been<00:02:45.300> done<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.870> much<00:02:46.110> in

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
they haven't been done that much in

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.840 
they haven't been done that much in
first<00:02:46.560> person<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.190> when<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.640> been

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
first person and when they have been

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.300 
first person and when they have been
done<00:02:48.060> they've<00:02:48.450> been<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.660> lot<00:02:48.900> more<00:02:48.930> limited<00:02:49.770> so

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
done they've been a lot more limited so

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.740

anyway the any way they like and so if
there's<00:03:05.850> something<00:03:06.150> that's<00:03:06.420> within<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
there's something that's within the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.420 
there's something that's within the
reach<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.080> their<00:03:07.320> hands<00:03:07.650> they<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.250> go

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
reach of their hands they can just go

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.040 
reach of their hands they can just go
that<00:03:08.640> they<00:03:08.820> can<00:03:09.000> jump<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.450> they<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.810> climb

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
that they can jump that they can climb

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.590 
that they can jump that they can climb
climb<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.620> top<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
climb on top of it so that's like the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.630 
climb on top of it so that's like the
the<00:03:13.019> base<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> basic<00:03:13.860> idea<00:03:14.130> behind<00:03:14.220> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
the base is the basic idea behind the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.210 
the base is the basic idea behind the
powerful<00:03:15.000> element<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.680> as<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.739> mentioned<00:03:17.130> it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
powerful element and as I mentioned it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.680 
powerful element and as I mentioned it
open<00:03:17.550> word<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.209> like<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.510> have

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
open word so it's not like you have

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.110 
open word so it's not like you have
those<00:03:18.840> linear<00:03:19.470> corridors<00:03:20.130> with<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:20.910> some

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
those linear corridors with like some

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.390 
those linear corridors with like some
elements<00:03:21.600> highlighted<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.500> can<00:03:22.530> grab<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.280> to

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
elements highlighted you can grab on to

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.449 
elements highlighted you can grab on to
everything<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:25.049> really<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.950> supported

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
everything and this really is supported

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.039 
everything and this really is supported
by<00:03:26.489> other<00:03:26.760> elements<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.480> game<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:27.930> you

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
by other elements of the game so if you

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.479 
by other elements of the game so if you
see<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.410> zombies<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:30.320> it's<00:03:31.320> viable<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.310> it's

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
see a zombies you it's viable and it's

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.360 
see a zombies you it's viable and it's
kind<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.850> easy<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.829> avoid<00:03:34.829> them<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
kind of easy to and avoid them and to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.789 
kind of easy to and avoid them and to
jump<00:03:35.610> on<00:03:35.760> roofs<00:03:35.970> etc<00:03:36.150> etc<00:03:36.540> yeah<00:03:37.530> now<00:03:37.739> you

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
jump on roofs etc etc yeah now you

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.580 
jump on roofs etc etc yeah now you
mentioned<00:03:38.280> open<00:03:38.579> world<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.269> usually<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:40.200> open

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
mentioned open world so usually in open

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.440 
mentioned open world so usually in open
world<00:03:40.799> games<00:03:41.010> there<00:03:41.250> was<00:03:41.340> some<00:03:41.820> kind<00:03:42.180> of

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
world games there was some kind of

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.970 
world games there was some kind of
restrictions<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.230> where<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.410> can<00:03:43.590> initially

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
restrictions to where you can initially

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.280 
restrictions to where you can initially
go<00:03:44.430> whether<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.299> hard<00:03:45.600> restriction<00:03:46.170> in

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
go whether it be a hard restriction in

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.840 
go whether it be a hard restriction in
the<00:03:46.320> sense<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:47.130> can't<00:03:47.400> get<00:03:47.549> out<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.760> this

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
the sense of you can't get out of this

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.370 
the sense of you can't get out of this
area<00:03:48.209> or<00:03:48.299> whether<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.510> be<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.630> soft<00:03:48.900> restriction

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
area or whether it be a soft restriction

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.410 
area or whether it be a soft restriction
saying<00:03:49.560> well<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.769> can<00:03:50.070> go<00:03:50.340> there<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:50.910> yeah

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
saying well you can go there but yeah

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.050 
saying well you can go there but yeah
probably<00:03:51.840> dead<00:03:52.410> if<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.620> actually<00:03:53.040> try<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.640> so

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
probably dead if you actually try it so

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.850 
probably dead if you actually try it so
how<00:03:54.540> do<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.810> actually<00:03:54.840> manage<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
how do you actually manage the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.830 
how do you actually manage the
progression<00:03:56.459> through<00:03:56.670> your<00:03:56.820> open<00:03:57.060> world<00:03:57.239> so

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
progression through your open world so

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.650 
progression through your open world so
we<00:03:57.959> can<00:03:58.079> go<00:03:58.320> with<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.590> soft<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.940> you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
we can go with this soft like you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.569 
we can go with this soft like you
mentioned<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.380> soft<00:04:01.650> limitation<00:04:02.280> and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
mentioned the the soft limitation and

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.110 
mentioned the the soft limitation and
you<00:04:03.360> can<00:04:03.540> go<00:04:03.690> anywhere<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.230> like<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:06.000> be

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
you can go anywhere you like but to be

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.580 
you can go anywhere you like but to be
honest<00:04:06.420> there<00:04:06.600> are<00:04:06.660> sections<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.350> maps

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
honest there are sections of the maps

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.979 
honest there are sections of the maps
sections<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.280> game<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.670> will<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:09.720> quite

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
sections of the game that will be quite

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.930 
sections of the game that will be quite
hard<00:04:10.230> if<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.560> go<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.950> at<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.400> other<00:04:11.609> side<00:04:11.910> of

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
hard if you go the at the other side of

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.220 
hard if you go the at the other side of
the<00:04:12.090> game<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.570> have<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.840> level<00:04:13.019> up<00:04:13.200> your

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
the game so you have to level up your

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.259 
the game so you have to level up your
character<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.859> have<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.160> build<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.549> we<00:04:15.000> start

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
character you have to build it we start

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.880 
character you have to build it we start
with<00:04:15.359> four<00:04:15.660> characters<00:04:16.200> because<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.859> a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
with four characters because this is a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.759 
with four characters because this is a
four<00:04:17.190> player<00:04:17.370> co-op<00:04:17.700> game<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:19.440> be<00:04:19.620> played

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
four player co-op game and can be played

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.520 
four player co-op game and can be played
in<00:04:19.859> cobb<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.940> spend<00:04:21.209> with<00:04:21.510> four<00:04:21.780> characters

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
in cobb you spend with four characters

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.110 
in cobb you spend with four characters
on<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.890> same<00:04:23.130> base<00:04:23.340> level<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.880> then<00:04:24.000> you

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
on the same base level and then you

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.020 
on the same base level and then you
build<00:04:24.390> those<00:04:25.050> characters<00:04:25.820> however<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:27.000> like

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
build those characters however you like

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.770 
build those characters however you like
it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
it

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.540 
it
during<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.020> gameplay<00:04:28.230> but<00:04:28.530> all<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:29.430> those

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
during the gameplay but all of those

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.430 
during the gameplay but all of those
characters<00:04:30.060> have<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.480> basic<00:04:30.900> ability<00:04:31.290> to

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
characters have the basic ability to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.490 
characters have the basic ability to
free<00:04:31.650> run<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.100> use<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.670> micro<00:04:33.360> movements<00:04:33.540> okay

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
free run to use the micro movements okay

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.480 
free run to use the micro movements okay
so<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.770> mentioned<00:04:34.950> some<00:04:35.160> character

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
so you mentioned some character

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.830 
so you mentioned some character
progression<00:04:35.639> so<00:04:36.090> let's<00:04:36.270> get<00:04:36.419> into<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.780> a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
progression so let's get into that a

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.060 
progression so let's get into that a
little<00:04:36.990> bit<00:04:37.169> more<00:04:37.350> you've<00:04:37.530> done<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.770> before

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
little bit more you've done it before

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.100 
little bit more you've done it before
with<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.460> dead<00:04:38.880> island<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:39.720> had<00:04:39.870> four

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
with a dead island and you had four

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.470 
with a dead island and you had four
fairly<00:04:40.470> distinct<00:04:40.950> classes<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.700> focused<00:04:42.360> on

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
fairly distinct classes that focused on

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.970 
fairly distinct classes that focused on
different<00:04:42.600> kinds<00:04:43.139> of<00:04:43.230> combat<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.770> can<00:04:43.889> all

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
different kinds of combat you can all

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.710 
different kinds of combat you can all
kind<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.280> use<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.460> same<00:04:44.730> weapons<00:04:45.120> but<00:04:45.360> you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
kind of use the same weapons but you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.030 
kind of use the same weapons but you
would<00:04:45.840> get<00:04:45.960> an<00:04:46.080> emphasis<00:04:46.500> on<00:04:46.650> various

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
would get an emphasis on various

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.010 
would get an emphasis on various
different<00:04:47.370> kinds<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.639> combat<00:04:48.000> here<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:48.750> time

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
different kinds of combat here this time

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.930 
different kinds of combat here this time
around<00:04:49.169> you're<00:04:49.500> less<00:04:49.710> combat<00:04:50.100> focused<00:04:50.550> so

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
around you're less combat focused so

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.580 
around you're less combat focused so
what<00:04:51.450> kind<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.690> abilities<00:04:52.110> will<00:04:52.380> these

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
what kind of abilities will these

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.230 
what kind of abilities will these
different<00:04:52.860> classes<00:04:53.130> actually<00:04:53.250> have<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:54.000> each

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
different classes actually have so each

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.480 
different classes actually have so each
of<00:04:54.450> our<00:04:54.600> abilities<00:04:55.200> are<00:04:55.440> active<00:04:55.980> skills<00:04:56.340> so

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
of our abilities are active skills so

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.040 
of our abilities are active skills so
you<00:04:56.520> have<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.970> press<00:04:57.240> something<00:04:57.540> when<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.900> hit

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
you have to press something when you hit

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.710 
you have to press something when you hit
do<00:04:58.350> something<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.919> use<00:04:59.070> those<00:04:59.280> skills<00:04:59.730> and<00:05:00.090> of

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
do something to use those skills and of

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.300 
do something to use those skills and of
course<00:05:00.960> there<00:05:01.140> are<00:05:01.230> skins<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:02.160> I've

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
course there are skins that that I've

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.250 
course there are skins that that I've
focused<00:05:02.700> that<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.060> will<00:05:03.330> relate<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:03.960> come

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
focused that I will relate it to come

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.659 
focused that I will relate it to come
back<00:05:04.290> but<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.710> course<00:05:04.770> they're<00:05:05.070> all<00:05:05.160> schemes

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
back but of course they're all schemes

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.510 
back but of course they're all schemes
that<00:05:05.730> I<00:05:06.090> just<00:05:06.720> for<00:05:07.140> made<00:05:07.830> for<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.160> freerunning

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
that I just for made for the freerunning

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.670 
that I just for made for the freerunning
so<00:05:08.820> for<00:05:09.030> example<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.570> hope<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.140> were<00:05:10.260> able<00:05:10.290> to

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
so for example I hope you were able to

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.200 
so for example I hope you were able to
experience<00:05:11.040> that<00:05:11.280> there<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:11.580> one<00:05:11.790> skit<00:05:12.060> that

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
experience that there is one skit that

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.970 
experience that there is one skit that
allows<00:05:12.510> you<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.630> jump<00:05:12.960> on<00:05:13.140> top<00:05:13.290> of<00:05:13.350> zombies<00:05:13.770> and

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
allows you to jump on top of zombies and

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.070 
allows you to jump on top of zombies and
then<00:05:14.160> jump<00:05:14.640> higher<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.180> that's<00:05:15.419> that's<00:05:15.690> just

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
then jump higher so that's that's just

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.360 
then jump higher so that's that's just
one<00:05:16.230> of<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.380> examples<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.070> skills<00:05:17.340> that

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
one of the examples of the skills that

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.940 
one of the examples of the skills that
we<00:05:17.580> have<00:05:17.760> excellent<00:05:18.600> okay<00:05:19.200> so<00:05:19.260> you<00:05:19.500> did

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
we have excellent okay so you did

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.460 
we have excellent okay so you did
mention<00:05:20.070> four<00:05:20.370> player<00:05:20.550> co-op<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.840> only<00:05:22.290> got

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
mention four player co-op and I only got

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.860 
mention four player co-op and I only got
to<00:05:22.590> play<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.770> in<00:05:23.010> single<00:05:23.580> player<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:24.240> I've<00:05:24.690> got

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
to play it in single player so I've got

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.230 
to play it in single player so I've got
to<00:05:24.900> ask<00:05:25.110> what<00:05:25.950> does<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.340> co-op<00:05:26.610> bring<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:27.090> the

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
to ask what does the co-op bring to the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.300 
to ask what does the co-op bring to the
table<00:05:27.419> what<00:05:27.900> kind<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.350> things<00:05:28.620> can<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:28.950> do

just drop in and they help you of course

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.790 
just drop in and they help you of course
the<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:48.150> system<00:05:48.570> that<00:05:48.600> we've<00:05:48.870> created<00:05:48.990> work

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
the the system that we've created work

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.980 
the the system that we've created work
doesn't<00:05:50.490> matter<00:05:50.820> if<00:05:51.000> you<00:05:51.090> play<00:05:51.300> alone<00:05:51.720> or<00:05:51.780> if

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
doesn't matter if you play alone or if

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.779 
doesn't matter if you play alone or if
you<00:05:52.110> play<00:05:52.289> with<00:05:52.470> four<00:05:52.740> players<00:05:52.979> players<00:05:53.460> so

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
you play with four players players so

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.240 
you play with four players players so
for<00:05:54.210> example<00:05:54.270> one<00:05:54.690> of<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:55.020> can<00:05:55.320> for<00:05:56.190> example

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
for example one of you can for example

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.279 
for example one of you can for example
make<00:05:56.729> some<00:05:56.970> noise<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:57.419> he<00:05:57.870> can<00:05:58.050> draw<00:05:58.229> the

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
make some noise and he can draw the

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.529 
make some noise and he can draw the
zombies<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.860> him<00:05:59.039> and<00:05:59.190> then<00:05:59.640> the<00:05:59.850> the<00:05:59.880> other

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
zombies to him and then the the other

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.279 
zombies to him and then the the other
players<00:06:00.960> can<00:06:01.289> safely<00:06:02.160> walk<00:06:02.250> around<00:06:02.700> them<00:06:02.850> and

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
players can safely walk around them and

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.620 
players can safely walk around them and
complete<00:06:04.289> the<00:06:04.380> objective<00:06:04.860> okay<00:06:05.850> so<00:06:06.120> what<00:06:06.450> kind

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
complete the objective okay so what kind

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.480 
complete the objective okay so what kind
of<00:06:06.750> synergy<00:06:07.020> is<00:06:07.260> can<00:06:07.530> we<00:06:07.680> expect<00:06:07.979> between<00:06:08.190> the

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
of synergy is can we expect between the

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.040 
of synergy is can we expect between the
classes<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:09.180> allow<00:06:09.390> them<00:06:09.570> to<00:06:09.660> work<00:06:09.840> together

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
classes to allow them to work together

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.880 
classes to allow them to work together
in<00:06:10.470> co-op<00:06:10.789> well<00:06:11.789> the<00:06:12.360> classes<00:06:12.840> as<00:06:13.169> I<00:06:13.229> say<00:06:13.740> as

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
in co-op well the classes as I say as

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.100 
in co-op well the classes as I say as
I've<00:06:14.039> mentioned<00:06:14.070> before<00:06:14.510> it's<00:06:15.510> kind<00:06:15.690> of<00:06:15.810> hard

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
I've mentioned before it's kind of hard

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.500 
I've mentioned before it's kind of hard
to<00:06:16.250> talk<00:06:17.250> about<00:06:17.310> classes<00:06:18.030> in<00:06:18.150> our<00:06:18.270> game

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
to talk about classes in our game

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.270 
to talk about classes in our game
because<00:06:18.780> you<00:06:18.810> start<00:06:19.169> at<00:06:19.320> the<00:06:19.350> zero<00:06:19.770> level<00:06:19.950> and

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
because you start at the zero level and

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.370 
because you start at the zero level and
then<00:06:20.789> there<00:06:20.970> are<00:06:21.030> many<00:06:21.450> many<00:06:21.720> bills<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.289> you

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
then there are many many bills that you

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.800 
then there are many many bills that you
can<00:06:22.560> end<00:06:22.950> up<00:06:23.220> with<00:06:23.460> so<00:06:23.669> it's<00:06:24.060> kind<00:06:24.240> of<00:06:24.330> hard<00:06:24.390> to

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
can end up with so it's kind of hard to

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.930 
can end up with so it's kind of hard to
talk<00:06:25.289> about<00:06:25.350> classes<00:06:25.919> but<00:06:26.130> of<00:06:26.340> course<00:06:26.700> there

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
talk about classes but of course there

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.790 
talk about classes but of course there
are<00:06:27.030> there<00:06:27.630> are<00:06:27.660> skills<00:06:28.020> that<00:06:28.140> you<00:06:28.410> can<00:06:28.590> use<00:06:28.770> to

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
are there are skills that you can use to

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.940 
are there are skills that you can use to
help<00:06:29.220> other<00:06:29.850> people<00:06:30.270> but<00:06:30.390> that's<00:06:31.380> that's<00:06:31.650> that

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
help other people but that's that's that

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.210 
help other people but that's that's that
but<00:06:32.190> the<00:06:32.340> amount<00:06:33.090> as<00:06:33.720> you<00:06:33.840> said<00:06:34.140> synergies<00:06:34.979> is

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
but the amount as you said synergies is

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.909 
but the amount as you said synergies is
really<00:06:35.789> limitless<00:06:36.120> right<00:06:36.990> so<00:06:37.260> basically<00:06:37.560> what

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
really limitless right so basically what

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.040 
really limitless right so basically what
we're<00:06:38.039> talking<00:06:38.370> about<00:06:38.430> here<00:06:38.580> is<00:06:39.060> a<00:06:39.360> class

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
we're talking about here is a class

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.450 
we're talking about here is a class
system<00:06:40.560> that

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
system that

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.279 
system that
would<00:06:41.639> allow<00:06:41.850> you<00:06:41.910> to<00:06:42.120> play<00:06:42.300> with<00:06:42.600> four<00:06:42.960> of<00:06:43.139> the

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
would allow you to play with four of the

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.499 
would allow you to play with four of the
same<00:06:43.530> class<00:06:44.250> but<00:06:44.580> everything<00:06:45.240> would<00:06:45.360> still

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
same class but everything would still

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.330 
same class but everything would still
work<00:06:45.720> together<00:06:46.020> there<00:06:46.380> is<00:06:46.470> there<00:06:46.889> is<00:06:46.919> some

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
work together there is there is some

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.659 
work together there is there is some
synergy<00:06:47.789> but<00:06:47.940> no<00:06:48.060> interdependence<00:06:49.669> excellent

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
synergy but no interdependence excellent

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.059 
synergy but no interdependence excellent
so<00:06:51.150> a<00:06:51.630> couple<00:06:51.960> of<00:06:52.139> extra<00:06:52.380> questions<00:06:52.740> that<00:06:52.919> I've

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
so a couple of extra questions that I've

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.830 
so a couple of extra questions that I've
got<00:06:53.430> for<00:06:53.669> you<00:06:53.699> obviously<00:06:54.240> Techland<00:06:54.630> has

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
got for you obviously Techland has

specific<00:07:01.889> features<00:07:02.310> that<00:07:02.520> we<00:07:02.639> should<00:07:02.759> be

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 
specific features that we should be

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.040 
specific features that we should be
looking<00:07:02.910> out<00:07:03.090> for<00:07:03.150> well<00:07:03.630> that's<00:07:03.840> really

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
looking out for well that's really

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.390 
looking out for well that's really
because<00:07:04.349> you<00:07:04.380> want<00:07:04.620> to<00:07:04.680> make<00:07:04.889> a<00:07:04.919> game<00:07:05.220> that

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
because you want to make a game that

because you want to make a game that
place<00:07:05.729> the<00:07:06.270> same<00:07:06.479> on<00:07:06.539> all<00:07:06.750> platforms<00:07:06.990> of

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
place the same on all platforms of

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.170 
place the same on all platforms of
course<00:07:07.590> we<00:07:07.740> try<00:07:07.979> to<00:07:08.039> use<00:07:08.280> to<00:07:08.819> play<00:07:09.000> the

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
course we try to use to play the

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.059 
course we try to use to play the
strengths<00:07:09.569> of<00:07:09.660> each<00:07:09.810> platform<00:07:10.139> but<00:07:10.590> and<00:07:10.830> and

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:11.069 
strengths of each platform but and and

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:13.159 
strengths of each platform but and and
it<00:07:11.370> in<00:07:11.669> terms<00:07:11.910> of<00:07:12.030> PC<00:07:12.479> it's<00:07:12.720> mostly<00:07:12.990> the

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
it in terms of PC it's mostly the

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.439 
it in terms of PC it's mostly the
processing<00:07:13.680> power<00:07:13.889> and<00:07:14.190> the<00:07:15.030> use<00:07:15.180> of<00:07:15.210> the

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:15.449 
processing power and the use of the

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.620 
processing power and the use of the
middle<00:07:15.750> word<00:07:16.009> but<00:07:17.009> it<00:07:17.520> plays<00:07:18.000> the<00:07:18.210> same<00:07:18.389> on<00:07:18.570> all

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
middle word but it plays the same on all

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.770 
middle word but it plays the same on all
platforms<00:07:18.870> really<00:07:19.320> ok<00:07:20.190> and<00:07:20.430> I<00:07:21.150> suppose<00:07:21.360> the

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
platforms really ok and I suppose the

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.540 
platforms really ok and I suppose the
last<00:07:22.169> question<00:07:22.560> that<00:07:22.680> I<00:07:22.740> would<00:07:22.889> have<00:07:23.039> before
