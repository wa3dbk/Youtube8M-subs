access<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.069> simple<00:00:05.670> system<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.240> developed

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
access to a simple system I developed

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.900 
access to a simple system I developed
that<00:00:07.109> made<00:00:07.410> me<00:00:07.560> twenty<00:00:07.950> one<00:00:08.069> thousand<00:00:08.610> dollars

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
that made me twenty one thousand dollars

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.540 
that made me twenty one thousand dollars
in<00:00:09.090> 21<00:00:09.540> days<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.290> very<00:00:10.679> first<00:00:11.010> time<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.519> was

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
in 21 days the very first time it was

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.780 
in 21 days the very first time it was
ever<00:00:11.940> used<00:00:12.690> you'll<00:00:13.410> see<00:00:13.620> live<00:00:13.950> proof<00:00:14.340> that

ever used you'll see live proof that

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
ever used you'll see live proof that
this<00:00:14.910> does<00:00:15.269> make<00:00:15.480> twenty<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:15.990> thousand

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
you the entire system absolutely free if

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.939 
you the entire system absolutely free if
you'll<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.600> listen<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> watch<00:00:22.710> this

presentation<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:24.060> let's<00:00:24.449> get<00:00:24.900> started<00:00:25.289> there

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
presentation so let's get started there

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.800 
presentation so let's get started there
is<00:00:26.369> only<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:26.849> thing<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> bring<00:00:27.630> up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
is only one thing I have to bring up

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
is only one thing I have to bring up
before<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.320> too<00:00:28.529> far<00:00:28.560> though<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.580> simple

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
before we get too far though the simple

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
before we get too far though the simple
system<00:00:30.359> I've<00:00:30.539> developed<00:00:30.750> works<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.650> well<00:00:31.679> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
system I've developed works so well that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.040 
system I've developed works so well that
if<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.489> allow<00:00:32.730> too<00:00:32.790> many<00:00:33.149> people<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> use<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
if I allow too many people to use it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
if I allow too many people to use it
there's<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> chance<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.280> bad<00:00:35.489> apple<00:00:35.700> will

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there's a chance that one bad apple will

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819 
there's a chance that one bad apple will
get<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> ruin<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.079> everyone<00:00:37.320> else<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
get in and ruin it for everyone else and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.979 
get in and ruin it for everyone else and
that's<00:00:38.280> why<00:00:38.579> I'm<00:00:38.790> strictly<00:00:39.270> limiting<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that's why I'm strictly limiting the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
that's why I'm strictly limiting the
number<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.320> people<00:00:40.590> who<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.370> which

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
number of people who can use it which

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540 
number of people who can use it which
means<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.870> site<00:00:43.230> may<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.469> gone<00:00:43.829> tomorrow<00:00:44.070> or

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
means this site may be gone tomorrow or

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
means this site may be gone tomorrow or
worse<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.239> may<00:00:45.539> still<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.800> may

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
worse it may still be here but you may

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.459 
worse it may still be here but you may
find<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> price<00:00:47.700> tag<00:00:48.000> unaffordable<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.379> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
find the price tag unaffordable think of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.930 
find the price tag unaffordable think of
