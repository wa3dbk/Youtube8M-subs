so<00:02:02.969> looking<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> performance<00:02:04.200> we'll

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
so looking at the performance we'll

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.929 
so looking at the performance we'll
start<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> high<00:02:05.100> graphics<00:02:05.610> settings

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
start with the high graphics settings

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.700 
start with the high graphics settings
then<00:02:06.060> move<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.390> max<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> high<00:02:07.200> graphics

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
then move to max on a high graphics

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.619 
then move to max on a high graphics
settings<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.610> play<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.970> game<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.209> all

for<00:02:20.220> me<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.550> good<00:02:20.640> enough<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:20.940> most<00:02:21.300> people

it<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.390> bit<00:03:03.690> more<00:03:03.870> impressive<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:04.440> that

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
it is a bit more impressive in that

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.040 
it is a bit more impressive in that
regard<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.820> think<00:03:06.209> grid<00:03:06.360> Autosport<00:03:06.510> is

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
regard but I think grid Autosport is

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.770 
regard but I think grid Autosport is
optimized<00:03:07.769> for<00:03:08.010> Nvidia<00:03:08.820> devices<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.600> that's

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
optimized for Nvidia devices and that's

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.479 
optimized for Nvidia devices and that's
why<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.110> see<00:03:10.320> this<00:03:10.530> disparity<00:03:11.070> in<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> way

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
why we see this disparity in the way

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.470 
why we see this disparity in the way
that<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.930> 750ti

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
that it is the 750ti

that it is the 750ti

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
that is where the 760 would be so it

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.340 
that is where the 760 would be so it
would<00:04:37.800> be<00:04:37.950> in<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.190> probably<00:04:38.760> 65<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.600> 75<00:04:40.110> FPS

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
something to do that so what are my

something to do that so what are my

recommendations here I mean obviously we

recommendations here I mean obviously we

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
look at sli with the 780 s it's not even

look at sli with the 780 s it's not even
why<00:04:54.090> would<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:54.360> spend<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.810> kind<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.080> money

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
why would you spend that kind of money

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.100 
why would you spend that kind of money
on<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.680> but<00:04:55.950> they<00:04:56.160> did<00:04:56.220> well<00:04:56.670> so<00:04:57.090> that's<00:04:57.300> cool

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
on this but they did well so that's cool

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.500 
on this but they did well so that's cool

something on those lines my

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.840 
something on those lines my
recommendations<00:05:41.070> would<00:05:41.190> be<00:05:41.340> this<00:05:41.490> if<00:05:41.729> you're

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
recommendations would be this if you're

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.090 
recommendations would be this if you're
okay<00:05:42.090> with<00:05:42.120> high<00:05:42.419> settings<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.110> you're<00:05:43.860> on<00:05:43.950> an

bucks<00:05:47.220> all<00:05:47.550> day<00:05:47.700> long<00:05:47.910> is<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.270> best<00:05:48.510> choice

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
bucks all day long is the best choice

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.740 
bucks all day long is the best choice
for<00:05:48.810> this<00:05:49.290> game<00:05:49.590> but<00:05:50.430> if<00:05:50.880> you<00:05:51.120> can<00:05:51.270> afford<00:05:51.390> the

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
for this game but if you can afford the

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.500 
for this game but if you can afford the
extra<00:05:51.870> $20<00:05:52.560> for<00:05:52.740> 750ti<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.610> would<00:05:54.060> strongly

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
extra $20 for 750ti I would strongly

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.940 
extra $20 for 750ti I would strongly
recommend<00:05:54.690> it<00:05:55.169> because<00:05:55.320> it<00:05:55.440> gives<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:55.770> more

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
recommend it because it gives you more

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.190 
recommend it because it gives you more
versatility<00:05:56.479> especially<00:05:57.479> with<00:05:57.570> a<00:05:57.600> 2<00:05:57.810> gigabyte

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
versatility especially with a 2 gigabyte

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.159 
versatility especially with a 2 gigabyte
capacity<00:05:58.320> in<00:05:58.950> other<00:05:59.550> games<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:01.020> also

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
capacity in other games and it also

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.870 
capacity in other games and it also
gives<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.620> a<00:06:01.680> couple<00:06:01.979> of<00:06:02.010> extra<00:06:02.250> features<00:06:02.460> and

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
gives you a couple of extra features and

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.790 
gives you a couple of extra features and
it's<00:06:03.030> just<00:06:03.180> more<00:06:03.330> powerful<00:06:03.510> and<00:06:04.020> very<00:06:04.500> power

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
it's just more powerful and very power

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.880 
it's just more powerful and very power
efficient<00:06:05.460> on<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.820> TDP<00:06:06.180> side<00:06:06.570> so<00:06:07.110> 750ti<00:06:07.770> is

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
efficient on the TDP side so 750ti is

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.650 
efficient on the TDP side so 750ti is
kind<00:06:08.160> of<00:06:08.190> my<00:06:08.340> preferred<00:06:08.790> recommendation<00:06:09.479> here

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
kind of my preferred recommendation here

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.630 
kind of my preferred recommendation here
for<00:06:09.840> high<00:06:10.110> settings<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:10.770> you<00:06:11.040> can<00:06:11.160> also<00:06:11.280> push

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
for high settings and you can also push

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.090 
for high settings and you can also push
a<00:06:11.850> hybrid<00:06:12.419> of<00:06:12.570> high<00:06:12.810> and<00:06:12.990> max<00:06:13.229> above<00:06:13.740> that<00:06:13.919> if

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
a hybrid of high and max above that if

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.890 
a hybrid of high and max above that if
you<00:06:14.190> want<00:06:14.340> to<00:06:14.400> max<00:06:14.580> out<00:06:14.729> the<00:06:14.880> game<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.180> 270x<00:06:15.750> is

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
you want to max out the game the 270x is

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.870 
you want to max out the game the 270x is
kind<00:06:16.080> of<00:06:16.140> where<00:06:16.260> it<00:06:16.350> starts<00:06:16.710> that<00:06:17.430> performs

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
kind of where it starts that performs

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.050 
kind of where it starts that performs
pretty<00:06:18.000> well<00:06:18.240> if<00:06:18.510> a<00:06:18.660> bit<00:06:18.840> oddly<00:06:19.260> for<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.040> game

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
pretty well if a bit oddly for the game

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.659 
pretty well if a bit oddly for the game
the<00:06:21.360> 760<00:06:22.080> would<00:06:22.229> be<00:06:22.320> my<00:06:22.470> next<00:06:22.680> recommendation

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
the 760 would be my next recommendation

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.190 
the 760 would be my next recommendation
if<00:06:24.150> you<00:06:24.240> want<00:06:24.360> to<00:06:24.450> really<00:06:24.600> start<00:06:24.810> pushing

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
if you want to really start pushing

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.560 
if you want to really start pushing
graphics<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.890> their<00:06:26.040> highest<00:06:27.000> possible

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
graphics to their highest possible

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.650 
graphics to their highest possible
settings<00:06:27.990> with<00:06:28.620> Nvidia<00:06:29.130> then<00:06:29.729> the<00:06:29.970> 760<00:06:30.540> would

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
settings with Nvidia then the 760 would

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.870 
settings with Nvidia then the 760 would
be<00:06:30.780> where<00:06:30.990> it's<00:06:31.200> at<00:06:31.410> and<00:06:31.470> that<00:06:31.919> is<00:06:32.250> somewhere

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
be where it's at and that is somewhere

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.690 
be where it's at and that is somewhere
in<00:06:33.090> the<00:06:33.830> $230<00:06:34.830> range<00:06:35.070> I've<00:06:35.250> looked<00:06:35.400> at<00:06:35.520> run

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
in the $230 range I've looked at run

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.950 
in the $230 range I've looked at run
right<00:06:35.940> now<00:06:35.970> the<00:06:36.599> 270x<00:06:37.260> is<00:06:37.410> $170<00:06:38.400> 7

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
right now the 270x is $170 7

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.570 
right now the 270x is $170 7
having<00:06:39.169> these<00:06:39.280> $330<00:06:40.900> 250x<00:06:41.900> is<00:06:42.050> 100<00:06:42.470> 750ti<00:06:43.460> is

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
having these $330 250x is 100 750ti is

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.520 
having these $330 250x is 100 750ti is
120<00:06:44.270> so<00:06:44.419> that<00:06:44.539> gives<00:06:44.720> you<00:06:44.810> an<00:06:44.870> idea<00:06:45.110> of<00:06:45.169> price

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
120 so that gives you an idea of price

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.200 
120 so that gives you an idea of price
for<00:06:45.740> all<00:06:45.770> this<00:06:45.949> stuff<00:06:46.069> and<00:06:46.430> that<00:06:46.970> is<00:06:47.120> the
