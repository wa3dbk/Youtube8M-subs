majority<00:02:38.790> did<00:02:39.150> give<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.420> speech<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.780> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
majority did give this speech in this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.450 
majority did give this speech in this
chapter<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.290> how<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.920> know<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.100> person<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
chapter of how you know the person that

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.000 
chapter of how you know the person that
can<00:02:41.700> obtain<00:02:42.060> both<00:02:42.420> opposing<00:02:43.380> forces<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
can obtain both opposing forces in the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.670 
can obtain both opposing forces in the
universe<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.640> become<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.390> know<00:02:45.680> immensely

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
universe can become you know immensely

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.410 
universe can become you know immensely
powerful<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:47.820> assuming<00:02:47.970> that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
powerful and so I'm assuming that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.300 
powerful and so I'm assuming that
because<00:02:48.540> he<00:02:48.900> has<00:02:48.990> both<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.200> senjutsu<00:02:49.650> DNA<00:02:50.160> as

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
because he has both the senjutsu DNA as

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.760 
because he has both the senjutsu DNA as
well<00:02:50.490> as<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.270> chia<00:02:51.540> DNA<00:02:51.930> that's<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.500> reason

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
well as the chia DNA that's the reason

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.370 
well as the chia DNA that's the reason
why<00:02:52.800> he's<00:02:52.980> able<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.310> absorb<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.730> chakra<00:02:54.090> I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
why he's able to absorb the chakra I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.660 
why he's able to absorb the chakra I
don't<00:02:55.380> know<00:02:55.500> he<00:02:55.920> doesn't<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.280> Rinnegan

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
don't know he doesn't have the Rinnegan

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.890 
don't know he doesn't have the Rinnegan
at<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.910> point<00:02:57.180> he's<00:02:57.330> looking<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.660> get<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
at this point he's looking to get it

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.960 
at this point he's looking to get it
from<00:02:58.020> obito<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.459> know<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.700> couldn't

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
from obito so you know that couldn't

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.730 
from obito so you know that couldn't
have<00:03:00.060> been<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:01.110> kind<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.320> interested<00:03:01.650> as

have been it I was kind of interested as

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.050 
have been it I was kind of interested as
to<00:03:01.860> why<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.100> could<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.490> but<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.970> know

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
to why you could do that but you know

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
we'll probably get hopefully a better

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.720 
we'll probably get hopefully a better
explanation<00:03:04.680> later<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.280> maybe<00:03:05.430> I'm<00:03:05.610> just

the<00:04:31.830> next<00:04:31.980> chapter<00:04:32.250> just<00:04:32.550> going<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.730> go<00:04:32.850> around

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
the next chapter just going to go around

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.970 
the next chapter just going to go around
each<00:04:33.750> tail<00:04:34.050> beast<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.590> just<00:04:34.710> literally

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
each tail beast and just literally

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.280 
each tail beast and just literally
absorb<00:04:35.430> every<00:04:36.060> ounce<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.480> chakra<00:04:36.930> from<00:04:37.080> that

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
absorb every ounce of chakra from that

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.260 
absorb every ounce of chakra from that
tail<00:04:37.530> piece<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:38.580> would<00:04:38.670> be<00:04:38.790> fucking<00:04:39.000> awesome

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
tail piece that would be fucking awesome

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.700 
tail piece that would be fucking awesome
it<00:04:39.480> would<00:04:39.630> be<00:04:39.750> even<00:04:39.810> better<00:04:39.930> than<00:04:40.290> being<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
it would be even better than being the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.520 
it would be even better than being the
other<00:04:40.920> jinda<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.460> 10<00:04:41.940> tails<00:04:42.180> jinchuuriki

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
other jinda the 10 tails jinchuuriki

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.690 
other jinda the 10 tails jinchuuriki
that<00:04:43.530> would<00:04:43.620> be<00:04:43.680> even<00:04:43.770> better<00:04:43.980> than<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.460> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
that would be even better than that and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.580 
that would be even better than that and
my<00:04:44.850> opinion<00:04:45.030> is<00:04:45.300> absorbed<00:04:45.780> all<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:45.990> chakra

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
my opinion is absorbed all the chakra

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.890 
my opinion is absorbed all the chakra
from<00:04:47.070> every<00:04:47.610> single<00:04:48.030> fucking<00:04:48.420> tailed<00:04:48.660> beast

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
from every single fucking tailed beast

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.200 
from every single fucking tailed beast
and<00:04:49.140> you<00:04:49.800> know<00:04:49.890> if<00:04:50.010> he<00:04:50.400> goes<00:04:50.580> ahead<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.940> kills

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.810 
and you know if he goes ahead and kills
all<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.750> fucking<00:04:52.310> fodder<00:04:53.310> ninja<00:04:53.700> that

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
have the nine tails cloak on him he can

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.990 
have the nine tails cloak on him he can
get<00:04:55.650> enough<00:04:55.890> chakra<00:04:56.130> from<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> nine<00:04:56.580> tails<00:04:56.790> to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
get enough chakra from the nine tails to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.670 
get enough chakra from the nine tails to
have<00:04:57.120> all<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.510> tailed<00:04:57.720> beasts<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.200> that

means is he gonna kill be I think about
that<00:05:01.290> be<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:02.010> think<00:05:02.400> killaby<00:05:02.730> might<00:05:02.910> be<00:05:03.030> on<00:05:03.120> the

that be I think killaby might be on the
chopping<00:05:03.240> block<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:04.050> chapters<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.800> come<00:05:05.040> but

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
chopping block in chapters to come but

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
that was pretty much the gist of the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.800 
that was pretty much the gist of the
chapter<00:05:08.130> mad<00:05:08.310> are<00:05:08.460> being<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.910> badass<00:05:09.120> Sasuke
