00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello my name is Victoria I 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.000
 it was a free minute my children 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.099
 left with the grandmother to the museum 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.740
 I decided for them to cook one of them 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.599
 favorite desserts and since it consists 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 from a small amount of ingredients very 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.130
 just making decided so 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.039
 recipe to share with you what for 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.020
 he is required so to say the amount I 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 Of course I will write below but I have it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.650
 comes from the calculation here such 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.080
 silicone mold by trial I already 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.689
 determined how much ingredient I need here 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 it is necessary of course it goes sour cream half a kilo 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 I have about milk or cream 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.960
 a glass of sugar well with sweet here in general 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.329
 how would each be determined that his 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 more sweetly than 200 grams 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.590
 fruit in this case I have strawberries 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.710
 children and most of all love 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.260
 but it is also possible and there are bananas and peaches 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.719
 grapes can be some kind of canned 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.579
 fruits that are soft also who likes 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.320
 nuts can add nuts can 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.660
 buy plain shortbread cookies or 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 yourself to concoct here you know 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.379
 square cookies 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.409
 pour in there too and it is on a little bit 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.790
 will soften and there will be a special taste but to us from 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.350
 most like this very 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.659
 the simplest option because it turns out 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 something like milk pudding with 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.530
 fruit pieces further i will take 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.479
 a little vanilla sugar and I'll 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.630
 use sheet gelatin 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.159
 It is based on 5 leaves approximately. 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.049
 500 500 grams because I have a little 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.000
 a little more I take 6 leaves of such 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.140
 gelatin those who will use 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.909
 regular gelatin needs 15 grams of it and those 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.009
 who uses agar 5 times in my opinion 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.390
 less there it is stronger more powerful 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.619
 but basically 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.509
 I 'll start by sticking with the first thing 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.619
 strawberry diced silicone mold 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.390
 let's go it turns out that i am a strawberry 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.399
 Spoiled and especially here and align 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.100
 do not lay out because when you 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.740
 pour liquid directly 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.820
 anyway there all over pops up and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.100
 relatively evenly distributed 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.580
 throughout the product further we need 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.950
 soak gelatin 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.780
 the same who uses not sheet it 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.690
 you need to soak in there for forty minutes 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:27.620
 Immunal therefore we take clean drinking 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:29.330
 water for 10 minutes by the way I wanted to say 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.209
 you about the berries do not choose much 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.060
 sour berries because because they 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.550
 can simply roll up the milk 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.030
 well, then immerse the big bowl 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.030
 sour cream 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:20.269
 and add sugar there add sugar 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.939
 you can sugar powder is already someone 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:28.780
 I would not like to sing to vanilla satoru 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:32.989
 a little bit for flavor 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.469
 well, then just all immersed 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:39.139
 Blender I can whip it can be 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:42.650
 just the usual fork will mix for up 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:44.120
 normal consistency mix here 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.159
 I whipped it turns out this 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.650
 consistency they are just bubbly 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:54.739
 air sugar almost dissolved 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:58.299
 and now you need a glass of a thread convenient 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.849
 pour a glass of milk into a glass and 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.099
 warm up either on the stove or in 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.750
 microwave until hot condition in 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.780
 it's about a minute in the microwave 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.010
 in order to easily dissolve the sheet 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.229
 gelatin here I got milk from 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.389
 microwaves she's hot and now what 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:22.479
 need to do need one leaf of gelatin 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.419
 i get 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:30.260
 shaking off water I pour into the hot 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.750
 milk is basically there right away 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:38.800
 practically nothing 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:43.220
 next I press and there and so everything 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.240
 leaves are not exactly like leaf 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.650
 gelatin that bother 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:56.860
 melt in a water bath because 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.860
 it is already heated quickly 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:16.020
 last us all ran here now 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:21.770
 you need this mass quietly pour into our 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.770
 stir sour cream 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.930
 and the resulting mass is poured into that form 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.930
 which you already have fruit and 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.199
 fill 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.550
 so here it is now I 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.590
 I will carefully transfer in the refrigerator 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.990
 leave there with at 23 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.120
 but everyone has a different fridge looking like 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.520
 frost how fast this gelatin 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.650
 grab here well and in principle and then 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.740
 I can only turn the form 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.289
 little by little so move the edges and mine 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.060
 so corrugated bros falls out just not 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.659
 the fact that I will get it for you already 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.400
 show this video here 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:52.419
 so I will tell you I wish you all 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.419
 happiness all bye
