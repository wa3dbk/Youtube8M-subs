00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
this stuff you don't have to leave the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.440 
this stuff you don't have to leave the
timer<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.940> right<00:01:12.180> from

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
timer you can do all that right from

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
timer you can do all that right from
here<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:12.899> this<00:01:13.050> particular<00:01:13.290> meter<00:01:13.740> it's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
here then this particular meter it's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340 
here then this particular meter it's
auto-ranging<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.759> I<00:01:15.000> set<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.539> AC<00:01:15.780> voltage

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
auto-ranging so I set it to AC voltage

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
auto-ranging so I set it to AC voltage
this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.920> AC<00:01:17.160> voltage<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.690> yours

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this is AC voltage right here if yours

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
this is AC voltage right here if yours
does<00:01:19.440> not<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> Unisa<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
does not have that Unisa on the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.790 
does not have that Unisa on the
next-highest<00:01:21.450> above<00:01:21.930> 30<00:01:22.259> volts<00:01:22.649> we're

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
next-highest above 30 volts we're

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560 
next-highest above 30 volts we're
testing<00:01:23.100> low<00:01:23.220> voltages<00:01:23.670> 30<00:01:24.000> volts<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.360> below

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
testing low voltages 30 volts and below

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.719 
testing low voltages 30 volts and below
so<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.380> multimeter<00:01:25.740> might<00:01:25.920> say<00:01:26.070> 60<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
so if your multimeter might say 60 it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.719 
so if your multimeter might say 60 it
might<00:01:26.880> say<00:01:27.060> 30<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:28.080> say<00:01:28.229> 200<00:01:29.039> volts<00:01:29.640> but

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
might say 30 it could say 200 volts but

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.520 
might say 30 it could say 200 volts but
need<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.030> volts<00:01:30.330> AC<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.959> check<00:01:31.259> your

need to be volts AC you check your

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
need to be volts AC you check your
transformer<00:01:32.160> is<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.729> take<00:01:32.910> your<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.149> leads

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
transformer is you take your two leads

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.460 
transformer is you take your two leads
it<00:01:33.509> doesn't<00:01:33.720> matter<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:33.990> direction<00:01:34.289> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it doesn't matter which direction you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.469 
it doesn't matter which direction you
put<00:01:34.649> them<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> put<00:01:35.160> one<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.459> one<00:01:35.520> side<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
put them on you put one on one side and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.570 
put them on you put one on one side and
one<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> other<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.069> you<00:01:38.190> should<00:01:38.399> read

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
one on the other and you should read

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.249 
one on the other and you should read
right<00:01:38.729> around<00:01:38.940> 30<00:01:39.209> we're<00:01:39.420> getting<00:01:39.630> 29<00:01:39.990> point

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it looks like a 1 there that looks

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.490 
it looks like a 1 there that looks
pretty<00:01:42.209> good<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.660> that's<00:01:42.810> what<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> want<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pretty good and that's what you want you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.199 
pretty good and that's what you want you
want<00:01:43.619> around<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.069> 30<00:01:44.310> range<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.090> we're

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.279 
want around that 30 range what we're
gonna<00:01:45.300> do<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.479> we're<00:01:45.569> gonna<00:01:45.630> turn<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> zone<00:01:46.140> on

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
gonna do is we're gonna turn a zone on

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.779 
gonna do is we're gonna turn a zone on
let's<00:01:46.709> say<00:01:46.800> we're<00:01:46.920> having<00:01:47.039> trouble<00:01:47.399> zone<00:01:47.580> 1

we're<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.179> turn<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.690> make

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
we're going to turn this on and make

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.749 
we're going to turn this on and make
sure<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.050> got<00:01:49.200> power<00:01:49.410> going<00:01:49.830> out<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.250> port<00:01:50.490> 2

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

that<00:01:50.940> zone<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.599> we're<00:01:51.690> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.929> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
that zone and what we're going to do is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.940 
that zone and what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:52.080> gonna<00:01:52.170> take<00:01:52.289> our<00:01:52.349> multimeter<00:01:52.800> we're

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
we're gonna take our multimeter we're

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.859 
we're gonna take our multimeter we're
going<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.130> put<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.520> lead<00:01:53.910> on<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.330> common

one is the zone you're testing this

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.300 
one is the zone you're testing this
happens<00:02:00.599> to<00:02:00.660> be<00:02:00.720> zone<00:02:00.899> 1<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.860> looks<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.160> we're

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
happens to be zone 1 it looks like we're

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.339 
happens to be zone 1 it looks like we're
