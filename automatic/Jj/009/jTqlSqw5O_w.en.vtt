we designed each one of these systems

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.600 
we designed each one of these systems
and<00:00:59.690> how<00:00:59.780> we<00:00:59.839> came<00:01:00.050> up<00:01:00.110> with<00:01:00.409> these<00:01:00.589> systems<00:01:00.800> so

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
and how we came up with these systems so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.090 
and how we came up with these systems so
that<00:01:01.820> way<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:02.059> can<00:01:02.330> understand<00:01:02.870> how<00:01:03.530> they<00:01:03.739> fit

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
that way you can understand how they fit

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.670 
that way you can understand how they fit

that we adhere to those covenants for it

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.550 
that we adhere to those covenants for it
for<00:01:52.820> example<00:01:53.180> when<00:01:53.780> we're<00:01:53.960> looking<00:01:54.110> at<00:01:54.440> this

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
for example when we're looking at this

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.770 
for example when we're looking at this
configuration<00:01:55.430> stuff<00:01:55.790> we<00:01:56.240> want<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.600> make<00:01:56.750> sure

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
configuration stuff we want to make sure

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.590 
configuration stuff we want to make sure
that<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.350> always<00:01:57.680> start<00:01:58.460> with<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.850> end<00:01:59.000> goal

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
that we always start with the end goal

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.590 
that we always start with the end goal
in<00:01:59.810> mind<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.250> would<00:02:01.430> be<00:02:01.640> something<00:02:02.240> as

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
in mind so that would be something as

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.510 
in mind so that would be something as
Extreme<00:02:03.200> as<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:03.740> imagine<00:02:04.160> let's<00:02:04.280> say

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
Extreme as you can imagine let's say

that you're thinking one day that you
may<00:02:06.170> want<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.530> be<00:02:06.680> exploring<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.790> cave<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.330> you

is and you now get into an air sharing
situation<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.459> now<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.640> have<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.180> scoot<00:02:20.629> a

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
situation and now you have to scoot a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.020 
situation and now you have to scoot a
home<00:02:20.959> 5,000<00:02:21.800> feet<00:02:21.950> while<00:02:22.129> towing<00:02:22.459> your<00:02:22.790> buddy

configuration the tools because remember

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.460 
configuration the tools because remember
these<00:02:28.280> are<00:02:28.430> three<00:02:28.790> separate<00:02:29.269> tools<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:30.170> tools

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
these are three separate tools the tools

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
will work for you to get you home once

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.240 
will work for you to get you home once
you've<00:02:34.579> designed

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
you've designed

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.550 
you've designed
that<00:02:35.670> once<00:02:36.390> you've<00:02:36.540> got<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.380> what

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
that once you've got that then what

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
that once you've got that then what
you're<00:02:37.680> gonna<00:02:37.740> do<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.010> you're<00:02:38.130> gonna<00:02:38.190> work

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
you're gonna do is you're gonna work

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.000 
you're gonna do is you're gonna work
backwards<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.450> boil<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.720> down<00:02:40.110> down<00:02:40.710> down
