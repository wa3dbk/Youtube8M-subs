hey<00:00:00.269> what's<00:00:00.630> up<00:00:00.810> YouTube<00:00:01.050> today<00:00:01.709> I'll<00:00:02.340> be

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey what's up YouTube today I'll be

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.030 
hey what's up YouTube today I'll be
doing<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.210> transmitter<00:00:03.840> comparison<00:00:04.650> so<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
doing a transmitter comparison so the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.030 
doing a transmitter comparison so the
one<00:00:05.190> on<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.460> Left<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.600> emerson<00:00:07.290> RC

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
one on the Left I have the emerson RC

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.640 
one on the Left I have the emerson RC
600<00:00:08.790> milliwatt<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.540> then<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:09.870> my<00:00:10.050> right<00:00:10.349> I

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
600 milliwatt and then on my right I

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.700 
600 milliwatt and then on my right I
have<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.040> fat<00:00:11.309> char<00:00:11.759> 250<00:00:12.690> milliwatts<00:00:13.200> I'll<00:00:13.469> be

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
have the fat char 250 milliwatts I'll be

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.980 
have the fat char 250 milliwatts I'll be
doing<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.190> comparison<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> weight<00:00:15.570> size

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
doing a comparison of the weight size

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.450 
doing a comparison of the weight size
and<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> comes<00:00:17.100> with

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
and what it comes with

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.790 
and what it comes with
ok<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.000> let's<00:00:18.449> unbox<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.260> fat<00:00:19.470> char

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
ok so let's unbox the fat char

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.519 
ok so let's unbox the fat char
transmitter<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.359> comes<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> wire<00:00:22.170> or

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
transmitter so it comes with a wire or

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.400 
transmitter so it comes with a wire or
the<00:00:22.560> power<00:00:22.859> source<00:00:23.369> video<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.420> audio<00:00:24.660> wires

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the power source video and audio wires

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.920 
the power source video and audio wires
antenna<00:00:26.099> got<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> fat<00:00:26.910> shark<00:00:27.269> name<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.750> there

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
antenna got the fat shark name on there

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:41.340 
antenna got the fat shark name on there
and<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.910> transmitter<00:00:30.449> itself

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.090 

okay<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:41.980> now<00:00:42.370> let's<00:00:43.030> unbox<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.989> Emerson<00:00:44.530> RC

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
okay so now let's unbox the Emerson RC

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.160 
okay so now let's unbox the Emerson RC
transmitter<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:46.239> this<00:00:46.450> is<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.750> one<00:00:46.900> that<00:00:47.140> I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
transmitter so this is the one that I

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.030 
transmitter so this is the one that I
will<00:00:47.410> be<00:00:47.530> installing<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.850> let's<00:00:49.090> open<00:00:49.239> this<00:00:49.510> up

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
will be installing so let's open this up

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.430 
will be installing so let's open this up
so<00:00:51.040> again<00:00:51.190> it<00:00:51.580> comes<00:00:51.840> exactly<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:52.960> same<00:00:53.170> thing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
so again it comes exactly the same thing

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.680 
so again it comes exactly the same thing
as<00:00:53.739> what<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.010> fat<00:00:54.400> shark<00:00:54.700> has<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.390> have<00:00:55.480> your

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
as what a fat shark has you have your

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.100 
as what a fat shark has you have your
antenna<00:00:56.140> immersed<00:00:56.950> in<00:00:57.100> RC<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.510> transmitter

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
antenna immersed in RC and a transmitter

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:08.859 
antenna immersed in RC and a transmitter
itself

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.810 

so<00:01:09.500> here<00:01:09.890> they<00:01:10.039> are<00:01:10.189> side<00:01:10.520> by<00:01:10.579> side<00:01:12.399> as<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.640> can

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
so here they are side by side as you can

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.880 
so here they are side by side as you can
see<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.329> Emerson's<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.990> little<00:01:15.229> bit<00:01:15.380> smaller

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
see that Emerson's a little bit smaller

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:25.059 
see that Emerson's a little bit smaller
in<00:01:16.250> length<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:17.479> in<00:01:18.469> width<00:01:19.310> as<00:01:19.520> well<00:01:24.069> okay

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
in length and in width as well okay

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:33.990 
in length and in width as well okay
thickness<00:01:25.850> wise<00:01:27.159> almost<00:01:28.159> identical

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.260 

connection<00:01:35.000> wise<00:01:36.219> pretty<00:01:37.219> much<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:37.640> same<00:01:37.880> and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
connection wise pretty much the same and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.169 
connection wise pretty much the same and
then<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.990> layout<00:01:39.649> on<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.219> bottom<00:01:40.670> there's

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
then the layout on the bottom there's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.020 
then the layout on the bottom there's
more<00:01:41.509> component<00:01:42.170> on<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.619> Emerson<00:01:44.590> okay<00:01:45.590> so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
more component on that Emerson okay so

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.120 
more component on that Emerson okay so
let's<00:01:47.030> measure<00:01:47.299> them<00:01:47.599> up<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.020> weigh<00:01:48.679> them

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
let's measure them up and weigh them

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.120 
let's measure them up and weigh them
okay<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:49.789> let's<00:01:50.270> measure<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:50.810> up<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:52.069> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
okay so let's measure this up so for the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.469 
okay so let's measure this up so for the
width<00:01:52.459> of<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.819> Fatshark

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
width of the Fatshark

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.770 
width of the Fatshark
one<00:01:53.840> inch<00:01:54.140> long<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.189> width<00:01:55.459> and<00:01:55.789> up<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.569> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
one inch long the width and up to the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.100 
one inch long the width and up to the
antenna<00:01:57.679> mount<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.250> two<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.569> half<00:01:59.810> inch

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
antenna mount is two and a half inch

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.850 
antenna mount is two and a half inch
long<00:02:00.679> so<00:02:00.979> for<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.729> emerson<00:02:02.329> width<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.200> less

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
long so for the emerson width is less

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.479 
long so for the emerson width is less
than<00:02:04.250> one<00:02:04.759> inch<00:02:05.110> lengthwise<00:02:06.110> less<00:02:06.950> than<00:02:07.219> two

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
than one inch lengthwise less than two

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.119 
than one inch lengthwise less than two
and<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.700> half<00:02:07.909> inch

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
and a half inch

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.460 
and a half inch
okay<00:02:10.129> so<00:02:10.190> let's<00:02:10.579> weigh<00:02:10.849> them<00:02:11.030> up<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.480> got<00:02:12.349> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
okay so let's weigh them up I got the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.599 
okay so let's weigh them up I got the
Fatshark<00:02:12.709> here<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.609> in<00:02:13.850> grams<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.870> 14<00:02:15.609> okay

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
Fatshark here so in grams it is 14 okay

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.940 
Fatshark here so in grams it is 14 okay
now<00:02:16.819> for<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.150> emerson<00:02:17.810> RC<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:19.069> 15<00:02:19.819> grams<00:02:20.950> so

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
now for the emerson RC it's 15 grams so

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.199 
now for the emerson RC it's 15 grams so
it<00:02:22.069> looks<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.530> fat<00:02:24.889> shark<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.700> much

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
it looks like the fat shark is much

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.530 
it looks like the fat shark is much
lighter<00:02:26.690> than<00:02:27.109> the<00:02:27.260> emerson<00:02:27.859> RC<00:02:28.609> so<00:02:29.209> there<00:02:29.450> you

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
lighter than the emerson RC so there you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
lighter than the emerson RC so there you
go<00:02:29.690> guys
