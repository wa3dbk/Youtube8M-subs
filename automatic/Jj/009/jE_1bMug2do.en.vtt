he has cut into the bank and found the
bank<00:00:12.820> just<00:00:13.809> blow<00:00:14.110> me<00:00:14.350> here

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
there's a narrow spot the drifts

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.349 
there's a narrow spot the drifts
where<00:00:20.500> it<00:00:20.589> slopes<00:00:20.890> down<00:00:21.009> to<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.429> rail<00:00:21.640> so<00:00:22.029> now

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
where it slopes down to the rail so now

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.370 
where it slopes down to the rail so now
he's<00:00:22.570> got<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.869> start<00:00:23.079> cut

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
he's got to start cut

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.410 
he's got to start cut
a<00:00:24.439> little<00:00:24.740> lower

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
a little lower

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.970 
a little lower
with<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.170> blade<00:00:29.080> gather<00:00:30.080> up<00:00:30.380> enough<00:00:30.650> snow<00:00:30.949> to

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
with the blade gather up enough snow to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.640 
with the blade gather up enough snow to
push<00:00:31.340> forward<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.119> off<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.660> side

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
push forward and off to the side

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.380 
push forward and off to the side
where<00:00:35.220> he<00:00:35.310> can<00:00:35.460> continue<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.940> drive<00:00:36.770> ahead

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
where he can continue to drive ahead

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:52.930 
where he can continue to drive ahead
towards<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.540> blowhole<00:00:40.080> there

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.119 

keep<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.750> mind<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.350> wider<00:00:54.620> machine

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
keep in mind this is a wider machine

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.009 
keep in mind this is a wider machine
than<00:00:55.399> we've<00:00:55.699> been<00:00:56.030> using<00:00:56.300> through<00:00:56.629> here<00:00:56.809> last

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
than we've been using through here last

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.590 
than we've been using through here last
three<00:00:57.320> years<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:57.949> takes<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.850> much<00:00:59.090> more<00:00:59.300> room

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
three years so takes that much more room

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.730 
three years so takes that much more room
to<00:01:00.250> build<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.399> road<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:01.879> get<00:01:02.000> across<00:01:02.300> these

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
to build the road to get across these

to build the road to get across these
drift

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.310 

it<00:01:15.700> gets<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.240> blowhole<00:01:16.870> he's<00:01:17.080> going<00:01:17.229> to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
it gets to that blowhole he's going to

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.160 
it gets to that blowhole he's going to
have<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.500> start<00:01:17.770> dropping<00:01:18.370> some<00:01:18.610> of<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.820> snow

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
have to start dropping some of that snow

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.450 
have to start dropping some of that snow
into<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.410> hole<00:01:20.710> because<00:01:20.890> he's<00:01:21.160> going<00:01:21.400> to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
into that hole because he's going to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.370 
into that hole because he's going to
want<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.760> continue<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.300> track<00:01:22.600> along<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.200> base

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
want to continue to track along the base

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.510 
want to continue to track along the base
of<00:01:23.410> those<00:01:23.710> rocks

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.450 

he<00:01:28.119> loses<00:01:28.299> too<00:01:28.689> much<00:01:28.719> snow<00:01:29.079> over<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.469> edge<00:01:29.619> as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
he loses too much snow over the edge as

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.270 
he loses too much snow over the edge as
he<00:01:30.729> enters<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.240> area<00:01:31.890> he's<00:01:32.890> gonna<00:01:33.039> have<00:01:33.189> to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
he enters that area he's gonna have to

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.850 
he enters that area he's gonna have to
start<00:01:33.549> cutting<00:01:33.789> way<00:01:34.090> down<00:01:34.570> find<00:01:35.289> more<00:01:35.530> snow<00:01:35.799> to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
start cutting way down find more snow to

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.799 
start cutting way down find more snow to
drop<00:01:36.189> in<00:01:36.429> there<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:38.259> more<00:01:38.469> time-consuming
