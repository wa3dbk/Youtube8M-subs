00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.710 

so<00:00:05.310> here's<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.640> new<00:00:05.880> board<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:08.150> the<00:00:09.150> only<00:00:09.510> one

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:09.720 
so here's a new board and the only one

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.610 
so here's a new board and the only one
different

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
different

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.480 
different
on<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.000> new<00:00:12.150> board<00:00:13.280> because<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.430> replaces<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
on the new board because it replaces a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
on the new board because it replaces a
couple<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.580> different<00:00:17.880> models<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.390> there's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
couple of different models is there's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.010 
couple of different models is there's
this<00:00:19.350> dip<00:00:19.619> switch<00:00:19.920> down<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.720> stips

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
this dip switch down here and to stips

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.210 
this dip switch down here and to stips
which<00:00:22.320> corresponds<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:24.380> what<00:00:25.380> how<00:00:25.619> much<00:00:25.830> delay

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
which corresponds to what how much delay

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.090 
which corresponds to what how much delay
you<00:00:26.610> want<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> cool<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> come<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.890> much

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
you want the cool to come on how much

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.920 
you want the cool to come on how much
delay<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.520> want<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> heat<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.210> come<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.690> and

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
delay you want the heat to come on and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.439 
delay you want the heat to come on and
how<00:00:31.050> much<00:00:31.230> delay<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.650> want<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> heat<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:33.239> turn

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
how much delay you want to heat to turn

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.619 
how much delay you want to heat to turn
off<00:00:33.629> afterwards<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:34.980> set<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> default

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
off afterwards it's all set to default

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.560 
off afterwards it's all set to default
which<00:00:36.629> is<00:00:36.809> fine<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:41.570> secure

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
which is fine and now it's just secure

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.620 
which is fine and now it's just secure
to<00:00:42.630> pull<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.290> here

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
to pull back on here

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:59.299 
to pull back on here
there<00:00:45.630> we<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:53.510> all<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:54.989> fits<00:00:58.309> put

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
there we go all right it all fits put

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
there we go all right it all fits put
this<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:01.070> put<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.399> second<00:01:03.559> okay<00:01:04.559> let's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this back in put that second okay let's

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.800 
this back in put that second okay let's
look<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:04.979> these<00:01:05.100> neutrals<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
look at these neutrals this one is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.969 
look at these neutrals this one is
neutral<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.539> fan<00:01:14.840> which<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.050> neutral<00:01:16.350> see

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
neutral for the fan which is neutral see

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.320 
neutral for the fan which is neutral see
auto<00:01:18.380> next<00:01:19.380> neutral<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.789> is<00:01:20.940> for

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:35.180 

transformer<00:01:24.350> up<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.800> this<00:01:26.569> second<00:01:27.569> move

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.280 

all<00:01:36.190> right<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.940> there's<00:01:37.270> one<00:01:37.540> more<00:01:37.720> neutral

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
all right and there's one more neutral

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:49.640 
all right and there's one more neutral
where<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.860> go<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:41.260> is<00:01:41.320> line<00:01:41.680> in

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.600 

let's<00:01:50.650> hook<00:01:50.920> up<00:01:51.010> all<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.250> wires<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:54.370> is<00:01:54.580> a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
let's hook up all the wires so this is a

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:06.090 
let's hook up all the wires so this is a
high<00:01:56.070> cool<00:01:57.070> high<00:01:57.340> goes<00:01:58.180> in<00:01:58.390> here<00:02:02.730> this<00:02:03.730> is<00:02:05.100> heat

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
high cool high goes in here this is heat

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:17.790 
high cool high goes in here this is heat
I<00:02:09.600> goes<00:02:10.600> in<00:02:10.840> here<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:17.110> remain<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
I goes in here and then the remain to

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.980 
I goes in here and then the remain to
just<00:02:18.790> go<00:02:18.970> Park<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.360> another<00:02:26.140> Park<00:02:27.570> line<00:02:28.570> in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
just go Park and another Park line in

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.680 
just go Park and another Park line in
and<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:31.380> transformer<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:34.150> one<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.450> line

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and then transformer which one is line

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:50.070 
and then transformer which one is line
in<00:02:39.840> now<00:02:40.840> let's<00:02:41.050> connect<00:02:41.410> all<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.739> this

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:02.580 

I<00:02:57.210> think<00:02:58.210> that's<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.940> right<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.450> guess<00:03:02.410> we

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
I think that's it all right I guess we

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.700 
I think that's it all right I guess we
can<00:03:02.830> plug<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.550> power<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:07.150> after<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:07.480> give

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
can plug in the power so after we give

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.140 
can plug in the power so after we give
pressed<00:03:08.710> a<00:03:08.890> button<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.760> give<00:03:09.910> power<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.910> fan

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
pressed a button to give power the fan

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.420 
pressed a button to give power the fan
comes<00:03:13.420> on<00:03:13.570> right<00:03:13.750> away<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.980> can<00:03:15.070> see<00:03:15.340> it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
comes on right away and you can see it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.080 
comes on right away and you can see it
there's<00:03:15.640> five<00:03:16.000> flashes<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.590> stop<00:03:18.000> again<00:03:19.000> it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
there's five flashes and a stop again it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.910 
there's five flashes and a stop again it
goes<00:03:19.180> five<00:03:19.450> flashes<00:03:19.960> and<00:03:20.110> stop<00:03:20.350> again

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
goes five flashes and stop again

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.900 
goes five flashes and stop again
and<00:03:21.400> if<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:21.790> look<00:03:21.970> at

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.220 

right<00:03:27.480> here<00:03:28.110> basically<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.580> means<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:30.120> TIA

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
right here basically this it means a TIA

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.660 
right here basically this it means a TIA
roh-roh<00:03:31.920> off<00:03:32.480> switch

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.850 

so<00:03:38.030> there's<00:03:38.180> an<00:03:38.270> issue<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.720> relative<00:03:39.140> well

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
so there's an issue of the relative well

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.620 
so there's an issue of the relative well
let<00:03:40.790> me<00:03:40.880> stop<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.270> real<00:03:41.420> quick<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:43.630> total

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
let me stop that real quick the total

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.900 
let me stop that real quick the total
power<00:03:44.830> what's<00:03:45.830> really<00:03:46.160> going<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.580> is<00:03:46.850> this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
power what's really going on is this

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.010 
power what's really going on is this
furnace<00:03:49.910> doesn't<00:03:50.300> have<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> rollout<00:03:50.720> switch

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
furnace doesn't have a rollout switch

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.350 
furnace doesn't have a rollout switch
and<00:03:51.740> if<00:03:51.860> I<00:03:52.010> compare<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:55.120> graphics<00:03:56.120> right

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
and if I compare this graphics right

going to do is just connect between
those<00:04:15.950> two<00:04:16.190> pins<00:04:16.489> just<00:04:16.850> pin<00:04:17.330> right<00:04:17.480> here

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
those two pins just pin right here

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:30.610 
those two pins just pin right here
one<00:04:21.370> two<00:04:22.370> all<00:04:24.490> right<00:04:29.140> there<00:04:30.140> you<00:04:30.230> go<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.380> can

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
one two all right there you go you can

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.730 
one two all right there you go you can
see<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.800> put<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.310> jumper<00:04:31.730> between<00:04:31.850> them

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
see that put this jumper between them

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.420 
see that put this jumper between them
connect<00:04:33.740> this<00:04:33.860> back<00:04:34.100> in<00:04:35.890> plug<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.040> in<00:04:37.420> power

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
connect this back in plug it in power

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.770 
connect this back in plug it in power
plug<00:04:40.430> in<00:04:40.580> power<00:04:40.880> now<00:04:41.920> press<00:04:42.920> this<00:04:43.070> button<00:04:43.780> yeah

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
plug in power now press this button yeah

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.330 
plug in power now press this button yeah
that's<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.260> call<00:04:45.650> on<00:04:46.030> call<00:04:47.030> for<00:04:47.060> code<00:04:48.160> so<00:04:49.160> it's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
that's a call on call for code so it's

00:04:49.340 --> 00:05:01.110 
that's a call on call for code so it's
set<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.550> cold<00:04:54.340> there<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.460> go

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.820 

and<00:05:01.600> let's<00:05:01.780> go<00:05:01.900> out<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.139> check<00:05:02.290> on

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.330 

as<00:05:06.830> we<00:05:07.010> can<00:05:07.160> see<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:08.620> running<00:05:09.620> running

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
as we can see that the running running

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.469 
as we can see that the running running
on

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
on

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.740 
on
this<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.249> who<00:05:14.249> and<00:05:14.460> old

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
this is who and old
