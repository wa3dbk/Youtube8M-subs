00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.840
 earth so it must necessarily clean 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.649
 Okay, let's go, go to the water 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.989

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.219
 a salad made no carrot seen 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.079
 citrus fruit very simple with a pass 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.119
 in mobile zone of olive juice of lemon 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.860
 no very fragrant spices 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.329
 Teddy bear and a little bit oriental 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.530
 leave to surprise your guests 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.939
 so first step go it's gone 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.740
 we will start by cutting every year 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.740
 you're going there alone 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.409
 it will stay in etrat we decided in 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.869
 thin slats then thickness a 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.130
 millimeter near okay you arrive 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.869
 our carrots are cut into strips 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.180
 we're going to put a little bone lion of vegetables 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.770

 10 seconds to go it's gone 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.580
 I was surprised yes we stir suspense is 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.580
 at its height and that's it's cooked 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.680
 so in fact so much is the boiling 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.520
 more than what you have to live 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.730
 boiling games just a little bit 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.950
 looked pro when we are going to put them lukewarm 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.600
 in a salad bowl and then we will do the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.500
 season of the ANC that goes to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.410
 like a marinade 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:10.470
 we will call live oranges and I 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.420
 meeting and there it has allowed you to have 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.100
 blacks are orange without skin 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.480
 and we're going to make a little vinaigrette 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.130
 we will do something else that is good 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:27.570
 will start by putting a little bit of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:28.860
 that of cumin lemon juice we go 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.530
 add coriander 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.330
 we have slightly not too beautiful 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.810
 perfume it's a pretty volatile perfume 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.890
 coriander 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.850
 we add the olive oil from the juice of 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.400
 bleachers and there need an expert com 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.540
 to mix this with love give of 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.820
 the air our ben it's okay we have the color of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.260
 the cool humor is if you are very 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.660
 very eager to consume as is 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.230
 or so ideally you let 2 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:04.110
 hours in the fridge salad 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.110
 ice carrots perfect to ego 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.200
 it's all the flavors of the south east 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.880
