00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
probes are a bad batch i bought a bad

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.070 
probes are a bad batch i bought a bad
batch<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.729> probes<00:01:12.119> off<00:01:12.299> ebay<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> they're

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
batch of probes off ebay and they're

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.289 
batch of probes off ebay and they're
reading<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.799> off<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.369> they're<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.210> be

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
reading way off so they're not to be

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
reading way off so they're not to be
trusted<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> flow<00:01:16.950> rates<00:01:17.159> are

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
trusted for now but the flow rates are

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.940 
trusted for now but the flow rates are
pretty<00:01:17.400> sick<00:01:17.700> close<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.380> temperatures

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
pretty sick close and the temperatures

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
pretty sick close and the temperatures
are<00:01:20.040> pretty<00:01:20.250> close<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.630> we'll<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
are pretty close as well so we'll take a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.960 
are pretty close as well so we'll take a
look<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.740> how<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.009> works<00:01:23.250> I'll

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
look out there and how this works I'll

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.200 
look out there and how this works I'll
go<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> overview<00:01:26.040> screen<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.119> we'll

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
go back to the overview screen and we'll

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420 
go back to the overview screen and we'll
take<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> walk<00:01:27.900> into<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> wet<00:01:28.590> lab<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.250> see

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
take a walk into the wet lab and see

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.969 
take a walk into the wet lab and see
that<00:01:29.610> from<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:31.049> we're<00:01:31.290> looking<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that from so we're looking at one of the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.710 
that from so we're looking at one of the
water<00:01:32.220> cloth<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> egg<00:01:33.390> tray

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
water cloth here in the egg tray

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200 
water cloth here in the egg tray
assemblies<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:34.950> eluted<00:01:35.220> water<00:01:35.579> clock<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
assemblies then eluted water clock and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
assemblies then eluted water clock and
said<00:01:36.420> water<00:01:36.750> from<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> north<00:01:37.409> end<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.340> flows

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
said water from the north end that flows

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.930 
said water from the north end that flows
down<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.240> profit<00:01:39.900> goes<00:01:40.140> out

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
down the profit goes out

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.900 
down the profit goes out
newegg<00:01:41.330> nozzles<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.800> we<00:01:42.950> have<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.310> ability<00:01:43.760> in

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
newegg nozzles so we have the ability in

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.080 
newegg nozzles so we have the ability in
our<00:01:44.650> education<00:01:45.650> here<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.950> measure<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.880> height

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
our education here to measure the height

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.910 
that trough to measure temperature and
why<00:03:35.450> are<00:03:35.510> we<00:03:35.630> measuring<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.110> twice<00:03:36.350> well

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
why are we measuring it twice well

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.880 
why are we measuring it twice well
because<00:03:37.459> we've<00:03:38.269> installed<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.840> system<00:03:39.050> not

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
because we've installed the system not

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.710 
because we've installed the system not
just<00:03:39.950> for<00:03:40.340> practical<00:03:40.910> reasons<00:03:40.940> but<00:03:41.390> also<00:03:41.480> to

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
just for practical reasons but also to

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.090 
just for practical reasons but also to
have<00:03:41.900> 20<00:03:42.440> different

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
have 20 different

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.280 
have 20 different
students<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.550> work<00:03:43.700> on<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.210> I<00:03:44.420> want<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:44.930> water

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
students to work on so I want that water

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.440 
students to work on so I want that water
temperature<00:03:45.920> transmitters<00:03:46.460> here<00:03:46.640> just<00:03:47.330> to

temperature transmitters here just to

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
lots of symptoms not that we needed to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.250 
lots of symptoms not that we needed to
census<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.460> every<00:03:52.640> water<00:03:52.880> trough<00:03:53.210> we're<00:03:54.110> also

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
census and every water trough we're also

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.980 
census and every water trough we're also
measuring<00:03:54.710> pH<00:03:55.310> over<00:03:56.300> here<00:03:56.510> we<00:03:56.660> can<00:03:56.810> see<00:03:56.960> a

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
measuring pH over here we can see a

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.170 
measuring pH over here we can see a
Phoenix<00:03:57.380> transmitter<00:03:57.890> measure<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.820> pH<00:03:59.090> of

Phoenix transmitter measure the pH of

the water as I mentioned before the eph
codes<00:04:02.870> here<00:04:03.080> are<00:04:03.230> bad<00:04:03.500> with<00:04:03.710> the<00:04:03.860> bad<00:04:04.040> gas<00:04:04.340> this

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
codes here are bad with the bad gas this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.720 
codes here are bad with the bad gas this
is<00:04:05.060> wildly<00:04:05.600> off<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.020> mark<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:06.560> our<00:04:07.040> pH<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.550> much

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
is wildly off the mark so our pH is much

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.900 
is wildly off the mark so our pH is much
closer<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.300> seven<00:04:08.690> than<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.860> nine<00:04:10.220> so

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
closer to seven than it is to nine so

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.910 
closer to seven than it is to nine so
that<00:04:11.060> is<00:04:11.210> not<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.570> be<00:04:11.720> trusted<00:04:12.170> at<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.590> moment

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
that is not to be trusted at the moment

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.010

full bedroom to point out earlier so

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.110 
full bedroom to point out earlier so

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
to measure of eight variables for off so

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.160

this<00:04:38.150> is<00:04:38.300> really<00:04:38.450> a<00:04:38.810> working<00:04:39.650> lab<00:04:39.920> for<00:04:40.280> us<00:04:40.370> over

here<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.490> students<00:04:52.850> are<00:04:52.910> really<00:04:53.090> proud<00:04:53.360> of

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
here the students are really proud of
