00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone we are on the booth 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.879
 black phone I think you had to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.109
 read about frandroid about 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.090
 black rhÃ´ne is a project that is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.670
 led by the Spanish grifols is a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.820
 other company that created this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 phone leblatphone then you know 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.000
 it's part of smartphones that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.680
 protects the privacy of their 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 users that's basically the argument of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.789
 sale and there we have just the detail 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.570
 exactly what does it bring 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.810
 so design point of view we have a screen 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.969
 4.7 inches hd in hdi ps so it's not 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.000
 badly to keep the viewing angles sas 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.290
 to his grip pays no more enormously one 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.399
 can co processor is not bad no 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.100
 more because we are a quad core 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.660
 clocked at 2.6 war we do not know the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.950
 mark not now the guy told us 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.780
 we could not know so we did not 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.960
 we did not look further for two gigas 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.700
 of ram and especially 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.230
 then flash this version is no 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.400
 version there is no scott of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.830
 micro sd of the blow 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.640
 it's not normally unions are 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.310
 not extensible but it will come 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.690
 maybe in another version 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.630
 that's in any case for the right corridor 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.430
 there is wifi there is bluetooth there 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.140
 also includes gps and all 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.250
 centers where all the normal sensors 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.630
 accelerometer other than one can 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.420
 find my help is on the market 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.770
 so features side is where 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.270
 it becomes interesting when you 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.120
 must start LEBLATPHONE 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.960
 imperatively identify his phone 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.220
 there is a qr code 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.180
 but it's only a qr code there is 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.190
 no need to give his name and his 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.420
 address this is already a first 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.640
 first thing too 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.520
 you have to know that all the data 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.050
 on this phone are encrypted 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.840
 completely that's what you 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.070
 download it your contacts 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.720
 everything is going to be encrypted this is a 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.580
 option that can be activated directly from 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.320
 the beginning then there are plenty of things 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.310
 interesting in features on the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.160
 black fake nose let's start with 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.200
 example by the starter yes if it's a 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.380
 small application wholesale if we have 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.710
 understood it will disable one say where the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.500
 residual whiskey messages of the time you 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.759
 do not we're going to say trust and that's to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.540
 say trust a wholesale network 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.770
 you are connected to your network 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.160
 domestic you say I make him 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.170
 trust 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.700
 so you will connect is all the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.950
 time on him against others 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.420
 when you're in the subway when you 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.649
 are in the subway and suddenly you 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.640
 have a unique cable network all 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.489
 geolocation data 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.500
 good in general will not pass that's it 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.959
 it's something pretty cool then 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 that in my opinion it's really the heart of 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 black phone you know when we go on 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.850
 the google suite usually falls 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.260
 on downloaded applications that's 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.360
 to why it is that we especially you 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.890
 request permissions and this 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.450
 application will access your contacts 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.450
 your phones and rides on the black 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.489
 phone it will be possible 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.050
 to give permissions according to 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.250
 applications and that's really 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.790
 nice because look at the list gema 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.160
 applications 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.680
 I opened one but I have my list 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.510
 of applications here messaging musicphone 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.400
 oh well, I do not want all 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.230
 these apps access my wifi hop 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.610
 there you do that and then it's 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.560
 completed all the applications of 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.269
 london axa or here and that's possible 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.769
 whatever the applications you 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.150
 download it is always possible to 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.099
 make phone calls with this 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.330
 phone but that your normal calls 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.060
 who will pass through other operators do not 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.470
 will not be encrypted for his joke phone 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.920
 proposes an application called 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.239
 silent circle mobile to download there 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.660
 will be in default present on this 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.250
 phone 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.180
 by and large good there we can not you 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.299
 show because the phone is not 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 connected to the network but basically it's a 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.459
 application of 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.900
 kiva encrypted for a voip application 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.120
 who will encrypt your calls and your 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.099
 messages of whether the voip so of 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.989
 coup we can use it from the wifi 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.150
 or from the networks directly to 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.769
 minus two sim cards and we have a table 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.599
 and a survey is simply 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.040
 but it's also a tool so it's a 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.989
 advantage here and knowing also that 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.760
 the application will vary the quality of the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.459
 signal according to the bandwidth 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.930
 so a priori you should you can 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.340
 you shoot and all people 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.409
 can call a black fauna even though 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.969
 your pockets not through precisely this 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.519
 application that blake phone offers 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:52.370
 proposes to remove the smartphone will 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.139
 cost 629 dollars there are services to 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.340
 buy on it yes necessarily better 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.750
 that the iphone pays a little on the beast 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.359
 but there are services purchased on it 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.489
 especially the hawke spyder service which 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.129
 is an encrypted storage service in 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.269
 line in the cloud 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.709
 some services will be free at 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.870
 the purchase and then after it will have to pay 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.950
 a small amount after one year according to 1 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.519
 $ 10 per month 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.590
 it does not seem excessive for anyway 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.539
 the service that is being sold for $ 629 for the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.099
 spectrum of this phone it's true that 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.419
 it's not cheap but maybe it's the 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:27.710
 price the price in quotation marks beyond the 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.570
 security of privacy so having to 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.979
 anyway safe on this phone have 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.770
 builds their skis it becomes a 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.889
 massy product may have 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.870
 attacks from people who are successful at 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.610
 break through the design of course of course if 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.990
 I have nothing but a fact but for the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.360
 moment we will say that this is one of 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.000
 rare a phone to offer a sequel 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.190
 completely secure we have examples 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.470
 as a rookie to a secure android bone 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.639
 but it does not offer it on 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.039
 phones that were not created 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.900
 specifically like that so it's a 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.030
 first attempt well in the era 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.340
 well still below time and suddenly 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.720
 here again we will look forward to 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.039
 to be able to test it if we ever have 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.150
 the opportunity and not to know everything he 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.310
 Remember, this is not the only 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.479
 it was not the only one it is not the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.220
 only android declension which is 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.190
 secure there are also spat 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.190
 canafe there are several organizations 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.419
 who encrypt their phone also the 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.689
 capitals many white areas that 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.719
 are left 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:25.089
 with in particular outings of samsung on 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.499
 has a lot of diversity 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.849
 that this is not a phone that 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.019
 was commissioned by a government there that 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.839
 is going to be really aimed at the general public 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:33.039
 and to all that what they want this 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.339
 that they want to protect their privacy 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.629
 in any case it will be run so 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:39.879
 for knowing also and we 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.559
 will conclude that the source code of 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.049
 applications for example as 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.389
 the security center application and an open 

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:47.439
 source everyone can go see him 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.089
 and not access the code to shut up 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.059
 besides a good or a bad use it 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:54.869
 depends on here is tony and mwc waters on 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.869
 the stand of the black fauna hi
