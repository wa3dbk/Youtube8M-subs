00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 let's not talk about marianite colors 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.470
 colors 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:24.200
 if the colors of what 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:24.200
 but they are also specialists 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.949
 Well look, I do not know how the 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.750
 cyclists I'll show you how 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.789
 do the orientals because it makes a 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.040
 time we show a video where 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.500
 We learned how to peel a hard egg in 10 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.760
 seconds 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.290
 there is a video that had been made in 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.210
 these days that has to do with 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.440
 invest the colors of the hard egg is 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.420
 eating hard new tuna that is white 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.890
 on the outside it is with the yolk inside 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.510
 that we are going to show you this video is 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.890
 that the yolk is left out looking 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.890
 inside 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.010
 but basically what you have to do is 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.680
 need the dogs of women of the 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.780
 cancan stockings scotch tape 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.210
 and one of those times when you're 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.510
 wire sleepers so it's a 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.340
 biscuit package 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.460
 - exactly then the first thing that 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 do to achieve this is to tape the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.479
 egg and wrap it and wrap it in ribbon 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.410
 is the egg towards natural they are not pre 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.410
 cooked or nothing 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.050
 clear so that it does not break fundamental 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.590
 that all the egg is well covered 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.410
 for the tape that we have but the best 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.759
 for any special event you want 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.470
 present a different table is 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.509
 good for salt once you tape it 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.570
 is the air what is proposed to you by this 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.619
 technique is that you put it inside a 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.619
 cancan mean 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.180
 you have to measure in the length of one of 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.180
 one leg from the middle to the middle 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:20.530
 was testing until it turns out 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:23.570
 incredible that the other side does not scare 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.800
 to the typical one to do it in thread and it puts 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.800
 the these wire sleepers 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 and what remains once you have that is 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.170
 grab the middle of the two ends 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.670
 and he's going to show it and he's going to show you 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.110
 that on one side has the knot of the other 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.819
 side put this lock so that after 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.099
 take it out be massive 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.099
 and now it's time to shake 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.870
 show is so this is for 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.930
 check what is going to happen this 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.109
 experiment with a flashlight 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.250
 it illuminates the egg and it is clearly visible 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.329
 light because the light is outside 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.890
 then you will see after the 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.719
 Shake how it looks is the home of the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.920
 extremes and now you have to start beating 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:17.120
 you have to shake the egg 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.090
 a while with much force the cute 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.040
 jimÃ©nez a few days 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.810
 in the form of a circle I shake it well 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.220
 good good again with both hands 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.450
 and if not then 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.450
 it's fun 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:45.270
 it's great what you have to achieve is 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.940
 that later when it comes back to light up with 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.890
 a flashlight no longer lights up the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.460
 clear egg that means that the yolk has 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.460
 left out 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.030
 there you take it to the egg of the average 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.280
 You see that it will light up and notice that 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.830
 it does not light up like before then 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.340
 means that up to this moment 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.790
 well done the experiment 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.620
 you have to cook what is clear now is the 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.419
 moment of cooking you put it in water to 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.530
 boil how many minutes we say it takes 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:23.949
 an egg from seven minutes 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.389
 it's very good there are some that say 10 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.860
 others who say to cool it cooked it 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.009
 then he takes it out he puts it in water with 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.150
 ice and now 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.860
 it was time to open it 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:44.500
 true 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:46.060
 that was the tape of the quick treatment 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.680
 see how it will look like they were 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.420
 spectacular gave you to make a 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.420
 table and now says today 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.160
 the other way around than trying at home 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.570
 but no 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:21.560
 with these things you have to have time 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:21.560
 for tomorrow the girls
