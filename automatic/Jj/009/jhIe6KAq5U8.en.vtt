00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.820
 the collagen 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.429
 biological function 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.469
 collagen is a protein molecule 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.529
 secreted by tissue cells 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.960
 conjunctive as the fibroblasts as well 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.910
 like other cell types the collagen 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.700
 are part of the protein family 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.369
 fibrous if it is the main protein more 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.070
 abundant of our body 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.080
 particularly collagen type 1 and a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.960
 essential component of bones 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.089
 cartilage ligaments tendons and skin 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 constituting approximately 25 per 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.940
 one hundred percent of the total mass of the protein 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.149
 in mammals its main function is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.610
 the structural and cellular support 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 the fibrous protein collagen possesses a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.829
 Great resistance to high stress 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.320
 without stretching ability likewise 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.300
 is able to withstand mechanical stress 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.550
 in human tissues they are known 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.789
 around 16 types of collagen 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.920
 different being the most abundant and 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.810
 therefore the most studied those of 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.400
 type 1 present in bone those of type 2 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.690
 present in cartilage and flax and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.450
 type 3 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.930
 present in skin 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.630
 organism that contains it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.810
 the collagen is contained by all beings 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.420
 live animals 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.840
 and molecular weight and number of amino acids 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.539
 that form it 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.450
 the collagen has a molecular weight of 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.399
 300 kilos daltons and is constituted by 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.479
 a set of three poly chains 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.450
 peptides a thousand amino acids per chain 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.670
 grouped in a helical structure 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.149
 glycine is the third part 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.729
 of the amino acids of each chain 35% 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.509
 unique fact among all the proteins 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.119
 of the alanine organism 11% and pro lineage 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.140
 hydroxy poly na 21% 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.500
 the repetition of 333 triples of form 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.099
 glycine xy chairs the structure of each 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.489
 one of the chains in position x is 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.819
 finds in most cases the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.640
 proline in position and the 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.440
 hydroxy proline and hydroxy lysine two 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.750
 amino acids that do not abound in the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.170
 constitution of the other proteins of the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.360
 organism 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.910
 with formation of collagen and its 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.040
 subunits 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.630
 the collagen has a structure 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 long complex and characteristic the pro 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.860
 collagen is synthesized by the ribosomes of 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.400
 the specialized cells in the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.840
 elaboration of genetic tail tissues 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.140
 assembling amino acids and forming 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.820
 long chains these amino acids 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.130
 come from the digestion of 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.530
 protein foods that go through the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.940
 intestinal barrier reaching the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.790
 gene tail tissues via blood 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.010
 secondary structure these chains of 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.780
 amino acids are rolled and linked between 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.090
 yes in groups of three forming the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.620
 triple propeller alpha pro chains 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.600
 collagen tertiary structure the pro 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.970
 Collagen are transformed into trope 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.190
 collagen by the action of a collagenase 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.170
 that allows these collagen trope to 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.500
 open and link by their ends 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.870
 forming long rows 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.750
 they line up and come together in parallel 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.430
 to form the micro fibrils the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.850
 which are also joined in parallel 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.030
 forming the structure fibrils 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.220
 quaternary the fibrils are aligned 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.070
 also in parallel to form fibers 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.100
 of collagen as can be seen in the 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.100
 image 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.220
 Currently, collagen is a protein 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.710
 of great biotechnological interest and 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.200
 they do research about how 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.480
 can take advantage of an investigation 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.480
 recent developed by the doctor 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.140
 diego m bernales and colleagues titled 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.610
 polymerized collagen membranes 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.510
 Considerations about its use in techniques 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.280
 of guided tissue and bone regeneration 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.790
 where membra was developed the use 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.040
 dental collagen membrane 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.140
 Absorbable of extreme purity having 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.980
 into account as a background meted the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.550
 Collagen dressing medical use designed 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.640
 as transient skin is covered 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.560
 they also presented the reports 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.320
 preliminary of a sequence of 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.510
 works in which it is shown how 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.570
 first stage the biocompatibility of 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.580
 membranes the dental use making 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.389
 keratinocyte cultures on the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.770
 biomaterial 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.050
 Later, we worked with animals 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.439
 of laboratory collecting data that 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.689
 clinical experience encouraged the 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.589
 results obtained are guaranteed by 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:04.710
 microscopy histological sections 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:06.690
 transillumination and photography 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.700
 collagen has been one of the 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.370
 materials most used in medicine 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.180
 to repair chemical trauma or damage 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.860
 mechanical either in skin or mucous membranes 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.380
 due to its bio compatibility and its 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.590
 ability to promote healing 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.590
 of wounds 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.870
 we hope that this information has been 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.870
 of utility thanks
