 of today's program we begin 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.840
 tomorrow thursday facebook has prepared 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.460
 an event in california in which 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.610
 intends to announce several novelties 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.290
 related to your social network there is no 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.779
 Many product data or 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.910
 concrete services but we do know that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.720
 the star ad is related to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.730
 android 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.760
 we know because in your invitation 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.590
 facebook write a pretty phrase 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.230
 descriptive that comes to say come to 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.390
 know our home on android without 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.820
 There are certainly reasons to think that 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.190
 it's about a revolutionary application 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.960
 android custom ROM or 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.210
 even a phone of its own because 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.950
 we think it's in the three because if 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.170
 the last of the points is met is 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.050
 say the phone the rest comes 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.400
 shot by pure logic and to give 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.560
 way to the rumors 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.630
 the boys of early who usually 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.090
 anticipate movements with great aim 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.550
 they publish some photos of a supposed 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.560
 facebook phone that would be manufactured 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.729
 by htc his name 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.729
 htc first 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.270
 that's how it seems that htc would be the partner 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.540
 facebook makers responsible for the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.970
 htc first development a phone that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.740
 It would be personalized and themed with 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.500
 the zuckerberg network from head to foot 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.630
 there are not many details but it 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.600
 rumored that would come to have a screen 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.840
 4.3 inch a dual 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.360
 core a gig of ram memory 16 gigas 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.210
 of internal memory and a camera of 5 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.680
 megapixels that you think will be this the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.680
 facebook phone definitive 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.670
 the rumors about the next iphone of 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.250
 apple are so many and so varied 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.709
 provenance that one no longer knew which 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.630
 give some credibility however 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.400
 when a medium the likes of wall 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.400
 street journal dares to give data 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.340
 concrete then a reference is created 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.380
 about which few can debate and is 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.080
 what has happened wall street journal 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.300
 ensures that you have information as to 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.910
 confirm the presentation of the new ipad 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.489
 besides betting on that size and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.040
 proportions will remain the same as 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.000
 of the current iphone5 although changing 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.160
 important parts of the design 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.530
 concretely equal stranger a date 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.470
 the presentation event for June not 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.540
 says concrete day but is a month not 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.390
 However there is another important fact that 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.670
 the medium gives us the confirmation of 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.950
 launch of an iphone 'low cost' 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.140
 which would be presented at the end of 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.940
 September and which would also come to 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.459
 have the same proportions of 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.340
 screen although obviously changing 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.709
 materials and coal 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.019
 wall street journal also publishes that 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.450
 Apple will release a new version of them 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.430
 the mobile operating system of the house 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.160
 on this point it does not give many details 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.560
 although it ensures that it will be a system with 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.560
 important changes and improvements that the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.230
 user will know how to value and that's all for 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.150
 the moment but surely we know more 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.150
 details in the coming days 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.230
 right now the android phone or 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.500
 most media smartphone is undoubtedly the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.840
 samsung galaxy s 4 its power and a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.900
 excellent marketing campaign have done 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.430
 that the terminal is seen as a 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.710
 unattainable although always as 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.990
 usually say there is someone bigger more 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.390
 strong or prettier 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.370
 this last one could be put in doubt not 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.160
 however in regards to size and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.160
 power to galaxy s 4 from samsung has you 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.010
 come out a tough competitor this is about 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.870
 lenovo kan 900 a terminal that was 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.940
 presented within the framework of the 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.400
 vegas and now thanks to the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.380
 results of the performance test before 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.110
 your benchmark proves to be above 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.110
 of the idolatrous galaxy s 4 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.860
 that yes we do not have record of if it 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.200
 It is the model four were eight 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.090
 nuclei for which you do not know this 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.070
 hello mouth to nine hundred fight in the 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.170
 battle of power with a processor 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.230
 intel atom clover trail plus with 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.570
 technology and no opening curiously 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.430
 the new k 900 is not the first 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.450
 smartphone that is your penis in performance 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.310
 the galaxy s 4 of samsung in this test 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.680
 another of the favorites for this year the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.780
 htc one also outperformed the ship 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.330
 samsung badge although in that 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.130
 moment that it was confirmed that 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.130
 it was about the quad-core model 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.070
 and speaking of galaxy s 4 even without 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.750
 confirm by samsung the data 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.590
 of the arrival of the flagship to 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.900
 our country 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.330
 amazon spain adds to your list the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.970
 purchase of the terminal and date of arrival at 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.919
 our country for May 15 this 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:18.080
 same year this is the Spanish version of 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:23.270
 Amazon has started to put the reservation on 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.370
 galaxy s 4 for a price of 699 euros it 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.500
 is about the free model and although in the 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.350
 purchase card can be appreciated that is 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.960
 the 16 gb version and that we can also 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.850
 choose between the white color in black in 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.949
 no part of said record is 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.380
 specifies if it is the version of 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.170
 4 or 8 cores 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.690

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.160
 we assume due to the demands of 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.040
 manufacturer let's suppose it's the model 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.290
 quad-core full hd screen of 5 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.590

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.080
 internal memory and all the software that 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.630
 samsung has included in android 422 with 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.650
 this data seems good price or what 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.290
