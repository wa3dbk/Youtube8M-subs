00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello dear friends your top five and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.760
 In x square hack not very well helped with this 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 mechanism so today it is involved 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.630
 in the role of the subject he came we have 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 here is the payment system but all are paid 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.430
 only a metal block but now he 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.250
 try s4 and put there any 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 another block to start the game you need 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.480
 press the button and see the game not 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.050
 the block starts 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.370
 climbed this and attention and lure you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 fined in how you sad yes come on 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.760
 now let's start the game honestly because 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.600
 that four ill let me now 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 explain everything that happened as paid 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.469
 right amount and now they manage 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.629
 bow and 2 arrows let's both 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.270
 and also look at this field at 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.960
 randomly placed goal spawn 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.960
 come on 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.140
 I missed but from the second time but not 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 gave a diamond cheer because darling opal 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:22.369
 boy how come on now come on 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.369
 you try and miss both times 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.580
 so I missed the first time and 2 and 2 1 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.750
 I ask you to look at it guys 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.290
 missed twice 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.970
 there are no buttons here and how are you 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:46.000
 see with him I am not a shield you are not I am not I am not 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.509
 bills look all all he is nothing 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.970
 gets 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.190
 and he leaves the game 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.500
 wonderful mechanism but now i'm 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.750
 show all the first person and more 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.590
 well dear friends now I'm from 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.229
 First person I will explain everything to you 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.050
 I will sort everything out when 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.679
 and I also want to say this video 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.880
 will consist of several parts then 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.580
 there is a following part will disassemble 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.069
 each part of the mechanism separately 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.230
 so don't forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.300
 if you are already subscribed then update the tape 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.640
 more often 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.760
 also want to say something you can 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.680
 look in the description and there will be everything 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.910
 described in detail about the release of new parts 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.100
 about this mechanism and also about laying out 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.500
 cards 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.900
 well friends now let's start 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.989
 in detail and in detail and all disassemble 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.690
 let's start with what I wanted 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.650
 4 is written here , put the iron block 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.049
 here but I came in with those 4 and let's 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.019
 try what happens block me 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.920
 take away this exemption for cheating 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.170
 but the game will not start here you can pay 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.230
 everything is just an iron block iron 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.859
 look here we pay next 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.079
 really 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.079
 you can pay any but 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.519
 depending on whether and to put on 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.420
 this we will talk in one of the following 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:22.980
 parts oh well now we push 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:26.440
 a button and we are given a bow and 2 arrows and 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.019
 here the target on this wall is bedroom ca in 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.770
 random place you might not 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.960
 believe 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.390
 and then you will see this circle I will pass 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.100
 several times and maybe I'm lucky and 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.070
 on not be slept somewhat at one point 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.640
 and so let me try to miss 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.220
 for starters and as you can see with me how 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.490
 only i shots shots climb 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.690
 the bow and me controls with losing me not 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.810
 gives a prize and drives me back 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.190
 what's next for us guys let me 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.880
 I'll try to allegedly have resources here 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.090
 inverter clogged 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.790
 and let's say I wanted s4 and you still have to take 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.600
 four arrows that is to me 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.299
 six shots let's i want to show 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.540
 the fact that your inverter is stored in any 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.959
 case here so here as you see i have 6 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.580
 by that 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:28.560
 and as you can see again, I remember the goal 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.850
 elsewhere so that you don't 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.100
 stuck on one goal did not get 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.740
 each time actually get here 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.950
 very easy but I can warn you right away 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.990
 will be set up so that the goal was here 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.330
 this wall itself was as far away as 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.500
 you want blocks well let's 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.980
 try with 4 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.650
 we have 6 arrows and again I will try 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.670
 miss in order not yet 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.700
 I need to win 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.640
 as soon as i shot two arrows me 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.450
 return back that is anyway 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:05.860
 me back minutes and I'm 4 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.210
 I can not and this kind of anti-cheat well 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.380
 well guys let's go now i'm 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.240
 I'll try to hit the target again 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.390
 to pay 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.390
 I will pay and where we will have a goal here 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.020
 here, as if I did not want her to spam 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.540
 here because she already for ability 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:30.160
 so need some aim here and 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.360
 shoot and not hit like this i get 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.260
 and get 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.480
 diamond is all that is me 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.040
 reward 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.160
 paid for entering the lottery and me 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.920
 rewarded that's all and me more 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.130
 telling this mechanism nothing you 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.780
 can look arranged at first 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.270
 a look is difficult but actually everything 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.480
 consists of five or six separate 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.120
 parts you can count just the same 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.600
 how many clips there will be five or 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.580
 six 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.710
 Well goodbye dear friends 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.700
 make sure you like to read 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.460
 description 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:10.340
 there you will find many interesting things hope 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.340
 and that's all goodbye
