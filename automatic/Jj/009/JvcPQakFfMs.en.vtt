00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:51.074
Sometimes I lay

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:52.534
Under the moon

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.080
And thank God I'm breathing

00:00:57.154 --> 00:00:58.554
Then I pray

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.800
Don't take me soon

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.300
'Cause I'm here for a reason

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.480
Sometimes in my tears I drown

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.440
But I never let it get me down

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.200
So when negativity surrounds

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.760
I know some day it'll all turn around

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.500
Because

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.477
All my life I've been waiting for

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:22.637
I've been praying for

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.440
For the people to say

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.440
That we don't wanna fight no more

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.100
There'll be no more wars

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.840
And our children will play

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.800
One day

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.880
One day

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.200
One day

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.740
One day this all will change

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.440
Treat poeple the same

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.720
Stop with the violence

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.320
Down with the hate

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.660
One day we'll all be free

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.520
And proud to be

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.140
Under the same sun

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.360
Singing songs of freedom like
