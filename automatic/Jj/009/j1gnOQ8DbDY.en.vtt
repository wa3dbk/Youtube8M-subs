as<00:02:30.680> usual<00:02:31.390> what<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.630> noticed<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
as usual what I have noticed is that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.850 
as usual what I have noticed is that
they<00:02:33.799> don't<00:02:34.100> do<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.640> crazy<00:02:34.970> overtakes<00:02:35.860> maybe

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
they don't do the crazy overtakes maybe

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.100 
they don't do the crazy overtakes maybe
because<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.640> sign<00:02:37.880> long<00:02:38.180> vehicle<00:02:38.750> that's

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
because of the sign long vehicle that's

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.000 
because of the sign long vehicle that's
in<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> rear<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.769> truck<00:02:41.620> they<00:02:42.620> don't<00:02:42.829> take

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
in the rear of the truck they don't take

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.539
