Jeon Ji-yoon (Bok-hee)
Hello. I'm Jeon Ji-yoon, a new musical actress, and I'm taking a role of 
 'Bok-hee', who is a frustrated ballerina in the musical 'My Love Next to Me'.

00:00:50.162 --> 00:01:05.730
Q. How do you feel about your first musical?
I had a lot of interest in musicals and it is my first challenge. It 
 is one of the things which I really want to do, so I'm really honored to take a role in this musical.

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:20.057
When I'm singing, I show people my boyish charm, but I'm taking a role of 
 a ballerina in this musical. So it's little difficult, but still interesting to me.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.620
Q. What do you think your strength is compare 
 to the other singers who challenged the musical?

00:01:51.621 --> 00:02:10.160
There are many idols who act and sing wonderfully in the musicals. I 
 think my strength is powerfulness and energy on the stage. 

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:15.530
Hong Ji Min /Musical Actress
Q. What do you 
 say about Jeon Ji-yoon as a junior?

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:39.760
She does well at the stage and also she's an easy-going person, so she hangs out with the other actors 
 and actresses. I worried about it, but rather I want to thank her in that respect now. 

00:02:42.525 --> 00:03:01.250
When she's in the practice room, she greets everyone politely before they do. I am 
 her mother in the musical and she treats me as her real mother. 

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:18.870
Q. Musical acting
A. I think it's really difficult. Singing and acting at 
 the same time on the stage is not that easy.

00:03:18.872 --> 00:03:34.120
Q. Classic songs in the musical?
A. Every song I sing is the classic song. I have heard remake version of songs so 
 many times. I searched for the original versions after taking a role in this musical. I like all of them.

00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:44.880
I think I'm really lucky as I can 
 sing great songs in the great musical.

00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:54.440
This musical will be the right one for whoever wants to love, 
 whoever is in love, and whoever begins to love. 

00:03:55.134 --> 00:04:11.050
The musical 'My Love Next to Me' will be performed from 
 Dec 11th to Jan 20th at Hanjeon Art Center.
