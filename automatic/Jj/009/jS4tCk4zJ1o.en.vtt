00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 in Sardinia 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.340
 in past years I have had the opportunity to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.430
 work already for this mission with various initiatives 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.740
 and with that of 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.060

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.240
 which is the community of barral donors together 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 we could achieve 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.970

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.560
 it is nice to give the commitment of plants that I am making available 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.530

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.730
 a filmup you actually had to contribute 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.090
 many situations of poverty assessor so many situations 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.450
 the difficulties here 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.450
 we meet day by day 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.740
 health particular way 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.870

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.270
 we know well that the honda spirit association 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.160

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.689
 the funds raised with the screening of this film 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.960

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.980
 we are working 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.110
 this film apparently 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.650
 it may seem that it has nothing to do with missionary discourse 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.110
 in reverse 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.950
 is a film that invites us to make people think 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.409
