hi<00:00:00.570> I'm<00:00:00.750> Tim<00:00:00.989> Gibson<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.500> talked<00:00:01.740> you<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:01.860> the

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hi I'm Tim Gibson I talked you about the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.710 
hi I'm Tim Gibson I talked you about the
International<00:00:02.700> Building<00:00:03.060> Code<00:00:03.090> for

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
International Building Code for

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.950 
International Building Code for
handrails<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.650> steps<00:00:05.629> essentially<00:00:06.629> what<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
handrails and steps essentially what the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.540 
handrails and steps essentially what the
International<00:00:07.529> Building<00:00:07.859> Code<00:00:07.890> does<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.460> it

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
International Building Code does is it

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.810 
International Building Code does is it
provides<00:00:08.880> minimum<00:00:09.570> standards<00:00:10.400> for<00:00:11.400> building

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
provides minimum standards for building

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.169 
provides minimum standards for building
or<00:00:12.059> renovating<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.490> specifically<00:00:14.490> as<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.030> has

or renovating and specifically as it has

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
or renovating and specifically as it has
to<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.450> residential<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:16.500> provided

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070

by the International residential code
now<00:00:21.180> what<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> covered<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:23.000> as<00:00:24.000> a

now what is covered in this is as a
concerns<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> steps<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.980> there<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
concerns to the steps is there is a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.089 
concerns to the steps is there is a
maximum<00:00:28.140> rise<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:29.970> maximum<00:00:30.689> height<00:00:31.140> from

of the next and this maximum height as
measured<00:00:39.120> from<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.480> finished<00:00:39.930> surface<00:00:40.170> so

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
measured from a finished surface so

whether it's a solid wood or a carpet in

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.010 
whether it's a solid wood or a carpet in
this<00:00:43.079> case<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.129> maximum<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.420> seven

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this case the maximum can be is seven

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.130 
this case the maximum can be is seven
and<00:00:46.170> three-quarters<00:00:46.800> inches<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.750> then<00:00:48.750> also

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and three-quarters inches and then also

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.750 
and three-quarters inches and then also
as<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> number<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.879> steps<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
as you have a number of steps the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.250 
as you have a number of steps the
maximum<00:00:53.760> difference<00:00:54.180> between<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> height<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
maximum difference between the height of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
maximum difference between the height of
any<00:00:56.149> two<00:00:57.149> treads<00:00:57.739> can<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> difference<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.820> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
any two treads can be a difference of a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.869 
any two treads can be a difference of a
maximum<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> 3/8<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.129> an<00:01:02.550> inch

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
maximum of 3/8 of an inch

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
maximum of 3/8 of an inch
now<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> other<00:01:04.019> standard<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:04.949> covered<00:01:05.430> as

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
now the other standard that's covered as

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.340 
now the other standard that's covered as
it<00:01:05.850> has<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.500> with<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.909> steps<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.140> have

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it has to do with the steps is you have

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.609 
it has to do with the steps is you have
to<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> clear<00:01:11.220> dimension<00:01:12.020> minimum<00:01:13.020> clear

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to have a clear dimension minimum clear

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.960 
to have a clear dimension minimum clear
dimension<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.750> 36<00:01:15.750> inches<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.409> width<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.549> if

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
dimension of 36 inches in width so if

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
dimension of 36 inches in width so if
you<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.450> handrails<00:01:19.259> such<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you have handrails such as this that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.480 
you have handrails such as this that
stick<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.720> extend<00:01:22.259> off<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> wall<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
stick out or extend off the wall the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.219 
stick out or extend off the wall the
minimum<00:01:23.880> width<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.869> between

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
minimum width that you can have between

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.399 
minimum width that you can have between
the<00:01:25.560> handrails<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.460> clear<00:01:27.060> opening<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.720> 36

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the handrails or clear opening is 36

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.390 
the handrails or clear opening is 36
inches<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.850> are<00:01:29.939> also<00:01:30.060> standards<00:01:30.810> that

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
inches now there are also standards that

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.319 
inches now there are also standards that
tell<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:33.950> far<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.729> edge<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
tell you how far the edge of the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.370 
tell you how far the edge of the
handrail<00:01:36.780> has<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.530> from<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.579> wall<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:40.170> also

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
handrail has to be from the wall it also

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.690 
handrail has to be from the wall it also
covers<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.430> maximum<00:01:41.970> height<00:01:43.490> typically<00:01:44.490> this

starts for going up then you have to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.480 
starts for going up then you have to
measure<00:02:20.550> from<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.150> tread<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.920> now<00:02:22.920> to

measure from that tread up now to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.460

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
establish what these minimums are you
