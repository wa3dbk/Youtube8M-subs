00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.380 
those of you rudiment people you know
that's<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.210> nine<00:02:18.390> stroke<00:02:18.690> roll<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.140> en<00:02:19.380> SE<00:02:23.390> so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
that's a nine stroke roll one en SE so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:35.900 
that's a nine stroke roll one en SE so
I'll<00:02:24.510> play<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> double

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
I'll play that for you so the double

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.340 
I'll play that for you so the double
strokes<00:02:36.120> are<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.300> neat<00:02:36.450> way<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.630> embellish<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
strokes are a neat way to embellish the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.050 
strokes are a neat way to embellish the
groove<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.740> still<00:02:37.980> keeps<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.340> same<00:02:38.700> general

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
groove it still keeps the same general

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.330 
groove it still keeps the same general
feel<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.560> sounds<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> little<00:02:41.280> bit

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
feel but it sounds a little bit

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.280 
feel but it sounds a little bit
different<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.730> keeps<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.000> interesting<00:02:42.290> number

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
different it keeps it interesting number

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
different it keeps it interesting number
three<00:02:43.740> embellishes<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.520> with<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.760> open

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
three embellishes it with the open

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.300 
three embellishes it with the open
hi-hat<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.810> put<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> UH<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:47.040> to

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
hi-hat and I put that on the UH of to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.220 
hi-hat and I put that on the UH of to
write<00:02:47.550> with<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.760> bass<00:02:47.910> drum<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.959> I'll<00:02:49.050> play

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
write with the bass drum so I'll play

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:58.470 
write with the bass drum so I'll play
that<00:02:49.440> for<00:02:49.650> you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.470 

and<00:02:59.480> one<00:03:00.290> thing<00:03:00.320> cool<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.890> do<00:03:01.100> when<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.030> add<00:03:02.270> an

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
and one thing cool to do when you add an

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.170 
and one thing cool to do when you add an
open<00:03:02.750> hi-hat<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:04.100> add<00:03:04.250> more<00:03:04.520> open<00:03:05.000> hi-hat

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
open hi-hat is to add more open hi-hat

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.990 
open hi-hat is to add more open hi-hat
so<00:03:05.570> number<00:03:05.780> four<00:03:05.990> adds<00:03:06.260> more<00:03:07.220> open<00:03:07.490> hi-hat<00:03:07.670> and

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
so number four adds more open hi-hat and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.240 
so number four adds more open hi-hat and
what<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.720> did<00:03:08.990> here<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.830> keep<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.100> interesting

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
what I did here to keep it interesting

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.850 
what I did here to keep it interesting
is<00:03:10.730> I'm<00:03:10.880> not<00:03:11.090> doing<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.810> same<00:03:11.840> one<00:03:12.590> measure

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
is I'm not doing the same one measure

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.040 
is I'm not doing the same one measure
repeating<00:03:13.400> pattern<00:03:13.760> now<00:03:13.910> I'm<00:03:14.300> using<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.900> open

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
repeating pattern now I'm using the open

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.010 
repeating pattern now I'm using the open
hi-hat<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:16.250> create<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.270> measure<00:03:17.480> repeating

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
hi-hat to create a to measure repeating

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.050 
hi-hat to create a to measure repeating
pattern<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.650> first<00:03:18.860> measure<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.820> number

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
pattern so the first measure of number

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.540 
pattern so the first measure of number
four<00:03:20.270> is<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> same<00:03:20.750> as<00:03:20.960> number<00:03:21.800> three<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
four is the same as number three the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.970 
four is the same as number three the
second<00:03:22.970> measure<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.450> where<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.900> second<00:03:24.710> open

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
second measure is where the second open

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:36.270 
second measure is where the second open
hi-hat<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.460> added<00:03:25.820> on<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.000> end<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.300> 3<00:03:26.570> and

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.030 

number<00:03:37.280> five<00:03:37.610> ads<00:03:37.970> in<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.780> low<00:03:39.380> Tom<00:03:39.620> on<00:03:39.830> count

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
number five ads in the low Tom on count

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.220 
number five ads in the low Tom on count
four<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.820> you're<00:03:40.940> going<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.090> go<00:03:41.270> from<00:03:41.630> hitting
