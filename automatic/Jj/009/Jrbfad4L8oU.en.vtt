about love and friendship and like being
somebody<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.820> someone<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.630> were

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
somebody to someone that were

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.790 
somebody to someone that were
that<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.069> was<00:02:17.580> able<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.970> respond<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
that I was able to respond to and I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.979 
that I was able to respond to and I
think<00:02:19.940> even<00:02:20.940> though<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.180> sort<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.690> coming

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
think even though it is sort of a coming

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.620 
think even though it is sort of a coming
of<00:02:22.110> age<00:02:22.200> story<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.770> think<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.280> very<00:02:23.630> important

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
of age story I think it's very important

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.690 
of age story I think it's very important
to<00:02:24.959> know<00:02:25.830> those<00:02:26.130> sort<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.340> things<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.640> think

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
to know those sort of things I think

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.430 
to know those sort of things I think
Stephen<00:02:27.120> Chbosky<00:02:27.209> presents<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.260> really

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
Stephen Chbosky presents it in a really

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.710 
Stephen Chbosky presents it in a really
dark<00:02:30.080> but<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.349> realistic<00:02:32.310> way<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.360> think<00:02:33.390> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
dark but a realistic way and I think the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.440 
dark but a realistic way and I think the
dark<00:02:34.230> parts<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.220> book<00:02:35.550> all<00:02:35.790> together<00:02:36.000> are

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
dark parts of this book all together are

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.570 
dark parts of this book all together are
really<00:02:36.780> what<00:02:37.020> hold<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.680> apart<00:02:38.130> from<00:02:38.250> other

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
really what hold it apart from other

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.309 
really what hold it apart from other
coming-of-age<00:02:39.209> stories<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
coming-of-age stories because the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.320 
coming-of-age stories because the
darkness<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.069> book<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.459> very<00:02:41.700> real<00:02:42.000> um

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
darkness in this book is very real um

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.809 
darkness in this book is very real um
the<00:02:43.230> things<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.739> happened<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.160> Charlie<00:02:44.459> are

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
the things that happened to Charlie are

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.500 
the things that happened to Charlie are
not<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:45.810> typical<00:02:46.019> sort<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:47.120> dark<00:02:48.120> things

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
not your typical sort of dark things

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.420 
not your typical sort of dark things
that<00:02:48.780> happen<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.230> high<00:02:49.380> school<00:02:49.830> there<00:02:50.069> they're

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
that happen in high school there they're

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.250 
that happen in high school there they're
very<00:02:50.700> legitimate<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.540> very<00:02:51.690> real<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.140> all

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
very legitimate and very real that's all

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.100 
very legitimate and very real that's all
say<00:02:52.590> without<00:02:52.739> spoiling<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:54.110> think

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
say without spoiling it but I think

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.400 
say without spoiling it but I think
without<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.910> would<00:02:57.239> not<00:02:57.510> be<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.900> sort

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
without that this would not be the sort

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.250 
without that this would not be the sort
of<00:02:58.500> connective<00:02:59.370> book<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.360> it's<00:03:00.900> also

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
of connective book that it is it's also

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.170 
of connective book that it is it's also
a<00:03:01.500> film<00:03:01.950> starring<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.640> beautiful<00:03:03.060> and

people whose names I honestly don't know

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.250 
people whose names I honestly don't know
but<00:03:08.910> after<00:03:09.269> reading<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:09.780> book<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.049> think<00:03:10.200> I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
but after reading this book I think I

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.430 
but after reading this book I think I
watched<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> film<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.069> same<00:03:11.280> day<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:12.440> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
watched the film in the same day and it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.650 
watched the film in the same day and it
was<00:03:13.620> really<00:03:13.799> good<00:03:14.100> i<00:03:14.160> think<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:15.120> they<00:03:15.390> did<00:03:15.630> a

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
was really good i think that they did a

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.660 
was really good i think that they did a
very<00:03:15.870> great<00:03:16.170> job<00:03:16.380> as<00:03:16.530> especially<00:03:16.950> since<00:03:17.160> the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
very great job as especially since the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.460 
very great job as especially since the
author<00:03:17.819> was<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.600> one<00:03:18.720> who<00:03:18.810> directed<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.319> kind

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
author was the one who directed and kind

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.229 
author was the one who directed and kind
of<00:03:19.530> put<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.709> together<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.760> i<00:03:20.790> think<00:03:20.910> they<00:03:21.060> did<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
of put it together so i think they did a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.060 
of put it together so i think they did a
really<00:03:21.390> great<00:03:21.510> job<00:03:21.630> adapting<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.799> taking

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
really great job adapting it and taking

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.199 
really great job adapting it and taking
the<00:03:23.190> right<00:03:23.310> things<00:03:23.549> out<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.910> putting<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
the right things out and putting the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.699 
the right things out and putting the
right<00:03:24.269> things<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.660> i<00:03:24.900> think<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.650> was

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
right things in i think it was

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.599 
right things in i think it was
incredibly<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.850> organized<00:03:27.480> as<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.170> movie<00:03:28.709> but

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
incredibly well organized as a movie but

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.990 
incredibly well organized as a movie but
overall<00:03:30.090> i<00:03:30.209> think<00:03:30.329> i<00:03:31.230> liked<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.579> book<00:03:32.820> a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
overall i think i liked the book a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.880 
overall i think i liked the book a
little<00:03:33.239> bit<00:03:33.390> more<00:03:33.690> i<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.049> movie<00:03:34.230> made

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
little bit more i think the movie made

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.039 
little bit more i think the movie made
me<00:03:34.920> understand<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.269> book<00:03:36.480> better<00:03:36.690> because

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
me understand the book better because

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.660 
me understand the book better because
you<00:03:37.170> could<00:03:37.350> see<00:03:37.709> things<00:03:37.980> played<00:03:38.489> out<00:03:38.519> on

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
you could see things played out on

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.090 
you could see things played out on
screen<00:03:39.180> rather<00:03:39.480> than<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:40.019> in<00:03:40.170> your<00:03:40.290> head<00:03:40.530> but

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
screen rather than just in your head but

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.650 
screen rather than just in your head but
i<00:03:41.160> think<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.519> book<00:03:41.670> does<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> better<00:03:42.209> job<00:03:42.299> of

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
i think the book does a better job of
