00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.770 
step one is to clean off the lens
obviously<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.670> they<00:00:14.730> look<00:00:14.910> pretty<00:00:15.059> grimy<00:00:15.330> so

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
obviously and they look pretty grimy so

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.290 
obviously and they look pretty grimy so
I'll<00:00:16.379> get<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.740> wanted<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.400> try<00:00:17.880> something

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I'll get to that wanted to try something

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.820 
I'll get to that wanted to try something
here<00:00:18.510> isn't<00:00:18.660> putting<00:00:18.930> them<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.470> looks<00:00:19.680> like

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
here isn't putting them on it looks like

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
here isn't putting them on it looks like
it<00:00:19.980> might<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.279> good<00:00:20.430> idea<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.090> try<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.570> trim

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it might be a good idea to try and trim

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.939 
it might be a good idea to try and trim
this<00:00:21.840> off<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.500> stuff<00:00:22.710> isn't

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
this off so that this stuff isn't

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.439 
this off so that this stuff isn't
sticking<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.279> your<00:00:23.340> fingers<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.359> gonna

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
sticking to your fingers so I'm gonna

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.560 
sticking to your fingers so I'm gonna
make<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> little<00:00:24.930> groove<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.920> backing<00:00:26.699> got

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
make a little groove and the backing got

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
make a little groove and the backing got
a<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:27.810> groove<00:00:27.960> into<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> backing<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.279> that

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
a little groove into the backing so that

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.389 
a little groove into the backing so that
when<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> peel<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.390> backing<00:00:31.349> from<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
when I peel off the backing from this it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.910 
when I peel off the backing from this it
leaves<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> tab<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.290> hold<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
leaves the tab so that I can hold on to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.030 
leaves the tab so that I can hold on to
the<00:00:35.040> tabs<00:00:35.219> without<00:00:36.559> touching<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.770> sticky

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the tabs without touching the sticky

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.340 
the tabs without touching the sticky
stuff<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.550> potentially<00:00:39.510> contaminating<00:00:40.200> this

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
stuff and potentially contaminating this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.490 
stuff and potentially contaminating this
so<00:00:41.239> peel<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.360> backing<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.110> stick<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.410> on

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so peel this backing off and stick it on

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
so peel this backing off and stick it on
the<00:00:43.620> headlight<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.910> see<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.239> mean<00:00:45.360> now<00:00:45.539> my

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
tab is still has the backing on it I can

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
tab is still has the backing on it I can
handle<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> without<00:00:55.559> touching<00:00:56.100> any<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

stuff<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> without<00:00:58.070> risking<00:00:59.070> screwing<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.489> up

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.840 

all<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.500> Gunsmoke<00:01:14.250> finish<00:01:14.670> on

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
all right this is the Gunsmoke finish on

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.360 
all right this is the Gunsmoke finish on
the<00:01:14.970> foglight<00:01:16.010> couldn't<00:01:17.010> be<00:01:17.070> much<00:01:17.220> more

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
the foglight couldn't be much more

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.880 
the foglight couldn't be much more
simple<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:18.420> putting<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.720> sticker<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:20.870> alright

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
simple just putting a sticker on alright

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
simple just putting a sticker on alright
so<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.010> things<00:01:23.220> rival<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> Sun<00:01:23.910> from<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
so these things rival the Sun from a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
so these things rival the Sun from a
brightness<00:01:24.570> perspective<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.320> I'll<00:01:25.680> turn<00:01:26.070> one

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
brightness perspective so I'll turn one

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.570 
brightness perspective so I'll turn one
on<00:01:26.310> without<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:27.740> Lenox<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.370> do

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
on without the Lenox on it and then do

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.800 
on without the Lenox on it and then do
this<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> lemon<00:01:30.450> next<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:30.720> going

annex<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:49.610> wanted<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> give<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.910> look<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
annex I wanted to give you a look at the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.460 
annex I wanted to give you a look at the
before<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.780> after<00:01:51.990> here

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.390 

alright<00:01:56.470> I'm<00:01:56.620> standing<00:01:56.979> in<00:01:57.070> front<00:01:57.159> of<00:01:57.280> the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
alright I'm standing in front of the

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.899 
alright I'm standing in front of the
track<00:01:57.610> looking<00:01:57.970> down<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.860> light<00:02:00.700> field

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
track looking down at the light field

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.940 
track looking down at the light field
cast<00:02:01.270> by<00:02:01.450> just<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.840> fog<00:02:02.020> lights<00:02:02.320> being<00:02:02.560> on<00:02:02.740> and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
cast by just the fog lights being on and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.350 
cast by just the fog lights being on and
I<00:02:03.190> think<00:02:03.430> it's<00:02:03.610> pretty<00:02:03.760> clear<00:02:03.970> that<00:02:04.030> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
I think it's pretty clear that the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.600 
I think it's pretty clear that the
passenger<00:02:04.869> side<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.950> little<00:02:06.280> bit<00:02:06.400> brighter

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
passenger side is a little bit brighter

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.059 
passenger side is a little bit brighter
than<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.970> driver's<00:02:07.360> side<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:08.020> there<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.770> some

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
than the driver's side so there is some

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.330 
than the driver's side so there is some
light<00:02:09.250> loss<00:02:09.490> with<00:02:09.850> these<00:02:09.970> lamb<00:02:10.179> index<00:02:10.479> covers

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
light loss with these lamb index covers

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.410 
light loss with these lamb index covers
not<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.400> big<00:02:12.820> shock

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
not a big shock

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.270 
not a big shock
and<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.020> fact<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.770> was<00:02:14.950> hoping<00:02:15.100> for

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and in fact and what I was hoping for

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.890 
and in fact and what I was hoping for
because<00:02:15.910> my<00:02:16.030> fog<00:02:16.240> lights<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.600> been<00:02:16.630> so

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
because my fog lights have been so

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.940 
because my fog lights have been so
bright<00:02:17.200> but<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.620> can't<00:02:17.830> ever<00:02:18.070> really<00:02:18.340> run<00:02:18.580> them

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
bright but I can't ever really run them

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.990 
bright but I can't ever really run them
standing<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.070> front<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> truck<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:21.820> both

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
standing in front of the truck with both

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.350 
standing in front of the truck with both
legs<00:02:22.180> having<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> laminates<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.320> them<00:02:24.360> now

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
legs having the laminates on them now

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.510 
legs having the laminates on them now
they're<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.720> same<00:02:25.930> as<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.190> tell<00:02:27.400> that

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
they're the same as you can tell that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.449 
they're the same as you can tell that
that<00:02:28.530> laminates<00:02:29.530> cover<00:02:29.739> really<00:02:29.980> does<00:02:30.160> make<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
that laminates cover really does make a

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.610 
that laminates cover really does make a
difference<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.480> reducing<00:02:31.630> some<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.200> line

you kind of see on the ground in front

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.680 
you kind of see on the ground in front
of<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> truck<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:38.380> difference<00:02:38.739> between<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
this is from inside the truck like it's

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.050 
this is from inside the truck like it's
even<00:02:54.620> more<00:02:54.709> obvious<00:02:54.889> at<00:02:55.340> least<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:55.790> shot

that passenger side is brighter than the

that passenger side is brighter than the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
does look a little bit brighter so it's

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.199 
does look a little bit brighter so it's
eaten<00:03:07.099> up<00:03:07.189> just<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.489> little<00:03:07.519> bit<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.969> the<00:03:08.030> light
