out there's only one way to find out we
used<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.520> see<00:01:12.700> how<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.909> even<00:01:13.090> start<00:01:13.509> it<00:01:13.600> but<00:01:13.719> the

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
used to see how to even start it but the

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.600 
used to see how to even start it but the
gums<00:01:14.079> wrapped<00:01:14.439> up<00:01:14.740> now<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.250> need<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.460> get

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
and then that opens up that's what it

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.380 
and then that opens up that's what it
