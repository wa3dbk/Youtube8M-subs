00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
earthquake is he shows him the seed bomb

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
earthquake is he shows him the seed bomb
now<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.599> weakened<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.410> is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
now right on is weakened but this is

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.020 
now right on is weakened but this is
really<00:02:10.770> nice<00:02:11.009> because<00:02:11.220> he<00:02:11.459> doesn't<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.760> any

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
really nice because he doesn't get any

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.220 
really nice because he doesn't get any
layers<00:02:12.300> up

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
layers up

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.690 
layers up
as<00:02:13.530> well<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:13.950> getting<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.310> thing<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
as well as getting that thing out of the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.550 
as well as getting that thing out of the
way<00:02:14.819> let's<00:02:15.120> denote<00:02:15.420> putting<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.870> lot<00:02:16.140> more<00:02:16.379> work

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
way let's denote putting a lot more work

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.729 
way let's denote putting a lot more work
so<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.519> really<00:02:17.730> nice<00:02:17.879> um<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:19.440> gonna<00:02:19.590> go

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
the reason I'm thinking out is because I

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.150

poison or any of that because mainly

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:48.120 
poison or any of that because mainly
what<00:07:46.719> mattered<00:07:47.110> was<00:07:47.139> not<00:07:47.440> healing<00:07:47.740> wishing
