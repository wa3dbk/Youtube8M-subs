00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
poisonous plant um I still prefer to

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.349 
poisonous plant um I still prefer to
watch<00:02:55.980> out<00:02:56.159> for<00:02:56.189> five<00:02:56.519> leaves<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.060> don't<00:02:57.269> know

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
watch out for five leaves I don't know

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.199

why<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.569> just<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:58.139> um<00:02:59.239> and<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.909> poison<00:03:02.909> ivy<00:03:03.030> is

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
why I just do um and so poison ivy is

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.309 
why I just do um and so poison ivy is
more<00:03:03.389> like<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.780> fine<00:03:04.079> edged<00:03:04.530> outer<00:03:05.459> layer<00:03:06.319> as

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
more like the fine edged outer layer as

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.809 
more like the fine edged outer layer as
you<00:03:07.560> can<00:03:07.680> see<00:03:07.859> here<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:10.620> poison<00:03:10.980> ivy<00:03:11.099> isn't

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
you can see here this poison ivy isn't

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.240 
you can see here this poison ivy isn't
how<00:03:11.909> many<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.599> serration<00:03:13.409> spots<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:14.040> just

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
how many like serration spots is just

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.059 
how many like serration spots is just
fine<00:03:14.549> throughout<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.150> whole<00:03:15.299> side<00:03:16.069> and

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
fine throughout the whole side and

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.250 
fine throughout the whole side and
poison<00:03:17.639> ivy<00:03:17.760> that's<00:03:18.120> pretty<00:03:18.329> much<00:03:18.480> stat<00:03:19.019> and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
poison ivy that's pretty much stat and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.129 
poison ivy that's pretty much stat and
it's<00:03:19.560> probably<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.040> worst<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.609> me<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:21.139> poison

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
it's probably the worst to me and poison

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:27.140 
it's probably the worst to me and poison
oak<00:03:22.349> is<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:25.220> saw<00:03:26.220> some<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.699> minute<00:03:26.970> ago<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
oak is I saw some just a minute ago I

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.629 
oak is I saw some just a minute ago I
think<00:03:27.419> okay<00:03:28.379> now<00:03:28.620> here<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.569> poison<00:03:30.569> oak<00:03:30.690> poison

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
think okay now here is poison oak poison

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.819 
think okay now here is poison oak poison
oak<00:03:32.639> is<00:03:32.849> pretty<00:03:33.269> much<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.599> same<00:03:33.780> thing<00:03:34.079> but<00:03:34.709> it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
oak is pretty much the same thing but it

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.520 
oak is pretty much the same thing but it
has<00:03:34.859> kind<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.220> like<00:03:35.310> serrations<00:03:36.060> or<00:03:36.530> jagged

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
has kind of like serrations or jagged

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.849 
has kind of like serrations or jagged
edges<00:03:38.569> which<00:03:39.569> makes<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.260> difference

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
edges which makes it the difference

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.339 
edges which makes it the difference
poison<00:03:41.430> ivy<00:03:41.549> just<00:03:41.849> has<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> nice<00:03:42.209> fine<00:03:42.629> so

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
poison ivy just has a nice fine so

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.289 
poison ivy just has a nice fine so
killer<00:03:43.650> edge<00:03:43.859> this<00:03:44.190> has<00:03:44.400> nut<00:03:44.699> this<00:03:45.060> has

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
killer edge this has nut this has

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.349 
killer edge this has nut this has
serrations<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.229> I<00:03:46.769> mean<00:03:47.220> not<00:03:47.370> swish<00:03:47.639> jagged

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
serrations and I mean not swish jagged

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.300 
serrations and I mean not swish jagged
edge<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.409> outside<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:51.090> poison<00:03:51.690> oak<00:03:51.810> is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
edge on the outside but poison oak is

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.920 
edge on the outside but poison oak is
more<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.519> plant<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:54.150> doesn't<00:03:54.419> grow<00:03:54.540> much<00:03:54.750> on

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
more of a plant it doesn't grow much on

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.819 
more of a plant it doesn't grow much on
the<00:03:55.019> other<00:03:55.409> line

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.500 

so<00:03:58.829> that's<00:03:59.040> poison<00:03:59.430> oak<00:03:59.579> is<00:03:59.790> pretty<00:04:00.060> much<00:04:00.209> just

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
so that's poison oak is pretty much just

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.089 
so that's poison oak is pretty much just
watch<00:04:00.629> out<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.229> two<00:04:01.500> three<00:04:01.799> leaves

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.920 

poison<00:04:05.099> ivy<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.669> fine<00:04:05.940> edged<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.629> then

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
poison ivy is this fine edged and then

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.740 
poison ivy is this fine edged and then
poison<00:04:07.349> oak<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.239> jagged-edged<00:04:10.010> now

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
poison oak is the jagged-edged now

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.830 
poison oak is the jagged-edged now
poison<00:04:12.750> sumac<00:04:13.229> is<00:04:13.590> not<00:04:13.769> around<00:04:14.040> here<00:04:14.629> but<00:04:15.629> I
