it's<00:04:22.470> like<00:04:22.650> an<00:04:22.800> invisible<00:04:23.490> part<00:04:23.670> because<00:04:24.090> I

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's like an invisible part because I

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.390 
it's like an invisible part because I
didn't<00:04:24.390> have<00:04:24.510> time<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.900> do<00:04:25.590> anything<00:04:25.950> else

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
didn't have time to do anything else

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.250 
didn't have time to do anything else
nothing<00:04:26.669> gonna<00:04:26.970> be<00:04:27.180> my<00:04:27.360> hair<00:04:27.600> on<00:04:27.720> top<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.050> this

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
nothing gonna be my hair on top of this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.130 
nothing gonna be my hair on top of this
it's<00:04:28.740> just<00:04:28.830> yeah<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.210> invisible<00:04:30.510> part

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
it's just yeah so the invisible part

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.450 
it's just yeah so the invisible part
it's<00:04:31.410> probably<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.800> little<00:04:31.919> messy<00:04:32.340> that's

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
it's probably a little messy that's

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.159 
it's probably a little messy that's
really<00:04:32.970> basically<00:04:33.330> air<00:04:33.570> brothers<00:04:33.960> hair

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
really basically air brothers hair

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.900 
really basically air brothers hair
because<00:04:34.440> it's<00:04:34.620> really<00:04:34.770> not<00:04:35.010> much<00:04:35.190> taking<00:04:35.700> care

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
because it's really not much taking care

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.480 
because it's really not much taking care
of<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.419> have<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.780> do<00:04:36.930> like<00:04:37.190> when<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.250> wake

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
of that you have to do like when I wake

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.610 
of that you have to do like when I wake
up<00:04:38.520> when<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:39.210> go<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.450> sleep<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.840> just<00:04:39.900> put<00:04:40.260> my<00:04:40.380> body

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
up when I go to sleep I just put my body

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.250 
up when I go to sleep I just put my body
on<00:04:40.860> top<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.460> like<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:42.180> put<00:04:42.720> my<00:04:42.870> body<00:04:43.080> on

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
on top of it like this put my body on

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.980 
on top of it like this put my body on
Zappos<00:04:43.740> or<00:04:43.890> when<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.100> wake<00:04:44.310> up<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.730> just<00:04:45.660> take<00:04:45.960> it

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
Zappos or when I wake up I just take it

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
somewhere it's flat and just tease it a

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.980 
somewhere it's flat and just tease it a
little<00:04:53.010> bit<00:04:53.160> that's<00:04:53.760> pretty<00:04:54.450> much<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.810> I'm<00:04:54.960> on

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990

you<00:05:19.470> know<00:05:19.710> should<00:05:19.979> synthetic<00:05:20.460> it's<00:05:20.610> not

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
you know should synthetic it's not

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.160 
you know should synthetic it's not
really<00:05:21.000> going<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.210> last

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
really going to last

check it out if you start seeing that

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.760 
check it out if you start seeing that
you<00:06:00.060> you<00:06:00.420> know<00:06:00.540> it's<00:06:00.810> too<00:06:00.960> messy<00:06:01.140> for<00:06:01.500> you<00:06:01.530> or
