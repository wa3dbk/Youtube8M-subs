explodes quite a bit from afar range

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
explodes quite a bit from afar range
it's<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.620> effective<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.489> you're

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's not so effective but if you're

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
it's not so effective but if you're
doing<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.840> yourself<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> can't

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
doing it right on top yourself you can't

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.209 
doing it right on top yourself you can't
get<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.430> good<00:00:56.610> effective<00:00:57.300> damage<00:00:57.949> besm<00:00:58.949> pub

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
get some good effective damage besm pub

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.630 
get some good effective damage besm pub
stomps<00:00:59.670> i<00:00:59.760> guess<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.640> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
stomps i guess kind of like this and you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.920 
stomps i guess kind of like this and you
see<00:01:02.960> some<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> stealth<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.630> stealth

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
see some of the stealth this the stealth

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
see some of the stealth this the stealth
with<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> thief<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> pretty<00:01:08.790> solid<00:01:09.950> obviously

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
with the thief is pretty solid obviously

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
with the thief is pretty solid obviously
it<00:01:11.040> doesn't<00:01:11.280> last<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.880> long<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.630> quite

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it doesn't last very long that's quite

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.420 
it doesn't last very long that's quite
the<00:01:13.140> problem<00:01:13.710> another<00:01:14.490> issue<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
the problem another issue with it is

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
the problem another issue with it is
when<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> break<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> stealth<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.750> when

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
when you break out of stealth or when

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.690 
when you break out of stealth or when
you<00:01:19.110> hit<00:01:19.259> someone<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.920> stealth<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you hit someone out of stealth you have

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.060 
you hit someone out of stealth you have
a<00:01:20.970> short<00:01:21.420> immunity<00:01:21.960> i<00:01:21.990> believe<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.680> three

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
a short immunity i believe it's a three

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
a short immunity i believe it's a three
second<00:01:23.580> immunity<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
second immunity and that kind of

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.100 
second immunity and that kind of
complicates<00:01:25.979> things<00:01:26.360> see<00:01:27.360> some<00:01:27.659> there's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
complicates things see some there's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.390 
complicates things see some there's
there's<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> stealth<00:01:28.770> they're<00:01:28.979> obviously

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
there's a stealth they're obviously

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700 
there's a stealth they're obviously
stealth<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.240> good<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> defensive

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
stealth is very good for a defensive

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
stealth is very good for a defensive
ability<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:33.030> can't<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.720> hit<00:01:33.900> while<00:01:34.110> in

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
ability you can't be hit while in

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.270 
ability you can't be hit while in
stealth<00:01:34.729> some<00:01:35.729> stealths<00:01:36.210> cleanse<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
stealth some stealths cleanse the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.179 
stealth some stealths cleanse the
obviously<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> heel<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.259> thief<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.590> also<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
obviously the heel and thief is also a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.999 
obviously the heel and thief is also a
condition<00:01:42.000> removal<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> full

condition removal not not a full

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
condition removal not not a full
condition<00:01:44.520> removal<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.780> helps<00:01:46.170> quite

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
condition removal but if it helps quite

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.100 
condition removal but if it helps quite
a<00:01:46.530> bit<00:01:46.799> looks<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:47.850> got<00:01:47.880> another<00:01:48.299> thief

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
a bit looks like they got another thief

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
a bit looks like they got another thief
on<00:01:49.290> their<00:01:49.500> team<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.890> well<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> similar

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
on their team as well with the similar

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.520 
on their team as well with the similar
build<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.060> choices<00:01:54.329> i<00:01:54.659> picked<00:01:54.990> with

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
build and the the choices i picked with

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.749 
build and the the choices i picked with
this<00:01:55.770> build<00:01:56.159> were<00:01:57.290> basically<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.740> give<00:01:59.280> me<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
this build were basically to give me the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.230 
this build were basically to give me the
most<00:01:59.939> else<00:02:00.270> possible<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:02.000> maximize<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
most else possible not to maximize the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959 
most else possible not to maximize the
damage<00:02:03.450> i<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> stealth<00:02:04.969> granted

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
damage i can do with the stealth granted

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.270 
damage i can do with the stealth granted
it<00:02:06.090> does<00:02:06.509> pretty<00:02:06.810> decent<00:02:07.200> damage<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.770> i<00:02:08.069> will

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it does pretty decent damage all i will

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.529 
it does pretty decent damage all i will
say<00:02:08.429> that

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
say that

but<00:02:40.139> it<00:02:40.439> can<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.859> kind<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.639> difficult<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:42.450> get

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599

someone<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:56.099> long<00:02:56.280> enough<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.939> you<00:02:57.510> see

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
someone for long enough like if you see

you see a thief near you and stealth
it's<00:03:04.049> very<00:03:04.349> easy<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:05.189> reposition<00:03:06.030> yourself<00:03:06.389> to

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
it's very easy to reposition yourself to

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.460 
it's very easy to reposition yourself to
evade<00:03:08.189> that<00:03:08.489> backstab<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.900> only<00:03:10.139> time

evade that backstab now the only time
this<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.859> an<00:03:10.980> exception<00:03:11.669> is<00:03:11.879> when<00:03:11.939> you<00:03:12.480> steal

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
this is an exception is when you steal

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.460 
this is an exception is when you steal
so<00:03:14.280> if<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.579> do<00:03:14.819> plan<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.419> make<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.599> practical

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
so if you do plan to make a practical

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.689 
so if you do plan to make a practical
thief<00:03:16.709> build<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.400> would<00:03:17.940> definitely<00:03:18.120> suggest

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
thief build I would definitely suggest

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.800 
thief build I would definitely suggest
working<00:03:20.699> with<00:03:20.879> your<00:03:21.120> your<00:03:21.659> steal<00:03:22.079> more<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:23.810> may

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
working with your your steal more it may

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.140 
working with your your steal more it may
be<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.079> necessarily<00:03:25.709> going<00:03:25.919> fully<00:03:26.430> down<00:03:26.760> your

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
be not necessarily going fully down your

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.979 
be not necessarily going fully down your
tray<00:03:27.540> tree<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.079> get<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.440> stealth<00:03:28.949> steal<00:03:29.989> that

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
tray tree to get that stealth steal that

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.089 
tray tree to get that stealth steal that
with<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.530> beta<00:03:31.949> weekend<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.609> they<00:03:32.849> moved<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
with the beta weekend to they moved the

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.860 
with the beta weekend to they moved the
stealth<00:03:35.099> when<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.430> steal<00:03:35.729> down<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.449> last

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
stealth when you steal down to the last

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.259 
stealth when you steal down to the last
year<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.500> it's<00:03:37.620> pretty<00:03:38.010> difficult<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.849> pick<00:03:39.060> up

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
year so it's pretty difficult to pick up

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.740 
year so it's pretty difficult to pick up
in<00:03:39.479> a<00:03:39.540> lot<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.810> builds<00:03:40.199> most<00:03:41.129> builds<00:03:41.549> just<00:03:42.030> kind

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
in a lot of builds most builds just kind

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.259 
in a lot of builds most builds just kind
of<00:03:42.810> will<00:03:42.959> forego<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.370> go<00:03:44.579> with<00:03:44.729> more

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
of will forego that and go with more

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.899 
of will forego that and go with more
damaging<00:03:46.019> attacks<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.889> definitely<00:03:47.579> agree

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
damaging attacks and I definitely agree

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.180 
damaging attacks and I definitely agree
in<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.329> more<00:03:48.780> competitive<00:03:49.139> atmosphere<00:03:49.620> that

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
in a more competitive atmosphere that

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.539 
in a more competitive atmosphere that
would<00:03:50.609> be<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:51.090> way<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.239> go<00:03:51.889> but<00:03:52.889> like<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.489> said

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
would be the way to go but like I said

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.270 
would be the way to go but like I said
my<00:03:53.939> goal<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.510> was<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.870> give<00:03:55.709> me<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.099> most

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
my goal for this was to give me the most

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.240 
my goal for this was to give me the most
amount<00:03:56.579> of<00:03:56.729> stealth<00:03:57.060> as<00:03:57.540> possible<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.470> I'd

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
amount of stealth as possible and I'd

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.689 
amount of stealth as possible and I'd
say<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.819> does<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:01.680> can<00:04:01.859> kind<00:04:02.099> of<00:04:02.220> see<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
say it does that you can kind of see the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.449 
say it does that you can kind of see the
the<00:04:03.599> gameplay<00:04:04.139> style<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.739> build<00:04:04.979> like<00:04:05.189> this

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
the gameplay style of a build like this

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.319 
the gameplay style of a build like this
though<00:04:05.729> it's<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:07.079> other<00:04:07.349> games<00:04:07.650> with<00:04:08.370> thief's

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
though it's in other games with thief's

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.780 
though it's in other games with thief's
or<00:04:09.629> rogues<00:04:09.989> you're<00:04:10.379> gonna<00:04:10.530> just<00:04:11.370> kind<00:04:11.699> of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
or rogues you're gonna just kind of

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.490 
or rogues you're gonna just kind of
skulk<00:04:12.120> around<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.569> outskirts<00:04:12.930> or<00:04:13.199> whatever

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500

your stealth you come in you open on

your stealth you come in you open on
someone<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.709> burst<00:04:17.340> them<00:04:17.579> down<00:04:17.789> not

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
someone and you burst them down not

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.899 
someone and you burst them down not
really<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.409> case<00:04:19.620> here<00:04:19.979> there<00:04:20.549> are<00:04:20.700> times

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
really the case here there are times

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.760 
really the case here there are times
when<00:04:21.389> you<00:04:21.510> do<00:04:21.750> do<00:04:21.930> that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
when you do do that
