00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
and I had some stem cell anti-aging

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.990 
and I had some stem cell anti-aging
procedure<00:00:15.530> done<00:00:15.769> in<00:00:15.889> January<00:00:16.429> here<00:00:16.910> in

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:22.249 
that's a good question i think we're the

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:27.009 
that's a good question i think we're the
28<00:00:23.150> of<00:00:23.659> the<00:00:24.349> 29th<00:00:24.769> may<00:00:25.159> 2009<00:00:26.149> so<00:00:26.659> we're<00:00:26.869> about

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
28 of the 29th may 2009 so we're about

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.569 
28 of the 29th may 2009 so we're about
five<00:00:27.409> months<00:00:27.589> out<00:00:27.800> since<00:00:28.069> your<00:00:28.220> procedure

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
five months out since your procedure

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.120 
five months out since your procedure
yeah<00:00:29.179> four<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:29.659> a<00:00:29.720> half<00:00:29.749> to<00:00:30.019> five<00:00:30.199> months<00:00:30.560> ok

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
yeah four and a half to five months ok

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.030 
yeah four and a half to five months ok
and<00:00:31.369> where<00:00:31.550> did<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.789> stem<00:00:32.029> cells<00:00:32.270> come<00:00:32.540> from

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
and where did the stem cells come from

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.350 
and where did the stem cells come from
the<00:00:34.040> stem<00:00:34.220> cells<00:00:34.460> are<00:00:34.640> actually<00:00:34.850> came<00:00:35.149> to<00:00:35.180> my

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
the stem cells are actually came to my

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.290 
the stem cells are actually came to my
own<00:00:35.450> body<00:00:35.660> they<00:00:35.960> came<00:00:36.170> from<00:00:36.350> my<00:00:36.560> big<00:00:36.740> section

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
own body they came from my big section

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.740 
own body they came from my big section
and<00:00:38.500> they<00:00:39.730> extracted<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.000> stem<00:00:41.180> cells<00:00:41.480> and

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
and they extracted the stem cells and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.300 
and they extracted the stem cells and
after<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:42.410> did<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:42.770> they<00:00:42.950> were<00:00:43.010> then

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
after that it did that they were then

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.300 
after that it did that they were then
treated<00:00:44.090> they<00:00:44.360> were<00:00:44.420> spun<00:00:45.380> and<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.950> good<00:00:46.100> set<00:00:46.280> of

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
treated they were spun and a good set of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.120 
treated they were spun and a good set of
stem<00:00:46.520> cells<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:46.850> take<00:00:47.060> it<00:00:47.180> out<00:00:48.070> um<00:00:50.920> how<00:00:51.920> did<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
stem cells to take it out um how did the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.040 
stem cells to take it out um how did the
procedure<00:00:52.310> go<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:53.030> thought<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.780> procedure

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
procedure go I thought the procedure

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.210 
procedure go I thought the procedure
went<00:00:54.320> very<00:00:54.350> well<00:00:54.820> I<00:00:55.820> had<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:56.570> little<00:00:56.870> extra

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
went very well I had a little extra

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.180 
went very well I had a little extra
light<00:00:58.220> liposuction<00:00:58.430> done<00:00:59.150> at<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.420> same<00:00:59.630> time

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
light liposuction done at the same time

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.030 
light liposuction done at the same time
and<00:01:01.190> as<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.460> result<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.880> that<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:03.170> was<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.920> have

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
and as a result of that that was to have

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.580 
and as a result of that that was to have
my<00:01:04.070> Victoria<00:01:04.909> area<00:01:05.239> fixed<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.840> as<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.439> result

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
my Victoria area fixed and as a result

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.410 
my Victoria area fixed and as a result
of<00:01:06.799> that<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.189> probably<00:01:07.759> had<00:01:07.939> a<00:01:07.969> little<00:01:08.240> longer

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
of that it probably had a little longer

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.289 
of that it probably had a little longer
recovery<00:01:08.929> time<00:01:09.340> because<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.369> had<00:01:10.969> to<00:01:11.090> wear<00:01:11.270> a

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
recovery time because I had to wear a

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.300 
recovery time because I had to wear a
belt<00:01:11.869> around<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.350> for<00:01:12.560> for<00:01:12.950> about<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.130> month

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
belt around that for for about a month

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.870 
belt around that for for about a month
or<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:13.579> but<00:01:14.390> generally<00:01:14.990> once<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:16.100> once<00:01:16.429> that

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
or so but generally once the once that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.480 
or so but generally once the once that
was<00:01:17.619> recovery<00:01:18.619> period<00:01:18.889> is<00:01:18.979> over<00:01:19.069> everything

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
was recovery period is over everything

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.010 
was recovery period is over everything
seemed<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.729> be<00:01:19.819> very<00:01:19.880> very<00:01:20.119> good<00:01:20.299> I<00:01:20.689> seen<00:01:20.990> that

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
seemed to be very very good I seen that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.289 
seemed to be very very good I seen that
more<00:01:21.289> energy<00:01:21.670> how<00:01:22.670> long<00:01:22.850> did<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.090> procedure

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
more energy how long did the procedure

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.679 
more energy how long did the procedure
tape<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:25.100> think<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:25.880> procedure<00:01:26.210> took<00:01:26.450> about

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
tape I think the procedure took about

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.510 
tape I think the procedure took about
three<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.170> four<00:01:27.439> hours<00:01:27.889> I<00:01:28.899> arrived<00:01:30.520> relatively

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
three to four hours I arrived relatively

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.669 
three to four hours I arrived relatively
early<00:01:31.639> did<00:01:31.939> some<00:01:32.119> questionnaires<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:32.929> things

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
early did some questionnaires and things

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.010 
early did some questionnaires and things
of<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:33.829> nature<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:35.030> then<00:01:35.209> had<00:01:35.509> a<00:01:35.539> bit<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:35.899> a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
of this nature and then had a bit of a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.599 
of this nature and then had a bit of a
wait<00:01:36.229> just<00:01:36.709> a<00:01:36.829> cube<00:01:37.569> and<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:39.770> when<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.280> when

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
wait just a cube and then when the when

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:41.739 
wait just a cube and then when the when
they<00:01:40.729> actually<00:01:40.880> putting<00:01:41.299> these<00:01:41.479> stem<00:01:41.719> cells

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
they actually putting these stem cells

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:45.069 
they actually putting these stem cells
back<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.469> by<00:01:42.679> IV<00:01:43.100> drip<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:44.479> took<00:01:44.749> quite<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.990> while

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
back in by IV drip it took quite a while

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.109 
back in by IV drip it took quite a while
which<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.920> good<00:01:46.219> I<00:01:46.249> understand<00:01:46.819> that<00:01:46.999> the

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
which is good I understand that the

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.639 
which is good I understand that the
longer<00:01:47.299> it<00:01:47.450> takes<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.689> win<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.229> better

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
longer it takes to win that the better

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.249 
longer it takes to win that the better
it<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.189> so<00:01:49.819> I<00:01:50.029> think<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.509> total<00:01:50.840> situated

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
it is and so I think the total situated

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.609 
it is and so I think the total situated
in<00:01:51.350> about<00:01:51.499> four<00:01:51.799> hours<00:01:51.829> start<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.520> finish<00:01:53.619> have

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
in about four hours start to finish have

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.919 
in about four hours start to finish have
you<00:01:54.740> seen<00:01:54.950> any<00:01:55.189> anti-aging<00:01:56.149> benefits<00:01:56.719> app

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
you seen any anti-aging benefits app

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.550 
you seen any anti-aging benefits app
since<00:01:57.499> you<00:01:57.679> had<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
since you had the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800 
since you had the
stem<00:01:58.860> cell<00:01:59.130> procedure<00:01:59.520> I've<00:02:00.210> noticed<00:02:00.689> some

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
stem cell procedure I've noticed some

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.609 
stem cell procedure I've noticed some
changes<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.229> my<00:02:01.350> body<00:02:02.420> one<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:03.960> my<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
changes in my body one is that my I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.039 
changes in my body one is that my I
think<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.670> body<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.090> secreting<00:02:06.869> more

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
think that my body is secreting more
