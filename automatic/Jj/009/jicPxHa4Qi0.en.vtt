00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.579
 O's here

 you see she has a team on 4 4 2 and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.570
 not in this line has a 4 4 2 4 3 3 is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.070
 this here what would this training 4 4 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.939
 2 is the famous formation of the ultimate 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 team that one 4 12 12 only she comes 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.689
 with 442 aquino seasons' so let's go 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.049
 back here sharing and what I 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.039
 I usually do here I play with Pepe and 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.039
 View Sergio's full profile to ... 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:18.400
 Certain oak is cardinal. I think they touched me. 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.610
 then sought beauty both sides 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.240
 cope with marcelo zaga pepe ramos cross 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.950
 of steering wheel and right middle javi 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.350
 Rodriguez on the left 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.430
 modric in the middle and benzema and ronaldo in the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.470
 attack 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.310
 you see that there is a very strong line 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.190
 huh 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.400
 because I'd rather play with him and I'd 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.010
 and a rmr guys playing at the tips 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.690
 why keep position on the sides right 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.340
 if you do not like to go up a lot 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500
 attack I come at the most here 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.100
 half -field with the lateral and 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.800
 automatically it does not go up by tac 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.620
 he does not come back to save position 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.550
 because the game is in the counter tactic 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.230
 attack 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.610
 I'll be showing you here. 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.580
 further on 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:09.100
 I edit the players here in this 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.530
 part of instructions is one to implement 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.790
 here I do not stay here, I think it was 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.200
 very cool that also had the 14 most 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.750
 a different way we will see here in the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.920
 Pressing the defensive pressure press the 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.709
 Short defense is the footsteps of rival 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.480
 basic low defensive support and I do not 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.250
 I put the two attackers to press 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.500
 the defense 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:40.209
 sure the offensive and offensive midfield 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.750
 that never goes ahead with 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:48.760
 your team attacks or advance I put 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:55.209
 certain support to the centers is 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.970
 which is balanced enter the area by 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.390
 such as playing with socks does not 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:07.209
 leaves 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:09.040
 so I also balance the tips 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.600
 on the right and left end I leave 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.610
 everything is not balanced, do not stay both 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.729
 It's that I leave balanced people 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.979
 the sides is important attack is 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:25.110
 offensive careers occasionally runs 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.110
 when your team has the opportunity 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.840
 always leave the side forward or 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.999
 never go to attack with your team 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.639
 attack and I leave so I leave both 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:38.289
 this way you 'll never miss it when 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.120
 his team attacks that he did not pass the 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.509
 midfield because the game is not against 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.999
 attack and the defender never goes ahead 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.310
 When your team attacks I leave the 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:51.849
 two so they do not rise otherwise 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.460
 It's the same thing david luiz sees when 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.080
 game it seemed brother davi luiza almost all 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.229
 Time is in the area, I do not know. 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.990
 do what I do not then I leave here 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.659
 never goes ahead with your team attacks 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.330
 in the two states is because otherwise the 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:10.689
 backs up just in closing 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.669
 in you and in the expensive tactic this here was 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.680
 thing to put here on fifa 15 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.069
 that helped a lot 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.520
 I always play this counterattack. 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.749
 guys okay so I put here against 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.789
 attack 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:28.029
 then you can see the details of the tactic 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:31.180
 It's really cool, I thought it was a 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:36.879
 well-balanced tactic because we and 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.979
 played at speed 95 passes 50 and 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.110
 placement of the organized team that 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.419
 tell that the team 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.089
 each one will play in their position is not 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.159
 100 exchanging position with no player 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.620
 then each one plays in the upright position 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:56.349
 of the training that you put in the team 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:59.610
 50 passes 50 50 shots and 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:04.149
 organized placement as well as 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.310
 pressure 10 aggressiveness 50 then it is 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:10.180
 half will not go up much line 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.849
 defensive 60 team ranch and line 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.569
 defensive by coverage then the 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:20.680
 defender does not play online and when 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:23.879
 you take a dribble on defending others 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.589
 defender have already covered that 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:28.270
 mate who was dribbled 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.589
 if you do not want to play in these 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.409
 pre-defined 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.979
 you can also customize here 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.719
 guys 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.129
 That's it , I 'll make one. 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:37.760

 This is it people this is a tactic that I 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.180
 I've been playing here with Real Madrid already 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.360
 I'm in the third division and Mexico 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.010
