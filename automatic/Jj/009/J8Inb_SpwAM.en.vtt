00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 how are you doing, I regret that you can not 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.680
 shoot the back of cameras as a 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.410
 miserable manga which is today in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 the study but let's work a little 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.280
 more serious because painters are re 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920
 Serious today what we are going to do is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.539
 I brought a mini of these 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.750
 sample of silverware to go 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.779
 seeing this is a dwarf beruti is not a 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.730
 big beruti like the ones I paint 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.189
 let's go to the subject of painting for 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 advance time I put them here the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.200
 colors that we are going to comb after the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.469
 this is how it prepared a gray made the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.149
 black white and a little bit of ultramarine blue 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.910
 it started by putting white on the sides 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.090
 gray gray here also because I have a 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.520
 gray light reflection with natural sienna the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.730
 which is brown oak poop 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.130
 gray with black and natural shadow that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.860
 curie ximo after bristle brush 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:01.950
 soft comb the white 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.950
 the union of white and gray reigned 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.350
 then the union of gray with silt 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.860
 natural 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.800
 I can not go back because if I do not know 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.070
 tie the colors 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.370
 and I always keep in mind that metals 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.740
 work by reflexes would be ideal 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.560
 I could put light gray to a whole 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.420
 silver pot and I will stay but not 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.810
 that's how they work as a mirror of everything 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.960
 that is around then if I 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.510
 had for example on the side 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.070
 left that is this 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.820
 a red apple down here here would have 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.820
 a red reflection 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.289
 here I already have the colors the union of 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.670
 the colors is formed enough 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.950
 as to reveal the edge with the edge 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.560
 of the brush and the little prolixity that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.720
 can have a tax on that the cup 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.320
 have 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.490
 a hard cinnamon here what I do is not 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.570
 clean the brush I tear softly in the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.250
 dark part and the dark one runs me up 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.050
 that side and it's already 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.950
 How many minutes do I have left, lady? 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.920
 conductive a lot we're good we're going to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.890
 do a little bit here of distributing 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.250
 colors for you to see the white 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.180
 I messed up porcine on camera does not come out 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.180
 I put white 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.930
 I put the gray light 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.780
 see how the reflections continue 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.689
 the volume of the piece that I'm 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.450
 painting in the goblet of the cup were like that 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:59.500
 and so here will follow the drop shape 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 what's wrong with it 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.400
 that part of the cup that's called steel 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.000
 and that we say well 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.310
 and it's all complete and astiles this 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.819
 piece that holds it we go to the brush 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.819
 soft 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.160
 and here they will see how messed 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.100
 something that I did not realize I forgot about 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.980
 put paint on a piece that is this 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.930
 what dark 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.829
 and how time is left over 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.349
 I tell you the next time I can 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.420
 come to record I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.069
 bronze that is exactly the same but with 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.140
 a single trap that I do not plan to tell 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.140
 until you show them 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.780
 you still can not appear the light 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.760
 is not I do not want you to feel bad 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.820
 you always remember that white does not 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.520
 is covered then if I want 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.000
 shine I have to give the brushstroke and 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.000
 leave it
