00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.050
 millas a konichiwa raging on health 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.590
 sport h obvious and for games 'guide' as 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.420
 you took place 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.160
 and I find you today for a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.790
 video on ff xiv begins to have 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
 the habit 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.070
 and today I will talk to you in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.340
 this video is dice and inherit 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.810
 that's because we have a quest that we 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.980
 explains quickly done like in water related to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.330
 a summer punctuated with two small three 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.769
 stuff that's nice to know and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.720
 time we miss anyway in 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.769
 the first hours of play then them and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.610
 inherit it's what's it for 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.140
 terrible it's just 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
 tp points so you know the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.950
 stone of foci past exactly the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.239
 same concept 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 the peculiarity of slag heaps 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.000
 that we click you right once 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 on the first time you fall 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.579
 on it you will synchronize with 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.340
 if you want to be able to use the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.870
 slag hoses have to sync with until then 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.570
 it's normal normally you have it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.800
 made in the first minutes of play 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.210
 another thing to know that with 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 the and inherits it is that you can 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.600
 save the point of return and in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.090
 done if you save the point of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.809
 back like this here it allows you 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.280
 to use this little spell on the bottom right 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 that's with the little house that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.390
 is called repatriation actually that you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.250
 lets you tv for free and 8 on 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.619
 this war 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.909
 so that's not bad to do when 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.799
 you will go back and forth in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.270
 in a capital like that went to 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.670
 foot then hop to come back quickly and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 it's free 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 otherwise you can do something else 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.710
 save as favorite place 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.740
 it will allow you to take it out in the lead 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.960
 list on the list of tp and yes and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.270
 precisely when we talk about tp there is the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 teleportation which is on the first 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 line here is here and when you click 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.210
 above you have a story begins 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.560
 to have a lot that allow you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.939
 just you see the day one who 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.229
 favored a small canvas beside it 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.909
 allow will be find happening like 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.439
 you notice one that is not a card 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.970
 what appears but it's the list 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.170
 with names and that's where you go 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.299
 learn as ff xiv be a good 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.310
 memory because you have to memorize everything 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.850
 everything is done from donations of course 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.200
 it costs money and it's expensive 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.759
 seems small numbers like that but 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.659
 that's really not bad at all 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.429
 case at level 20 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.740
 so me what I advise you is 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.179
 to try to use it the minimum 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.830
 simply because especially in the 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.989
 beginnings of the game you are going to need to 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.540
 a lot of jls higgins and 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.519
 unfortunately it does not flow 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.640
 so it's better to try 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.959
 to save a little his sous so that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.340
 it's really the basics normally the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.180
 most people know it but good if 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.560
 you never went to 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.269
 side is always good to know 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.590
 another thing you need to know is 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.440
 that and inherits in capitals in 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.209
 actually allow to teleport to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.410
 the interest of the capital so you 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.120
 from outside a city where since 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.500
 the teleportation menu you can not to 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.239
 you can not access it 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.549
 music man you tp on big crystals 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.440
 like that now if you click 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.510
 on sucking letteri two 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.069
 main click on networks of 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.930
 ethereal urban transport and there you 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.400
 have and have been dtp inside even 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.440
 the city or again it's just 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.730
 the names anyway the names of the du 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.599
 remarkable place of remarkable area 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.730
 the closest 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.290
 so for example if we want this summer 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.579
 reported to the miners guild on 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.079
 click on minor equality and that we 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.069
 teleport directly on top of that which 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.230
 would come to do 14 is that the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.370
 loads are quite short I think 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.049
 that it's for everyone else was eating 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.329
 not a ssd is where you you 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.069
 unearth it's next to them the 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.930
 territories ben here are the three 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.230
 capitals in circles and you must not hesitate 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.120
 to abuse because it's free ehret 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.069
 so it's not bad to use it at 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.120
 maximum and it's good to know him because 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.109
 that there are unfortunately some 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.519
 people passing by 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.569
 the history of the urban network of slag heaps 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.489
 and who suddenly spend their time 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.319
 run with the little pitt source like 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.389
 that's it so it's a bit close 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.609
 then I remind you if you want 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.079
 to know where they fall and 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.480
 terry ben you see a little drawing 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.530
 blue the shape of the territories ben and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.000
 you usually have a place 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.079
 remarkable there are so are written on the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.400
 map so that usually fits 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.260
 the nearest camshafts in 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.769
 anyway the ski generally will you 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.959

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.060
 and of course it's already over friends 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.280
