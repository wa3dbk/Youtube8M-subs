like a major muscle group with a smaller
muscle<00:03:02.030> group<00:03:02.360> for<00:03:02.660> example<00:03:02.740> chest<00:03:03.740> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010

triceps or chest and biceps or so
there's<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.420> many<00:03:08.540> different<00:03:08.660> methods<00:03:09.020> what<00:03:09.740> i

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
there's so many different methods what i

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.750 
there's so many different methods what i
would<00:03:09.950> do<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.630> try<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:11.960> method<00:03:12.350> one<00:03:13.160> split<00:03:13.550> and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
would do is try one method one split and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.060 
would do is try one method one split and
do<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.330> for<00:03:14.630> about<00:03:14.780> six<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.500> eight<00:03:15.530> weeks<00:03:15.650> and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
do that for about six to eight weeks and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.430 
do that for about six to eight weeks and
then<00:03:16.730> see<00:03:17.120> how<00:03:17.239> your<00:03:17.390> body<00:03:17.570> changes<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.410> how

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
then see how your body changes and how

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.340 
then see how your body changes and how
your<00:03:18.709> body<00:03:19.060> adapts<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.450> then<00:03:20.690> make

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
your body adapts to it and then make

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.410 
your body adapts to it and then make
another<00:03:21.560> adjustment<00:03:21.770> see<00:03:22.520> how<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:22.970> changeup

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
another adjustment see how that changeup

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.410 
another adjustment see how that changeup
helps<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.770> it's<00:03:25.010> Oh<00:03:25.220> trial<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.120> error<00:03:26.300> and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
helps so it's Oh trial and error and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.080 
helps so it's Oh trial and error and
personal<00:03:27.200> preference<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.489> also<00:03:28.640> depends

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
personal preference and it also depends

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.160 
personal preference and it also depends

you<00:04:12.080> I<00:04:12.350> would<00:04:12.739> try<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:12.950> focus<00:04:13.459> on<00:04:13.959> getting<00:04:14.959> as

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
you I would try to focus on getting as

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.170 
you I would try to focus on getting as
much<00:04:15.320> sleep<00:04:15.380> as<00:04:15.800> you<00:04:15.890> can<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.400> know<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.000> work

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
much sleep as you can and know you work

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.390 
much sleep as you can and know you work
a<00:04:17.330> lot<00:04:17.510> but<00:04:17.750> sleep<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.590> so<00:04:18.830> important<00:04:19.370> because

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
a lot but sleep is so important because

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.260 
a lot but sleep is so important because
that's<00:04:19.700> when<00:04:19.850> your<00:04:19.970> body<00:04:20.150> recovers<00:04:20.830> to

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
that's when your body recovers to

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.159 
that's when your body recovers to
decrease<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.390> amount<00:04:23.450> of<00:04:23.630> cardio<00:04:23.840> you're

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
decrease the amount of cardio you're

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:24.850 
decrease the amount of cardio you're
doing

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
doing

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.999

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
2 30 to 45 minutes maybe five times a

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.640 
2 30 to 45 minutes maybe five times a
week<00:04:28.189> and<00:04:28.370> replace<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.389> time<00:04:29.659> that<00:04:30.500> you're

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
week and replace the time that you're

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.070 
week and replace the time that you're
not<00:04:30.830> doing<00:04:31.099> cardio<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.750> do<00:04:32.750> your<00:04:32.900> weight

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
not doing cardio and do your weight

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.439 
not doing cardio and do your weight
training<00:04:33.439> so<00:04:33.800> for<00:04:34.039> you<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.610> would<00:04:35.180> recommend

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
training so for you I would recommend

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.290 
training so for you I would recommend
doing<00:04:35.710> more<00:04:36.710> time<00:04:36.979> with<00:04:37.159> the<00:04:37.250> weights<00:04:37.460> less

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
doing more time with the weights less

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.420 
doing more time with the weights less
time<00:04:38.599> with<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.960> cardio<00:04:39.349> more<00:04:40.009> muscle<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.340> have

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
time with a cardio more muscle you have

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.700 
time with a cardio more muscle you have
the<00:04:40.849> faster<00:04:41.180> metabolism<00:04:41.330> is<00:04:41.840> going<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.020> be<00:04:42.110> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
the faster metabolism is going to be the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.869 
the faster metabolism is going to be the
more<00:04:42.919> body<00:04:43.069> fit<00:04:43.280> you're<00:04:43.400> going<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.580> burn<00:04:43.699> on<00:04:43.849> a

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
more body fit you're going to burn on a

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.320 
more body fit you're going to burn on a
consistent<00:04:44.210> basis<00:04:44.979> and<00:04:45.979> also<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:47.030> need<00:04:47.180> to

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
consistent basis and also you need to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.929 
consistent basis and also you need to
increase<00:04:47.569> your<00:04:47.719> calories<00:04:48.139> 1100<00:04:48.889> calories<00:04:49.069> for

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:49.939 
increase your calories 1100 calories for

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.999 
increase your calories 1100 calories for
someone<00:04:50.210> who's<00:04:50.389> 140<00:04:51.080> pounds<00:04:51.439> is<00:04:51.560> not<00:04:51.770> enough

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
someone who's 140 pounds is not enough

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.969 
someone who's 140 pounds is not enough
food<00:04:52.250> so<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.909> would<00:04:53.360> gradually<00:04:54.349> increase<00:04:54.800> that

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
food so I would gradually increase that

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.279 
food so I would gradually increase that
you<00:04:55.280> know<00:04:55.729> but<00:04:56.330> i<00:04:56.360> wouldn't<00:04:56.719> take<00:04:56.840> in<00:04:57.020> less

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289
