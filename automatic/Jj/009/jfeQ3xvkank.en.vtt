00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.910
 for help mutual assistance 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.910
 the service of simone turchetti 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.080
 I practically always had a weight at 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.960
 stomach but a weight in the stomach 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.660
 important because in the evening not 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.939
 I could still have dinner 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.189
 the lunch food he didn't have 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.539
 was suggested to Rosanna eight years ago was 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.970
 diagnosed with stomach cancer 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.109
 after the removal operation 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.760
 of the organ his life has changed and has 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.830
 decided to share his experience 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.700
 on facebook with other people fighting 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.500
 with the disease 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.540
 we have a facebook group called 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.350
 live after stomach cancer yes 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 can he 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.520
 I opened it three years ago when I was 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 I realized that on the internet 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.510
 there were practically no associations 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.550
 of support for patients operated on 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.500
 stomach so I got the idea of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 create this group and over time it is 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.340
 in fact this cancer has grown 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.750
 unfortunately it is quite rare 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.000
 a tumor that generally does not give 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.770
 warning signs and then you arrive 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.390
 to late diagnosis compromising 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 the possibilities of overcoming the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.760
 disease 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.530
 from this point of view there are the data 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
 collected from the Italian group about 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.040
 of research on gastric cancer that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.130
 brings together 20 Italian centers 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.229
 specialized the evolution of therapies 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.000
 proceeds today there are new protocols 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.070
 doctors available 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.799
 First the so-called therapies has 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.689
 or adjuvant ie chemotherapy la 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.880
 radiotherapy to be administered first 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.340
 of the intervention in order to reduce the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 tumor mass to be removed the second 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.930
 treatment protocol provides 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.750
 the use of chemo hyperthermia 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 intraperitoneal or ipad which consists 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.159
 in 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.470
 when administering circulate 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.080
 inside the abdominal cavity to the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.630
 end of the intervention a solution 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.530
 containing high chemotherapy 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.040
 dosage at a temperature of 41 43 degrees 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.940
 in order to treat the micro 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.700
 peritoneal dissemination of the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.740
 disease which is the main cause of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 treatment failure in these 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.729
 stage 3 patients when the tumor 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 it is small and is found in the early stages of 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.420
 disease the mini approach is possible 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.979
 invasive with robotic surgery e 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.479
 laparoscopic 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.280
 however, these are situations that go 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.019
 carefully evaluated by the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.100
 surgeons not to compromise the 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.690
 healing 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.580
 in other cases there is a need for 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.890
 more incisive interventions when the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.540
 injury at the top and then we are forced 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.700
 to remove all the organ when 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.769
 instead the lesson and tax can be 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.500
 safeguard a part and therefore 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.269
 perform a partial gastrectomy in the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.070
 patients in whom one was removed 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.860
 patients only part of the stomach 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.000
 they adapt quite quickly in the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.480
 within 5 6 months 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.890
 take up eating habits 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.750
 normal in patients where it comes 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.760
 all the stomach removed 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.850
 the recovery is a little slower because 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.049
 no need to make small meals 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.640
 split during the day 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.560
 precisely because of these difficulties it is 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.269
 need to share experiences with 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.220
 other people compare with others 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.769
 people operate very useful to have 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.110
 maybe tips tips for 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.910
 overcome the first problems that are hard 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.890
 the survivals are currently 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.380
 the conditions are better 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.200
 of life under diagnostic conditions 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.720
 also with regard to this too 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.790
 tumor for which we hope to find 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.950
 increasingly smaller lesions that are 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.239
 those where the chance of treatment is 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.239
 certainly optimal
