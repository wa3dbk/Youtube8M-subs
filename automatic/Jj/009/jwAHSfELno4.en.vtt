00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that's gonna come out of the simple

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
that's gonna come out of the simple
seven<00:01:26.939> body<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> left<00:01:27.990> hand<00:01:28.170> side

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
seven body for the left hand side

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770 
seven body for the left hand side
actually<00:01:29.009> fairly<00:01:29.220> large<00:01:29.600> bigger<00:01:30.600> than<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
actually fairly large bigger than I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.219 
actually fairly large bigger than I
thought<00:01:31.049> anyway<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.189> they're<00:01:33.079> suppose<00:01:34.079> has

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
thought anyway so they're suppose has

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
thought anyway so they're suppose has
probably<00:01:34.500> got<00:01:35.119> bit<00:01:36.119> longer<00:01:36.390> than<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> width

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
probably got bit longer than the width

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.609 
probably got bit longer than the width
