like about this lens is that there's no

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.720 
like about this lens is that there's no

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
full time manual focus override like to

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.110 
full time manual focus override like to
say<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.000> 7200<00:03:24.840> F<00:03:25.070> 2.8<00:03:26.070> l<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.730> course<00:03:26.970> this

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
say the 7200 F 2.8 l of course this

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.810 
say the 7200 F 2.8 l of course this
isn't<00:03:27.269> an<00:03:27.450> L<00:03:27.600> lens<00:03:27.630> but<00:03:28.560> still<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.860> manual<00:03:29.430> focus

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
isn't an L lens but still a manual focus

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.610 
isn't an L lens but still a manual focus
override<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.720> nice<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:31.080> certain<00:03:31.380> times

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
override is really nice at certain times

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.949 
override is really nice at certain times
the<00:03:32.519> focusing<00:03:32.970> ring<00:03:33.090> could<00:03:33.360> get<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.600> little<00:03:33.810> bit

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the focusing ring could get a little bit

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.360 
the focusing ring could get a little bit
better<00:03:34.110> when<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.470> do<00:03:34.650> have<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.010> manual

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
better when you do have it in manual

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.250 
better when you do have it in manual
focus<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:36.630> people<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.989> are<00:03:37.080> using

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
focus and I think people that are using

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.750 
focus and I think people that are using
a<00:03:37.470> fall<00:03:37.680> focus<00:03:38.130> are<00:03:38.250> not<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:38.580> going<00:03:38.670> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
a fall focus are not really going to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.690 
a fall focus are not really going to
like<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.739> do<00:03:40.739> have<00:03:40.920> some<00:03:41.130> heavy<00:03:41.430> than

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
like it you do have some heavy than

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.759 
like it you do have some heavy than
getting<00:03:42.060> also<00:03:42.269> on<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> full<00:03:42.930> frame<00:03:43.140> camera<00:03:43.200> I

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
getting also on a full frame camera I

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.559 
getting also on a full frame camera I
could<00:03:44.220> show<00:03:44.340> some<00:03:44.640> sample<00:03:45.090> pictures<00:03:45.420> that

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
could show some sample pictures that

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.190 
could show some sample pictures that
I've<00:03:45.660> used<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.830> lens<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.550> 5d<00:03:48.510> mark<00:03:48.780> 3<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.080> you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
I've used this lens on 5d mark 3 so you

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.630 
I've used this lens on 5d mark 3 so you
could<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:49.709> can<00:03:49.830> see<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.130> vignette

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
could you can see that vignette

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.250 
could you can see that vignette
in<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> corner<00:03:51.240> from<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.450> ultra-wide<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.020> know

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
in the corner from the ultra-wide I know

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.460 
in the corner from the ultra-wide I know
but<00:03:52.470> that's<00:03:52.620> that's<00:03:53.310> par<00:03:53.610> for<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.819> course

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
but that's that's par for the course

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.020 
but that's that's par for the course
there's<00:03:55.470> no<00:03:55.680> lens<00:03:55.890> correction<00:03:56.370> profile<00:03:56.790> in

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
there's no lens correction profile in

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.540 
there's no lens correction profile in
Lightroom<00:03:57.600> for<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.080> for<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.440> because<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:59.340> is

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
Lightroom for it for it because it is

from<00:03:59.819> a<00:03:59.850> 1988<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:01.280> need<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.400> do<00:04:02.520> some<00:04:02.700> more

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
from a 1988 I need to do some more

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.510 
from a 1988 I need to do some more
research<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.420> internet<00:04:03.720> maybe<00:04:03.930> there<00:04:04.170> is

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
research on the internet maybe there is

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.770 
research on the internet maybe there is
enough<00:04:05.520> information<00:04:05.670> out<00:04:06.270> there<00:04:06.300> for<00:04:06.480> me<00:04:06.690> to

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
enough information out there for me to

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.020 
enough information out there for me to
get<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.050> right<00:04:07.260> barrel<00:04:07.620> distortion<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:08.430> all

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
get the right barrel distortion and all

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.630 
get the right barrel distortion and all
those<00:04:09.240> numbers<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:10.680> make<00:04:10.830> my<00:04:10.980> own<00:04:11.100> profile<00:04:11.490> in

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
those numbers to make my own profile in

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.970 
those numbers to make my own profile in
my<00:04:11.700> group<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.120> if<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.170> do<00:04:13.260> get<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.620> stuff

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
my group so if I do get that stuff

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.500 
my group so if I do get that stuff
together<00:04:14.100> I'll<00:04:14.640> be<00:04:14.700> sure<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.030> post<00:04:15.240> that<00:04:15.450> on
