00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
room light for thinking what

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.450

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
did I just do that I could have just

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.710 
did I just do that I could have just
wrapped<00:04:23.640> up<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.060> could<00:04:24.240> have<00:04:24.330> got<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.540> bull

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
wrapped up I could have got the bull

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.570 
wrapped up I could have got the bull
then<00:04:24.930> played<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.800> around<00:04:25.980> safely<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:26.490> the

got<00:04:42.450> bit<00:04:42.630> of<00:04:42.720> a<00:04:42.900> bit<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.710> burn<00:04:44.130> or<00:04:44.190> rash<00:04:44.580> by

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
got bit of a bit of a burn or rash by

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.850 
got bit of a bit of a burn or rash by
celebrate<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.360> time<00:04:45.600> out<00:04:45.780> there<00:04:45.930> but<00:04:46.230> we

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
celebrate on the time out there but we

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.710 
celebrate on the time out there but we
lose<00:04:47.010> that<00:04:47.040> free<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.580> which<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.360> obviously

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
lose that free to which is obviously

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.450 
lose that free to which is obviously
very<00:04:48.780> disappointing<00:04:49.560> because<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:50.070> could<00:04:50.340> have

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
very disappointing because we could have

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.130 
very disappointing because we could have
won<00:04:50.640> that<00:04:50.670> game<00:04:50.940> just<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.630> goal<00:04:51.810> at<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.050> end

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
won that game just that goal at the end

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.160 
won that game just that goal at the end
from<00:04:52.350> him<00:04:52.560> past<00:04:52.830> now<00:04:53.070> very<00:04:53.880> amateur<00:04:54.390> decision

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
from him past now very amateur decision

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.260 
from him past now very amateur decision
by<00:04:55.320> me<00:04:55.560> too<00:04:55.830> well<00:04:56.010> not<00:04:56.250> decision<00:04:56.700> but<00:04:56.880> amateur

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
by me too well not decision but amateur

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.540 
by me too well not decision but amateur
move<00:04:57.450> by<00:04:57.630> me<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.960> miss<00:04:58.170> that<00:04:58.350> but<00:04:59.220> we<00:04:59.280> did<00:04:59.400> have

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
move by me to miss that but we did have

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.640 
move by me to miss that but we did have
a<00:04:59.610> rare<00:04:59.940> dream<00:05:00.150> team<00:05:00.360> point<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.780> we<00:05:01.410> had<00:05:01.500> one

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
a rare dream team point and we had one

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.620 
a rare dream team point and we had one
of<00:05:01.740> those<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.160> I<00:05:02.190> decided<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:02.820> replace<00:05:03.390> my

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
of those so I decided to replace my

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.710 
of those so I decided to replace my
striker<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:05.160> decide<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.580> replace<00:05:05.820> forte

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
striker and I decide to replace forte

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.330 
striker and I decide to replace forte
and<00:05:06.750> you're<00:05:06.990> probably<00:05:07.140> thinking<00:05:07.350> well<00:05:07.680> you

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
and you're probably thinking well you

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.820 
and you're probably thinking well you
know<00:05:08.490> Forte's<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.360> your<00:05:09.450> best<00:05:09.630> striker<00:05:10.020> but<00:05:10.800> I

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
know Forte's of your best striker but I

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.650 
know Forte's of your best striker but I
really<00:05:11.250> really<00:05:11.550> wanted<00:05:11.940> just<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.240> boost<00:05:12.480> the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
really really wanted just to boost the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.950 
really really wanted just to boost the
chemistry<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.110> think<00:05:13.470> why<00:05:14.480> not<00:05:15.480> I've<00:05:15.630> still<00:05:15.840> got

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
chemistry I think why not I've still got

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.230 
chemistry I think why not I've still got
40<00:05:16.230> on<00:05:16.320> my<00:05:16.440> team<00:05:16.620> but<00:05:16.890> I'm<00:05:17.220> generally<00:05:17.670> good<00:05:17.790> not

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
40 on my team but I'm generally good not

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.520 
40 on my team but I'm generally good not
gonna<00:05:18.390> have<00:05:18.540> him<00:05:18.660> in<00:05:18.780> my<00:05:18.900> team<00:05:19.110> just<00:05:19.350> because

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
gonna have him in my team just because

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.470 
gonna have him in my team just because
he<00:05:19.770> doesn't<00:05:19.950> link<00:05:20.310> with<00:05:20.460> anyone<00:05:20.790> I<00:05:20.940> think

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
he doesn't link with anyone I think

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.580 
he doesn't link with anyone I think
chemistry<00:05:21.720> means<00:05:22.050> quite<00:05:22.290> a<00:05:22.320> lot<00:05:22.410> especially

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
chemistry means quite a lot especially

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.790 
chemistry means quite a lot especially
at<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.610> bronze<00:05:23.880> level<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.420> so<00:05:25.260> let<00:05:25.650> me<00:05:25.710> know
