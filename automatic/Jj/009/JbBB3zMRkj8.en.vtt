00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.130
 yes 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.269
 today I bring you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.350
 hope you like 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.279
 to start combing and dividing by watching 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.669
 the hair to the side that I get 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.669
 still 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.650
 when your hair is well combed 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.650
 you with a pin 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.180
 then apply it here and comb it we liked it 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.989
 my remaining horse give him a little bit of 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.989
 volume with lacquer and a comb 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.680
 and it's the result for a day look 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 simple and spectacular 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 do not 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.990
 you start combing your hair in a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 strainer 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.380
 and then to give them some pretty 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.549
 new the remaining hair dreams a 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.549
 little if you make two braids 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.290
 these braids the rolls around 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.850
 of changuitos and you tighten them very well 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.850
 with the necessary pins 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.250
 then with the box rule is very good 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.959
 hair that in no crime is left 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.959
 outside and they will be ready 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.840
 well as we always start by placing 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.840
 base us all over our face 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.500
 then with what this corrector for the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.500
 dark and red marks of my skin 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.130
 Then I placed myself all over my face 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.860
 then remove the exposed with a brush 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.270
 all put me a little balm 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.460
 my lips 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.220
 and everything with what is my shadow glory in 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.640
 all the eyelid mobile 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.330
 I grabbed it and placed it right next to 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.330
 of the white 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.400
 everything diffuses a little 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.599
 I grabbed that gold and put it on 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.599
 right next to the brown 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.910
 the hills 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.910
 with that golden 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.950
 and I put that combination under 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.379
 my remaining 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.069
 do not put a bar line on me 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.069
 water line 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.140
 do not put me liquid eyeliner 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.620
 I put on a lash 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.300
 made of bronze 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.300
 over apply to my cheek 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.710
 then I put this red with little touches 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.710
 on the lips 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.409
 fresh rainbow made by me and 

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:01.889
 a bag that was made in the same with a 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.889
 wreath of flowers 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.989
 combined with some color bands 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.989
 purple different 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.490
 I used a smart shirt loose one 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.940
 blue skirt with high heels 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.949
 black platform and some accessories like 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.949
 a black bracelet with a list 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.530
 do not 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.160
 the maximum 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.050
 let's start the video 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.340
 yes 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.450
 Y 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.610
 when the bed 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.610
 I think if you see 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:34.950
 for what it is since I'm recording 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:38.750

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.750
