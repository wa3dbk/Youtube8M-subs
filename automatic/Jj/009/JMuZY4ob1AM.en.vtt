00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
is pretty good it doesn't really shout

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.980

or<00:02:18.420> tangle<00:02:18.840> too<00:02:18.990> much<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.630> blend

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
or tangle too much so what I do to blend

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.199 
or tangle too much so what I do to blend
it<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.440> use<00:02:22.650> some<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.220> argan<00:02:23.970> oil

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
it and I use some of this argan oil

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:35.930 
it and I use some of this argan oil
spray<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:27.690> around<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> edges<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:34.880> then<00:02:35.880> I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
spray just around the edges and then I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:57.550 
spray just around the edges and then I
get<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.240> toothbrush<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.260> brush<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.310> in

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.809 

just<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.940> flattens<00:03:00.400> kind<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.520> combing

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
just so that it flattens kind of combing

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:42.530 
just so that it flattens kind of combing
it<00:03:01.910> through

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.050 

and<00:03:42.720> there<00:03:43.709> we<00:03:43.890> go<00:03:46.040> my<00:03:47.040> hair<00:03:47.310> was<00:03:47.579> recently

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
and there we go my hair was recently

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.360 
and there we go my hair was recently
perm<00:03:48.480> that's<00:03:48.900> why<00:03:49.170> my<00:03:49.379> edges<00:03:49.709> are<00:03:49.829> blending<00:03:50.250> in

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
perm that's why my edges are blending in

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.479 
perm that's why my edges are blending in
a<00:03:50.459> little<00:03:50.730> bit<00:03:50.849> better<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.720> does<00:03:51.989> help

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
a little bit better so that does help

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.309 
a little bit better so that does help
but<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.909> hair<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.840> could<00:03:54.989> see<00:03:55.140> up

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
but this is the hair so you could see up

I did cut in a little bit just to add a
little<00:04:29.720> bit<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:29.900> layers<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.349> frayed<00:04:30.650> my<00:04:30.770> face<00:04:30.979> a

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
little bit of layers to frayed my face a

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.760 
little bit of layers to frayed my face a
little<00:04:31.220> bit<00:04:31.370> better<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.910> might<00:04:32.569> cut<00:04:33.500> right<00:04:33.740> here

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
little bit better I might cut right here

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.950 
little bit better I might cut right here
a<00:04:33.949> little<00:04:34.160> bit<00:04:34.340> instead<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.360> pushing<00:04:35.599> it<00:04:35.810> up

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
a little bit instead of pushing it up

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.050 
a little bit instead of pushing it up
just<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.830> falls<00:04:37.340> around<00:04:37.729> my<00:04:37.849> face

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
just so that it falls around my face

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.480 
just so that it falls around my face
better<00:04:38.889> this<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:40.009> there<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:42.130> might<00:04:43.130> cut<00:04:43.310> this

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
better this is there I might cut this
