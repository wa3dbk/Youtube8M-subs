many many times and I've avoided it many
many<00:00:20.939> times<00:00:21.090> because<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.539> wasn't<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:22.020> sure

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
many times because I wasn't really sure

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.370

how<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.439> approach<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.180> course

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
how to approach it and that is of course

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.130 
how to approach it and that is of course
fantasmic<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.910> fireworks<00:00:26.910> crazy<00:00:27.420> show<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
over on Sunset Boulevard I didn't know

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.760 
over on Sunset Boulevard I didn't know
how<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> approach<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.350> had<00:00:34.559> never

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
how to approach it because I had never

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.799 
how to approach it because I had never
done<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> show<00:00:35.100> before<00:00:35.610> I've<00:00:36.000> always<00:00:36.270> revisited

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
done a show before I've always revisited

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
done a show before I've always revisited
attractions<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.489> couldn't<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
attractions and I couldn't think of a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
attractions and I couldn't think of a
way<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> revisit<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> show<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.469> without

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
way to revisit a show really without

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
way to revisit a show really without
just<00:00:40.950> sitting<00:00:41.219> down<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.550> writing<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> new

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
just sitting down and writing out a new

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
just sitting down and writing out a new
show<00:00:42.660> which<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.530> I'm<00:00:43.710> good

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
show which is not really what I'm good

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580 
show which is not really what I'm good
at<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> feel<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.870> I've<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.230> enough

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
at or do but I feel like I've got enough

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
at or do but I feel like I've got enough
of<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.800> solid<00:00:47.160> idea<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:48.000> safely<00:00:48.719> go

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
of a solid idea that I can safely go

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.970 
of a solid idea that I can safely go
ahead<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> revisit<00:00:50.570> fantasmic<00:00:51.570> now<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.860> as

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
ahead and revisit fantasmic now just as

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.110 
ahead and revisit fantasmic now just as
I<00:00:53.070> say<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.399> every<00:00:53.699> episode

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I say in every episode

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
I say in every episode
just<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:54.989> revisiting<00:00:55.289> something

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
just because I'm revisiting something

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.139 
just because I'm revisiting something
like<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.160> doesn't<00:00:56.460> necessarily<00:00:56.550> mean<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
like this doesn't necessarily mean I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
like this doesn't necessarily mean I
want<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> happen<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> see

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
want to see this happen or I want to see

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.340 
want to see this happen or I want to see
the<00:00:59.399> original<00:00:59.520> go<00:01:00.149> away<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.840> enjoy<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the original go away I actually enjoy a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290 
the original go away I actually enjoy a
lot<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:01.859> places<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
lot of these places and don't want to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
lot of these places and don't want to
see<00:01:03.420> them<00:01:03.570> change<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> fun

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
see them change but I think it's a fun

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.520 
see them change but I think it's a fun
creative<00:01:05.159> exercise<00:01:05.820> anyway<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.320> were<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
creative exercise anyway if I were to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
creative exercise anyway if I were to
replace<00:01:07.850> fantasmic<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.090> would<00:01:09.570> take<00:01:09.869> out

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
replace fantasmic I would take out

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710 
replace fantasmic I would take out
almost<00:01:10.670> everything<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:12.210> would<00:01:12.330> still<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
almost everything it would still be a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
almost everything it would still be a
show<00:01:12.990> obviously<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.770> want<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.070> put

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
show obviously I don't want to just put

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.730 
show obviously I don't want to just put
a<00:01:14.280> ride<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.060> make<00:01:15.210> no<00:01:15.240> sense

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
a ride there that would make no sense

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.039 
a ride there that would make no sense
but<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> feel<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> show<00:01:18.390> when<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> think

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
but I feel like as a show when you think

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.780 
but I feel like as a show when you think
about<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.470> park<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> theme<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> park

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
about the park in the theme of the park

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.969 
about the park in the theme of the park
it<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.330> kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.689> sticks<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.619> sore

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it really kind of sticks out like a sore

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.100 
it really kind of sticks out like a sore
thumb<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.180> doesn't<00:01:24.659> fit<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
thumb it's not really doesn't fit in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.840 
thumb it's not really doesn't fit in
think<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.710> Fantasmic<00:01:26.250> takes<00:01:26.460> place<00:01:26.700> at

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
think about if Fantasmic takes place at

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.789 
think about if Fantasmic takes place at
the<00:01:26.939> end<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> Sunset<00:01:27.630> Boulevard<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:28.350> itself

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the end of Sunset Boulevard which itself

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.030 
the end of Sunset Boulevard which itself
is<00:01:28.979> an<00:01:29.130> offshoot<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.759> Hollywood<00:01:30.659> Boulevard

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
is an offshoot of Hollywood Boulevard

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.530 
is an offshoot of Hollywood Boulevard
the<00:01:32.040> entire<00:01:32.340> park<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:32.790> sort<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> built<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> an

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the entire park was sort of built as an

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.840 
the entire park was sort of built as an
ode<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> old-school<00:01:34.320> Hollywood<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.549> yeah<00:01:35.790> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
ode to old-school Hollywood and yeah you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.330 
ode to old-school Hollywood and yeah you
can<00:01:36.150> argue<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.930> lot<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.590> animated

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
can argue that a lot of these animated

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.280 
can argue that a lot of these animated
films<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.970> featured<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.570> fantasmic

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
films that get featured and fantasmic

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
films that get featured and fantasmic
are<00:01:40.530> part<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.820> Disney

are part of you know the Disney

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.230 
are part of you know the Disney
Renaissance<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.200> old-school<00:01:43.439> Disney<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
Renaissance and old-school Disney but I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.160 
Renaissance and old-school Disney but I
think<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.290> doesn't<00:01:47.100> resonate<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
think it just doesn't resonate with the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
think it just doesn't resonate with the
original<00:01:49.170> theme<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> park<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> think

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
original theme of the park when I think

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.330 
original theme of the park when I think
of<00:01:51.329> Hollywood<00:01:51.810> Studios<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.829> funny<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.189> don't

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
of Hollywood Studios it's funny I don't

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.880 
of Hollywood Studios it's funny I don't
think<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.970> Disney<00:01:54.149> movies<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.470> The

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
think of Disney movies I think of The

Twilight Zone

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.959 
Twilight Zone
I<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.479> Casablanca<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.820> these

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
I think of Casablanca and all of these

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.850 
I think of Casablanca and all of these
films<00:02:00.360> The<00:02:00.479> Wizard<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.930> Oz<00:02:01.079> everything<00:02:01.740> that

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.260 
feel like there's so much on the
technical<00:03:27.620> end<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.070> can't<00:03:28.550> speak<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.090> as

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
technical end that I can't speak to as

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.350 
technical end that I can't speak to as
an<00:03:29.390> expert<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.440> can't<00:03:30.770> really<00:03:31.100> guess<00:03:31.640> but<00:03:32.300> I

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
an expert so I can't really guess but I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.570 
an expert so I can't really guess but I
think<00:03:32.780> making<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.290> show<00:03:33.530> about<00:03:33.770> Hollywood

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
think making a show about Hollywood

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.180 
think making a show about Hollywood
would<00:03:34.760> be<00:03:34.910> way<00:03:35.300> cooler<00:03:35.960> than<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.590> show<00:03:36.920> about

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
would be way cooler than a show about

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.060 
would be way cooler than a show about
like<00:03:37.400> Disney<00:03:38.180> characters<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.020> Disney<00:03:39.440> movies

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
like Disney characters and Disney movies

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.650 
like Disney characters and Disney movies
because<00:03:40.520> I<00:03:40.550> think<00:03:40.670> we've<00:03:40.910> got<00:03:41.090> plenty<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.450> that

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
because I think we've got plenty of that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.060 
because I think we've got plenty of that
I<00:03:41.690> think<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:41.990> you<00:03:42.380> know<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.620> Magic<00:03:42.950> Kingdom

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
I think we you know the Magic Kingdom

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.880 
I think we you know the Magic Kingdom
has<00:03:43.430> its<00:03:43.820> fair<00:03:44.180> share<00:03:44.240> of<00:03:44.600> Disney<00:03:45.380> characters

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
has its fair share of Disney characters

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.580 
has its fair share of Disney characters
involved<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:46.610> think<00:03:46.640> you<00:03:46.970> see<00:03:47.209> them<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:48.560> know

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
involved I think you see them you know

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.170 
involved I think you see them you know
you<00:03:48.770> see<00:03:48.950> them<00:03:49.070> in<00:03:49.190> Epcot<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.520> bit<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.910> see<00:03:50.060> them

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
you see them in Epcot a bit you see them

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.540 
you see them in Epcot a bit you see them
in<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.390> animal<00:03:50.690> kingdom<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:51.050> it<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.380> think

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
in the animal kingdom of it but I think

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.120 
in the animal kingdom of it but I think
Hollywood<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.180> cinemas<00:03:54.080> where<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.950> can

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
Hollywood and and cinemas where you can

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.220 
Hollywood and and cinemas where you can
make<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> home<00:03:55.640> for<00:03:55.670> for<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.510> show<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:56.990> this<00:03:57.170> and

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
make a home for for a show like this and

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.170 
make a home for for a show like this and
that's<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:58.250> know<00:03:58.280> what<00:03:58.640> would<00:03:58.760> be<00:03:58.790> in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
that's you know what would be in

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.670 
that's you know what would be in
Hollywood<00:03:59.390> studios<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.230> now<00:04:00.320> that<00:04:00.530> the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
Hollywood studios and now that the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.530 
Hollywood studios and now that the
Sorcerer's<00:04:01.100> had<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.430> gone<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:02.120> parks<00:04:02.390> even

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
Sorcerer's had is gone the parks even

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.720 
Sorcerer's had is gone the parks even
less<00:04:02.930> focused<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:03.740> you<00:04:04.040> know<00:04:04.070> Disney

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
less focused on you know Disney

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.490 
less focused on you know Disney
characters<00:04:05.270> so<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.510> think<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.870> makes<00:04:06.050> sense<00:04:06.290> in

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
characters so I think it makes sense in

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.300 
characters so I think it makes sense in
that<00:04:07.010> respects<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:08.800> but<00:04:09.800> there<00:04:09.950> that's<00:04:10.160> what

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
that respects to but there that's what

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.850 
that respects to but there that's what
comes<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.670> mind<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:11.000> picture<00:04:11.630> big<00:04:11.900> grand<00:04:12.530> scenes

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
comes to mind I picture big grand scenes

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.680 
comes to mind I picture big grand scenes
that<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.130> know<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.250> think<00:04:13.340> we<00:04:13.880> grow<00:04:14.209> up<00:04:14.390> seeing

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
that you know I think we grow up seeing

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.170 
that you know I think we grow up seeing
some<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.170> these<00:04:15.290> scenes<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.580> big<00:04:16.790> screen

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
some of these scenes on the big screen

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.090 
some of these scenes on the big screen
and<00:04:17.450> that's<00:04:18.109> really<00:04:18.410> cool<00:04:18.770> and<00:04:18.980> I<00:04:19.070> think

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
and that's really cool and I think

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.099 
and that's really cool and I think
there'd<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.549> something<00:04:19.850> really<00:04:20.359> fantastic

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
there'd be something really fantastic

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.990 
there'd be something really fantastic
about<00:04:21.230> getting<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.770> see<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.010> recreation<00:04:22.880> of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
about getting to see a recreation of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.620 
about getting to see a recreation of
that<00:04:23.210> in<00:04:23.450> real<00:04:23.840> life<00:04:24.880> whether<00:04:25.880> it's<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.600> know

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
that in real life whether it's you know

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.110 
that in real life whether it's you know
films<00:04:27.229> like<00:04:27.440> Rock

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
films like Rock

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.909 
films like Rock
I<00:04:28.660> don't<00:04:28.900> know<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.020> mean<00:04:29.530> this<00:04:29.620> would<00:04:29.800> be<00:04:29.830> a

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
I don't know I mean this would be a

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.150 
I don't know I mean this would be a
great<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:31.030> know<00:04:31.380> series<00:04:32.380> in<00:04:32.530> itself<00:04:32.889> is

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
great you know series in itself is

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.080 
great you know series in itself is
figuring<00:04:33.910> out<00:04:34.060> what<00:04:35.190> moments<00:04:36.190> in<00:04:36.310> cinema<00:04:36.880> are

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
figuring out what moments in cinema are

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.150 
figuring out what moments in cinema are
worthy<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.870> being<00:04:38.020> represented<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.919> show

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
worthy of being represented in a show

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.010 
worthy of being represented in a show
like<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.610> how<00:04:39.790> far<00:04:40.090> back<00:04:40.300> do<00:04:40.510> you<00:04:40.600> go<00:04:40.780> for

like this how far back do you go for

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.010 
like this how far back do you go for
classic<00:04:41.590> how<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:42.970> know<00:04:43.030> modern<00:04:43.360> do<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.780> go

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
for for some of these films what what

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.530 
for for some of these films what what
would<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.780> consider<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.380> be<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:48.130> know

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.480 
would you consider to be you know
memorable<00:04:49.540> enough<00:04:49.810> seeing<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.830> ball<00:04:51.040> rolling

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
memorable enough seeing the ball rolling

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.159 
memorable enough seeing the ball rolling
down<00:04:51.520> in<00:04:51.880> Indiana<00:04:52.210> Jones<00:04:52.300> sort<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.900> like<00:04:53.020> in

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
related I mean you can get films in

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.939 
related I mean you can get films in
there<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:58.720> aren't<00:04:58.900> necessarily<00:04:59.470> Disney

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
there that aren't necessarily Disney

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.170 
there that aren't necessarily Disney
characters<00:05:00.370> that<00:05:00.520> are<00:05:00.610> still<00:05:00.850> owned<00:05:01.090> by

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
characters that are still owned by

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.690 
characters that are still owned by
Disney<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:01.870> still<00:05:02.620> make<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:02.950> good<00:05:03.220> show<00:05:03.460> out<00:05:03.669> of

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.969 
Disney and still make a good show out of
it<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.840> there<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.110> have<00:05:05.139> it<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.680> know<00:05:05.710> it's

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
it so there you have it I know it's

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.950 
it so there you have it I know it's
short<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.400> know<00:05:06.460> it's<00:05:06.669> very<00:05:06.850> vague<00:05:07.150> but<00:05:07.780> that's

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
short I know it's very vague but that's
