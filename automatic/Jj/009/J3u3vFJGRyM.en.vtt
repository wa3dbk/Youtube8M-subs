hello this is the video to introduce you

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.710 
hello this is the video to introduce you
to<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.980> air<00:00:05.250> friction<00:00:05.520> laboratory<00:00:06.120> this

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
to the air friction laboratory this

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.450 
to the air friction laboratory this
laboratory<00:00:07.319> we're<00:00:07.560> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> be<00:00:07.919> measuring

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
laboratory we're going to be measuring

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.350 
laboratory we're going to be measuring
the<00:00:09.210> terminal<00:00:09.929> velocity<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.550> a<00:00:11.550> varying

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
the terminal velocity of a varying

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.660 
the terminal velocity of a varying
number<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.750> coffee<00:00:13.139> filters<00:00:13.650> if<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.460> assume

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
number of coffee filters if we assume

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.340 
number of coffee filters if we assume
that<00:00:14.700> each<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.030> those<00:00:15.269> coffee<00:00:15.630> filters<00:00:16.139> has

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
that each of those coffee filters has

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.140 
that each of those coffee filters has
the<00:00:16.560> same<00:00:16.800> mass<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:19.490> we<00:00:20.490> were<00:00:20.609> able<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.970> keep

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the same mass and we were able to keep

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.689 
the same mass and we were able to keep
the<00:00:21.330> bottom<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.869> close<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.949> being<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.670> same

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the bottom as close to being the same

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.790 
the bottom as close to being the same
shape<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.769> was<00:00:25.769> every<00:00:26.519> time<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.970> drop<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
shape as it was every time we drop it

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.320 
shape as it was every time we drop it
then<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:29.010> should<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.400> able<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> determine<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
then we should be able to determine the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.319 
then we should be able to determine the
power<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:31.740> which<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> velocity<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.700> raised<00:00:33.000> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
power to which the velocity is raised in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.319 
power to which the velocity is raised in
the<00:00:33.840> force<00:00:34.079> equation<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.860> air<00:00:35.010> friction<00:00:36.260> so

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
the force equation for air friction so

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
the force equation for air friction so
first<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.629> we're<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
first here we're going to do this

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.150 
first here we're going to do this
particular<00:00:41.250> video<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.690> show<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.980> how

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
particular video to show you kind of how

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
particular video to show you kind of how
to<00:00:44.190> use<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.670> measuring<00:00:44.940> tape<00:00:45.260> kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> what

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to use your measuring tape kind of what

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
to use your measuring tape kind of what
you<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> need<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:48.210> you're<00:00:48.300> doing

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you kind of need to do when you're doing

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.510 
you kind of need to do when you're doing
these<00:00:48.600> videos<00:00:48.930> first<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.280> see

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
these videos first of all as you can see

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.939 
these videos first of all as you can see
I've<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.059> tilted<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> line

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I've kind of tilted this so it's a line

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.880 
I've kind of tilted this so it's a line
straight<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.969> down<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.530> really

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
straight on down here it's just really

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.010 
straight on down here it's just really
nice<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.340> set<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.699> axis<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> understand

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
nice to set up your axis I understand

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
nice to set up your axis I understand
they<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:59.010> come<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.250> perfect<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> it's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
they don't come out perfect and it's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
they don't come out perfect and it's
really<00:01:00.780> hard<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.440> line<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:01.949> at<00:01:02.160> one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
really hard and if you line it up at one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.670 
really hard and if you line it up at one
spot<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.690> lining<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
spot we're going to be lining it up a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.730 
spot we're going to be lining it up a
little<00:01:04.890> different<00:01:05.280> another<00:01:06.180> spot<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.740> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
little different another spot in this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.289 
little different another spot in this
particularly<00:01:08.720> since<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:11.150> we're<00:01:12.150> not

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
particularly since the we're not

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.910 
particularly since the we're not
measuring<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.780> specific<00:01:12.990> constants

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
measuring the specific constants

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
measuring the specific constants
associated<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> force<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.930> want

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
associated with that force we just want

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.510 
associated with that force we just want
to<00:01:16.170> power<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:17.670> extent<00:01:18.060> philosophy<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> raised

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
to power to extent philosophy is raised

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
to power to extent philosophy is raised
that<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.479> air<00:01:21.720> doesn't<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.680> matter

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that kind of air doesn't really matter

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
that kind of air doesn't really matter
as<00:01:23.310> much<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.229> last

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
as much as it would in the last

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
as much as it would in the last
experiment<00:01:26.009> where<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.250> were<00:01:26.400> specifically

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
experiment where we were specifically

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.980 
experiment where we were specifically
trying<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.479> measure<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.170> constant<00:01:28.740> G<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
trying to measure the constant G so you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
trying to measure the constant G so you
want<00:01:31.170> our<00:01:31.259> calibration<00:01:31.710> stick<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.880> oh<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
want our calibration stick but oh I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.069 
want our calibration stick but oh I
don't<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.950> meter<00:01:35.520> stick<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:35.970> me<00:01:36.119> well

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
don't have my meter stick with me well

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.620 
don't have my meter stick with me well
we<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.619> measuring<00:01:38.220> tape<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.450> what

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
we have the measuring tape and so what

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
we have the measuring tape and so what
you<00:01:39.750> want<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.530> get

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you want to do is you want to get

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.039 
you want to do is you want to get
something<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.189> what<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.869> remain<00:01:42.869> in

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
something that is what is the remain in

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.399 
something that is what is the remain in
position<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.740> measured<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.689> larger<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
position and measured the larger the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.460 
position and measured the larger the
calibration<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.880> use<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:49.259> more

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
calibration that you use the more

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.969 
calibration that you use the more
accurate<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.369> answer<00:01:51.119> will<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> I'm

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
accurate your answer will be so I'm

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.780 
accurate your answer will be so I'm
going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> go<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.670> shelf<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:58.790> this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
going to go from this shelf here this

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.069 
going to go from this shelf here this
shelf<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:03.530> if<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.740> estimate<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.780> number<00:02:07.049> of

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
shelf and if I estimate the number of

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.230 
shelf and if I estimate the number of
centimeters<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:10.319> about

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
centimeters is about

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.040 
centimeters is about
from<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.960> top<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:14.000> show<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> bottom

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.350 
of this one is 93 and a half centimeters
so<00:02:22.190> that's<00:02:22.400> what<00:02:22.610> I'm<00:02:22.700> going<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:22.910> use<00:02:23.030> for<00:02:23.240> my

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
so that's what I'm going to use for my

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.660 
so that's what I'm going to use for my
calibration<00:02:23.950> now<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:24.980> will<00:02:25.280> be<00:02:25.370> doing<00:02:25.520> another

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
calibration now I will be doing another

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.870 
calibration now I will be doing another
video<00:02:26.030> where<00:02:26.750> I'm<00:02:26.870> analyzing<00:02:27.740> this<00:02:27.860> video<00:02:28.160> so

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
video where I'm analyzing this video so

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880 
video where I'm analyzing this video so
then<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.270> can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.690> how<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.960> translate<00:02:30.590> that

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
then you can see how I translate that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.780 
then you can see how I translate that
into<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.820> analysis<00:02:32.300> okay<00:02:33.140> now<00:02:33.590> take<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
into the analysis okay now take the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.290 
into the analysis okay now take the
filters<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.370> have<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.550> particular<00:02:38.000> number

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
filters if you have a particular number

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.080 
filters if you have a particular number
of<00:02:38.360> filters<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:39.490> so<00:02:40.490> what<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.700> want<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.880> do<00:02:41.000> is

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
of filters and so what you want to do is

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.670 
of filters and so what you want to do is
you<00:02:41.150> want<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.360> indicate<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.960> your<00:02:42.200> video<00:02:42.470> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
you want to indicate in your video that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.930 
you want to indicate in your video that
you're<00:02:42.800> doing<00:02:43.160> because<00:02:43.370> when<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.790> go<00:02:43.910> to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
you're doing because when you go to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.850 
you're doing because when you go to
analyze<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:44.600> not<00:02:44.780> gonna<00:02:44.930> be<00:02:45.080> there<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
analyze it's not gonna be there the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.680 
analyze it's not gonna be there the
number<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.190> filters<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.610> actually<00:02:46.940> have<00:02:47.120> so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
number of filters you actually have so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.500 
number of filters you actually have so
in<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:47.930> case<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.380> 6<00:02:48.620> filters<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.090> can

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
in this case I have 6 filters so I can

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.940 
in this case I have 6 filters so I can
hold<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.410> close<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
hold this up a really close to the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.540 
hold this up a really close to the
camera<00:02:52.160> here<00:02:52.460> it's<00:02:53.060> okay<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:55.220> something<00:02:55.520> to

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
camera here it's okay just something to

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.190 
camera here it's okay just something to
mark<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.210> when<00:02:56.390> you're<00:02:56.480> analyzing<00:02:56.840> your

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
mark it so when you're analyzing your

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.530 
mark it so when you're analyzing your
video<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:58.070> know<00:02:58.220> how<00:02:58.400> many<00:02:58.550> filters<00:02:59.030> you've

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
video you know how many filters you've

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.440 
video you know how many filters you've
dropped<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.250> 6<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.570> just<00:03:02.750> drop<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:04.450> that's

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
dropped so 6 and you just drop it that's

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.600 
dropped so 6 and you just drop it that's
it<00:03:06.130> ok<00:03:07.130> I'll<00:03:07.400> do<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.610> again<00:03:09.190> trying<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.310> get<00:03:10.490> my

hands in a way filters off ok now your I
need<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.590> do<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:18.830> next<00:03:19.100> lower<00:03:19.580> number<00:03:20.000> now<00:03:20.570> if

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
need to do the next lower number now if

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.170 
need to do the next lower number now if
you<00:03:20.810> have<00:03:20.990> 6<00:03:21.920> coffee<00:03:22.190> filters<00:03:22.640> it's

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
you have 6 coffee filters it's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.000 
you have 6 coffee filters it's
recommended<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.870> stretch<00:03:24.590> out<00:03:24.800> those

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
recommended that you stretch out those

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.280 
recommended that you stretch out those
numbers<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.460> little<00:03:25.610> bit<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.870> we<00:03:26.990> want<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.230> go

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
numbers a little bit so we want to go

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.130 
numbers a little bit so we want to go
from<00:03:27.440> 6<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.800> 4<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:29.270> want<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.570> take<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.930> coffee

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
from 6 to 4 you want to take the coffee

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.160 
from 6 to 4 you want to take the coffee
filters<00:03:30.560> out<00:03:30.740> one<00:03:31.160> at<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.400> time<00:03:32.170> individually

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
filters out one at a time individually

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.920 
filters out one at a time individually
from<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.770> top<00:03:33.980> not<00:03:34.730> from<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:34.970> bottom<00:03:35.120> because

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
from the top not from the bottom because

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.220 
from the top not from the bottom because
remember<00:03:36.370> we<00:03:37.370> want<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.640> try<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.880> avoid<00:03:38.270> as<00:03:38.540> much

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
remember we want to try to avoid as much

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.640 
remember we want to try to avoid as much
change<00:03:39.710> to<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.070> bottom<00:03:40.400> as<00:03:40.550> possible<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:42.440> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
change to the bottom as possible so the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.830 
change to the bottom as possible so the
area<00:03:42.950> carefully<00:03:43.190> pu.1<00:03:44.090> now<00:03:46.570> so<00:03:47.570> this<00:03:47.660> would

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
area carefully pu.1 now so this would

00:03:47.840 --> 00:04:02.980 
area carefully pu.1 now so this would
not<00:03:47.870> be<00:03:47.990> five<00:03:48.410> coffees<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:02.450> do<00:04:02.630> want<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.870> be

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
not be five coffees you do want to be

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.130 
not be five coffees you do want to be
careful<00:04:03.170> here<00:04:06.370> make<00:04:07.370> sure<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.640> just<00:04:07.790> got<00:04:07.940> one

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
careful here make sure you just got one

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.590 
careful here make sure you just got one
ok<00:04:09.140> so<00:04:09.200> now<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.470> have<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:10.220> set<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.670> 4<00:04:11.060> coffee

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
ok so now I have the set of 4 coffee

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.460 
ok so now I have the set of 4 coffee
filters<00:04:12.020> and<00:04:12.050> drop<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:14.050> you<00:04:15.050> can<00:04:15.290> make<00:04:15.440> a

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
filters and drop it you can make a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.479 
filters and drop it you can make a
separate<00:04:16.160> video<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:17.450> analyze<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.340> start<00:04:19.340> here

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
separate video to analyze the start here

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:27.810 
separate video to analyze the start here
so<00:04:19.730> here's<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.030> 4<00:04:21.669> ok

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.530 

three<00:04:33.160> you're<00:04:34.160> careful<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.820> get<00:04:34.970> one<00:04:35.330> at

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
three you're careful just to get one at

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.170 
three you're careful just to get one at
a<00:04:35.630> time<00:04:36.010> because<00:04:37.010> it's<00:04:37.280> really<00:04:37.550> easy<00:04:37.670> to<00:04:37.940> pull

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
a time because it's really easy to pull

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:58.920 
a time because it's really easy to pull
more<00:04:38.660> okay<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:39.440> three<00:04:41.920> okay<00:04:46.300> then<00:04:47.300> -<00:04:56.950> okay<00:04:57.950> and

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
more okay so three okay then - okay and

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:07.510 
more okay so three okay then - okay and
then<00:05:00.400> one<00:05:01.400> coffee<00:05:01.730> filter<00:05:06.190> always<00:05:07.190> pulling

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
then one coffee filter always pulling

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.200 
then one coffee filter always pulling
from<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.940> top<00:05:09.190> to<00:05:10.190> keep<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.550> bottom<00:05:11.030> of<00:05:11.120> the

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
from the top to keep the bottom of the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.200 
from the top to keep the bottom of the
same<00:05:15.220> okay<00:05:16.220> in<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.400> next<00:05:16.430> video<00:05:16.880> we'll<00:05:17.120> be

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
same okay in the next video we'll be

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.930 
same okay in the next video we'll be
analyzing<00:05:17.750> these
