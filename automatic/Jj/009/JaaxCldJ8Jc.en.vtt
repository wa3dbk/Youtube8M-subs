hi<00:00:01.290> everyone<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.280> another<00:00:03.030> project<00:00:03.419> of

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hi everyone this is another project of

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.750 
hi everyone this is another project of
mine<00:00:03.959> using<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.120> semen<00:00:06.120> POC<00:00:06.839> step<00:00:07.799> 7<00:00:08.130> 1200

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
mine using the semen POC step 7 1200

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.400 
mine using the semen POC step 7 1200
that<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.630> got<00:00:10.170> from<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.679> boss<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.360> um<00:00:12.660> yeah

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
that I just got from my boss so um yeah

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.500 
that I just got from my boss so um yeah
I<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.490> did<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> simple<00:00:15.509> setup<00:00:15.839> using<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
I just did a simple setup using the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.529 
I just did a simple setup using the
ultrasonic<00:00:18.510> sensor<00:00:18.539> right<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.539> right

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
ultrasonic sensor right here I right

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.349 
ultrasonic sensor right here I right
there<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.230> ultrasonic<00:00:22.740> sensor<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.340> then<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
there the ultrasonic sensor and then I

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.620 
there the ultrasonic sensor and then I
use<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> comma<00:00:25.519> kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> communicating<00:00:27.420> with

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
use a comma kind of a communicating with

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.320 
use a comma kind of a communicating with
Arduino<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.650> make<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> simple<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.550> simple

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
Arduino to make a simple a simple

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
Arduino to make a simple a simple
project<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
project out of it so as you can see I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.650 
project out of it so as you can see I
also<00:00:33.200> also<00:00:34.200> bought<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> HMI<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.910> model<00:00:36.510> is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
also also bought the HMI this model is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.940 
also also bought the HMI this model is
the<00:00:36.690> KTP<00:00:37.469> 600<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:39.120> did<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.170> did<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the KTP 600 and I did a little I did a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.400 
the KTP 600 and I did a little I did a
little<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.629> not<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:42.809> programming

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
little bit of not really programming

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.330 
little bit of not really programming
it's<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.710> drag-and-drop

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it's just drag-and-drop

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.680 
it's just drag-and-drop
buttons<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.780> control<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.410> motors<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.480> read

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
buttons to control the motors or to read

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
buttons to control the motors or to read
the<00:00:48.960> reading<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.860> ultrasonic<00:00:50.489> sensors

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the reading of the ultrasonic sensors

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.170 
the reading of the ultrasonic sensors
using<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> HMI<00:00:51.960> screen<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.879> come<00:00:53.879> back<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
using the HMI screen and come back to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.240 
using the HMI screen and come back to
the<00:00:54.300> HMI<00:00:54.690> screen<00:00:55.050> right<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.100> see

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the HMI screen right here as you can see

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
the HMI screen right here as you can see
this<00:00:56.460> bar<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.660> bar<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:59.359> distance<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this bar this bar is a distance or the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
this bar this bar is a distance or the
value<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.920> reads<00:01:02.160> from<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> ultrasonic

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
value it reads from the ultrasonic

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
value it reads from the ultrasonic
sensor<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.080> higher<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.589> reads<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.070> further

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
sensor the higher it reads the further

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
sensor the higher it reads the further
away<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.909> object<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.450> away<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> sensor

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
away an object is away from the sensor

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.350 
away an object is away from the sensor
the<00:01:07.680> lower<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.729> means<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> object<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the lower so that means the object is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.450 
the lower so that means the object is
close<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.740> button<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
close so this is an on button for the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.370 
close so this is an on button for the
for<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> motor<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> off

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
for the motor and this one is the off

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.490 
for the motor and this one is the off
button<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> motor<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.540> put<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
button for the motor so I put in a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.210 
button for the motor so I put in a
simple<00:01:16.950> logic<00:01:17.250> once<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.470> well<00:01:19.470> once<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
simple logic once the well once the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.310 
simple logic once the well once the
ultrasonic<00:01:20.759> sensor<00:01:21.030> reading<00:01:21.360> gets<00:01:21.930> below<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
ultrasonic sensor reading gets below a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.480 
ultrasonic sensor reading gets below a
thousand<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.430> motor<00:01:23.850> will<00:01:24.119> start<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.920> can

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
thousand the motor will start or I can

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.429 
thousand the motor will start or I can
press<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.090> button<00:01:27.119> simply<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.080> start<00:01:28.350> the

press the on button simply to start the
motor<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.640> look<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> motor

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
motor and now you can look at the motor

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.050 
motor and now you can look at the motor
a<00:01:30.509> long<00:01:31.250> or<00:01:32.250> look<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> motor<00:01:32.759> along<00:01:33.000> with

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
a long or look at the motor along with

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.890 
a long or look at the motor along with
the<00:01:33.270> HMI<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.710> motives<00:01:35.070> right<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.900> then

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the HMI the motives right here and then

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.069 
the HMI the motives right here and then
asbestos<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> capture<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.869> button<00:01:39.869> as

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
asbestos you can capture the button as

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.130 
asbestos you can capture the button as
well<00:01:40.229> maybe<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.460> sigh<00:01:42.270> wait<00:01:42.479> cool<00:01:42.930> slide

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
well maybe you can sigh wait cool slide

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
well maybe you can sigh wait cool slide
wait<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.560> bit

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.950 

okay<00:01:48.850> all<00:01:49.120> right<00:01:49.360> I'll<00:01:49.570> cast<00:01:50.020> button<00:01:51.810> turn<00:01:52.810> it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
okay all right I'll cast button turn it

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.960 
okay all right I'll cast button turn it
off<00:01:53.250> button<00:01:54.480> turn<00:01:55.480> it<00:01:55.630> off<00:01:55.770> button<00:01:56.820> turn<00:01:57.820> it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
off button turn it off button turn it

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.410 
off button turn it off button turn it
off

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
off

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.690 
off
so<00:01:58.900> basically<00:01:59.290> is<00:01:59.740> pretty<00:02:00.010> simple<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.580> then

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
so basically is pretty simple and then

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.270 
so basically is pretty simple and then
you<00:02:00.729> can<00:02:01.090> also<00:02:01.210> see<00:02:01.540> there's<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.410> simple<00:02:02.920> logic

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
you can also see there's a simple logic

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.100 
you can also see there's a simple logic
with<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.640> ultrasonic<00:02:04.119> sensor<00:02:04.150> if<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
with the ultrasonic sensor if the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.070 
with the ultrasonic sensor if the
distance<00:02:05.650> is<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:06.270> lower<00:02:07.270> than<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.600> thousand

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
distance is a lower than a thousand

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.170 
distance is a lower than a thousand
value<00:02:09.990> you<00:02:10.990> block<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.440> sensor<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.250> will<00:02:12.310> turn

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
value you block the sensor it will turn

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.000 
value you block the sensor it will turn
on<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.600> then<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.900> press<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> button<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.650> turn

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
on and then you press a button you turn

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.090 
on and then you press a button you turn
off<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.430> off<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.000> sensor<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.600> go<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.100> press
