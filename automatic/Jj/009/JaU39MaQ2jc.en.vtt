00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
 the next round here in business box 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.990
 was 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.480
 while we are on the next opponent 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 waiting 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 we're just seeing a couple here 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.760
 I believe a few in the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.920
 Dark Summoner fights the boss fight 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.609
 is very interesting because I believe 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.470
 once the player is one of these 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:36.059
 ghosts because of which the bossa 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:38.070
 will summon course true that we 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.890
 have such a brook group is quite 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.510
 practically judge in this group 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.860
 now of course all fit the whole 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 Group off if you go regularly 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.360
 fit and you can do that in the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.780
 arena take something and not 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.020
 works is his for example 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.359
 heroism what you can do with man 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.199
 then stand and then you can draw heroism 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.460
 he does not take this with him 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.310
 that will be my turn now 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.200
 who will be our next boss ours 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.830
 next ministerial post our next 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.830
 to become opponents 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:26.280
 very nice going on 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:27.659
 Vocation is quite good that we 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.630
 now very well sink the bomb in it 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.280
 have sunk the bomb living bomb 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:43.349
 has now booty are neat on the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.550
 fdp still not from the meeting that 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:49.270
 now a mirror image 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:53.230
 a bit acute that means I can with 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.230
 choose and stay 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.229
 but not that here yet 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.229
 survive 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.910
 shit there I have my suggestion 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.170
 have poorly timed you see now 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.330
 me those little bloodsuckers 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.610
 hit it well is the little loks he 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.349
 Now you can see that you are moving very nicely 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.140
 much slower than the baltic sea 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.959
 Now, nothing is ever known 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.420
 We have a nice blink now 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:34.209
 that 's it 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.209
 in the next fight continues until the same
