hi I'm Bob the bug guy I'm going out to
a<00:00:07.980> property<00:00:08.580> right<00:00:08.790> now<00:00:08.850> to<00:00:09.090> inspect<00:00:09.660> for<00:00:10.410> a

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
a property right now to inspect for a

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
a property right now to inspect for a
mound<00:00:10.740> that's<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.100> the<00:00:11.219> front<00:00:11.460> yard<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.940> a

house<00:00:12.500> this<00:00:13.500> could<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.740> number<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.340> go<00:00:14.850> for

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
house this could be number one go for

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.269 
house this could be number one go for
round<00:00:15.180> number<00:00:15.480> two<00:00:15.990> possibly<00:00:16.830> important

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
round number two possibly important

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.540 
round number two possibly important
fiery<00:00:17.520> eyes<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.330> let's<00:00:18.510> go<00:00:18.660> take<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> look

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
well it's pretty evident where the mound

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.460 
well it's pretty evident where the mound
is<00:00:23.740> right<00:00:24.220> here<00:00:24.429> in<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.640> front<00:00:25.140> if<00:00:26.140> you<00:00:26.230> get<00:00:26.439> a

close-up of this you can see that

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.900 
close-up of this you can see that
there's<00:00:29.529> little<00:00:29.770> holes<00:00:30.039> coming<00:00:30.640> out<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:30.820> the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
there's little holes coming out of the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
fire ants bite well what they do is they

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.460 
fire ants bite well what they do is they
first<00:01:37.550> they<00:01:37.850> bite<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.450> then<00:01:38.990> they<00:01:39.140> sting<00:01:39.440> you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
you so what we're going to do here is

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.230 
you so what we're going to do here is
we're<00:01:45.290> going<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.440> treat<00:01:45.710> this<00:01:45.920> mound

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
we're going to treat this mound

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.210 
we're going to treat this mound
individually<00:01:47.470> some<00:01:48.470> ways<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.860> treating<00:01:49.040> this

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
individually some ways of treating this

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.950 
individually some ways of treating this
mound<00:01:49.490> is<00:01:49.670> with<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.940> granular<00:01:50.450> product<00:01:50.870> or

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
mound is with the granular product or

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.400 
mound is with the granular product or
with<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.110> bait<00:01:51.410> all<00:01:52.160> right<00:01:52.370> but<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.570> chemical

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
with a bait all right but a chemical

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.100 
with a bait all right but a chemical
application<00:01:54.980> of<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.190> right<00:01:55.370> chemical<00:01:56.110> will

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
application of the right chemical will

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.620 
application of the right chemical will
treat<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:57.650> mound<00:01:57.920> successfully<00:01:58.820> some

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
treat this mound successfully some

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.770 
treat this mound successfully some
homeowners<00:02:00.170> will<00:02:00.890> use<00:02:01.100> gasoline<00:02:01.780> they'll

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
homeowners will use gasoline they'll

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.060 
homeowners will use gasoline they'll
also<00:02:03.050> use<00:02:03.440> grits<00:02:04.060> that's<00:02:05.060> right<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.330> said<00:02:05.450> grits

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
also use grits that's right I said grits

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.800 
also use grits that's right I said grits
the<00:02:07.070> thought<00:02:07.310> process<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.510> grits

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
the thought process is that the grits

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.900 
the thought process is that the grits
the<00:02:09.290> ants<00:02:09.530> can<00:02:09.770> consume<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.340> grits<00:02:10.610> and

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
the ants can consume the grits and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.350 
the ants can consume the grits and
they'll<00:02:11.390> blowed<00:02:11.810> out<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.880> will<00:02:14.030> eradicate

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
they'll blowed out and it will eradicate

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.990 
they'll blowed out and it will eradicate
the<00:02:14.750> ants<00:02:14.930> well<00:02:15.260> ants<00:02:15.650> will<00:02:15.800> only<00:02:15.920> eat<00:02:16.190> liquid

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
the ants well ants will only eat liquid

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.890 
the ants well ants will only eat liquid
formulations<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:19.040> won't<00:02:19.310> work<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.330> let's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
formulations so that won't work so let's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.240 
formulations so that won't work so let's
take<00:02:21.190> let's<00:02:22.190> go<00:02:22.400> over<00:02:22.580> here<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.790> get<00:02:22.970> a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
take let's go over here and get a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.790 
take let's go over here and get a
application<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.989> chemical<00:02:26.989> i'm<00:02:27.080> doing<00:02:27.440> here

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
application of chemical i'm doing here

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.680 
application of chemical i'm doing here
is<00:02:28.600> i'm<00:02:29.600> going<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.870> saturate<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.739> mound<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
is i'm going to saturate the mound the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.670 
is i'm going to saturate the mound the
way<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.900> do<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:33.320> is<00:02:33.650> by<00:02:34.370> sticking<00:02:34.820> your<00:02:34.940> wand

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
way you do this is by sticking your wand

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.440 
way you do this is by sticking your wand
deep<00:02:36.680> down<00:02:36.980> into<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> mound<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.910> injecting

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
deep down into the mound and injecting

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.500 
deep down into the mound and injecting
your<00:02:41.600> chemical<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:43.489> more<00:02:43.730> ants<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.330> can

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
your chemical the more ants that you can

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.990 
your chemical the more ants that you can
hit<00:02:44.720> with<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.989> chemical<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:46.520> more<00:02:46.730> effective

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
hit with the chemical the more effective

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.890 
hit with the chemical the more effective
it's<00:02:47.360> going<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.780> be<00:02:49.360> chemical<00:02:50.360> kind<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.690> works

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
it's going to be chemical kind of works

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.460 
it's going to be chemical kind of works
like<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.290> SARS<00:02:51.590> virus<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.900> more<00:02:54.110> ants<00:02:54.440> that

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
like the SARS virus the more ants that

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:13.819 
like the SARS virus the more ants that
are<00:02:54.590> corrupted<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.700> faster<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.780> results

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
this ant mounds been here a long time so

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.089 
this ant mounds been here a long time so
the<00:03:18.519> result<00:03:18.939> you<00:03:19.569> could<00:03:19.750> have<00:03:19.900> up<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.200> 200,000

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
the result you could have up to 200,000

if<00:03:21.189> it's<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.459> single<00:03:21.819> Queen<00:03:22.090> work<00:03:22.989> around<00:03:23.379> if

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
if it's a single Queen work around if

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.319 
if it's a single Queen work around if
you<00:03:24.400> have<00:03:24.549> multiple<00:03:24.730> Queens<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.930> can<00:03:26.079> have

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
you have multiple Queens you can have

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.440 
you have multiple Queens you can have

can go down three to four feet so this

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.740
