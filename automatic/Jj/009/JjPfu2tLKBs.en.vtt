00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.930
 wm more power in the informative iha then 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.629
 acquire for those guys who do not 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.449
 know how to play a lot for those guys who 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.269
 until you know more tomtom looking to learn 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:01.000
 a little bit for the newbies themselves 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.830
 who are starting to play now and it is 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.839
 This is where I'll start, and beauty. 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.229
 The first day that I come back to you 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.270
 always moving is independent of 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.180
 where are you from, where are you ever? 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.220
 moves a lot when buemi 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.350
 to that place in the suit scheduled for 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.409
 this tip of moving around is 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:28.000
 to be be wm to be to lose in 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.210
 also because each one is 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.009
 It is also good to move around but it is 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.170
 You can see that I get enough. 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.829
 in this place because the coup pleases me 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.619
 It was enough for me here. 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.070
 enough there in relation to the others 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.229
 players, but that's it. 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.140
 move and walk pollan every time 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.210
 have typhus wanting to look for an enemy 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.270
 dance is always about students 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.869
 always looking always at 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.689
 some things, yes, it's something else 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.499
 learn to do with what that would be 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:09.340
 who is not the one who is to cry abu de 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:11.770
 hacker or if you stay connected it is not what 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.930
 Would you change the wm to the knife? 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.170
 quickly to you and every time you boot 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.470
 of the knife w can see that I do much if 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.319
 can move your weight with the wm if 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.209
 greatly favors its weight its 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.850
 general drive and even your shot 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.950
 another tip also tip is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.440
 You've learned where you look. 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.480
 see this is my little sister 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 in the middle of the screen and when 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 You vote for a knife and a pistol 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.630
 so that Abbott is already your enemy in the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.510
 direction of samira is easier if 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.500
 shoot or aim to get you out 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.160
 with the media but you take a general way 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.150
 another thing is to buy 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.230
 snif snif out there but I recommend it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:10.090
 You always buy the wm because it's wwf 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.260
 to do qq very well to wm not so heavy 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.010
 the sr 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:20.770
 a wm and is not so heavy go dragon and she 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:26.230
 has and she has an exceptional face 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:29.200
 Congratulations to 8 so why is this one 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.120
 the best I think 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.740
 else where I'll give a tip to 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.970
 you when you are playing on 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:40.240
 mainly pd weapon second area 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.830
 whenever you have aimar in high very 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.220
 good in your hands 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:51.850
 always have a eg a desert 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.650
 hego desert 31 a na when I say so much 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.290
 because the anaconda has people who do not 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.680
 know how to play i really like to play and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.140
 in the most perfect conda desert right 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.870
 It is in very hit single account 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.540
 desert mouth things and catches you pulls 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.270
 enemy regatta because because sometimes 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.630
 You have to have tried the second good one. 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.800
 home wm only just bullets and not 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.960
 can hit 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.390
 sometimes the target is moving very 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.720
 Sometimes he is very much in front of you and not 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.610
 can repair from various areas 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.370
 possibility then that is already pulls 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.140
 especially in his head was 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:36.150
 would you stay with what you're connected to? 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:41.010
 Another thing the tea pulls cool for you 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:44.770
 to catch one day a leap term from 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:50.500
 To throw at her is sport. 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.009
 She is good for those who shoot jumping thing. 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.620
 such 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.229
 finally, it has an advantage over the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.669
 that in the other characters although I 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.060
 do not find that right 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.120
 but this is cool 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.340
 my friends always talk so I'll go 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:13.389
 to follow yo and his thesis is 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.250
 good is not always bought pop 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.860
 If you have the money, we'll go to 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.020
 play with the character who does the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.360
 play the player, right? 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.440
 My grandma already said who makes the game. 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.530
 player 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.120
 if you play very well, the morro 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.919
 of any other character for which 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.620
 understand pop 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.580
 But I'm playing sports because I 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.099
 I think the woman finds out that she 's better. 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.710
 so this is a favorite and see if 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.909
 Did you like the video if you did not like it? 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.159
 short 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.129
 if you do not like favorite either 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:51.370
 you liked this favorite is still there 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:54.550
 Let's save my hand evolution. 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.960
 and will focus on x-wife my brother chisui who did 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.849
 this video happens because it was 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.849
 filling my bag thanks
