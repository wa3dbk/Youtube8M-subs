00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it no it's to my butt and like when you

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.850 
it no it's to my butt and like when you
stretch<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.879> past<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.989> um

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
hair is really really long so I'm

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
hair is really really long so I'm
believing<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:17.610> people<00:02:18.540> say<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.020> it's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
believing it's like people say that it's

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.770 
believing it's like people say that it's
like<00:02:19.410> 30<00:02:19.680> inches<00:02:20.070> but<00:02:20.310> I'm<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.610> sure<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:21.660> you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
like 30 inches but I'm not sure but you

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
you want apart I did like a rough part

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.350 
you want apart I did like a rough part
because<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.860> kind<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.100> just<00:03:50.220> let<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.489> fall<00:03:51.030> where

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
because I kind of just let it fall where

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.870 
because I kind of just let it fall where
it<00:03:51.420> wanted<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.810> fall<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:53.250> can<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> middle

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
it wanted to fall you can do a middle

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.289 
it wanted to fall you can do a middle
part<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.420> side<00:03:54.660> part<00:03:55.049> whatever<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.250> prefer<00:03:56.580> and

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
part a side part whatever you prefer and

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.570 
part a side part whatever you prefer and
also<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.080> think<00:03:58.290> would<00:03:58.530> look<00:03:58.739> more<00:03:59.010> natural<00:03:59.459> if

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
also I think would look more natural if

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.640 
also I think would look more natural if
you<00:03:59.700> let<00:03:59.910> some<00:04:00.360> hair<00:04:00.630> out<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.019> never<00:04:01.260> really

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
you let some hair out but I never really

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.979 
you let some hair out but I never really
leave<00:04:01.920> my<00:04:02.730> hair<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:03.239> because<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.630> never<00:04:03.690> know

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
leave my hair out because I never know

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.460 
leave my hair out because I never know
