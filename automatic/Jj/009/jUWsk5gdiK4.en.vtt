they're both going to have the same

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
they're both going to have the same
design<00:01:04.559> nothing<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.070> changing<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
design nothing really changing in that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
design nothing really changing in that
aspect<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.140> some<00:01:07.320> physical

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
aspect but there are some physical

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
aspect but there are some physical
characteristics<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.520> weight<00:01:08.880> size<00:01:09.570> width

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
characteristics like weight size width

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.980 
characteristics like weight size width
and<00:01:10.439> depth<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.909> will<00:01:12.090> change<00:01:12.420> but

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and depth that actually will change but

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
and depth that actually will change but
the<00:01:13.110> differences<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.530> weight<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:13.890> depth<00:01:14.430> are

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the differences in weight and depth are

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.580 
the differences in weight and depth are
really<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.270> big<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.659> issue<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.140> don't

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
really that big of an issue I don't

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.480 
really that big of an issue I don't
think<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.890> something<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
think it's something that's going to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.190 
think it's something that's going to
either<00:01:17.670> sway<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.570> or<00:01:18.750> another<00:01:18.900> so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
either sway you one way or another so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
either sway you one way or another so
we're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.740> ahead<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> mark<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> up

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
we're going to go ahead and mark that up

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.210 
we're going to go ahead and mark that up
as<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.030> non-issue<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
as a non-issue and we're not going to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.010 
as a non-issue and we're not going to
calculate<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.180> whether<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.990> want

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
calculate it into whether or not we want

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.960 
calculate it into whether or not we want
to<00:01:25.229> purchase<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.799> device<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.820> other

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
decision so let's talk about with if

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
iphone screen is 2.31 inches so if you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
iphone screen is 2.31 inches so if you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
were to get the 4.7 inch iphone 6 you're

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.609 
were to get the 4.7 inch iphone 6 you're
looking<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.240> increased<00:01:45.750> width<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.229> 0<00:01:46.320> point

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
looking at an increased width of 0 point

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
looking at an increased width of 0 point
33<00:01:46.950> inches<00:01:47.490> or<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.909> third<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> an<00:01:48.479> inch<00:01:48.659> but

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
33 inches or a third of an inch but

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.109 
33 inches or a third of an inch but
jumping<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> iphone<00:01:50.040> 6<00:01:50.340> plus<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:51.000> the

jumping to the iphone 6 plus from the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990 
jumping to the iphone 6 plus from the
iphone<00:01:51.479> 5s<00:01:51.990> you're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.009> jump<00:01:53.820> up

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
iphone 5s you're going to jump up

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300 
iphone 5s you're going to jump up
three-quarters<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:55.020> an<00:01:55.259> inch<00:01:55.380> wider<00:01:55.829> which<00:01:56.159> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
three-quarters of an inch wider which is

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
three-quarters of an inch wider which is
actually<00:01:56.729> quite<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.090> bit<00:01:57.329> bigger<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> think

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
actually quite a bit bigger if you think

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
actually quite a bit bigger if you think
about<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.310> smaller<00:01:59.610> hands

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
about it so if you have smaller hands

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.859 
about it so if you have smaller hands
it's<00:02:00.119> probably<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.810> difficult

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it's probably going to be more difficult

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.929 
it's probably going to be more difficult
to<00:02:01.290> reach<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:01.950> across<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.549> width<00:02:02.759> of

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
to reach all the way across the width of

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
plus and that's that it's going to start

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.000

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
with either of these so that's really

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.180 
with either of these so that's really
going<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.210> be<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.450> main<00:05:55.600> decision<00:05:56.080> maker<00:05:56.290> so<00:05:56.950> i

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
going to be the main decision maker so i

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.770 
going to be the main decision maker so i
don't<00:05:57.460> really<00:05:57.520> think<00:05:57.940> that<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.210> iphone<00:05:58.540> 6

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780

plus<00:05:58.840> is<00:05:59.170> going<00:05:59.290> to<00:05:59.350> be<00:05:59.440> incredibly<00:06:00.070> hard<00:06:00.370> to

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
plus is going to be incredibly hard to

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.190 
plus is going to be incredibly hard to
use<00:06:00.790> i<00:06:01.030> don't<00:06:01.450> think<00:06:01.480> it's<00:06:01.690> going<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.840> be<00:06:01.990> too

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
use i don't think it's going to be too

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.780 
use i don't think it's going to be too
big<00:06:02.500> i<00:06:02.680> think<00:06:02.860> it's<00:06:02.950> going<00:06:03.040> to<00:06:03.100> be<00:06:03.220> great<00:06:03.460> for

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790
