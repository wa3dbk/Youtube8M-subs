that's<00:02:06.150> where<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> SAS<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.650> where<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:07.830> was

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
that's where the SAS that's where I was

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.150 
that's where the SAS that's where I was
on<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.850> right<00:02:09.030> hand<00:02:09.240> side<00:02:09.440> my<00:02:10.440> friend<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.130> a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
there stood in front of the ship now the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.360 
there stood in front of the ship now the
when<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.170> reptilians<00:02:19.650> walked<00:02:19.890> past<00:02:20.160> my

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
when the reptilians walked past my

when the reptilians walked past my
friend<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:20.940> them<00:02:21.420> if<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.660> slow<00:02:21.959> it

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
to the reptilians where they just been

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.000 
to the reptilians where they just been
learned<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.290> again<00:02:58.590> these<00:02:58.739> little

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
these small cube type devices and these

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.340 
these small cube type devices and these
kids<00:03:02.700> talked<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.269> us<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.630> do<00:03:03.690> they<00:03:04.049> have

to do we we brought this craft down with
these<00:03:23.250> cubes<00:03:23.930> against<00:03:24.930> some<00:03:25.140> kind<00:03:25.350> of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
these cubes against some kind of

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.120 
these cubes against some kind of
particle<00:03:26.040> beam-weapons

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
particle beam-weapons

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.400 
particle beam-weapons
and<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.430> end<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.880> as<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.600> can<00:03:30.989> see<00:03:31.200> the

and I just end it as you can see the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:44.230 
and I just end it as you can see the
craft<00:03:31.980> has<00:03:32.190> been<00:03:32.400> shot<00:03:32.910> down<00:03:33.170> behind
