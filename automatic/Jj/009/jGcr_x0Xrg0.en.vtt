00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 good afternoon dear viewers and guests 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.120
 of my channel with you Victoria snowy 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.780
 and in this video we will see our master 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.160
 classes tom how to make a cream for 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.279
 polymer clay cakes 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.689
 with the help of gel from them yes many 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.580
 asked about this to many it will be 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.580
 interesting but let's get started 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.250
 in order to make the cream in principle 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.860
 she doesn't need a lot of things 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.340
 you will need white polymer clay 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.190
 colors for its versatility and females 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.309
 grave if you want to make a color 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.420
 cream i have two options either you take 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.540
 colored piece of clay or else you take 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.019
 acrylic also white plastic and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.030
 already add acrylic paints to that 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.360
 the mixture that we get now and 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.610
 give the desired color 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.000
 we cut small pieces so that our time is all 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.390
 mixed and wetted abundantly fimo 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.630
 gel and take the wand my case up 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.990
 back sushi stick 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.640
 we start to knead the clay and do on those 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.649
 pore until we get homogeneous 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:32.210
 weight as needed can 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:36.740
 add fimo gel to get 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.649
 more fluid cream but also look not 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.920
 go too far with this material to 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.729
 the cream on your husband is completely liquid well 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.660
 stir the gray mixture to make it 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.179
 was homogeneous so there were no lumps 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.190
 that is, in fact you must achieve 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:59.649
 the consistency of the cream that you 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.649
 usually see on cakes 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.740
 well now let's go directly to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.150
 the process of making the cakes themselves is 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.210
 not easy 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.830
 it was already about one of mine 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.800
 master classes will choose a polymer 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.510
 Clay roll it with just 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.130
 cars or with 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.959
 acrylic roller and then cut out than 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.430
 it is convenient for you to do round cakes 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.720
 I advise you to do a few to 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.440
 it was more interesting and only then 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.800
 fold 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.040
 those cakes that I want here for example 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.690
 decided to make a big batch of cake 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.110
 there were more than 40 pieces and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.940
 used white crimson cakes 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.940
 brown first colors 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.200
 Well, so that our cake looked 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.520
 more carefully we will make these stripes 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.880
 him on the side we wrap so to speak 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:14.790
 our blind and special layers 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.799
 tool we will press polymer clay 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.970
 so that we get such a homogeneous 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.850
 mass and in order to texture also 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.290
 came out homogeneous let's go 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.980
 a toothbrush giving texture to us some 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.830
 so you know 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.200
 baking brush advise you to take tough 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.390
 I bristle by the way brush from fix 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.500
 price for such things she just 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.170
 great fit 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.930
 and u brush her teeth of course not at all 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.180
 it is worth the teacher on striking simplicity 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.170
 polymer hell we do it 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.170
 really liked 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.800
 Now we will make the cream on the cake 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.850
 take white long sausages 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:11.480
 We roll up their here such here and head of PM 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:17.520
 Already in a circle will issue our cake 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:19.710
 it is simple the only thing that all this 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.960
 a process in such scope in which earlier 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.850
 respond took quite a big 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.220
 the amount of time we cut our cake 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.750
 someone as convenient someone cuts immediately 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.980
 someone here in halves 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.970
 separates them so look way 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:43.020
 cutting what is most convenient for you 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.090
 so that your blade is sharp and the layers are not 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.190
 crumpled 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.660
 like this, and immediately he got pieces 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.110
 and now we are dealt with 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.940
 directly already fimo gel well and how 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.980
 was you to the cream that us 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.070
 I will use nail 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.630
 decorating sausages 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.390
 you can make them yourself 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.070
 purchase specialized stores 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.820
 after I made here such here 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:12.830
 lightly baked candy 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.830
 polymer clay and finely chopped 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.660
 well, now everything is very simple we take 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.130
 put a piece of cake with a toothpick on 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:26.580
 him our delicious cream and stick it 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:30.380
 what we need after we do it 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.120
 let's do it together with polymer clay 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.180
 all this is our good at this temperature 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.700
 which is indicated on the packaging is 110 and 20 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.730
 degrees here at the time which is indicated 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.190
 on the packaging that is it is from 15 to 30 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.360
 minutes see as it is ready from 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.469
 the possibilities of your pike 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.449
 and at the end of our products already 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:55.419
 become hard the cream itself becomes 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:58.599
 solid nothing falls off anywhere 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:01.120
 great tool fimo gel in general is 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.310
 thing with its endless possibilities 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.689
 can be used as lines on 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.759
 products and as a means to translate 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:12.969
 images so see what 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:17.020
 best for you that's not important i appreciate 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:21.639
 as the maker of the cream but that's such here 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:25.750
 I got all the cakes 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:31.560
 look in the workshop synergy 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:36.900
 bracelets your possibilities are endless 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.900
 just sharpen your accuracy and skills 

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:44.979
 makes me very happy you are funny 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:49.830
 firmware on donuts and cakes great 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:49.830
 generally looks very joyfully rosy 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.469
 Thank you very much for your attention.
