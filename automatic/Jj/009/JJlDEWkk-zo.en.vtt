that for nine years the only thing I
know<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.539> her<00:00:18.810> job<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.350> has<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.619> with

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
know about her job is it has to with

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.010 
know about her job is it has to with
electricity<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.580> engineering<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.660> that's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
electricity and engineering and that's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.109 
electricity and engineering and that's
it<00:00:24.769> really<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.460> boring

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to me and she would use these technical

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
to me and she would use these technical
words<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> don't<00:00:31.769> understand<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.579> then

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
words that I don't understand and then

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.280 
words that I don't understand and then
she<00:00:33.120> would<00:00:33.239> dumb<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.899> smaller

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

technical<00:00:34.860> words<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.130> also<00:00:35.489> don't<00:00:36.120> understand

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
technical words I also don't understand

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.080 
technical words I also don't understand
it<00:00:37.950> would<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.340> frustrating<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:39.000> feel

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
like well right now I design schematics

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.980 
like well right now I design schematics
to<00:01:14.760> handle<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> downtown<00:01:15.450> power<00:01:15.720> grid

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to handle the downtown power grid

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.100 
to handle the downtown power grid
voltage<00:01:16.380> distribution<00:01:16.650> uh<00:01:17.360> what<00:01:18.360> yeah<00:01:18.840> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
voltage distribution uh what yeah and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.719 
voltage distribution uh what yeah and
I'm<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.229> what's<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> schematic<00:01:20.100> deal<00:01:20.280> said

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I'm like what's the schematic deal said

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.039 
I'm like what's the schematic deal said
well<00:01:20.880> schematic<00:01:21.210> doesn't<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.509> anything<00:01:21.869> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
well schematic doesn't do anything it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.330 
well schematic doesn't do anything it
just<00:01:22.200> shows<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> loads<00:01:22.830> being<00:01:23.009> carried

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
just shows that the loads being carried

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950 
just shows that the loads being carried
and<00:01:23.700> I'd<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.210> eighth<00:01:24.420> grade<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> make

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and I'd have to go eighth grade to make

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.749 
and I'd have to go eighth grade to make
myself<00:01:25.110> feel<00:01:25.380> better<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.770> um<00:01:26.040> I'll<00:01:26.520> show<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
myself feel better like um I'll show you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
myself feel better like um I'll show you
what<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.000> loads<00:01:27.180> gonna<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:27.479> carried<00:01:28.009> dan

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
I knew I'd have to work so hard and then

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.069 
I knew I'd have to work so hard and then
in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.000> end<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.299> would<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.540> suck<00:01:45.689> anyway<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
in the end it would just suck anyway you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.569 
in the end it would just suck anyway you
just<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.380> something<00:01:46.560> boring<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.159> wouldn't<00:01:47.430> care
