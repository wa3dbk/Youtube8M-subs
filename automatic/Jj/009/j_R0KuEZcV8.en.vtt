00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
are doing a band pull apart they will

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.140 
are doing a band pull apart they will
pull<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.920> band<00:00:23.100> apart<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.760> they'll<00:00:23.939> bring

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
their sternum to the band instead of the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920

band<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.699> their<00:00:26.849> sternum<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.300> they'll<00:00:27.449> hyper

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
band to their sternum so they'll hyper

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.460 
band to their sternum so they'll hyper
