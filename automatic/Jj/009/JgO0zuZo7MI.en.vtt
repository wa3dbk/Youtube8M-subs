00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 many boxing experts struck by two 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.680
 alexander povetkin aspects himself because 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.120
 that everyone expected that povetkin and burn but 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.330
 who gave what kind of us so 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.599
 transient that's what has n't yet produced 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.770
 lose the battle right that did everything 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.369
 were surprised sasha is getting 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.990
 with every fight that was killed by that moment 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.570
 how did he change his coach 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.380
 his cape began to train and he became 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.680
 the best and most effective battles 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.970
 will be further with the progression 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.949
 and yet I think that now everything goes to 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:49.019
 what is around the corner and revenge with 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:53.860
 Vladimir Klitschko and here is no longer 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:57.580
 it is known who will win on I think that Sasha 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.269
 will be very ready this will be in my opinion 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.869
 there are no official reviews yet 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.270
 I am sure that well, just say the last 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.630
 Here are two years after the fight Klitschko-Povetkin 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.640
 changed dad positive side 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.900
 Of course, of course, what is this? 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:24.330
 is expressed first in the same 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.330
 physicists how he became physically 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.399
 respectively 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.619
 Often this same here us knockout with peresom 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.909
 it was just lucky punch or lisina k 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.659
 prepared blow of course to all 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.869
 worked off tactically 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.329
 the second strategy was my strength be 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.979
 the second fight Povetkin-Klitschko what what 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:50.369
 the moment he can consider after the first fight 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:54.539
 and what can be done differently here already 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.740
 think about 1 god and something out there this 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.159
 correct errors here in general already 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.679
 the conversation is not worth it because that fight is like 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.200
 Sasha was then and what he is now 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.289
 these are two different 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.650
 Alexander Povetkin therefore now it 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.650
 will i think new strategy
