00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and on top of all that it's highly

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.350 
and on top of all that it's highly
resistant<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> fingerprints<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.970> did<00:01:09.119> notice

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
resistant to fingerprints we did notice

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.560 
resistant to fingerprints we did notice
however<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.280> backside<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:12.090> case<00:01:12.330> is

however that the backside of the case is
slightly<00:01:13.290> thicker<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.060> difference

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
slightly thicker but that's a difference

slightly thicker but that's a difference
that's<00:01:15.659> unlikely<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> bother<00:01:16.830> anyone<00:01:17.509> while

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that's unlikely to bother anyone while

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.570 
that's unlikely to bother anyone while
we<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> flap<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> flip<00:01:19.799> cover<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.430> its

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
we do like the flap a flip cover for its

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.880 
we do like the flap a flip cover for its
textured<00:01:21.119> surface<00:01:21.689> we're<00:01:22.140> somewhat<00:01:22.530> annoyed

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
textured surface we're somewhat annoyed

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.980 
textured surface we're somewhat annoyed
by<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> fact<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.729> when<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.450> closed<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
by the fact that when it's closed it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.649 
by the fact that when it's closed it
doesn't<00:01:25.290> want<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> leave<00:01:25.650> flat<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.280> place<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
doesn't want to leave flat in place it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.330 
doesn't want to leave flat in place it
would<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.990> nice<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.770> were<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> couple<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
would be nice if there were a couple of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.999 
would be nice if there were a couple of
magnets<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> hold<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.630> closed<00:01:31.049> another

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
magnets here to hold it closed another

magnets here to hold it closed another
thing<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.549> bothers<00:01:32.759> us<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
thing that bothers us is that when the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
thing that bothers us is that when the
smartphone<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.210> flip<00:01:36.420> cover

is<00:01:36.900> folded<00:01:37.710> around<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
is folded around the back it is

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580 
is folded around the back it is
difficult<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> operate<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.990> volume<00:01:40.380> rocker

difficult to operate the volume rocker
on<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> side<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.270> worries<00:01:42.540> us<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> most

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
on the side but what worries us the most

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.749 
on the side but what worries us the most
is<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.439> although<00:01:43.890> we've<00:01:44.189> been<00:01:44.220> using<00:01:44.520> this
