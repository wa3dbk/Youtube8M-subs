oxygen is quite nice it feels like quite

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.859 
oxygen is quite nice it feels like quite
expensive<00:01:16.789> very<00:01:17.719> light<00:01:17.990> though<00:01:20.680> all<00:01:21.680> right

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
expensive very light though all right

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:31.630 
expensive very light though all right
here<00:01:26.079> and<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:28.880> your<00:01:29.210> wire<00:01:30.220> quite<00:01:31.220> rubber

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
here and this is your wire quite rubber

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.389 
here and this is your wire quite rubber
in<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.000> way<00:01:32.649> it's<00:01:33.649> supposed<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:33.950> be<00:01:34.100> under

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
in this way it's supposed to be under

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.480 
in this way it's supposed to be under
can<00:01:34.670> gladly<00:01:35.799> tangle<00:01:36.799> resistance<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.909> that<00:01:39.490> so

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
can gladly tangle resistance is that so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.960 
can gladly tangle resistance is that so
it<00:01:40.549> comes<00:01:40.700> with<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.030> little<00:01:41.090> tag<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:48.970> so

it comes with this little tag on it so

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.719 
it comes with this little tag on it so
you<00:01:50.030> get<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.649> couple<00:01:51.649> more<00:01:53.319> yes<00:01:54.319> it<00:01:54.619> I<00:01:54.950> guess

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
you get a couple more yes it I guess

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.919

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
diverge son stop there and this is the

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.430 
diverge son stop there and this is the
right<00:02:10.789> one<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.799> it<00:02:12.799> just<00:02:13.510> rubber<00:02:14.510> eat<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
and then chrome bond around the top of

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:27.390 
and then chrome bond around the top of
law<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:24.700> quite<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.910> long<00:02:26.120> wire<00:02:26.420> actually

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
law and quite a long wire actually

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:36.680 
law and quite a long wire actually
surprised<00:02:28.400> me<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:30.410> mean<00:02:30.889> this<00:02:31.069> is<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.600> jack

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
