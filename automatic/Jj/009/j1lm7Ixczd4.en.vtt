00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.290
 today we are going to prepare a mousse of 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.020
 mango using the concentrated product 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.020
 is a base that mixes with either 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.820
 water with milk with liquors with any 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.119
 liquid product can you guys 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.850
 mix in what proportion to 2 by 12 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.940
 portions of concentrate on the one hand 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.860
 of the liquid either as I told you 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.690
 any sauce is not fruit liqueurs 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.070
 etc 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.180
 to start our dessert on the day of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.420
 today we are going to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.000
 to beat a little cream of the concentrate 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.250
 this is very important this comment 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.950
 what am I going to do because the product 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.540
 it has to be well beaten with very 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.850
 good consistency so that in the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.250
 moment that we add for 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.250
 continue let's add the water 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.550
 to the grenetina 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:12.970
 with a spatula we are going to integrate it well 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.790
 to later put it in the oven 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.130
 20 seconds microwave 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.130
 to add it to the mango pulp 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.420
 we introduce our big tub to the oven 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.780
 microwave for 20 seconds once 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.000
 our grenetina that we have it ready 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.690
 we are going to mix it 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.390
 with our mango sauce 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.570
 let's mix perfectly well for 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.660
 later add it to our 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.200
 base concentrate and we will go 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.180
 Mixing is important to always 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.330
 mix well so that all 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.700
 flavors the grenetina the cream take good 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.310
 consistency for when we put it in 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 our ring in our mold in the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.260
 that we are going to give it the form always have 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.510
 a good consistency and you can 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.430
 refrigerate without any problem already 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.500
 we have our mousse ready we have 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.200
 our plate we have our ring 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.470
 ready in the middle part 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.110
 that cut the center of a cake nothing 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.700
 more to give him a little body in 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.940
 our mousse once since what 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.610
 we unmold but this you can 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.950
 make vanilla chocolate bread 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.519
 strawberry according to him the flavor of the mus that 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.519
 are going to make then let's start 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.519
 putting up 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.900
 our mus 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.459
 we go with the same spatula 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.099
 we help ourselves to extend perfectly 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.350
 well on the mold trying not to 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.170
 no space left 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.470
 without extending we leave this layer 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.599
 later we put another layer to 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.680
 give a little more strength to our 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:07.560
 bus and we finished everything in our cream and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.350
 when all our mousse for 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.030
 perfectly cover our mold 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.080
 let's try to do it as evenly 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.090
 removing all the surplus to put 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.340
 refrigerate 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.860
 since we have it once 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.090
 perfectly good when hoisting we can 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.610
 take is our mold and our mousse 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.810
 hit it a little bit at the base of 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.170
 our of our 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.970
 of our mus to get the air 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.180
 Y 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.240
 fill in those spaces that were left 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.590
 empty before filling our mold 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.660
 perfect 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.879
 and we will pass it on to our 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.830
 refrigerator and we will refrigerate it 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:58.500
 for 3 to 4 hours before decorating it and 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.940
 to present it once we have 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.180
 our mousse ready perfectly fine 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.010
 stuffing we saw that everything is fine 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.049
 covered that there is no any 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.690
 property or any space that we 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.819
 it is out there without covering we are going to 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.650
 move to the refrigerator for three 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.010
 four hours to continue the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:25.150
 decorating our dessert once 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:29.710
 already the mousse since we wait 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.980
 at 34 hours to unmold what 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.010
 we have it ready 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.050
 now I just put some 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.470
 chocolate decorations with a bit of 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.590
 mango sauce on top and 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.470
 Now what I'm going to prepare is a desire 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.770
 of chocolate with the concentrate that 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.650

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.660
 mix with cream either with a 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.930

 Mix perfectly well whenever 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.419
 be half and half for example if we are going to 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.389

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.539
 grams of chocolate we will use the 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.330
 same amount of concentrate or cream 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.250

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.330
 15 to 20 seconds to integrate it into this 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.699

 Microwave 20 seconds and 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.420
 I take it out like this until it is diluted 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.180
