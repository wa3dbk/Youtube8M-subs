00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.000
 My Lord. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Carmilla? 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.200
 It must be a dream ... 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.000
 And if you would not wake up from him anymore, 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
 would it matter? 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.200
 - Gabriel. - Marie. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 You are real? Do I dream again? 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 They told me what you would become. I had no choice. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Did they tell you that you would die from my hand? 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 They told you what fate awaits our son? 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 Yes? 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Trevor. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.400
 Trevor died a long time ago, father. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.700
 I'm Alucard. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Did they tell you that the same blood would fight with you for eternity? 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 You've been deceived, Marie. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Tell me... 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 Is God rewarding the faithful and devoted in this way? 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.750
 You are not a fool, Gabriel. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 I'm not Gabriel anymore, woman! 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 I am a dragon, Dracul! 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.700
 I am the Prince of Darkness. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.300
 I am and I will be a thorn in his side for ever! 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Here is my revenge! 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 BLOOD is FAMILY 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 BLOOD IS A POWER 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 BLOOD IS EVERYTHING 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 The time has come for you to come back to us. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 To your family.
