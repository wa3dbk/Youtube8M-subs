00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 sitting here at home writes that 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.379
 so hello people packed we turn here 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.780
 the new episode is not yours 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.960
 At home, you are at home at the desk 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 and ask yourself what the teacher then 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.869
 can you guys here? 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.669
 why is the guy with the camera behind 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.199
 Of course, the camera is just like that 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.779
 friends just want the new one 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 the consequence is not your serious make up 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.750
 Now I'm pretty much driving I think the result 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.250
 gets really cool 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.160
 we have a problem and we do 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.170
 So today I saw that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.670
 beloved wales johnson from america 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 exactly the video we used our 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.070
 I really want to use new episodes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.470
 Deeply point out that we do not 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.630
 such a fool and us are the fools 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.790
 watching videos of him and just 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.350
 His things are taking place in the hope that 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.150
 we'll get more clicks or that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 that our videos are just as good 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.860
 I definitely do not have that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.180
 video already seen on monday and have 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 that's why i use it now 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.440
 just do not bock the whole 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.810
 to change the script because I would have to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.400
 choose a new video and so on the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.159

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.159
