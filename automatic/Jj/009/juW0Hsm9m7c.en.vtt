 Dilma leaf 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.190
 this dish is very typical b national and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 traditional Armenian tradition that we 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.299
 We start every day but we eat at 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.520
 days revellion party di home there 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.280
 the whole family comes together and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.970
 roll the ground beef into the leaf 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.970
 of grape 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.400
 but people have to leave their grape skin 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.130
 as speech hydrate for one day for 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.500
 another because when he is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 conserved she is a little salty there 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.590
 when we leave salt water inside 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:54.510
 It's already filled I assumed I'll put 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:58.979
 one pert up because I did not really 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.229
 I really like to mess with the meat with a street. 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:08.509
 next to 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.509
 Let's mix rice with ground meat. 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.330
 then smell green 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.840
 now we get our cut onion 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:34.190
 take these parts and carry and motorcycle 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.190

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.540
 also more laborious than rolling the 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:28.110
 meat inside the grape leaf does not 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.540
