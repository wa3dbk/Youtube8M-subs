00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
to get some dirt out from inside there

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.590 
to get some dirt out from inside there
so<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.130> all<00:02:38.310> clean<00:02:38.670> before<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> put<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.360> on

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
so it's all clean before I put this on

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.450 
so it's all clean before I put this on
and<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:41.780> dry<00:02:42.780> paper<00:02:43.080> towel<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.740> get<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.100> dried

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
and a dry paper towel to get that dried

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.560 
and a dry paper towel to get that dried
up<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.770> that's<00:02:47.100> good<00:02:47.840> let's<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:49.020> the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
up and I think that's good let's get the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.290 
up and I think that's good let's get the
block<00:02:51.570> offs<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:54.290> allen<00:02:55.290> wrench<00:02:56.300> because

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
block offs and the allen wrench because

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.150 
block offs and the allen wrench because
this<00:02:57.710> uses<00:02:58.710> different<00:02:59.430> screws<00:03:00.650> okay<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:01.920> it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
this uses different screws okay so it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.440

actual white paint on the bike is a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.090 
actual white paint on the bike is a
little<00:03:22.950> there's<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.520> lot<00:03:23.700> more<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.600> pearl<00:03:25.560> or

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
the awkward holes there are mirrors so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.560 
the awkward holes there are mirrors so
it's<00:03:41.820> good<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> other<00:03:42.120> one<00:03:42.300> hond

we go
got<00:03:51.030> them<00:03:51.180> all<00:03:51.300> installed<00:03:52.640> there's<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.730> little

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
got them all installed there's a little

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.280 
got them all installed there's a little
bit<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:55.760> lack<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.790> overlap<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.780> bottom

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
bit of a lack of overlap on the bottom

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.260 
bit of a lack of overlap on the bottom
it<00:03:58.470> could<00:03:58.620> have<00:03:58.709> overlapped<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.670> little<00:03:59.880> more

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
it could have overlapped a little more

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.470 
it could have overlapped a little more
I've<00:04:00.660> been<00:04:00.810> shifted<00:04:01.230> down<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.440> bit<00:04:02.209> that's<00:04:03.209> on

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
I've been shifted down a bit that's on

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.500 
I've been shifted down a bit that's on
both<00:04:03.660> sides<00:04:04.160> but<00:04:05.160> other<00:04:05.550> than<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.330> looked

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
both sides but other than that it looked

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.740 
both sides but other than that it looked
pretty<00:04:06.660> good<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:08.220> color<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:08.850> little<00:04:08.970> off<00:04:09.540> I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
pretty good the color is a little off I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.820 
pretty good the color is a little off I
don't<00:04:09.900> know<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.080> it's<00:04:10.170> coming<00:04:10.380> up<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:10.739> the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
don't know if it's coming up on the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.410 
don't know if it's coming up on the
camera<00:04:11.250> much<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:14.060> probably<00:04:15.060> should<00:04:15.330> have

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
camera much but I probably should have

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.849 
camera much but I probably should have
just<00:04:15.540> gone<00:04:15.660> with<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.870> black<00:04:16.140> or<00:04:16.169> some<00:04:16.709> other

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
just gone with a black or some other

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.500 
just gone with a black or some other
like<00:04:17.160> design<00:04:17.549> rather<00:04:17.820> than<00:04:17.940> somebody<00:04:18.359> who's

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
like design rather than somebody who's

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.990 
like design rather than somebody who's
trying<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.810> blend<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.580> because<00:04:20.580> I<00:04:20.700> guess<00:04:20.850> I

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
trying to blend in because I guess I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.550 
trying to blend in because I guess I

completely<00:04:23.430> blended<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.180> design<00:04:24.720> when<00:04:25.590> you're

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
completely blended in design when you're

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.440 
completely blended in design when you're
dealing<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:26.040> paint<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.419> little
