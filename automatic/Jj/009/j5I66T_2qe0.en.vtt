00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.050 

we're<00:00:24.960> playing<00:00:25.230> these<00:00:25.380> sounds<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.550> animal<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
we're playing these sounds the animal is

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
we're playing these sounds the animal is
not<00:00:28.100> attracted<00:00:29.100> to<00:00:29.130> them<00:00:29.430> yet<00:00:30.650> maybe<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.770> factor

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
not attracted to them yet maybe a factor

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.380 
not attracted to them yet maybe a factor
of<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> noise<00:00:32.970> in<00:00:33.330> the<00:00:33.360> channel<00:00:35.180> we<00:00:36.180> don't

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
of all the noise in the channel we don't

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.970 
of all the noise in the channel we don't
we<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.690> don't<00:00:36.900> know<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.710> we're<00:00:37.830> trying

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
we just don't know so we're trying

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:58.070 
we just don't know so we're trying
different<00:00:38.370> kinds<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.730> sounds<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.780 

we<00:00:58.530> were<00:00:58.620> thinking<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:58.980> putting<00:00:59.220> our<00:00:59.490> small

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
we were thinking about putting our small

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.750 
we were thinking about putting our small
goat<00:00:59.970> in<00:01:00.210> tow<00:01:00.540> about<00:01:00.960> 50<00:01:01.320> feet<00:01:01.530> behind<00:01:02.040> us<00:01:02.370> we

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
goat in tow about 50 feet behind us we

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.010 
goat in tow about 50 feet behind us we
could<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.090> any<00:01:03.270> put<00:01:03.450> your<00:01:03.600> equipment<00:01:03.930> on

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
could do that any put your equipment on

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.690 
could do that any put your equipment on
that<00:01:04.199> over<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.620> side<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.550> would

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that over the side and then we would

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.420 
that over the side and then we would
just<00:01:05.880> tow<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.300> guys<00:01:06.630> along<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.860> problem<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
just tow you guys along the problem is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.080 
just tow you guys along the problem is
that<00:01:08.940> we<00:01:09.120> think<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.930> happening<00:01:10.530> is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
that we think that this happening is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
that we think that this happening is
that<00:01:12.090> there's<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:12.660> signal<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.380> coming<00:01:13.740> off

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that there's some signal it's coming off

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.570 
that there's some signal it's coming off
your<00:01:14.280> boat<00:01:14.550> in<00:01:15.510> general<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.950> causing<00:01:17.250> some

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
your boat in general that's causing some

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.040 
your boat in general that's causing some
kind<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.910> aversion<00:01:18.150> behavior<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
kind of aversion behavior and the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.900 
kind of aversion behavior and the
animals<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.500> moving<00:01:19.770> away<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:20.010> it<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.790> if

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
animals are moving away from it but if

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.300 
animals are moving away from it but if
we<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.170> these<00:01:22.290> boats<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we get it and one of these boats and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.109 
we get it and one of these boats and
move<00:01:23.490> away<00:01:23.610> from<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:25.380> look<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
move away from this because look the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.640 
move away from this because look the
animals<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.600> been<00:01:27.750> around<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> these

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
animals have been around all of these

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.310 
animals have been around all of these
small<00:01:28.950> boats<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.850> morning<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:31.140> wherever

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
small boats all morning now wherever

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.840 
small boats all morning now wherever
they<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.740> rather<00:01:32.009> they've<00:01:32.190> been<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.729> know

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
they are rather they've been you know

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.730 
they are rather they've been you know
they<00:01:33.060> leave<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.869> animals<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.320> always<00:01:34.530> stayed

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
they leave the animals of always stayed

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.350 
they leave the animals of always stayed
around<00:01:35.070> them<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.400> haven't<00:01:35.700> done<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
around them they haven't done a lot of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.560 
around them they haven't done a lot of
aversion<00:01:36.720> behavior<00:01:37.259> maybe<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.180> causing

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
aversion behavior maybe this is causing

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
aversion behavior maybe this is causing
some<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.369> signaling<00:01:41.369> who<00:01:41.580> knows<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:44.360> wish

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
some kind of signaling who knows I wish

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.850 
some kind of signaling who knows I wish
I<00:01:45.450> could<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
I could see more of them because you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
I could see more of them because you
just<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.190> these<00:01:47.340> glimpses<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.630> love

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
just get these glimpses and I would love

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
just get these glimpses and I would love
to<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.500> good<00:01:49.680> good<00:01:50.220> glimpse<00:01:50.399> of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to get a really good good glimpse of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.570 
to get a really good good glimpse of
them<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.800> sad<00:01:53.040> cuz<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> know

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
them it's just kind of sad cuz you know

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.300 
them it's just kind of sad cuz you know
she's<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.970> where<00:01:54.119> she's<00:01:54.300> supposed<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:55.310> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
she's not where she's supposed to be the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.859 
she's not where she's supposed to be the
rest<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> her<00:01:56.759> pod<00:01:56.970> has<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.540> gone<00:01:57.690> on

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
rest of her pod has probably gone on

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
some contact wheel feeding calls that I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.370 
some contact wheel feeding calls that I
believe<00:02:10.350> are<00:02:10.619> from<00:02:11.069> Alaska<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.840> he's<00:02:13.230> gonna
