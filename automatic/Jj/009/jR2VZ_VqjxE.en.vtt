00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 we pretended to lorenzo he won 4 to 0 at 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.170
 ad went up to the top of the table 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.369
 positions and here to the minute of game to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.560
 and it becomes over the coast and you win 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.300
 the yellow that would later be important 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.430
 for the development of the game 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.680
 vÃ­ctor ayala executes the criminal and torrico 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.420
 here in his right hand 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.570
 and here we have the right glove of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.570
 torrico 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.210
 so we see it three channels 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.809
 to highlight the lips of attraction of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.809
 attacks 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.830
 tell him it was criminal 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.830
 today we read that it was criminal 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.149
 that's how it was criminal as we are not going to give 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.860
 backwards 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.830
 happened in the game until the 39 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.140
 minutes there we see him he turned a ball 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.229
 killed is made space get the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.810
 just place we eliminate people who have 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.070
 the lefty they know are rare and latin 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.070
 come a match 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.549
 there is a current that says he killed that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.620
 I was ahead I have my doubts 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.060
 that exit where the clear ball is 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.800
 the truth that I do not doubt is one thing 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.240
 very fast that we should put the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.750
 ball in appropriate place as for 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.750
 can argue 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 While 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.650
 side is the teachers 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.500
 the complaint of guillermo in which 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.480
 they insulted and their game is played to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.880
 closed door here we have the rock to 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.990
 matÃ­as caruzzo at 43 minutes from 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.440
 first time noticed that there are obstacles 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.650
 imperceptible perfect infraction is 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.450
 perfect the double yellow 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.560
 it seemed to be complicated to san lorenzo 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.560
 the process of this 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.519
 forever 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.520
 it seemed like a few minutes were mauro 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.520
 Kills of produce seconds 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.800
 A) Yes 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.200
 if you are like this moment will be the next 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.180
 at 11 minutes penalty for san lorenzo 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.850
 more liberal you will see that Mauro takes it 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.850
 I kill clear penalties beyond the track 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.209
 Clear 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:09.420
 the criminal almost like he plays without thinking 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.420
 annp the arc and in 3 to 0 passing difficult 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.690
 and how much they live 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.570
 yes 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.050
 I'm talking about players 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.050
 make no mistake 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.680
 the head is so 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.770
 and turns the room is rediscovered with 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.770
 the 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:59.699
 and there is no data for a cluster of 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.740
 situations that you lead to 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.030
 protest in this way the party what 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.650
 we lose our responsibility to see 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.050
 what's lost we're not going to blame him 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.160
 to the referee to today's referee but they are 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:18.090
 timely plays that hurt us 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:19.500
 very much the criminal was very angry with 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.419
 the arbitrators and at a time that is the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.710
 game if he told you let's start talking 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.710
 because this is not the case anymore 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.100
 because the first goal in offside I do not 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.050
 I saw the play but they say what 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.940
 he started the second time in the 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.650
 second it was always the two of them 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.020
 first with say force and that in 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.360
 half meter and good very finite what I know 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.370
 where am I from I do not know what we started 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.610
 take out the book of complaints me too 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.610
 I have
