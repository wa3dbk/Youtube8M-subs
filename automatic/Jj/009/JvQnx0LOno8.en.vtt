00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.220 
of diversity but one thing I really want
to<00:00:20.250> make<00:00:20.369> sure<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.850> food<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.990> food

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to make sure I have is food and the food

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.250 
to make sure I have is food and the food
that's<00:00:22.560> coming<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.369> our<00:00:23.490> industrial

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
that's coming out of our industrial

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.070 
that's coming out of our industrial
conventional<00:00:25.260> agriculture<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.960> getting<00:00:27.960> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
conventional agriculture is getting to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.290 
conventional agriculture is getting to
be<00:00:28.109> very<00:00:28.680> poor<00:00:28.890> quality<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.670> sixty<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
be very poor quality you know sixty to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.030 
be very poor quality you know sixty to
seventy<00:00:30.660> percent<00:00:30.689> lower<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.260> nutrients<00:00:31.920> than

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
seventy percent lower in nutrients than

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.620 
seventy percent lower in nutrients than
it<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.340> before<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.270> whole<00:00:33.450> green

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
it was before this whole green

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.080 
it was before this whole green
revolution<00:00:34.200> started<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> last<00:00:35.670> century

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
revolution started in the last century

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.209 
revolution started in the last century
there<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.739> want<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> grow

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
there and so I want to I want to grow

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
there and so I want to I want to grow
food<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:38.940> more<00:00:38.969> nutrients<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
food that has a lot more nutrients in it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.900 
food that has a lot more nutrients in it
than<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.190> during<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.640> time

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
than that you know during that time

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.690 
than that you know during that time
we've<00:00:42.210> increased<00:00:42.989> pesticide<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:43.770> by<00:00:43.800> 1,000

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
we've increased pesticide use by 1,000

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.729 
we've increased pesticide use by 1,000
percent<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:46.379> still<00:00:46.620> getting

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
percent and that we're still getting

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.729 
percent and that we're still getting
crop<00:00:47.250> loss<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:48.030> from<00:00:48.570> insects<00:00:49.020> alone<00:00:49.320> crop

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
crop loss from from insects alone crop

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
crop loss from from insects alone crop
loss<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.190> doubled<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.820> where<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.300> pesticides

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
loss has doubled so where the pesticides

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.689 
loss has doubled so where the pesticides
aren't<00:00:51.989> working<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.320> well<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> they're

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
aren't working very well and they're

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.209 
aren't working very well and they're
contributing<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.600> loss<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.530> nutrients

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
contributing to this loss in nutrients

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.510 
contributing to this loss in nutrients
in<00:00:56.340> our<00:00:56.399> food<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.739> you've<00:00:58.949> read<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.219> blog

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
in our food so I if you've read my blog

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.010 
in our food so I if you've read my blog
you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.300> really<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.809> spend

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you know I don't really like to spend

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.479 
you know I don't really like to spend
too<00:01:01.109> much<00:01:01.199> time<00:01:01.260> complaining<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.370> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
too much time complaining about it I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
too much time complaining about it I
certainly<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.210> spent<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.690> being<00:01:04.019> down

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
certainly have spent time being down

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.539 
certainly have spent time being down
about<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.739> especially<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.400> first

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
about it especially when I was first

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.330 
about it especially when I was first
learning<00:01:05.909> about<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.200> stuff<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
learning about all this stuff but then I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
learning about all this stuff but then I
started<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> realize<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.750> make<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
started to realize that we can make a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.539 
started to realize that we can make a
difference<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.710> starting<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.310> our<00:01:11.430> own

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
difference you know starting in our own

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.960 
difference you know starting in our own
gardens<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.170> grow

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
gardens we can we can grow

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.399 
gardens we can we can grow
nutrient-dense<00:01:14.970> food<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.750> restore<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
nutrient-dense food we can restore the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
nutrient-dense food we can restore the
top<00:01:16.590> soil<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.130> been<00:01:17.220> degraded<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
top soil that's been degraded we can

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
top soil that's been degraded we can
clean<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> water<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.680> our<00:01:19.770> area<00:01:20.130> capture

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
clean up the water in our area capture

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
clean up the water in our area capture
rainwater<00:01:20.880> from<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> roof<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.500> can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
rainwater from the roof and we can

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.170 
rainwater from the roof and we can
really<00:01:22.860> create<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.369> inspirational

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
really create these inspirational

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
really create these inspirational
gardens<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.930> beautiful<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
gardens that are beautiful and and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.249 
gardens that are beautiful and and
provide<00:01:26.790> us<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.060> really<00:01:27.390> healthy<00:01:27.780> food<00:01:27.990> if

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
provide us with really healthy food if

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.990 
provide us with really healthy food if
we<00:01:28.320> learn<00:01:28.680> how<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:29.939> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
we learn how to really get in there and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
we learn how to really get in there and
build<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> soil<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.170> stuff<00:01:31.409> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
build up the soil and all that stuff so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.219 
build up the soil and all that stuff so
that's<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.549> main<00:01:32.729> goals<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.240> compost

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that's one of my main goals and compost

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.240 
that's one of my main goals and compost
is<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.490> uh<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.009> most

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
is is uh it's just one of the most

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.560 
is is uh it's just one of the most
important<00:01:38.700> tools<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.119> make<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> happen

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
important tools to make that happen

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780 
important tools to make that happen
there<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.500> sort<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> organic

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
there are really two sort of organic

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.520 
there are really two sort of organic
matter<00:01:41.970> tools<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> focus<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.439> my

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
matter tools that I focus on in my

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.399 
matter tools that I focus on in my
garden<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.549> first<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.270> compost<00:01:45.810> and

stuff<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.080> hasn't<00:03:19.530> hasn't<00:03:20.010> been<00:03:20.280> made<00:03:20.459> with

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
stuff that hasn't hasn't been made with

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.930 
stuff that hasn't hasn't been made with
like<00:03:20.850> paper<00:03:21.690> mill<00:03:22.050> waste<00:03:22.320> or<00:03:22.790> sewage<00:03:23.790> sludge

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
like paper mill waste or sewage sludge

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.560 
like paper mill waste or sewage sludge
any<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.510> kind<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.750> stuff<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:26.420> then<00:03:27.420> when

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
any of that kind of stuff and then when

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.260 
any of that kind of stuff and then when
it<00:03:27.660> comes<00:03:27.720> time<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.110> use<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:29.370> one<00:03:30.090> thing

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
it comes time to use it and one thing

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.520 
it comes time to use it and one thing
that<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.450> like<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.720> do<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.930> even<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.350> don't

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
that I like to do is even if I don't

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.199 
that I like to do is even if I don't
need<00:03:31.680> ya<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.100> bring<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.459> compost<00:03:32.820> onto<00:03:33.120> my

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
need ya I bring the compost onto my

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.120 
need ya I bring the compost onto my
property<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.930> let<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.200> sit<00:03:34.380> for<00:03:34.410> as<00:03:34.890> long

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
property and just let it sit for as long

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.260 
property and just let it sit for as long
as<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.550> know<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.670> month<00:03:35.880> or<00:03:36.000> two<00:03:36.120> or<00:03:36.150> three

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
as like you know a month or two or three

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.030 
as like you know a month or two or three
and<00:03:36.480> then<00:03:36.660> it'll<00:03:36.959> cure<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.320> little<00:03:37.620> more<00:03:37.800> than

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
and then it'll cure a little more than

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.860 
and then it'll cure a little more than
perhaps<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.940> did<00:03:39.150> at<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.330> composting

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
perhaps it did at the composting

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.720 
perhaps it did at the composting
facility<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.470> like<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.040> have<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.310> curing

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
facility I like it to have that curing

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.310 
facility I like it to have that curing
time<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.480> then<00:03:42.630> what<00:03:42.750> I'm<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.170> is

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
time so then what I'm going to do is

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.199 
time so then what I'm going to do is
you'll<00:03:43.470> see<00:03:43.680> when<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:43.920> prepare<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> soil<00:03:44.550> I'm

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
you'll see when I prepare the soil I'm

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.180 
you'll see when I prepare the soil I'm
going<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> take<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:46.290> least<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.739> couple<00:03:47.010> inches

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
going to take at least a couple inches

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.729 
going to take at least a couple inches
you<00:03:47.910> know<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.030> couple<00:03:48.270> inches<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:48.959> put<00:03:49.650> it

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
you know a couple inches of this put it

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.650 
you know a couple inches of this put it
on<00:03:49.830> my<00:03:50.010> soil<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.580> incorporate<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.300> in<00:03:51.420> there

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
on my soil and incorporate it in there

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.350 
on my soil and incorporate it in there
with<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> rototiller<00:03:52.739> or<00:03:53.100> with<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> pitchfork<00:03:53.760> or

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
with a rototiller or with a pitchfork or

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.300 
with a rototiller or with a pitchfork or
somehow<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:55.050> don't<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.830> do<00:03:55.950> too<00:03:55.980> much

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
somehow I don't like to do too much

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.490 
somehow I don't like to do too much
tilling<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.850> my<00:03:57.000> soil<00:03:57.270> in<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.600> long<00:03:57.780> run<00:03:58.020> but

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
tilling of my soil in the long run but

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.290 
tilling of my soil in the long run but
when<00:03:58.650> I'm<00:03:58.739> making<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.190> new<00:03:59.310> bed<00:03:59.520> especially<00:03:59.850> one

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
when I'm making a new bed especially one

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.229 
when I'm making a new bed especially one
that's<00:04:00.420> low<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:01.020> organic<00:04:01.170> matter<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:02.060> want<00:04:03.060> to

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
that's low in organic matter I want to

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.930 
that's low in organic matter I want to
incorporate<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.959> compost<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.709> there<00:04:05.100> as<00:04:05.880> you

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
incorporate that compost in there as you

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.660 
incorporate that compost in there as you
know<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.239> deep<00:04:06.450> as<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.690> can<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:08.310> and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
know as deep as I can really because and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.190 
know as deep as I can really because and
I<00:04:08.850> know<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.209> that's<00:04:09.660> actually<00:04:10.050> going<00:04:10.140> to

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
I know it's that's actually going to

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.750 
I know it's that's actually going to
hurt<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.500> soil<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.890> little<00:04:11.010> bit<00:04:11.250> what<00:04:11.400> I'm<00:04:11.489> when

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
hurt the soil a little bit what I'm when

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.100 
hurt the soil a little bit what I'm when
I'm<00:04:11.880> tilling<00:04:12.360> or<00:04:12.420> when<00:04:12.570> I'm<00:04:12.690> digging<00:04:13.019> like

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
I'm tilling or when I'm digging like

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.600 
I'm tilling or when I'm digging like
that<00:04:13.290> but<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.530> need<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:13.950> get<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.220> organic

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
that but I need to get that organic

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.430 
that but I need to get that organic
matter<00:04:14.730> in<00:04:14.940> there<00:04:15.060> at<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.269> beginning<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.810> so

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
matter in there at the beginning and so

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.680 
matter in there at the beginning and so
I<00:04:16.470> will<00:04:16.799> show<00:04:16.980> you<00:04:17.040> how<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.220> do<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.660> when<00:04:18.660> I

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
I will show you how to do that when I

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.000 
I will show you how to do that when I
get<00:04:18.810> doing<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.530> then<00:04:19.709> I'll<00:04:19.799> talk<00:04:19.980> about

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
get doing it and then I'll talk about

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.890 
get doing it and then I'll talk about
the<00:04:20.310> other<00:04:20.340> organic<00:04:20.970> matter<00:04:21.120> material<00:04:21.690> a

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
the other organic matter material a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.510 
the other organic matter material a
little<00:04:22.289> bit<00:04:22.380> later<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.740> once<00:04:23.039> I've<00:04:23.160> installed

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
little bit later on once I've installed

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.350 
little bit later on once I've installed
some<00:04:23.760> stuff<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.780> I'm<00:04:25.220> compost<00:04:26.220> really<00:04:27.030> useful

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
some stuff so I'm compost really useful

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.770 
some stuff so I'm compost really useful
to<00:04:27.539> learn

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
to learn

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.480 
to learn
how<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:27.900> make<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:28.440> but<00:04:28.740> until<00:04:29.070> then<00:04:29.250> it's

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
how to make it but until then it's

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.370 
how to make it but until then it's
useful<00:04:29.730> to<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.090> how<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.270> buy<00:04:30.480> it<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.900> you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
useful to know how to buy it and you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.790 
useful to know how to buy it and you
definitely<00:04:31.710> want<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.160> use<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.710> know

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
definitely want to use that and you know

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.550 
definitely want to use that and you know
I<00:04:34.860> guess<00:04:35.040> I<00:04:35.160> kind<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.930> skipped<00:04:36.930> an<00:04:37.139> important

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
I guess I kind of I skipped an important

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.990 
I guess I kind of I skipped an important
step<00:04:37.770> there<00:04:37.980> because<00:04:38.280> some<00:04:38.520> people<00:04:38.790> don't

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
step there because some people don't

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.300 
step there because some people don't
know<00:04:39.150> exactly<00:04:39.690> why<00:04:39.960> we<00:04:40.169> use<00:04:40.380> compost<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.980> so

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
know exactly why we use compost and so

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.830 
know exactly why we use compost and so
I'll<00:04:44.460> maybe<00:04:44.850> I'll<00:04:45.000> put<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.270> camera<00:04:45.510> back<00:04:45.660> up

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
I'll maybe I'll put the camera back up

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.930 
I'll maybe I'll put the camera back up
here<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.080> talk<00:04:46.230> about<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.620> because<00:04:47.310> that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
here and talk about that because that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.680 
here and talk about that because that
would<00:04:48.030> be<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> good<00:04:48.300> thing<00:04:48.389> to<00:04:48.450> talk<00:04:48.660> about

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
would be a good thing to talk about

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.770 
would be a good thing to talk about
wouldn't<00:04:49.050> it

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.340 

so<00:04:55.130> what<00:04:56.130> compost<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.730> is<00:04:56.970> it's<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:57.750> organic

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
so what compost is is it's it's organic

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.880 
so what compost is is it's it's organic
matter<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:59.190> has<00:04:59.370> been<00:04:59.810> broken<00:05:00.810> down<00:05:00.960> by

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
matter that has been broken down by

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.890 
matter that has been broken down by
microorganisms<00:05:02.280> largely<00:05:03.090> they<00:05:03.450> do<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.750> work

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
microorganisms largely they do the work

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.510 
microorganisms largely they do the work
of<00:05:04.110> breaking<00:05:04.560> down<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.710> organic<00:05:04.950> matter<00:05:05.280> and

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
of breaking down the organic matter and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.570 
of breaking down the organic matter and
that<00:05:05.640> can<00:05:05.790> be<00:05:05.910> manure<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:07.410> can<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.800> grass

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
that can be manure it can be grass

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.180 
that can be manure it can be grass
clippings<00:05:09.060> leaves<00:05:09.419> straw<00:05:10.410> any<00:05:10.800> kind<00:05:11.100> of

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
clippings leaves straw any kind of

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.720 
clippings leaves straw any kind of
anything<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.550> was<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:12.360> know<00:05:12.480> what's<00:05:12.750> alive

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
anything that was you know what's alive

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.390 
anything that was you know what's alive
and<00:05:15.260> what<00:05:16.260> happens<00:05:16.560> then<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:16.919> reason<00:05:17.310> we

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
and what happens then is the reason we

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.980 
and what happens then is the reason we
use<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.760> there<00:05:17.910> are<00:05:18.030> kind<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.450> three<00:05:18.720> main

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
use it there are kind of three main

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.520 
use it there are kind of three main
reasons<00:05:19.790> we<00:05:20.790> want<00:05:21.000> just<00:05:21.270> we<00:05:21.570> want<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.960> organic

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
reasons we want just we want the organic

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.140 
reasons we want just we want the organic
matter<00:05:22.680> because<00:05:23.010> we<00:05:23.130> want<00:05:23.340> some<00:05:23.700> of<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:23.940> to

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
matter because we want some of that to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.240 
matter because we want some of that to
turn<00:05:24.270> into<00:05:24.479> human<00:05:24.960> in<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.290> soil<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.860> that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
turn into human in the soil and and that

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.400 
turn into human in the soil and and that
does<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.430> lot<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.669> things<00:05:26.970> it<00:05:27.150> holds<00:05:27.960> water<00:05:28.169> and

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
does a lot of things it holds water and

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.370 
does a lot of things it holds water and
holds<00:05:28.860> nutrients<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.700> allows<00:05:30.540> for<00:05:30.570> air<00:05:31.020> in

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
holds nutrients and allows for air in

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.580 
holds nutrients and allows for air in
the<00:05:31.530> soil<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:33.510> just<00:05:33.690> it<00:05:33.990> does<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.380> lot<00:05:34.530> of

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
the soil and it just it does a lot of

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.040 
the soil and it just it does a lot of
good<00:05:35.070> stuff<00:05:35.280> for<00:05:35.310> us<00:05:35.610> also<00:05:36.450> it's<00:05:36.870> going<00:05:36.990> to

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
good stuff for us also it's going to

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.540 
good stuff for us also it's going to
have<00:05:37.260> nutrients<00:05:37.860> in<00:05:37.950> it<00:05:38.040> because<00:05:38.250> when<00:05:38.430> the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
have nutrients in it because when the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.580 
have nutrients in it because when the
microorganisms<00:05:39.270> broke<00:05:39.510> down<00:05:39.720> these<00:05:40.020> food

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
microorganisms broke down these food

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.830 
microorganisms broke down these food
scraps<00:05:40.979> manure<00:05:41.400> leaves<00:05:41.940> all<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.479> stuff<00:05:42.690> has

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
scraps manure leaves all that stuff has

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.800 
scraps manure leaves all that stuff has
nutrients<00:05:43.320> in<00:05:43.410> it<00:05:43.470> and<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:43.979> we<00:05:44.100> it's<00:05:44.669> really

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
nutrients in it and so we it's really

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.909 
nutrients in it and so we it's really
you<00:05:45.810> can't<00:05:46.110> technically<00:05:46.590> be<00:05:46.680> called<00:05:46.860> a

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
you can't technically be called a

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.290 
you can't technically be called a
fertilizer<00:05:47.340> but<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:47.669> can<00:05:47.789> kind<00:05:48.030> of<00:05:48.090> think<00:05:48.210> of

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
fertilizer but you can kind of think of

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.400 
fertilizer but you can kind of think of
it<00:05:48.419> like<00:05:48.479> that<00:05:48.630> it's<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.110> broad-spectrum

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
it like that it's a broad-spectrum

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.260 
it like that it's a broad-spectrum
fertilizer<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.430> has<00:05:50.550> a<00:05:50.580> lot<00:05:50.850> of<00:05:51.030> different

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
fertilizer it has a lot of different

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.940 
fertilizer it has a lot of different
nutrients<00:05:51.660> in<00:05:51.750> there<00:05:51.930> especially<00:05:52.229> if<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.830> was

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
nutrients in there especially if it was

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.590 
nutrients in there especially if it was
made<00:05:53.160> with<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.400> lot<00:05:53.610> of<00:05:53.640> different<00:05:54.030> sources<00:05:54.450> of

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
made with a lot of different sources of

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.140 
made with a lot of different sources of
organic<00:05:55.530> material<00:05:55.979> but<00:05:56.729> then<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.910> third

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
organic material but then the third

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.600 
organic material but then the third
reason<00:05:57.419> that<00:05:58.050> is<00:05:58.260> you<00:05:58.950> know<00:05:59.039> where<00:05:59.190> people<00:05:59.520> are

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
reason that is you know where people are

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.250 
reason that is you know where people are
starting<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.030> talk<00:06:00.150> about<00:06:00.210> it<00:06:00.510> more<00:06:00.720> but<00:06:00.930> to<00:06:01.140> me

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
starting to talk about it more but to me

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.320 
starting to talk about it more but to me
it's<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.680> most<00:06:01.710> important<00:06:02.340> or<00:06:02.490> certainly<00:06:03.150> up

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
it's the most important or certainly up

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.230 
it's the most important or certainly up
there<00:06:03.570> is<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:05.130> micro<00:06:05.430> organisms<00:06:05.910> are<00:06:06.030> still

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
there is the micro organisms are still

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.420 
there is the micro organisms are still
in<00:06:06.450> here<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:06.990> we<00:06:07.380> need<00:06:07.620> them<00:06:07.890> in<00:06:08.070> our<00:06:08.130> soil

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
in here and we need them in our soil

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.010 
in here and we need them in our soil
because<00:06:08.669> they<00:06:08.789> do<00:06:08.850> so<00:06:09.210> much<00:06:09.270> I'll<00:06:09.660> even<00:06:09.870> make

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
because they do so much I'll even make

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.020 
because they do so much I'll even make
another<00:06:10.289> video<00:06:10.530> on<00:06:10.919> them<00:06:11.190> because<00:06:11.760> they're

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
another video on them because they're

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.840 
another video on them because they're
just<00:06:12.120> so<00:06:12.210> important<00:06:12.780> so<00:06:13.260> we<00:06:14.010> run<00:06:14.190> oculi<00:06:14.729> ting

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
just so important so we run oculi ting

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.190 
just so important so we run oculi ting
our<00:06:14.970> garden<00:06:15.330> with<00:06:15.510> these<00:06:15.660> beneficial

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
our garden with these beneficial

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.550 
our garden with these beneficial
bacteria<00:06:16.380> and<00:06:16.919> fungi<00:06:17.430> and<00:06:17.539> protozoa<00:06:18.539> and<00:06:18.900> even

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
bacteria and fungi and protozoa and even

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.740 
bacteria and fungi and protozoa and even
little<00:06:19.770> animals<00:06:20.160> even<00:06:20.340> little<00:06:20.640> worms<00:06:20.910> insects

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
little animals even little worms insects

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.330 
little animals even little worms insects
we<00:06:22.289> want<00:06:22.530> all<00:06:22.740> of<00:06:22.770> them<00:06:23.010> in<00:06:23.130> our<00:06:23.190> garden

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
we want all of them in our garden

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.159 
we want all of them in our garden
because<00:06:23.700> they<00:06:23.850> do<00:06:23.910> you<00:06:24.840> know<00:06:24.930> they<00:06:25.110> do

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
because they do you know they do

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.590 
because they do you know they do
everything<00:06:25.800> to<00:06:26.039> make<00:06:26.280> the<00:06:26.550> soil<00:06:26.850> healthy<00:06:27.450> and

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
everything to make the soil healthy and

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.200 
everything to make the soil healthy and
alive<00:06:28.340> so<00:06:29.340> maybe<00:06:29.550> I'll<00:06:29.669> talk<00:06:29.820> about<00:06:29.850> that<00:06:30.150> more

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
alive so maybe I'll talk about that more

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.760 
alive so maybe I'll talk about that more
when<00:06:30.479> I<00:06:30.539> talk<00:06:30.720> about<00:06:30.840> microorganisms<00:06:31.650> but

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
when I talk about microorganisms but

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.360 
when I talk about microorganisms but
that's<00:06:31.979> why<00:06:33.050> we<00:06:34.050> want<00:06:34.289> to<00:06:34.350> use<00:06:34.410> compost<00:06:34.979> in<00:06:35.250> the

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
that's why we want to use compost in the

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.670 
that's why we want to use compost in the
soil<00:06:35.400> so<00:06:35.789> I<00:06:35.820> hope<00:06:36.120> you<00:06:36.330> will<00:06:36.539> get<00:06:37.409> into

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680
