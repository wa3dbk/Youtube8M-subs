00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to have that feel when you're playing

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530

with<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> band

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
with a band

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
with a band
you<00:01:09.930> can't<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.830> mean<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.250> be

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
you can't just be I mean you can be

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
you can't just be I mean you can be
amazingly<00:01:11.790> technical<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.630> play<00:01:12.840> with

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
amazingly technical but not play with

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.550 
amazingly technical but not play with
the<00:01:13.020> band<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:14.189> vice<00:01:14.520> versa<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:16.170> balanced

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the band or vice versa but it's balanced

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.370 
the band or vice versa but it's balanced
both<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.009> suppose<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.720> think<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.049> good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
both I suppose I think it's really good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530 
both I suppose I think it's really good
because<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.130> mean<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> soul<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
because I mean the soul is like a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780 
because I mean the soul is like a
challenge<00:01:21.960> speed<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> show<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.759> show<00:01:23.759> off

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
challenge speed to show off show off

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
challenge speed to show off show off
what<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> technical<00:01:24.750> ability<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
what you can do a technical ability and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.730 
what you can do a technical ability and
then<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.700> second<00:01:27.119> track<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
then the second track of the first of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
then the second track of the first of
the<00:01:28.860> two<00:01:29.009> tracks<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:30.329> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.990> way<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the two tracks is kind of a way of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
the two tracks is kind of a way of
showing<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.159> were<00:01:32.400> put<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> sort
