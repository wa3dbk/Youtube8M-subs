Scott's beat down is to work really hard
on<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.030> very<00:00:12.300> first<00:00:12.660> part<00:00:13.139> where<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.679> slowly

pattern<00:00:17.609> work<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.779> until<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.380> play

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
pattern work on that until you can play

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.620 
pattern work on that until you can play
without<00:00:19.770> even<00:00:20.250> thinking<00:00:20.390> remember<00:00:21.390> if<00:00:21.510> it

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
without even thinking remember if it

you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140

let<00:00:47.140> me<00:00:47.199> see<00:00:47.350> if<00:00:47.410> I<00:00:47.469> can<00:00:47.649> do<00:00:47.829> this<00:00:47.860> this<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.190> this

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
let me see if I can do this this is this

00:00:48.430 --> 00:01:37.050 
let me see if I can do this this is this
is<00:00:48.550> when<00:00:48.670> i<00:00:48.699> was<00:00:48.850> working<00:00:48.969> on<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.949> while<00:00:50.949> back
