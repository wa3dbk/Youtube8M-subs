a<00:00:00.149> little<00:00:00.900> section<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.350> comes<00:00:01.709> up<00:00:02.040> on<00:00:02.250> this

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
a little section that comes up on this

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.519 
a little section that comes up on this
rosebud<00:00:04.009> and<00:00:05.009> it's<00:00:05.279> really<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.549> shadow<00:00:06.529> which

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
rosebud and it's really a shadow which

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.910 
rosebud and it's really a shadow which
could<00:00:07.740> be<00:00:07.859> any<00:00:08.040> color<00:00:09.380> pulling<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> green<00:00:10.740> on

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
could be any color pulling the green on

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.520 
could be any color pulling the green on
top<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.340> red

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
top of the red

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.650 
top of the red
just<00:00:13.530> darkens<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.980> red<00:00:14.299> that<00:00:15.299> happens

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
just darkens the red that happens

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.269 
just darkens the red that happens
because<00:00:15.780> they're<00:00:16.109> complementary<00:00:16.680> colors<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
because they're complementary colors and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.510 
because they're complementary colors and
that's<00:00:17.430> another<00:00:17.730> day

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
that's another day

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.529 
that's another day
color<00:00:20.520> theory<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.390> fascinating<00:00:23.539> people

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
color theory is it's fascinating people

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.700 
color theory is it's fascinating people

and I couldn't figure out why I had them
but<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.039> knew<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> make<00:00:29.699> me<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
passed down and I'm just going to put a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.340 
passed down and I'm just going to put a
little<00:00:54.420> blob<00:00:56.000> clean<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.149> brush<00:00:57.449> dry<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.199> off

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 

so<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.770> dries<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.550> will<00:01:17.670> look<00:01:17.850> as

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so when that dries it will look as

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
so when that dries it will look as
though<00:01:18.150> you're<00:01:18.330> looking<00:01:18.510> through<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.080> leaf

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
though you're looking through that leaf

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.690 
though you're looking through that leaf
as<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.740> talked<00:01:19.950> before<00:01:22.280> we<00:01:23.280> did<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
as we talked before we did have that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.270 
as we talked before we did have that
little<00:01:23.970> triangle<00:01:25.760> somebody<00:01:26.760> covered<00:01:27.120> up<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
little triangle somebody covered up so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.620 
little triangle somebody covered up so
the<00:01:29.280> art<00:01:29.520> elves<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.090> come<00:01:30.300> in<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.570> you're

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the art elves they come in when you're

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.859 
the art elves they come in when you're
not<00:01:30.810> looking<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> change<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.250> painting

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.929 

dark<00:01:39.500> hair<00:01:39.680> dark<00:01:39.950> hair<00:01:40.070> not<00:01:40.430> dark<00:01:40.670> enough<00:01:40.759> here

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
dark hair dark hair not dark enough here

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.109 

and<00:02:01.929> then<00:02:02.380> I'm<00:02:02.469> just<00:02:02.530> going<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.799> soften<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
and then I'm just going to soften the

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.080 
and then I'm just going to soften the
yellow<00:02:04.359> on<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.630> side<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.020> fine<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:06.640> soften

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
yellow on the side is fine just soften

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:19.370 
yellow on the side is fine just soften
that<00:02:07.179> edge

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.110 

this<00:02:20.380> needs<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.770> dry<00:02:21.010> for<00:02:21.070> just<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.700> second

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this needs to dry for just a second

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.270 
this needs to dry for just a second
before<00:02:22.210> we<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.720> go<00:02:22.870> any<00:02:23.080> further<00:02:24.600> backgrounds

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
before we can go any further backgrounds

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.760 
before we can go any further backgrounds
optional<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:28.000> you're<00:02:28.150> doing<00:02:28.420> Rosebud's<00:02:29.410> for

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
optional if you're doing Rosebud's for

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.180 
optional if you're doing Rosebud's for
example<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.690> wanted<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.990> decide<00:02:32.710> what<00:02:33.010> to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
example and you wanted to decide what to

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.910 
example and you wanted to decide what to
use<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.640> background<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.210> want<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.480> think

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
use for a background you want to think

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.620 
use for a background you want to think
sometimes<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.160> what<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.790> would<00:02:36.940> see<00:02:37.209> when<00:02:37.480> you

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
sometimes of what you would see when you

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.990 
sometimes of what you would see when you
looked<00:02:37.870> at<00:02:37.959> this<00:02:38.080> rosebud<00:02:38.730> fairly<00:02:39.730> small

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
looked at this rosebud fairly small

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.760 
looked at this rosebud fairly small
fairly<00:02:40.510> close<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.930> ground<00:02:41.140> probably<00:02:41.560> a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
fairly close to the ground probably a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.130 
fairly close to the ground probably a
foot<00:02:42.040> or<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.209> think<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.110> were

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
foot or so so you think if you were

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.750 
foot or so so you think if you were
looking<00:02:44.620> at<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.980> from<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.220> angle<00:02:45.280> you'd

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
looking at it from this angle you'd

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.330 
looking at it from this angle you'd
probably<00:02:45.970> be<00:02:46.530> close<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.800> ground<00:02:47.980> looking

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
probably be close to the ground looking

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.220 
probably be close to the ground looking
up<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:49.060> maybe<00:02:49.240> you'd<00:02:49.390> see<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> sky<00:02:49.900> maybe

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
up so maybe you'd see the sky maybe

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.010 
up so maybe you'd see the sky maybe
you'd<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.650> some<00:02:50.970> green<00:02:51.970> some<00:02:52.360> more<00:02:52.570> roses

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
you'd see some green some more roses

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.580 
you'd see some green some more roses
some<00:02:53.290> more<00:02:53.470> flowers<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.720> tend<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.020> go<00:02:56.200> to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
some more flowers so you tend to go to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.729 
some more flowers so you tend to go to
things<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:56.890> make<00:02:57.100> sense<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.989> logic<00:02:58.989> has<00:02:59.470> a

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
things that make sense and logic has a

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.140 
things that make sense and logic has a
lot<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.190> do<00:03:00.340> with<00:03:00.600> success<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.790> think

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
lot to do with success so if you think

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.479 
lot to do with success so if you think
about<00:03:04.300> it<00:03:04.630> as<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:05.190> something<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.400> would

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
about it as a something that would

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.340 
about it as a something that would
actually<00:03:06.760> make<00:03:06.880> sense<00:03:07.150> then<00:03:07.480> it'll<00:03:08.050> get<00:03:08.200> you

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
actually make sense then it'll get you

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.210 
actually make sense then it'll get you
ahead<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.890> game<00:03:10.170> I'm<00:03:11.170> going<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.410> put<00:03:11.620> just

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
paint and leave it here I would end up

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.000 
paint and leave it here I would end up
with<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.970> halo<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.720> blue<00:03:41.320> that<00:03:41.560> came<00:03:41.739> up<00:03:41.890> to

this edge and just stopped

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.699 
this edge and just stopped
sometimes<00:03:44.320> it's<00:03:44.560> imperceptible<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.580> that's

sometimes it's imperceptible and that's

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.500 
sometimes it's imperceptible and that's
all<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:48.130> need<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.549> really<00:03:48.700> mess<00:03:49.120> up<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.360> good

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
all you need to really mess up a good

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
of paper with the water because I know

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.569 
of paper with the water because I know
that<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.760> gradual<00:03:58.420> transition<00:03:59.260> from<00:03:59.620> dark

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
that this gradual transition from dark

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.530 
that this gradual transition from dark
to<00:04:00.610> light<00:04:01.769> may<00:04:02.769> not<00:04:02.799> show<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.190> first<00:04:03.549> and<00:04:04.150> not

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
to light may not show it first and not

to light may not show it first and not
until<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.870> put<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:05.290> away<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.590> come<00:04:05.950> back<00:04:06.160> and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
until I put this away and come back and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.340 
until I put this away and come back and
get<00:04:06.519> ready<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.850> frame<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.420> then<00:04:07.570> go<00:04:07.750> oh<00:04:07.989> my

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
get ready to frame it and then go oh my

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.199 
get ready to frame it and then go oh my
god<00:04:09.329> karate

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.319 

how<00:04:15.209> do<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.420> know<00:04:15.599> when<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:17.269> everywhere<00:04:18.269> it

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
how do you know when it's everywhere it

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.599 
how do you know when it's everywhere it
needs<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.660> be<00:04:18.919> again<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.070> turn<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.370> on<00:04:20.430> its

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
needs to be again you turn it on its

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.800 
needs to be again you turn it on its
side<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.919> you'll<00:04:22.919> see<00:04:23.600> for<00:04:24.600> example<00:04:26.810> this

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
side and you'll see for example this

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.170 
side and you'll see for example this
white<00:04:28.110> space<00:04:29.300> hopefully<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.310> go<00:04:32.820> back<00:04:33.030> and

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
white space hopefully so you go back and

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.360 
white space hopefully so you go back and
you<00:04:33.270> fill<00:04:33.479> those<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:34.229> know<00:04:34.860> I'm<00:04:35.160> putting

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
you fill those in I know I'm putting

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.450 
you fill those in I know I'm putting
blue<00:04:35.760> on<00:04:35.940> here<00:04:36.500> blue<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:37.860> yellow<00:04:38.070> make<00:04:38.430> green

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
blue on here blue and yellow make green

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.340 
blue on here blue and yellow make green
so<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.240> can<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.080> right<00:04:40.260> across<00:04:42.350> there

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
so I can just do this right across there

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.600 
so I can just do this right across there
are<00:04:43.470> lots<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.710> things<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.040> can<00:04:44.160> worry<00:04:44.340> about

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
are lots of things you can worry about

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.100 
are lots of things you can worry about
and<00:04:44.760> this<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:44.880> not<00:04:45.150> one<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.389> them<00:04:47.720> my<00:04:48.720> favorite

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
and this is not one of them my favorite

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.290 
and this is not one of them my favorite
thing<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.320> tell<00:04:49.620> my<00:04:49.800> guys<00:04:50.010> is<00:04:50.370> find<00:04:51.090> something

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.480 

and<00:04:57.229> I'm<00:04:58.229> using<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.650> bigger<00:04:58.830> brush

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
and I'm using a bigger brush

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.310 
and I'm using a bigger brush

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
couldn't possibly do a great big

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.060 
couldn't possibly do a great big
painting<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.930> do<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.229> same<00:05:07.440> painting<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.919> do

painting you do the same painting you do

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.430 
painting you do the same painting you do
on<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> small<00:05:09.150> piece<00:05:09.389> of<00:05:09.419> paper<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:10.050> just<00:05:10.080> use

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
on a small piece of paper you just use

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:31.909 
on a small piece of paper you just use
bigger<00:05:10.710> brushes<00:05:13.639> so<00:05:14.639> it's<00:05:14.790> no<00:05:14.970> harder

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.409

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
I'm propping this up on the masking tape

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:43.080 
I'm propping this up on the masking tape
because<00:05:37.419> I<00:05:37.540> want<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:40.290> avoid<00:05:41.290> having<00:05:42.090> this
