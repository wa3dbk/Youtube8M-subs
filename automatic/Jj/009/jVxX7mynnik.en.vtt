00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.799
 Hello today is about a goal 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.690
 for the lick off I need 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.449
 now five liters that means 5 5 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:21.070
 I have three kilos of sugar 2 liters of warm 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:24.450
 water the top 5 liter bucket and that was 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.450
 it's that easy, too 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 there is still water in it 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.820
 continue again 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.369
 that does not take long now 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.380
 the one solution has become here and 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.610
 you have to do it a bit environmental now 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:59.020
 Let stand for an hour again 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 Stir and finished the arbor so the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.659
 is that what you a litter now 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.130
 get with it now become winter I 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.899
 want you on a line at least 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.500
 hibernate and for that they need stop 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.230
 a bit of food it is probably like that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.410
 the young vienna also build better if 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.660
 she really liquid feed evening 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.459
 I determined last year quite good 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.420
 Experiences made and was that 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.360
 continue now 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.489
 it is unreasonably expensive ambrosia is yes 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.580
 but a little bit of money and illusion 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.260
 and it looks like it's almost 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.430
 solved 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.380
 this is like wallpaper now 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.290
 So leaves the consistency of the paste 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.470
 But still shake something over 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.470
 sea 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.319
 That's it 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.540
 so gone a bit longer now 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.760
 the sugar has completely dissolved 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:58.219
 they keep you a little bit thinner 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.219
 even more water that's it 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:05.060
 and now I can do it one more time 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.060
 cool down a bit 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.900
 but that way or when I finish it 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.629
 makes for the spoils because I had me 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.969
 already gushing then I'll give the one here 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.500
 hydroculture already on top and then 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:26.060
 not try the bees also in there 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.060
 Let's go! 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.190
 First the bottle is done with it 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.620
 drive now on the stand can directly 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.940
 At present there tubes pure 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.239
 Tipping whatever you take bread 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.239
 the arbor is finished 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.630
 that was it from here and I wish you 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.630
 continue to enjoy the beekeeping
