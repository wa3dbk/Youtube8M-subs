00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.319 
head I've been seeing anybody else one
of<00:02:24.860> those<00:02:25.040> yet<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.549> I<00:02:25.579> ordered<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
of those yet and I ordered it for the

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.809 
of those yet and I ordered it for the
pro<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:28.090> seen<00:02:29.090> my<00:02:29.239> radio<00:02:29.569> out<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:29.989> then<00:02:30.170> I

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
pro and seen my radio out and then I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.660 
pro and seen my radio out and then I
think<00:02:31.819> for<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.060> next<00:02:33.040> three<00:02:34.040> or<00:02:34.069> four<00:02:34.160> months

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
think for the next three or four months

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
think for the next three or four months
I<00:02:34.760> might<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.209> park<00:02:35.930> all<00:02:36.110> my<00:02:36.290> helicopters

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
I might have to park all my helicopters

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.280 
I might have to park all my helicopters
so<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.750> could<00:02:38.930> save<00:02:39.140> some<00:02:39.349> money<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:41.290> guess

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
so I could save some money and I guess

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.960 
so I could save some money and I guess

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
see if I can find you an instruction

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.620 
see if I can find you an instruction
manual<00:03:21.739> cuz<00:03:22.250> just<00:03:22.700> possible<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.329> might<00:03:23.510> be

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
manual cuz just possible it might be

channel but yeah you want to use those
they<00:03:27.500> sell<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.099> splitters<00:03:28.849> like<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:29.959> plug

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
they sell the splitters like that plug

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.120 
they sell the splitters like that plug
into<00:03:30.349> your<00:03:30.590> receiver<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.239> could<00:03:32.540> plug<00:03:33.130> two

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
into your receiver so you could plug two

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.370 
into your receiver so you could plug two
devices<00:03:34.700> in<00:03:34.790> one<00:03:34.940> channel<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.959> then<00:03:36.200> you

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
devices in one channel and then you

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.039 
devices in one channel and then you
would<00:03:36.950> bind<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.489> channel<00:03:37.940> like<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.329> say<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.569> your

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
would bind a channel like to say to your

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.159 
would bind a channel like to say to your
to<00:03:39.889> your<00:03:39.919> throttle<00:03:40.489> hold<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.720> when<00:03:41.989> your

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
to your throttle hold so when your

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.470 
to your throttle hold so when your
throttle<00:03:42.769> hold<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.250> on<00:03:43.430> your<00:03:43.880> governor<00:03:44.269> could

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
throttle hold is on your governor could

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.240 
throttle hold is on your governor could
be<00:03:44.630> off<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.169> when<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.349> turn<00:03:45.590> your<00:03:45.829> throttle

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
be off and when you turn your throttle

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.610 
be off and when you turn your throttle
hold<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.700> your<00:03:47.480> governor<00:03:47.810> could<00:03:47.989> be<00:03:48.109> on<00:03:48.260> and

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
hold on your governor could be on and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.140 
hold on your governor could be on and
then<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.099> think<00:03:49.370> there's<00:03:49.669> a<00:03:49.760> way<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.000> you

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
then I think there's a way that you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.550 
then I think there's a way that you
could<00:03:50.299> actually<00:03:50.480> just<00:03:50.750> set<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.079> governor<00:03:51.410> to

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
could actually just set the governor to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.470 
could actually just set the governor to
come<00:03:52.010> on<00:03:52.160> when<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.489> turn<00:03:52.700> on<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.880> receiver<00:03:53.389> if

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
come on when you turn on a receiver if

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.629 
come on when you turn on a receiver if
you<00:03:53.569> got<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.750> splitter<00:03:54.079> you<00:03:54.400> know<00:03:55.400> when<00:03:55.549> you

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
you got a splitter you know when you

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.190 
you got a splitter you know when you
turn<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:55.849> your<00:03:55.970> transmitter<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.870> plug<00:03:57.079> in

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
turn on your transmitter and plug in

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.229 
turn on your transmitter and plug in
your<00:03:57.260> helicopter<00:03:57.859> that<00:03:58.340> governor<00:03:58.819> will<00:03:58.970> be<00:03:59.000> on

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
your helicopter that governor will be on

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.930 
your helicopter that governor will be on
automatically<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:01.250> governor<00:04:01.609> is<00:04:01.729> pretty

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
automatically and the governor is pretty

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.280 
automatically and the governor is pretty
good<00:04:02.180> because<00:04:02.419> you'll<00:04:02.660> keep<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:03.049> consistent

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
good because you'll keep a consistent

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.630 
good because you'll keep a consistent
heads

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
heads

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.449 
heads
when<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.239> just<00:04:06.480> hover<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.930> your<00:04:07.230> or<00:04:08.160> even

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
when you just hover in your or even

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.280 
when you just hover in your or even
doing<00:04:08.700> 3d<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.269> know<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.780> makes<00:04:10.140> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
doing 3d you know it makes the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.130 
doing 3d you know it makes the
helicopter<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.860> lot<00:04:11.040> more<00:04:11.250> stable<00:04:12.050> when<00:04:13.050> it

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
helicopter a lot more stable when it

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.870 
helicopter a lot more stable when it
keeps<00:04:13.290> one<00:04:13.590> head<00:04:13.769> speed<00:04:15.139> so<00:04:16.459> yeah<00:04:17.459> you're

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
keeps one head speed so yeah you're

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.300 
keeps one head speed so yeah you're
going<00:04:18.150> from<00:04:19.079> a<00:04:19.139> pitch<00:04:19.579> kurata<00:04:20.579> curbs<00:04:21.470> safe<00:04:22.470> for

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
going from a pitch kurata curbs safe for

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
example 25 50 75 100 you know you climb

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.950 
example 25 50 75 100 you know you climb
in<00:04:29.250> are<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.490> coming<00:04:30.030> down<00:04:30.180> but<00:04:30.510> when<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.780> got

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
in are you coming down but when you got
