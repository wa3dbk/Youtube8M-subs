natural number system

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.219 
natural number system
well<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.229> e-book<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:29.630> soon<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.810> be<00:04:30.840> video

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
well the e-book and soon to be video

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.520 
well the e-book and soon to be video
haven't<00:04:31.680> done<00:04:31.800> one<00:04:31.979> already<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:33.530> if

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
haven't done one already for that but if

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.170 
haven't done one already for that but if
we<00:04:34.770> think<00:04:35.010> about<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.430> song<00:04:35.669> as<00:04:35.820> being<00:04:36.030> in<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
we think about this song as being in the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.760 
we think about this song as being in the
key<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.450> D<00:04:38.810> six

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.350 

so<00:04:43.160> we<00:04:43.310> name<00:04:43.730> our<00:04:44.150> notes<00:04:44.630> in<00:04:44.990> our<00:04:45.260> major<00:04:45.470> scale

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
so we name our notes in our major scale

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:55.390 
so we name our notes in our major scale
1<00:04:47.360> 3<00:04:47.600> 1<00:04:48.020> through<00:04:48.290> 7<00:04:48.740> then<00:04:50.890> as<00:04:51.890> our<00:04:52.100> 1<00:04:53.980> our<00:04:54.980> a

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400
