00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 this is not just a suv of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.700
 hyundai no that's a steam engine 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.820
 a water steam engine allow the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.170
 ix35 fuel cell 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.179
 fuel cell vehicle with help 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.920
 just turned this fuel cell 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.840
 the asiate as one of the first 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 standard cars hydrogen in electric 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 energy and water vapor purely optical 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.340
 the steam generator differs 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.939
 not by conventionally driven 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.460
 models outside again inside under 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.350
 the hood works a 100 kw thicker 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.000
 Electric motor with a liter 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 Hydrogen 27 drives 8 kilometers 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.910
 Total reach just under 600 kilometers 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.039
 top speed 160 km h to buy 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 the korean is not the big one yet 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.020
 advantage is that to the outbreak here only 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.780
 pure water comes out disadvantages 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.600
 this system are in the moment with 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.760
 security mobility because there is 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 Germany only 15 gas stations now 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.030
 is added that this hydrogen 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.400
 vehicle only then refueled 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.689
 Can be when the tank under the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.630
 half is empty 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.220
 before you can not refuel one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.260
 even that limits the little bit 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.950
 if you are planning a longer route now 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.520
 where I want to go from a to b until 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.180
 At least 100 should be in 2017 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.130
 hydrogen refueling stations public 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.350
 accessible and in ten years 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.080
 nationwide network be present 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.210
 everything still future music after all 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.860
 Development and expansion could be 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.470
 be worth 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.729
 in comparison to a conventional one 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.060
 Electric vehicle being connected to the power outlet 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.549
 got to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.590
 and at the moment we are still relative 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.509
 long as wired one is with 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.729
 a hydrogen vehicle when 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.189
 Refueling five minutes actually 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.350
 fully mobile again and could at least 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.860
 the route munich berlin in one 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.860
 cope slippery 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.259
 at hyundai ix35 fuel cell is at the moment 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.569
 not yet freely available on the market 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.969
 Just watch the streets in fleets as a test 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.369
 and look at the eye-catching 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.920
 Adhesion on the side differs 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.110
 he visually looks in the outer light 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.220
 even a little bit under the sheet then 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.590
 you can see big difference 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.110
 mainly in the stern area that is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.959
 here in the trunk we have something 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.299
 less than in the normal 35 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.670
 variant and here under this cover 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.650
 then you see the so-called 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.650
 bubble where we go to franken 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.660
 if you are the first time with a 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.070
 fuel cell vehicle is on the way 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.320
 then you realize it drives like 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.720
 an electric vehicle also high 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.420
 torque amazing current too 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.340
 despite the heavy weight 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.690
 remains to hope that in the end more left over 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.690
 stays hot
