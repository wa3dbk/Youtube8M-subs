 I came from curiosity about the games Mario 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.920
 party 8 had their copies collected from 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.380
 shops in the UK due to the character 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 to say the spastic word to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.369
 word is considered extremely 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.140
 offensive in the UK as he comes 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.699
 been used to mock people 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 disabled 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.320
 an error was encountered in tomb raider 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 2013 in a part of the game where lara 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.230
 croft comes out of a blast just clothes stay 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.940

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 among the fortress 2 the weapon 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.620
 buffalo stick blood that would be a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.690
 pegeot a hallucinogenic cactus 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 the worst that would be added together with the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.489
 big tiff hat but the players of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.950
 test found a man with a headdress 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.780
 indigenous people beating people with the worst 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 type of anger pain in the hand would be 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 considered racism 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.649
 one of the languages invented nobody me 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.289
 Listen to thrones ray, I told you 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.140
 k series reference series and ray 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.629
 worth the word for the chain is good 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 which is a reference know bel lot 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.060
 of castlevania 2 that can evolve a 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 whip to a stream playing tetris 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.990
 after traumatic events can prevent 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.710
 the development of memories 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 traumatic 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 and reduce the chance of having 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 flashbacks had been planned lightly 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 playable with the theme of deadly kombat 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 n band am 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.869
 according to the sonic sega shows 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.759
 adventure is a schalke mutation 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.549
 by the edges of chaos 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.040
 according to portal writer 2 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.200
 érika the good valve originally 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.579
 planned to include gel that would allow 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.380
 sit on the walls 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.060
 unfortunately some players are 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 feel nauseous to use it 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.259
 I tried to reduce the frame rate 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.960
 than the camera movement but were 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 forced to abandon the idea 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 in infinite xote bailey the letter that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.979
 Elizabeth asks you to deliver later. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 This is what I'm a code for. 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.880
 I must be changed to something more official 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.649
 in the future but I suppose I'll be 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 a substitute for the time being 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.930
 developers or forgot to change 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.910
 or left as a joke in these 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.039
 Scene 3 a day if you go to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.920
 mansion camouflage on the outer walls 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.590
 and whistling the turkey will appear standing 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.630
 of you if you use the konami code one 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.959
 killer hood will appear on the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.610
 his head and bay shock a felipe 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.220
 whisper that you hear when you are 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.319
 using force by 71 is a dialogue of 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.230
 romeu and juliet of horn played 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.750
 otherwise according to the final end 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.970
 13 the team and omega in some 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.980
 moment was considered as 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.319
 main protagonist of the game 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.209
 the idea was rejected since the team of 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.250
 development had already launched a 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.450
 trailer and an art that featured 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 online in the leading role in green zone 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.080
 It is one of the shops that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.450
 on the second floor there is a graphite of 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.799
 an oval shape on the wall outside 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.170
 from the same wall 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.330
 You can find the figure again. 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.980
 reading a note close to her reveals 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.290
 that a scientist wanted to use the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.690
 travel long distances making a 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.670
 reference to port series 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.549
 according to the crash developer 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.769
 bang 4 delivered comes from neocortex is 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.950
 based on the pink drawing brain 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.109
 brain in the sylvania shop closed 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.150
 or rather the mayor the message of a 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.579
 skeleton mentions the condition of 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.030
 in the castle and how he would bother to 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.920
 even your brother Mario there is a control 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.859

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.440
 for sega's dreamcast he would have been 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.410
 used for airlies a sequence of 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.329
 night of the judge who also had rumors 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.790
 who was involved in the creation of 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.890
 super monkey ball series the sensor 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.130
 movement was eventually used to

 the maracas in viewtiful friend's samba

 joe has already been titled as red hot 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.549
 but has been changed due to 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.030
 copyright issues with the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.410
 friends 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.450
 the idea of ​​the character arose when he 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.139
 looked at the picture of the pizza with a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.239
 slice missing the only game to receive 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:15.620
 a perfect score in the magazine about

 You end the bonus stage of destroying 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.940
