00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello guys 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.949
 This is the second part of the video lesson. 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:12.089
 shows how to create a video communities subscriber selection menu 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.919
 and then worked with the bbb 9 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.509
 this is the program home screen 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.099
 here is harvested - the video system 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.189
 main 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.929
 imitated sc 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.929
 in theory this is the normal dvd standard 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.689
 then we will never be working with him 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.160
 this second option 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 normal time petersime normal movie 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.710
 this one is an ordinary dvd 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.930
 was a lower decision before 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.310
 if you want to use 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.400
 even on dvd and videos of various sizes 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.880
 the hearing is this one 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.880
 Maria appeared wild 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.260
 with this option you can work with video of different sizes 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.269
 here is simple in it you can only put 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.750
 could have this apparatus edict chapter but there will be no lower 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.720
 I'm going to use this option because my children are paulo we are not in the same 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.070
 Score 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.200
 romeo gomes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.080
 the first thing we do on the side bbb and causes to import to him all 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
 articles that will use our dvd 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.270
 an accident in this second option 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.100
 I'll start with 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 the production cut of the bbb 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.990
 is that the DVD kléber practically asking if I wanted to be for the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.660
 video walls 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.610
 the most recommended is to do this because if you are not separate 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.010
 he's sure to give lots of trouble so much 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.200

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.000

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.970

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.739
 maybe from here 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.919

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.279
