that's hanging out over the water and
this<00:00:38.600> one<00:00:38.840> wasn't<00:00:39.050> hanging<00:00:39.290> quite<00:00:39.800> like<00:00:40.040> we

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
this one wasn't hanging quite like we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.189 
this one wasn't hanging quite like we
wanted<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.699> so<00:00:41.180> what<00:00:41.360> I<00:00:41.390> did<00:00:41.510> was<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:41.900> shaved

wanted it to so what I did was I shaved
off<00:00:42.379> one<00:00:42.680> side<00:00:42.949> of<00:00:43.160> it<00:00:43.250> with<00:00:43.400> my<00:00:43.580> knife<00:00:43.820> and

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
off one side of it with my knife and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.840 
off one side of it with my knife and
split<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.080> broke<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:46.100> where<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.550> could

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
split it and broke it to where I could

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.880 
split it and broke it to where I could
kind<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.210> guide<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:47.900> push<00:00:48.379> it<00:00:48.589> into<00:00:48.800> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
kind of guide it and push it into the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.979 
kind of guide it and push it into the
direction<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.730> spot<00:00:50.089> that<00:00:50.330> I<00:00:50.390> want<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.780> tree

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
direction and spot that I want the tree

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.320 
direction and spot that I want the tree
to<00:00:51.140> actually<00:00:51.620> hang<00:00:51.830> so<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.760> know<00:00:52.850> just<00:00:53.120> pay

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
to actually hang so you know just pay

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.969 
to actually hang so you know just pay
attention<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.870> your<00:00:53.989> surroundings<00:00:54.170> and

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
basically what we're going to do is hang

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.149 
basically what we're going to do is hang
this<00:00:59.000> from<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.870> tip<00:01:00.080> of<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.409> tree<00:01:00.890> out<00:01:01.129> here

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
this from the tip of the tree out here

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.710 
this from the tip of the tree out here
and<00:01:01.640> then<00:01:01.760> we're<00:01:01.850> going<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.000> direct<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:02.479> down

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
and then we're going to direct it down

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.170 
and then we're going to direct it down
closer<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.409> spot<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:04.100> want<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:04.820> what

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
closer to the spot that we want and what

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.030 
closer to the spot that we want and what
happens<00:01:05.600> when<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.080> monofilament<00:01:06.530> you'll

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
happens when the monofilament you'll

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.590 
happens when the monofilament you'll
catch<00:01:07.310> your<00:01:07.490> monofilament<00:01:07.909> your<00:01:08.299> hook<00:01:08.479> and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
catch your monofilament your hook and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.140 
catch your monofilament your hook and
your<00:01:08.750> bait<00:01:08.930> down<00:01:09.200> here<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.770> when<00:01:10.460> he<00:01:10.490> sets<00:01:10.940> it

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
your bait down here and when he sets it

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.390 
your bait down here and when he sets it
or<00:01:11.450> when<00:01:11.720> they<00:01:11.840> pull<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:12.500> sets<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.920> hook<00:01:13.100> just

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
or when they pull it sets the hook just

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.399 
or when they pull it sets the hook just
like<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:13.760> would<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.720> we're<00:01:15.049> going<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.229> set

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
like you would so we're going to set

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.990 
like you would so we're going to set
that<00:01:15.560> up<00:01:15.620> here<00:01:15.950> in<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.070> next<00:01:16.250> few<00:01:16.399> seconds<00:01:16.850> and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
that up here in the next few seconds and

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.990 
that up here in the next few seconds and
show<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.299> how<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.600> works<00:01:18.520> all<00:01:19.520> right<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:19.850> we've

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
show you how it works all right so we've

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.090 
show you how it works all right so we've
got<00:01:20.180> our<00:01:20.299> yo-yo<00:01:20.659> tied<00:01:21.049> on<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.680> it's<00:01:21.979> a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
got our yo-yo tied on and it's a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.950 
got our yo-yo tied on and it's a
simplest<00:01:22.579> thing<00:01:22.759> in<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:22.939> world<00:01:23.000> like<00:01:23.539> I<00:01:23.689> said

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
simplest thing in the world like I said

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.770 
simplest thing in the world like I said
you<00:01:24.079> just<00:01:24.110> find<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.680> tree<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:26.060> is<00:01:26.270> hanging<00:01:26.689> out

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
you just find a tree that is hanging out

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.410 
you just find a tree that is hanging out
over<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.170> water<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.850> conform<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.390> to

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
over the water and just conform it to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.270 
over the water and just conform it to
the<00:01:29.600> way<00:01:29.719> that<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.049> need<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.560> then<00:01:31.009> take<00:01:31.250> a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the way that you need and then take a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.209 
the way that you need and then take a
piece<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:31.909> cordage<00:01:32.450> tie<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:34.100> know

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
piece of cordage tie it to the you know

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.190 
piece of cordage tie it to the you know
desired<00:01:34.609> length<00:01:35.000> where<00:01:35.359> it's<00:01:35.539> just<00:01:35.750> hanging

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
desired length where it's just hanging

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.870 
desired length where it's just hanging
just<00:01:36.409> above<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.859> water<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.430> not<00:01:37.549> in<00:01:37.759> the

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
just above the water and not in the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.730 
just above the water and not in the
water<00:01:38.090> even<00:01:38.689> though<00:01:38.899> you<00:01:39.020> can't<00:01:39.289> set<00:01:39.530> them<00:01:39.619> in

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
water even though you can't set them in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.340 
water even though you can't set them in
the<00:01:39.859> water<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.280> if<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:40.789> easy<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:42.020> like<00:01:42.200> to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the water and if it easy but I like to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.230 
the water and if it easy but I like to
keep<00:01:42.469> mine<00:01:42.710> above<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:43.399> when<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.850> hook

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
stuff that he can get hung up on so you

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.429 
stuff that he can get hung up on so you
tie<00:01:52.789> your<00:01:52.969> taut<00:01:53.240> line<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.810> here<00:01:54.020> attach<00:01:54.409> it

tie to this top loop here because that's

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:59.950

how<00:01:58.609> the<00:01:58.670> trigger<00:01:58.999> system<00:01:59.299> works<00:01:59.689> because

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
how the trigger system works because

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.779 
how the trigger system works because

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
when he pulls that it pulls this release

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.660 
when he pulls that it pulls this release
up<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.329> then<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.380> sets<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.950> hook<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.399> it'll

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
up and then it sets the hook and it'll

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.550 
up and then it sets the hook and it'll
keep<00:02:04.820> constant<00:02:05.420> tension<00:02:05.630> on<00:02:05.929> them<00:02:06.170> until<00:02:06.289> it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
keep constant tension on them until it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.889 
keep constant tension on them until it
wears<00:02:06.740> them<00:02:06.950> out<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.600> when<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.690> come<00:02:08.869> up

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899
