00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.510
 no one died 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.730
 March 12, 2015 in Philadelphia train 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.350
 got off the track the cause of the accident was 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.780
 that train and drove at a speed of one hundred 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.300
 sixty four kilometers per hour in the zone 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.220
 where the speed is limited to 80 kilometers in 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.370
 an hour as a result of the accident eight people 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.870
 more than 200 died injured so 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.430
 over the past fifteen years on 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.660
 railways united states 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 there were 10 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.770
 railway accidents causes 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.000
 which became abandoned cars 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.220
 on railway tracks 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.890
 driver fatigue that was right there 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.110
 fixed in 2015 as we saw 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.610
 frequent accidents with freight trains 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.590
 I think it is also very easy. 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.360
 due to the fact that over the past 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 several years in the United States went to the first 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.799
 oil production and export site 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.390
 I didnâ€™t view previous videos 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.690
 in 2015 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.290
 however it is worth noting that in 2015 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.519
 Rzhd already happened 7 accidents namely 22 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.709

 March 2, six cars went down on March 13 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.160
 one belt caught up with the other as a result 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.070
 39 wagons came off the rails on March 16 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.120

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.459
 Lipetsk region

 there was an accident when changing the locomotive 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.690
 which resulted in 26 injured 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.910

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.540
 move two people died over 30 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.760
 were injured and descended on Tver on May 11 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.799
 From the rails trolley locomotive interesting 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.180
 note that the number of accidents on 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.489
 railways usa past 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.010
 fifteen years and the number of accidents on 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.340
 rydzh for just five months of this 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.840
 years almost equally think when 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.000
 it is also important to note 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.940
 long rail length 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.970
 railways us 10 to 4 1792 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.820
 kilometers 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.860
 for comparison in Russia 85 thousand three hundred 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.080
 if you like, like it if 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.790
 you have any add-ons write about 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.810
 I want to add this in the comments 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.340
 if someone comments 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.830
 dilute the great and mighty 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.200
 with the help of Moto he will be banned for it 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.790
 I ask you to treat this with understanding she 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.410
 this is all good with you was a resident 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.410
