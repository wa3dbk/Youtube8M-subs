00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.630
 so then today we will be done 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 a little trick there you see there he goes there 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.770
 have a bathroom vanity 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 suspended so I'm just asking how 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 strengthen for fixing because 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.900
 should know that if it was just like 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 here there is going to be a little dryer 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.150
 towel 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.160
 so it does not really have any weight and that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.960
 works in this way it pulls at 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.030
 shear so the molly chevy 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.620
 adequate bathroom furniture 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 there is going to be a weight forward so 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 there will be a little bit of support and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.700
 especially the wrenching so there you have to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.690
 ensure the fasteners at the back so 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.180
 I had previously made a video where 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 there are negative points but I do not 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.090
 do not understand why since in fact 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 I will explain the same thing as 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.719
 now that is to say that you as you 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 will work to tear it off it takes 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.670
 that you have on fixing the back if 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.079
 you 're a heavy type furniture because 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 now we do stuff where there is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 bins inside that are jeans 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.200
 regret or I do not know what 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.580
 well, that makes a system 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.760
 tearing off if you rely on the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 buzz is not bad at all so you and 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.299
 to strengthen 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.189
 so you have two possibilities of fixing 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 in English we will put a board of 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 wood there and there also they furniture 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.590
 so when there is going to be the bindings to 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.189
 the back of the furniture is you will fall 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.470
 on scrap so banco be you're gonna 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.070
 fall on the board so a lot 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.509
 as well 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 that is, it will not only be 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.590
 the molly China that could draw and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 peanut blaco it will be fixing 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.799
 in the wood so a lot more of 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 taken and fixing in the world in 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.799
 the metal therefore the adapted ete with a paf 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.729
 a like to tear and banco too 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.649
 knowing that dallas well here look 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.530
 well 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.400
 go I bring you a little bit 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 here at the back I made a paste 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.570
 who comes between the two there hop and the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.140
 same thing on the other side of the board 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.150
 tak tak so as to block the advance of the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.319
 amount here to paddle to the wrenching 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.880
 a flexibility of the amount ok so you can 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.980
 so reinforced at the back and then that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.390
 it is to maintain your amount 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.180
 because the frankly hostile season 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.550
 so you go in optima where are arrested 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.260
 with intermediate nails that do not 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.050
 do not make as much existence of any 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.310
 way that what I did and in addition 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.820
 so the wooden planks for the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.070
 fasteners 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.239
 so ok it was short but it was good to 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.800
 know because so you go 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.110
 work so on tearing and a 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.239
 tearing is like for furniture 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.370
 senior cooks you put boards of the 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.720
 wood located at the fasteners 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.340
 so either you will fall on the busy 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.860
 or you will mostly fall on your wood 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.569
 it's nothing to insert in your ferrat is 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.269
 by the way generally expect even 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.069
 to deform it okay you inserts 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.850
 before and you leave your little ones 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.739
 quiet scrap 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.790
 well it will be the same because when you have 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.130
 two set either you will fall on the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.630
 wood you will put adapted levis either 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.489
 will fall to ferrals and you will put 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.930
 davis adapted too and will avoid 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 that he falls is to try to insert it 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.630
 in your editing and try to manage that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.519
 ok well listen on this I let you 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.079
 mount your furniture and then now 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.260
 will be safe 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:21.660
 go to more of a sudden launched the end 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 look at a small screw a small screw 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.720
 a small screw a little screw here 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.340
 it's the boards I put 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.170
 I put once after putting the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.690
 plate two little screws history of them 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.280
 keep tacked against that's on this 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.359
 base there and no worries since after 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.730
 the more you when you 're going to be the bindings 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.560
 to put your Basque people that's who 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.170
 will be suspended you will support 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.820
 on it you will take them back on the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.470
 vices end on the boards that are 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.049
 behind so it's going 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.000
 plated against a logic os x 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.590
 logical hours at the pier levis that I have 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.940
 put at the service just to maintain the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.989
 position story it does not break the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.230
 figure of the war as we had put 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.660
 just had some scotchs ok good bah listen 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.890
 we went around we went around 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.350
 go one more on the bus 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.069
 yeah I still insists no rim my 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.069
 rights of jokes null
