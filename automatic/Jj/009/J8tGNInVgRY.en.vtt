attention<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.960> little<00:02:40.260> details<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.950> they

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
attention to little details and they

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.100 
attention to little details and they
really<00:02:41.910> stepped<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.330> up<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.750> release

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
really stepped it up for this release

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.660 
really stepped it up for this release
which<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.920> awesome<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:46.280> pumped<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
which is awesome and I was pumped on the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.040 
which is awesome and I was pumped on the
build<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.300> went<00:02:48.540> awesome

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
build it went awesome

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.530 
build it went awesome
for<00:02:49.770> some<00:02:49.980> reason<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.430> diff<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.000> same<00:02:51.210> as

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
for some reason this diff is the same as

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.580 
for some reason this diff is the same as
my<00:02:51.990> B<00:02:52.170> fives<00:02:52.790> but<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:54.900> super<00:02:55.290> smooth

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
my B fives but it's just super smooth

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.350 
my B fives but it's just super smooth
and<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.860> don't<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:56.190> why<00:02:56.340> I've<00:02:56.550> broken<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.150> in

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and I don't know why I've broken it in

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.080 
and I don't know why I've broken it in
everything<00:02:58.050> broken<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.710> setup<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.790> car

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
everything broken in setup on this car

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.699 
everything broken in setup on this car
already

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
already

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.430 
already
but<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:04.100> don't<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.340> distance<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:06.030> like

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
but I don't this distance just like

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.650 
but I don't this distance just like
ridiculously<00:03:07.440> smooth<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.220> everyone<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.570> I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
ridiculously smooth and everyone that I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.370 
ridiculously smooth and everyone that I
showed<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.380> wow<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:12.380> then

showed it to is like wow but then
another<00:03:13.680> little<00:03:14.100> detail<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.520> they<00:03:14.760> did<00:03:15.330> this

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
another little detail that they did this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.860 
another little detail that they did this
chassis<00:03:16.560> cradle<00:03:16.920> right<00:03:17.100> here<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:18.209> b5<00:03:18.630> it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
chassis cradle right here on the b5 it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.320 
chassis cradle right here on the b5 it
was<00:03:19.110> flushed<00:03:19.410> with<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> chassis<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.580> people

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
was flushed with the chassis and people

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.820 
was flushed with the chassis and people
are<00:03:21.420> running<00:03:21.600> their<00:03:21.870> sensor<00:03:22.170> wires<00:03:22.350> under<00:03:22.740> it

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
are running their sensor wires under it

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.020 
are running their sensor wires under it
and<00:03:23.070> kind<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.370> crushing<00:03:23.790> it

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
and kind of crushing it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.270 
and kind of crushing it
well<00:03:24.480> now<00:03:24.630> they<00:03:24.840> cut<00:03:25.140> out<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> little<00:03:25.620> U<00:03:25.950> shape

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
well now they cut out a little U shape

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.729 
well now they cut out a little U shape
for<00:03:27.209> your<00:03:27.330> sensor<00:03:27.690> wire<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.110> go<00:03:28.200> right<00:03:28.440> under

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
for your sensor wire to go right under

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.910 
for your sensor wire to go right under
it's<00:03:29.580> just<00:03:29.760> nice<00:03:30.540> but<00:03:30.930> now<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.620> nice<00:03:31.890> and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
it's just nice but now it's nice and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.350 
it's just nice but now it's nice and
neat<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.550> don't<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.000> remove<00:03:33.180> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
neat and you don't have to remove the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.600 
neat and you don't have to remove the
cradle<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.989> remove<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.380> sensor<00:03:34.709> wire<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.550> if

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
cradle to remove the sensor wire so if

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.280 
cradle to remove the sensor wire so if
you<00:03:35.700> run<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> chassis<00:03:36.480> protector<00:03:36.989> you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
you run like a chassis protector you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.410 
you run like a chassis protector you
know<00:03:37.410> along<00:03:37.620> you're<00:03:37.860> have<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.310> take<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.300> off

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
know along you're have to take it off

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.300 
know along you're have to take it off
just<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.870> pull<00:03:40.050> your<00:03:40.170> electronics<00:03:40.769> out<00:03:40.980> or

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
just to pull your electronics out or

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.100 
just to pull your electronics out or
change<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.880> sense<00:03:42.120> for<00:03:42.269> wire<00:03:42.420> change<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.900> speed

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
change a sense for wire change of speed

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.940 
change a sense for wire change of speed
control<00:03:43.700> anything<00:03:44.700> stupid<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.950> so

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
control anything stupid like that so

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.470 
control anything stupid like that so
that<00:03:47.070> was<00:03:47.280> an<00:03:47.400> awesome<00:03:47.519> little<00:03:47.850> detail<00:03:48.330> that

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
they paid attention to and then the bail

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.030 
they paid attention to and then the bail
just<00:03:54.570> went<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:54.959> smooth<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
just went really smooth in the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.949 
just went really smooth in the
instruction<00:03:56.610> manual<00:03:56.640> there's<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.600> lot<00:03:57.810> of

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
instruction manual there's a lot of

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.680 
instruction manual there's a lot of
little<00:03:58.200> details<00:03:58.230> again<00:03:59.010> on<00:03:59.280> notes<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:00.390> things

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
that they've learned from the b5m and I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.050 
that they've learned from the b5m and I
didn't<00:04:04.530> use<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> stock<00:04:05.100> club<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:05.640> if<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.850> do

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
didn't use the stock club but if you do

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.940 
didn't use the stock club but if you do
they<00:04:06.780> even<00:04:06.840> there

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
they even there

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.280

now<00:04:08.610> put<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.910> lock<00:04:09.150> nut<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.720> backside<00:04:09.930> of

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
now put a lock nut on the backside of

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.290 
now put a lock nut on the backside of
the<00:04:10.500> Ballston<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.910> would<00:04:12.030> stop

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
the Ballston so that it would stop

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.020 
the Ballston so that it would stop
backing<00:04:12.600> out<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:12.900> everyone<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:14.459> are<00:04:14.610> using

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
backing out on everyone if you are using

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.789 
backing out on everyone if you are using
those<00:04:15.150> hubs<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:16.109> there's<00:04:16.320> like<00:04:16.530> another

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
those hubs so there's like another

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.469 
those hubs so there's like another
little<00:04:17.190> detail<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:19.790> well<00:04:20.790> that's<00:04:21.299> pretty

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
little detail and well that's pretty

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.270 
little detail and well that's pretty
much<00:04:21.630> all<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.080> they<00:04:22.200> update<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.500> they<00:04:23.010> didn't

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
much all that they update it they didn't

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.670 
much all that they update it they didn't
however<00:04:23.430> update<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.090> ball<00:04:24.270> cups<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.169> I'll<00:04:25.470> get

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
however update the ball cups so I'll get

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.980 
however update the ball cups so I'll get
into<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.760> new<00:04:26.880> ball<00:04:27.120> cups<00:04:27.450> we're

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
into that the new ball cups we're

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.440 
into that the new ball cups we're
supposed<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.380> not<00:04:28.560> stick<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.550> c-minor<00:04:30.150> a

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
supposed to not stick so c-minor a

supposed to not stick so c-minor a
little<00:04:31.080> tight<00:04:31.580> kind<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.760> sucks

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
little tight kind of sucks

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.940 
little tight kind of sucks

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
actually how it's supposed to feel but I

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.750

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.510 
about recalling to run the car ended up
putting<00:05:50.840> a<00:05:50.990> bad<00:05:51.169> sensor<00:05:51.650> iron<00:05:51.860> when<00:05:52.190> I<00:05:52.220> built

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
putting a bad sensor iron when I built

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.830 
putting a bad sensor iron when I built
it<00:05:52.700> so<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:54.310> had<00:05:55.310> no<00:05:55.520> power<00:05:55.730> to<00:05:55.880> my<00:05:56.120> motor<00:05:56.360> and

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
it so the I had no power to my motor and

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.240 
it so the I had no power to my motor and
actually<00:05:57.169> had<00:05:57.320> it<00:05:57.440> all<00:05:57.590> ready<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.980> go<00:05:58.040> with<00:05:58.160> the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
actually had it all ready to go with the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.409 
actually had it all ready to go with the
track<00:05:58.490> just<00:05:58.520> like<00:05:58.880> it<00:05:59.060> sits

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
track just like it sits

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.320 
track just like it sits
but<00:06:00.290> all<00:06:00.500> I<00:06:00.530> had<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.830> do<00:06:00.890> was<00:06:01.010> like<00:06:01.370> set<00:06:02.060> up<00:06:02.180> the

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
but all I had to do was like set up the

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.890 
but all I had to do was like set up the
servo<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.320> motor<00:06:04.060> set<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.180> end<00:06:05.270> points<00:06:05.720> I

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
servo and the motor set the end points I

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.720 
servo and the motor set the end points I
mean<00:06:06.080> and<00:06:06.410> breaking<00:06:07.040> the<00:06:07.130> diff<00:06:07.310> and<00:06:07.490> slipper

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
mean and breaking the diff and slipper

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.120 
mean and breaking the diff and slipper
so<00:06:08.510> I<00:06:08.540> went<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.780> go<00:06:08.900> do<00:06:09.080> all<00:06:09.110> that<00:06:09.380> and<00:06:09.590> what<00:06:10.040> do

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
so I went to go do all that and what do

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
you know I had a bad sensor wire and

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.070 
you know I had a bad sensor wire and
just<00:06:13.460> figured<00:06:13.880> it<00:06:14.000> out<00:06:14.120> two<00:06:14.390> days<00:06:14.570> later<00:06:14.870> after

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
just figured it out two days later after

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.380 
just figured it out two days later after
being<00:06:15.290> at<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.740> track<00:06:15.919> it's<00:06:16.669> a<00:06:16.730> kind<00:06:16.940> of<00:06:17.000> bum<00:06:17.210> I

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
being at the track it's a kind of bum I

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.840 
being at the track it's a kind of bum I
still<00:06:17.600> haven't<00:06:17.750> drove<00:06:17.960> it<00:06:18.110> but<00:06:18.530> I<00:06:18.830> will<00:06:19.580> bring

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
still haven't drove it but I will bring

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.130 
still haven't drove it but I will bring
a<00:06:20.120> running<00:06:20.510> video<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:21.080> after<00:06:22.060> full<00:06:23.140> review

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
a running video and after full review

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.400 
a running video and after full review
wrap<00:06:24.380> up<00:06:24.620> on<00:06:24.950> it<00:06:25.190> and<00:06:25.450> that'll<00:06:26.450> do<00:06:27.020> it<00:06:27.140> for<00:06:27.290> the

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
wrap up on it and that'll do it for the

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.270 
wrap up on it and that'll do it for the
t5n<00:06:28.160> but<00:06:28.790> so<00:06:28.970> far<00:06:29.210> I'm<00:06:29.419> impressed<00:06:29.919> my<00:06:30.919> only

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
t5n but so far I'm impressed my only

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.580 
t5n but so far I'm impressed my only
thing<00:06:31.910> again<00:06:32.210> would<00:06:32.419> be<00:06:32.450> the<00:06:32.720> stupid<00:06:33.440> ball

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
thing again would be the stupid ball

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.320 
thing again would be the stupid ball
stubs<00:06:33.890> but<00:06:34.070> I've<00:06:34.130> got<00:06:34.340> mine<00:06:34.580> pretty<00:06:34.820> freed<00:06:35.180> up

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
stubs but I've got mine pretty freed up

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.060 
stubs but I've got mine pretty freed up
but<00:06:36.169> it's<00:06:36.260> just<00:06:36.350> one<00:06:36.530> of<00:06:36.590> those<00:06:36.740> things<00:06:36.919> that

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
but it's just one of those things that
