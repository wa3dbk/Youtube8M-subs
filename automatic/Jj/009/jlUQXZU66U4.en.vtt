00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.169
 This girl needs to wear this patch 

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:08.080
 to solve the problem of your lazy eye 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:10.120
 the one that is uncovered the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.730
 patch is just one of the treatments 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.670
 employees to stimulate the eye that 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.250
 has this pathology then apart from 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.770
 put the glasses in many cases what 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.860
 we do is conclude putting patches on the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.590
 good eye to make that eye be 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.970
 more stimulated there are times that in addition to 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.520
 the patches 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.109
 We use other treatments that can 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.909
 be complementary to the patches or 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.409
 even substitutes for example 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:38.370
 use penalties that we call 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:41.559
 these penalties consist in putting 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.809
 difficulties to good eye to see for 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.440
 stimulate the bad eye are a graduation 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.239
 let's say it's more uncomfortable for the eye 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.249
 well let's say and therefore is 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.859
 favoring that you look more good eye 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.199
 bad or sometimes we also put some 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.530
 drops that cloud the vision of the good eye 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.690
 to stimulate that of the bad 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 experts recommend carrying 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.140
 out these treatments during the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.259
 time in which the child is in the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 school to exercise more the lazy eye and 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.009
 therefore we advise that in 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.650
 general these time that are with the 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.300
 children with him participate even worse 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.950
 for them but be it in time or let's say 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.500
 in school time because it's when they 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 they are exercising more vision and it is more 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.990
 effective treatment lazy eye can 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.960
 go unnoticed because children do not 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.060
 they complain about anything is to say a child can 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.770
 do not complain about anything and yet have 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.440
 a lazy eye because he is usually 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 looking for his good eye until he does not 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.240
 compares the vision between the two eyes by 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.550
 separate can not diagnose this 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.429
 pathology that makes one eye see 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.740
 more blurry and having different behind 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.140
 causes such as strabismus or 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.560
 graduation differences between an eye and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.470
 another is estimated that up to 5% of the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.720
 child population has a lazy eye and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.850
 can cause a loss of vision 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.850
 it would be if it is not diagnosed in time
