tribute to his father in New York City
this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.680> 1991<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.760> Jeff<00:00:51.660> went<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.670> played

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this is in 1991 and Jeff went and played

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
this is in 1991 and Jeff went and played
a<00:00:53.730> few<00:00:53.940> covers<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.649> other<00:00:55.800> people

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
a few covers and I think other people

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.740 
a few covers and I think other people
play<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> music<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.820> Tim<00:00:57.030> Buckley's<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.539> well

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
play the music of Tim Buckley's as well

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
play the music of Tim Buckley's as well
and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.500> believe<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> first<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.609> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and I believe it was the first time that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.380 
and I believe it was the first time that
Jeff<00:01:00.000> sang<00:01:00.510> publicly<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.440> well<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.800> playing

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
Jeff sang publicly as well as playing

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.549 
Jeff sang publicly as well as playing
and<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.629> he<00:01:03.750> played<00:01:03.930> three<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.229> four<00:01:04.379> songs

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and so he played three or four songs

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.740 
and so he played three or four songs
that<00:01:04.860> night<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.369> ended<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> concert<00:01:06.540> with

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that night and ended the concert with

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
that night and ended the concert with
this<00:01:06.990> particular<00:01:07.470> song<00:01:07.680> once<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.130> was<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this particular song once I was and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
this particular song once I was and
actually<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.900> end<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> song<00:01:10.320> Brooke

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
actually at the end of the song Brooke

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
actually at the end of the song Brooke
at<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> end<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> song<00:01:12.210> broke<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> string

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
at the end of the song broke a string

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.410 
at the end of the song broke a string
and<00:01:13.500> finished<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> song<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> cappella<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and finished the song a cappella and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.999 
and finished the song a cappella and
what<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> understand<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.920> was

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
what I understand of it is that it was

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.810 
what I understand of it is that it was
very<00:01:17.280> powerful<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.509> moving<00:01:19.729> part<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
very powerful and a very moving part of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.510 
very powerful and a very moving part of
the<00:01:20.880> night<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.560> then<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.159> ended<00:01:23.460> up

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the night and then it really ended up

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
the night and then it really ended up
being<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.000> launched<00:01:24.659> Jeff's

now<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.290> most<00:02:03.650> simple<00:02:04.220> version<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:04.700> song

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
now the most simple version of this song

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.150 
now the most simple version of this song
just<00:02:05.330> switch<00:02:06.050> back<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.260> forth<00:02:06.410> from<00:02:06.770> D<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.010> G

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
just switch back and forth from D to G

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.730 
just switch back and forth from D to G
when<00:02:07.970> you're<00:02:08.149> in<00:02:08.330> drop<00:02:08.660> D<00:02:08.840> tuning<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.380> easiest

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
when you're in drop D tuning the easiest

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.690 
when you're in drop D tuning the easiest
way<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.860> play<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> G<00:02:10.429> is<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.660> hold<00:02:11.930> down<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:13.250> 5th

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
way to play a G is to hold down the 5th

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:33.760 
way to play a G is to hold down the 5th
fret<00:02:13.940> at<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:16.450> 6th<00:02:17.450> 5th<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.230> 4th<00:02:18.500> strings

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.660 

you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.380 
you
now<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.730> can<00:02:36.970> come<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.630> do<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:39.360> G<00:02:40.360> chord

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
now you can come in and do a G chord

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.090 
now you can come in and do a G chord
this<00:02:40.900> way

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.950 

but<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.310> particular<00:02:45.460> case<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.510> don't<00:02:46.810> hear

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
but in this particular case I don't hear

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.980 
but in this particular case I don't hear
those<00:02:47.080> higher<00:02:47.290> notes<00:02:48.330> when<00:02:49.330> Jeff<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.660> playing

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
those higher notes when Jeff is playing

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.660 
those higher notes when Jeff is playing
so<00:02:50.350> I'm<00:02:50.560> not<00:02:50.680> I'm<00:02:50.980> actually<00:02:51.160> not<00:02:51.340> gonna<00:02:51.520> play

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
so I'm not I'm actually not gonna play

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.830 
so I'm not I'm actually not gonna play
the<00:02:51.790> G<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:51.970> way<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:54.240> that's<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.450> simplest

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
the G that way so that's the simplest

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.960 
the G that way so that's the simplest
version<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.320> how<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.500> play<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.130> intro<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.700> in

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
version of how to play the intro and in

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:11.140 
version of how to play the intro and in
the<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:59.260> verse<00:02:59.440> itself

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.190 

later<00:03:12.150> on<00:03:12.360> health<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> made<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> couple<00:03:13.049> of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
later on health and I made a couple of

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.309 
later on health and I made a couple of
other<00:03:13.349> chords<00:03:13.739> or<00:03:13.830> throwing<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.099> B<00:03:14.220> minor

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.290 

practice<00:03:18.319> gee

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.690 

doesn't<00:03:25.300> she<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.660> there's<00:03:25.810> an<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.520> which<00:03:27.520> if

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
doesn't she and there's an a which if

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.160 
doesn't she and there's an a which if
you<00:03:27.790> just<00:03:27.910> move<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.180> up<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.630> seventh<00:03:28.960> fret

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
you just move it up the seventh fret

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.699 
you just move it up the seventh fret
gives<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.100> an<00:03:30.220> A

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.330 

and<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:33.189> back<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.489> beginning<00:03:34.650> but<00:03:35.650> that's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
and it back to the beginning but that's

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.550 
and it back to the beginning but that's
like<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.879> said<00:03:36.909> the<00:03:37.239> simplest<00:03:37.659> way<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.840> play<00:03:38.170> it

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
like I said the simplest way to play it

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.020 
like I said the simplest way to play it
of<00:03:38.650> course<00:03:38.920> even<00:03:39.069> more<00:03:39.310> simple<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:39.730> not<00:03:39.760> able

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
of course even more simple it's not able

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.940 
of course even more simple it's not able
to<00:03:40.120> do<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> drop<00:03:40.569> D<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.349> can<00:03:41.530> stick<00:03:41.739> with

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
to do the drop D so you can stick with

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.160 
to do the drop D so you can stick with
your<00:03:42.549> regular<00:03:42.700> D<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.329> your<00:03:43.420> regular<00:03:43.689> G<00:03:43.930> major

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
your regular D and your regular G major

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.490 
your regular D and your regular G major
chord<00:03:45.060> but<00:03:46.060> there's<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.510> few<00:03:46.750> things<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.349> can

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
chord but there's a few things you can

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.800 
chord but there's a few things you can
throw<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:48.189> add<00:03:48.400> some<00:03:48.879> alterations<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.750> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
throw in to add some alterations to the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.720 
throw in to add some alterations to the
chords<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.890> progression<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.549> make

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
chords and to the progression that make

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.660 
chords and to the progression that make
it<00:03:51.909> a<00:03:52.090> bit<00:03:52.750> more<00:03:53.230> entertaining<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.459> bit

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
it a bit more entertaining and a bit

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.619 
it a bit more entertaining and a bit
more<00:03:54.819> flavorful<00:03:55.349> colorful<00:03:56.519> one<00:03:57.519> is<00:03:57.760> the

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
more flavorful colorful one is the

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.630 
more flavorful colorful one is the
second<00:03:58.930> half<00:03:59.109> of<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.319> first<00:03:59.739> measure<00:04:00.099> when

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
second half of that first measure when

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.300 
second half of that first measure when
you<00:04:00.670> play<00:04:00.819> your<00:04:00.939> D<00:04:01.150> major<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.920> can<00:04:03.069> switch<00:04:03.280> to

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
you play your D major you can switch to

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.820 
you play your D major you can switch to
a<00:04:03.489> d7<00:04:04.090> chord

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
a d7 chord

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.230 
a d7 chord
and<00:04:06.830> if<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.010> don't<00:04:07.160> know<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:08.060> only

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
and if you don't know that the only

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.210 
and if you don't know that the only
difference<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.590> finger<00:04:09.890> here<00:04:10.100> that

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
difference is the finger here that

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.500 
difference is the finger here that
you're<00:04:10.310> fretting<00:04:10.520> on<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.850> second<00:04:11.270> string

third fret that finger switches down to
playing<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.290> second<00:04:15.590> string<00:04:15.800> at<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.010> first

playing the second string at the first

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.009 
playing the second string at the first
fret<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:17.150> have<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.329> necessarily<00:04:17.480> switch

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.410

fingers<00:04:18.170> to<00:04:18.470> do<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:18.829> but<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:20.000> shape<00:04:20.180> of<00:04:20.329> the

d7<00:04:33.320> chord<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:33.980> you<00:04:34.010> go<00:04:40.450> alternately<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:42.230> could

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
d7 chord so you go alternately you could
