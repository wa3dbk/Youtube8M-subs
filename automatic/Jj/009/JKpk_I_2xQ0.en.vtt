00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
way one out to the side and a port one

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
way one out to the side and a port one
right<00:01:14.159> down<00:01:14.429> here<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> cover<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.240> what's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
right down here to cover up what's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.760 
right down here to cover up what's
called<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.780> mechanics<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.560> flower

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
called your mechanics and flower

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.139 
called your mechanics and flower
designing<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.640> holds<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.030> all

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
designing it's what holds it all

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.450 
designing it's what holds it all
together<00:01:18.469> so<00:01:19.469> then<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> squeeze<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.310> together

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
together so then you squeeze it together

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
together so then you squeeze it together
pretty<00:01:20.969> right<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.109> take<00:01:22.259> your<00:01:22.289> floral

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
pretty right then you take your floral

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
pretty right then you take your floral
tape<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.429> again<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.729> important<00:01:24.060> thing<00:01:24.149> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
tape but again the important thing is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.719 
tape but again the important thing is
getting<00:01:24.359> that<00:01:24.659> wire<00:01:24.920> through<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.130> plastic

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
getting that wire through that plastic

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
getting that wire through that plastic
now<00:01:26.939> we're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> wire<00:01:27.570> tape<00:01:28.109> this<00:01:28.350> all

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
now we're going to wire tape this all

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
now we're going to wire tape this all
together<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.249> what<00:01:29.429> I<00:01:29.460> call<00:01:29.670> banding<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
together this is what I call banding you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
together this is what I call banding you
have<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.719> be<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:30.899> my<00:01:30.990> school<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.469> learn<00:01:31.590> about

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
teaches it banding it put a little bit

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.580 
teaches it banding it put a little bit
of<00:01:35.039> tape<00:01:35.249> on<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.749> stop<00:01:37.109> and
