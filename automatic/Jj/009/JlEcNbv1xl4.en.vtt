00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
although I did actually go back in

downgrade<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:34.140> components<00:01:34.909> specifically

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909

downgrade some components specifically
the<00:01:36.240> camshafts<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.409> increase<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:37.979> rev

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180

down<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.720> around<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.200> 6,000<00:01:50.009> rpm<00:01:50.430> redline<00:01:50.610> then

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
down to around a 6,000 rpm redline then

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.910 
down to around a 6,000 rpm redline then
they<00:01:51.570> also<00:01:51.689> ended<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:52.409> through<00:01:52.799> in

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920

they also ended up going back through in
downgrade<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> lot<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.030> engine

I<00:02:08.039> found<00:02:08.369> myself<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.700> spinning<00:02:09.179> around<00:02:09.239> in

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I found myself just spinning around in

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.900 
I found myself just spinning around in
circles<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.289> General<00:02:10.709> Lee<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.220> it

circles with this General Lee and it
finally<00:02:12.330> managed<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.629> get<00:02:12.780> myself<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.230> nice

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
finally managed to get myself a nice

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.660 
finally managed to get myself a nice
a<00:02:13.540> lap<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.170> Indianapolis<00:02:15.010> circuit<00:02:15.519> which

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
a lap on the Indianapolis circuit which

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.490 
a lap on the Indianapolis circuit which
I<00:02:15.790> thought<00:02:15.970> was<00:02:16.120> quite<00:02:16.299> fitting<00:02:16.840> with<00:02:16.989> being<00:02:17.319> a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
I thought was quite fitting with being a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.009 
I thought was quite fitting with being a
classic<00:02:17.950> American<00:02:18.489> race<00:02:18.670> circuit<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.420> was

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
classic American race circuit I was

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.899 
classic American race circuit I was
quite<00:02:20.230> tempted<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.769> do<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.129> full<00:02:21.430> oval

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
quite tempted to do the full oval

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.910 
quite tempted to do the full oval
circuit<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.480> true<00:02:22.750> NASCAR<00:02:23.260> style<00:02:23.560> but<00:02:23.860> I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
circuit in true NASCAR style but I

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.130 
circuit in true NASCAR style but I
thought<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.370> twisty<00:02:25.329> corners<00:02:25.689> would<00:02:25.780> provide

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
thought the twisty corners would provide

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.229 
thought the twisty corners would provide
me<00:02:26.349> with<00:02:26.530> some<00:02:26.590> opportunities<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.640> try<00:02:27.939> some

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
me with some opportunities to try some

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.600 
me with some opportunities to try some
lore<00:02:28.540> drifts<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.230> want<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.980> improve<00:02:30.250> my<00:02:30.549> skills

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
lore drifts I want to improve my skills

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.610 
lore drifts I want to improve my skills
a<00:02:31.090> little<00:02:31.150> bit<00:02:31.360> more<00:02:31.540> before<00:02:31.900> producing

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
a little bit more before producing

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.520 
a little bit more before producing
myself<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.400> full-on<00:02:33.730> drift<00:02:34.150> build<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.110> next<00:02:35.379> up

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
myself a full-on drift build so next up

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.720 
myself a full-on drift build so next up
I<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:35.709> I'm<00:02:35.920> gonna<00:02:36.069> have<00:02:36.159> to<00:02:36.280> work<00:02:36.430> on

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
I think I'm gonna have to work on

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.390 
I think I'm gonna have to work on
practicing<00:02:37.420> driving<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:38.110> manual<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.829> think

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
practicing driving in manual I think

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.979 
practicing driving in manual I think
that's<00:02:39.549> one<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.909> keys<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.450> build<00:02:40.629> a<00:02:40.750> drift

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
that's one of the keys to build a drift

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.289 
that's one of the keys to build a drift
to<00:02:41.349> stop<00:02:41.709> your<00:02:41.920> kite<00:02:42.129> from<00:02:42.310> shifting<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:43.090> or

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
to stop your kite from shifting up or

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.360 
to stop your kite from shifting up or
shifting<00:02:43.659> down<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.230> maintain<00:02:44.709> those<00:02:44.950> skids
