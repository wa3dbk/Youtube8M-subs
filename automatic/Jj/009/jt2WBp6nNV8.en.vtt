00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.670
 my floor 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.550
 do not be afraid to look at him 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.420
 look at the lord 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:21.370
 look at the Lord with attentive eyes 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.390
 and you will discover in it 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:28.190
 the very face of god 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.520
 look for Christ 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.720
 look at Christ live in Christ 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.720
 this is more 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 Y 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.180
 While 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.900
 when we think about our vocation 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 could help us to meditate for good 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.680
 part of his preaching about the treasure 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.710
 hidden and buried 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.690
 a vocation is like a successor and 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.570
 our heart in that field where it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.050
 finds buried the treasure as well as 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.000
 anyone would need to dig up 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.060
 finding you just like this is the process of 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.180
 discovery 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.000
 Y 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.830
 refinement of our vocation 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.830
 making us able to recognize which one is 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.120
 the call and how the gentleman said that the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.580
 live 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.530
 one of the first thing that you can 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.930
 do to help you discover your 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.870
 vocation to work some questions 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.460
 fundamental 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.710
 I am in the greatest phase 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.710
 what is the longing of my heart 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.350
 from to 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.120
 many fundamental questions deserve 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.610
 answers 1 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.690
 that can only be answered in the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.410
 prayer before evil 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.690
 he is the one who has placed in this treasure 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.290
 in our heart 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.459
 says it will help us find better 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.760
 sometimes an impatient to want to know for 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.010
 I am the vocation 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.189
 but we have to remember that our 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.580
 vocation is to deliver what the lord 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.850
 you want them to discover 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.090
 and does not try to hide or hide it from 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.210
 we weigh the moment in which 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.240
 we mature sufficiently and 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.660
 we are ready to receive it and then 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.020
 reply 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.170
 we just need to have the heart 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.080
 willing to seek his will without 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.450
 However, no occasion is the Lord 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.770
 try to help us discover the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.140
 vocation 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.170
 but we do not respond to the small 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.080
 thank you they do not reach those hills 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.230
 for example if we are feeling the 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.860
 desire and attracted to reason more time in 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.770
 adoration many times we do not and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.020
 if the gentleman shows a certain baric 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.680
 the lazio that there is no healthy and 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.469
 we started to correct it 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.560
 we prepare the heart to receive the 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.510
 gift of knowing our vocation as the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.069
 Lord tells us in the gospel of san 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.069
 Lucas Chapter 16 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.180
 and a little 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.930
 they mean you have things and so 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.930
 will be ready we receive 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.300
 do not
