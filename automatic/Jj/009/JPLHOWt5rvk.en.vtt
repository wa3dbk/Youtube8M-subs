00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.010
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.810
 we will see how to pose 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.760
 Built-in racks 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.289
 panels you can find easily 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.660
 this kind of hardware in your 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.420
 favorite DIY store we have 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.000
 here the racks here is the etac and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 that go with it's rack are 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.320
 built-in and which says built-in says 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.480
 grooves we will realize these 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 grooves with the router equipped with a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.500
 copying guide measure the part to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.850
 recess g 11 mm wide 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.530
 and then the depth and we have 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:04.049
 here if mm installed a wick from 8 to 10 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.590
 mm in your router and then the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.630
 copying guide now he's going 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.020
 it is necessary to realize a routing of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.909
 to run the groove in the right place 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.960
 you have to know the exact value between 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:24.960
 the copying guide and the outside of the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.659
 strawberry at first sight it's not so 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.180
 easy than that but ray a solution 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.130
 put a sign on your plan of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 work then use a second 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 slightly thicker than the guide 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.720
 copying set this second with dc joined 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 to your work plan set the table 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.200
 of your defender on the panel 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.759
 higher and abc there until the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.280
 fresco is in contact with the panel 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:08.450
 lower you only have to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 raise the stopper to 6 mm and lock it 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.810
 lay the defender's table on the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.980
 top panel and copy guide 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.670
 against the field you can factories and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.670
 your grooves 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.040
 now it remains to measure the value 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.880
 between singing and the first day of remembrance 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.620
 I read 10 mm here it is not you left 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.070
 to make a grooving assembly 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.680
 11 mm value of the recessed part 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.030
 plus twice the value you come 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.010
 to measure either 31 mm used two 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.200
 plywood or wood panels 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.090
 massive the same thickness as the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.470
 top panel that you used 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.910
 just now do the longest that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.850
 the groove you want to make 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.340
 spaces and both 31 mm parallel 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.100
 to one another 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.720
 screw a plywood talent into 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.210
 below the two panels for the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:38.620
 start the defender and a 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:40.930
 second call at the other end place 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.540
 your guide to where you want 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.250
 realize your grooves do not forget the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:53.890
 offset of the tight 10 mm the whole thing with a 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.450
 greenhouse joints we are almost there 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.790
 the grooves in my panels are 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.370
 stopped they do not open so he 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.510
 will have to watch or must stop 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.750
 strawberry slip a hold where stops 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:16.570
 the copying guide do not forget the 10 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:19.180
 mm then vice and ask it your 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.850
 defender on both guides then 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.360
 make your grooves by doing a 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.360
 back and forth 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.560
 the strawberry and circular the taste of the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:48.090
 groove is rounded right with a 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:49.040
 wood chisel cut the rack to the 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.300
 metal saw 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:59.790
 respect the long hours well 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:05:02.640
 align the cleats install your 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.920
 rack with a hammer and a stack 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.740
 of wood you will only have 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.310
 install your cleat where you 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.730
 want to put your shelves here it is 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.010
 completed 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.570
 you will understand it with a guide of 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.250
 copying you can do lines 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.350
 straight but also curved lines 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.350
 it's up to you now to see you soon 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.189
 for
