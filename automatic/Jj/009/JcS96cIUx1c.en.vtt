00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
and keeping the long cylinder in its

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.849 
and keeping the long cylinder in its
already<00:02:18.090> extended<00:02:18.629> position<00:02:21.709> finally<00:02:22.709> to

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
already extended position finally to

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.860 
already extended position finally to
return<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.519> index<00:02:23.879> starting<00:02:24.329> position

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
return to the index starting position

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.410 
return to the index starting position
both<00:02:25.560> cylinders<00:02:26.129> must<00:02:26.459> be<00:02:26.640> retracted<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:29.420> will

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
both cylinders must be retracted I will

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.390 
both cylinders must be retracted I will
do<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.750> process<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> couple<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.799> times<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
do the process a couple of times so you

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.470 
do the process a couple of times so you
can<00:02:32.730> visualize<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.480> process<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.139> operation

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
can visualize the process in operation

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.729 
can visualize the process in operation
please<00:02:36.480> note<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.109> colors<00:02:37.439> of<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
please note that the colors of the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.770 
please note that the colors of the
tubing<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.400> cylinders<00:02:38.909> are<00:02:39.120> changing<00:02:39.659> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
tubing and the cylinders are changing to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.550 
tubing and the cylinders are changing to
reflect<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.319> appropriate<00:02:40.920> operations

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
reflect the appropriate operations

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.289 
reflect the appropriate operations
control<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:43.950> kind<00:02:44.189> operation<00:02:44.879> becomes

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
control of this kind operation becomes

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.300 
control of this kind operation becomes
much<00:02:45.540> easier<00:02:45.569> for<00:02:46.200> an<00:02:46.319> average<00:02:46.500> person<00:02:46.919> by

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
much easier for an average person by

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.319 
much easier for an average person by
