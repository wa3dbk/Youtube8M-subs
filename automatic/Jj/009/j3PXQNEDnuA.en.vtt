Doral<00:02:14.400> Easton's<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.820> hear<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.870> these

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
Doral Easton's I hear one of these

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.420 
Doral Easton's I hear one of these
aircraft<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:16.500> sent<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.800> very<00:02:16.980> short<00:02:17.190> notice

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
aircraft was sent a very short notice

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.290 
aircraft was sent a very short notice
out<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.850> Africa<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:19.019> fly<00:02:19.200> over<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.980> ear<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.820> map

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
out to Africa to fly over as I ear a map

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.220 
out to Africa to fly over as I ear a map
out<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.989> scale<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.500> refugee<00:02:22.860> problem<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
out the scale of the refugee problem and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.660 
out the scale of the refugee problem and
that<00:02:25.230> was<00:02:25.350> very<00:02:25.380> useful<00:02:25.830> because<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.340> were

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
that was very useful because we were

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.430 
that was very useful because we were
able<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:26.970> show<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.690> although<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.140> problem

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
able to show that although the problem

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.380 
able to show that although the problem
existed<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.100> was<00:02:29.220> no<00:02:29.340> longer<00:02:29.549> where<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.239> had

existed it was no longer where it had
been<00:02:30.420> thought<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.920> lot<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.100> nugatory
