00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.830
 hi to all the guys i am bear between 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.380
 i fine this my first commentary on the 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:14.090
 method weapons or better will be the first 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.940
 commentaries if the staff wants it will want me 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.010
 well I do a short one anyway 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.410
 my presentation and the match are 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.440
 bertram I have my little channel where 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.060
 I draw all call of duty most 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.680
 monroe share 3 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.379
 and okay to which I invite you to pass 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.999
 of course the game is a m60 fashion 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.989
 without silencer located on the map 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:43.819
 fast enough to be a ml 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.489
 I will take it in about 4 minutes and 

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:50.690
 however, I presented myself presented 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.089
 the game and I won't bother you again with 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.969
 these meaningless speeches therefore 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.030
 Let's move on to the topic I wanted 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.569
 which I wanted to discuss with you today here 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.649
 on this 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:07.070
 this fantastic channel the speech of 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.640
 I want to talk about today is the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.850
 what has become a commentary on 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.160
 this great community what can 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.470
 bring again what can still give us 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.980
 this community because I don't know if you have 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.140
 noticed but now youtube is invaded by 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.450
 people who comment on each other however in 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.730
 every corner 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.830
 Now there are also the many mine 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.110
 friends now every day some gods 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.840
 my friends you buy one alone a big one 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.670
 capture an hd pvr begin to do 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.680
 comment I don't say it's bad 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.770
 this however our community is 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.800
 small compared to a community 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.550
 American where there is one software 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.290
 English community where English is spoken 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.470
 the possibilities are almost endless 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.810
 because everyone knows more or less English 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.030
 me too and many other Italians or from 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.620
 any country follows gods 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.920
 Americans or even people anyway 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.390
 commented in English while for 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.940
 comments to the Italians the possibilities 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 they are restricted because the community 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 Italian youtube video 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.410
 there are a few hundred thousand 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.709
 people no more than three comments that 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.410
 according to video games there are about 100,000 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.510
 by now and those that according to only that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.860
 that god there are still less and therefore 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.060
 boh 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.800
 this brings an incredible year 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.019
 narrowness by what one does 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.769
 of which follow and this however brings 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.780
 also to an impoverishment at the end of 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.850
 comment because it is much more difficult 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.250
 break through in Italy in quotation marks 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.260
 break through becoming quite famous 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.720
 because I have the vice I enjoy it or ai 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.580
 knowledge or no I would never do a 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.150
 tube because I know not alone and a lot 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.250
 very very difficult I did 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.049
 two hundred registered or less in the facts of it 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.730
 I had 190 on the old canal I had 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.510
 done in five months without any help 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.799
 and I must say that it was tiring and 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.650
 I don't really like this because it's one 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.000
 narrowness that puzzles me 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.430
 because we could have many more 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.840
 possibility if a lot more people were 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.640
 perhaps engaging in their videos 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.519
 now I'm not attacking anyone though 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.489
 I see many videos now that I don't comment 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.709
 boring leaks is not the word 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.160
 right then with interest at the hands of 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.049
 uninteresting commentaries to mine 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.329
 opinion also opinion as usual not 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.310
 take hangs where I say with pliers 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.709
 because they are my personal opinions that 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.829
 I hope they will be shared or not and these 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.019
 they will not be shared if you force yourself 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.569
 not forced you are warmly invited 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.019
 to tell me your opinion without insulting 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.100
 but because it would be really unkind 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.840
 anyway, that's what I say is that yes 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.400
 now find many people do 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.690
 comment for example on how to pull 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.810
 fashions on tips I say is fine 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.970
 however he never did all the 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.980
 first months of play there is now is a 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.530
 slice model has been released for nine months 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.500
 many more and in any case here I take the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.590
 morra I made a cut until 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.440
 the throw and therefore this indicates that 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.680
 the video is now finished I greet you 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.510
 I leave you with my opinions 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.370
 I hope you share too 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.949
 I hope if you share them with me 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.090
 say why and that's all it takes 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.449
 from my channel a greeting to drink 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.449
 wobbles
