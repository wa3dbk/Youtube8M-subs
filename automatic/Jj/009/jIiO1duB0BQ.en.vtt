00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.160
 small to make a baseball game 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.720
 smaller I know the story of a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 another child who was small is small 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.820
 a good story and if you want it 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.190
 story there was once a long time 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 makes an old farmer and his beloved 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.770
 wife who were very poor by theirs 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.900
 even the mice had left home 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.420
 because they didn't even find the crust 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 to munch the old poor 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.470
 they would have so much desired a child 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 big and big to help them 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.540
 to work the land and to be able to feed 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.540
 but the good fairy and where not theirs 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.830
 wish and had a baby arrive 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.830
 made especially for them 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.560
 a sad surprise because they realized 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.780
 that the child who had just arrived 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.670
 it was no bigger than a finger 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.830
 and that was how they decided to call him 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.810
 pollicino naturally they were equally 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.740
 very happy to have a child all 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.290
 for them 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.300
 but that piece of cheese could certainly not 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.100
 I have seen their problem 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.200
 the earth was still to be cultivated 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.300
 pantry remained empty 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.850
 however, it soon turned out that if 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:18.340
 Tom Thumb was small in size 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:21.459
 anyway, you wouldn't have a big brain 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.769
 by chance some spinach seeds the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.870
 old farmer mushroom in the box 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.660
 of the seeds I will finally say the last one out 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.180
 if in the spinach he had and he gave it to the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.650
 son the little one took a spoon 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.180
 hurriedly she ran out of a hole 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.019
 deep the true that unique seven and it 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.870
 it didn't take long to cover it with earth 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.530
 which grew a robust map of 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.769
 spinach dad and mom look at her 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.299
 disconsolate then old said I am afraid 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.640
 that that plant would not be enough to 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.500
 feed none of us but go 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.190

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.410

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.600
 our little frog 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.510
 Tom Thumb became more robust than 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.000
 any other boy from so2 sowed 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.120
 all the fields of the old and obtained them 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 an excellent harvest then learned to 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.850
 bring the vegetables to the market 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.430
 every day he returned home burdened 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.590
 of money so I could buy the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.190
 farm animals that soon 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.710
 He turned into a real palace and 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.820
 two old peasants became the most 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.820
 rich of the whole region 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.689

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:10.049
 secret of its success 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:12.239

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.709

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.009
