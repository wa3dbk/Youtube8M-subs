00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.549
 very good people I am a child 1997 and in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.300
 this video as I had promised 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.630
 do so I'm going to make an attack 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.880
 strategic with elves troop elf 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.650
 Well, as many know, the goblin 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 It steals resources and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.290
 and when there are no more collectors and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.750
 warehouses are responsible for destroying 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.300
 the buildings can many many of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.860
 those of the clans see this troop very 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.080
 as in a very useless way because the truth 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.260
 let's say that if you know how to use it, not the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.850
 you see differently then truth 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.370
 let's attack a village of goblins 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.210
 to show you a little bit about what 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 what do i want to tell you 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.180
 then as you can see I am sick and 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.200
 we are still going to attack this village 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.380
 that has the gatherers outside 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.950
 so that they see a little if I put the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 goblin in this corner here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.380
 the goblin will go directly to the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.619
 to the nearest store 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.079
 or if they were make it closer to 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.470
 steal true then let's place 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.030
 one in this corner to see then 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.429
 find it easier is directly 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.909
 true but you do not always have to throw 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.409
 the rockets 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.159
 at the beginning 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.960
 It is advisable to launch a troop of 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.280
 extractor that has enough life then 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.369
 I do not have a distracting troop right now 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.369
 but if it is good that the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.420
 some troops and finally launches the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.150
 goblins to finish cleaning it 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.340
 what remains of gold and truth then 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.629
 Let's throw 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.599
 some end up for them to take care 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.140
 of and see we are going to throw some goblins and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.290
 cough 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.060
 Well, see how they steal while the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.990
 another in defense are responsible for killing 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.540
 the barbarians the goblins are stealing 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.820
 that would be that is a good use to see 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.190
 there the big ones go directly to the other 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.190
 side that is the gold stores 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.830
 so here we do the same 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.390
 then we throw a box 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.780
 another here and another here and we launch are a 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.780
 bridges 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.859
 to finish cleaning it 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.800
 if you know how to use them, the truth is not 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.960
 achieve common grasp 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.970
 like an annoying troop and that we 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.100
 it serves a useful tip true but 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.560
 and the truth where they are are very good 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.760
 the truth 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.760
 If you know how to use it 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.350
 then that is a little bit what 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.350
 I wanted to say with the great 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:28.510
 good in relation to what to comment their 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.510
 villages as you see already 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.599
 I'm placing the descriptions about 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.269
 links to fill out some forms 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.939
 those forms will reach me and then 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.590
 and just fill it and I have your 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.470
 information to comment on your village 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.340
 where and in which clan milestone in the case of 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.280
 the people who had already signed up 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.910
 there is another link in itself to renew 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.349
 your form then getting there I 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.099
 I know I'll put everything in the 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.720
 description so that for me to 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.129
 Fill out the form and do not fill 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.400
 have problems when commenting 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:08.540
 their villages and therefore in relation to 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.120
 challenges I'm also placing a link 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.950
 down in the description you can see it and 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.169
 there are the three links on 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 renovation for villages to comment on their 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.820
 the villages of if you're not targeted 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.669
 still for you to sign up and the one 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.280
 challenges there are how can you tell me with 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:30.000
 which troops attacked with what amount everything 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.180
 all the truth is there and then as 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.120
 they see change clan because he was the leader of the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.120
 clan gone unfortunately I 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.540
 I had not left as a leader as well 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.970
 it's a bit heavy to be a leader and 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.860
 is almost all the time connected to 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.969
 to be able to donate troops then and 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.009
 still do not make any clan for 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.539
 for 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.539
 for the channel then 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.569
 and here I have the supports of my two 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.429
 friends 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.309
 the truth is they are supporting me on the channel 

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:11.610
 Anything that needs me 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:14.169
 ask there is no problem commented 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.479
 and it may be a little what I wanted them 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.979
 say and also remember that in the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.569
 Next chapter, I'm going to start 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.869
 again to design villages I will have 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.869
 two chapters followed by village design 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:27.200
 City Hall level 6 and level 7 on Saturday 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:29.320
 then that was 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.790
 everything I wanted to say to them 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.090
 thank you very much for subscribing and 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.010
 like it if you liked it remember that 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.990
 the attacks are made without prisoners and 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.030
 having good defenses is like having a 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.030
 successful attack thank you very much
