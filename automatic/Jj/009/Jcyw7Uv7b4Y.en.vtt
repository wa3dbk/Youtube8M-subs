it<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.590> capture<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.399> so<00:01:18.670> we<00:01:18.759> don't<00:01:18.910> have<00:01:19.000> to

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
it to capture it so we don't have to

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.249 
it to capture it so we don't have to
worry<00:01:19.240> about<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.450> rotating<00:01:19.930> we<00:01:20.020> put<00:01:20.170> the

bracket again using a quarter inch
channel<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:05.950> had<00:02:06.100> formed<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:07.090> box<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.689> end<00:02:07.810> of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
channel I had formed we box the end of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.350 
channel I had formed we box the end of
it<00:02:08.049> over<00:02:08.229> there<00:02:08.579> we<00:02:09.579> just<00:02:09.729> bought<00:02:09.940> welded<00:02:10.269> it

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
it over there we just bought welded it

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.970 
it over there we just bought welded it
inside<00:02:10.690> now

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
inside now

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.670 
inside now
it's<00:02:12.790> really<00:02:13.390> strong<00:02:13.720> for<00:02:14.050> me<00:02:14.319> than<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.500> thought

it's really strong for me than I thought

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.910 
it's really strong for me than I thought
it<00:02:14.739> would<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:15.269> we<00:02:16.269> do<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.260> big<00:02:17.470> pulley<00:02:17.769> in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it would be we do have the big pulley in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.780 
it would be we do have the big pulley in
Seoul<00:02:19.080> well<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.200> guys<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.379> see<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.830> the

the way in the first groove we had to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.619 
the way in the first groove we had to
change<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.370> way<00:02:33.760> that's<00:02:33.940> alter<00:02:34.180> their<00:02:34.330> mounts

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
going through the bracket we took to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.819 
going through the bracket we took to
that<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.840> now<00:02:58.959> it's<00:02:59.109> only<00:02:59.230> bolted<00:02:59.680> for<00:02:59.739> the

bracket I'm not super crazy about it
does<00:03:04.510> seem<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.780> be<00:03:04.989> really<00:03:05.260> strong<00:03:05.650> we<00:03:06.099> ran<00:03:06.310> a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
does seem to be really strong we ran a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.559 
does seem to be really strong we ran a
two<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.700> quarter<00:03:06.849> inch<00:03:07.120> idler<00:03:07.450> on<00:03:07.599> it<00:03:09.569> what

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
two and a quarter inch idler on it what

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.670 
two and a quarter inch idler on it what
it's<00:03:10.690> meant<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.109> a<00:03:11.140> bushing<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.530> some

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
it's meant but a bushing and some

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.470 
it's meant but a bushing and some
washers<00:03:11.980> behind<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.640> don't<00:03:13.180> think<00:03:13.239> it's

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
washers behind it I don't think it's

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.940 
washers behind it I don't think it's
going<00:03:13.599> anywhere<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:14.590> might<00:03:14.769> have<00:03:14.799> to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
going anywhere we might have to

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.460 
going anywhere we might have to
fine-tune<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.549> later<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:16.480> all<00:03:16.599> together<00:03:16.930> if

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
fine-tune that later but all together if

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.650 
fine-tune that later but all together if
we're<00:03:17.889> getting<00:03:18.010> there<00:03:18.280> we're<00:03:18.459> almost<00:03:18.660> we're
