00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
with small maps that you're used to we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.860 
with small maps that you're used to we
really<00:01:04.760> give<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:05.120> huge<00:01:05.390> playground

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
really give you this huge playground

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.810 
really give you this huge playground
you're<00:01:06.320> not<00:01:06.470> constrained<00:01:07.130> by<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.400> normal

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
you're not constrained by the normal

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.840 
you're not constrained by the normal
boundaries<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:08.270> unit<00:01:08.630> c<00:01:08.840> with<00:01:09.140> map<00:01:09.440> design

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
boundaries that unit c with map design

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.100 
boundaries that unit c with map design
so<00:01:10.850> while<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.090> may<00:01:11.210> start<00:01:11.540> out<00:01:11.690> on<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.869> coast

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
so while you may start out on the coast

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.930 
so while you may start out on the coast

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
maybe to a farm and then even further

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.790
