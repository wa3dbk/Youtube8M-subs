now<00:00:08.960> the<00:00:09.020> L<00:00:10.480> that's<00:00:11.480> simple<00:00:12.190> just<00:00:13.190> don't<00:00:13.400> pull

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
now the L that's simple just don't pull

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.160 
now the L that's simple just don't pull
this<00:00:13.730> stroke<00:00:13.969> out<00:00:14.150> too<00:00:14.360> far<00:00:14.599> otherwise<00:00:14.990> you're

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
this stroke out too far otherwise you're

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.299 
this stroke out too far otherwise you're
going<00:00:15.260> to<00:00:15.349> end<00:00:15.500> up<00:00:15.590> with<00:00:15.710> that<00:00:15.830> big<00:00:16.099> gaping

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
going to end up with that big gaping

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:25.810 
going to end up with that big gaping
space<00:00:16.790> I<00:00:23.859> sort<00:00:24.859> of<00:00:24.949> like<00:00:25.189> it<00:00:25.220> that<00:00:25.520> there's<00:00:25.699> an

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
space I sort of like it that there's an

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.689 
space I sort of like it that there's an
ever<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:26.330> slight<00:00:26.680> slant<00:00:27.680> outward<00:00:28.250> with<00:00:28.490> that

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
ever so slight slant outward with that

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.810 
ever so slight slant outward with that
first<00:00:29.539> stroke<00:00:29.779> on<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.080> M<00:00:30.460> now<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.490> want<00:00:31.760> to

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
first stroke on the M now I want to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.150 
first stroke on the M now I want to
think<00:00:31.970> in<00:00:32.150> terms<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.629> making<00:00:33.530> sure<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:33.980> this

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
think in terms of making sure that this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.139 
think in terms of making sure that this
is<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.449> symmetrical<00:00:35.449> letter<00:00:37.149> bilaterally

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
is a symmetrical letter bilaterally

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.110 
is a symmetrical letter bilaterally
symmetrical<00:00:38.750> just<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.050> way<00:00:39.140> we<00:00:39.290> are

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
symmetrical just the way we are

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.520 
symmetrical just the way we are
bilaterally<00:00:41.120> symmetrical<00:00:41.719> comfortable<00:00:42.410> with

a one-story letter tendency is to make

two strokes for the Oh starting right
about<00:01:23.119> here<00:01:24.159> thinking<00:01:25.159> around<00:01:25.509> thinking

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
about here thinking around thinking

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.410 
about here thinking around thinking
about<00:01:26.569> the<00:01:26.869> counter<00:01:27.259> appearing<00:01:28.329> creating<00:01:29.329> the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
counter mm-hmm here's our join it

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.410 
counter mm-hmm here's our join it
thickens<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:36.289> fins<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.939> join<00:01:38.209> is<00:01:38.390> a

thickens and it fins and the join is a
follow<00:01:38.780> through<00:01:38.959> you<00:01:39.259> want<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.469> follow

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
follow through you want to follow

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.779 
follow through you want to follow
through<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.099> same<00:01:40.250> way<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.520> would<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:40.700> would

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
through the same way we would you would

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.550 
through the same way we would you would
follow<00:01:41.000> through<00:01:41.329> with<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.479> stroke<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:41.929> golf<00:01:42.200> or

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
follow through with a stroke in golf or

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.609 
follow through with a stroke in golf or
in<00:01:42.829> tennis<00:01:43.990> or<00:01:44.990> other<00:01:45.920> things<00:01:50.079> now<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.109> think<00:01:51.319> of

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
in tennis or other things now I think of

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.979 
in tennis or other things now I think of
the<00:01:51.709> piers<00:01:52.009> relating<00:01:52.429> to<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.670> F<00:01:52.849> and<00:01:53.719> then

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
the piers relating to the F and then

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.119 
the piers relating to the F and then
we've<00:01:54.110> got<00:01:54.729> we've<00:01:55.729> got<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.909> bowl<00:01:56.149> on<00:01:56.360> top<00:01:57.129> and

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.129 
we've got we've got a bowl on top and

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.279 
we've got we've got a bowl on top and
nothing<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.640> bottom<00:01:59.140> remember<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.200> told

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
nothing on the bottom remember I told

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.859 
nothing on the bottom remember I told
you<00:02:00.530> about<00:02:00.649> how<00:02:00.950> some<00:02:01.670> often<00:02:02.329> leave<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.509> space

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
you about how some often leave a space

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.330 
you about how some often leave a space
right<00:02:03.200> there<00:02:03.469> I<00:02:04.329> think<00:02:05.329> I'll<00:02:05.509> going<00:02:06.219> put<00:02:07.219> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
right there I think I'll going put the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.170 
right there I think I'll going put the
cue<00:02:07.579> down<00:02:07.759> here<00:02:09.250> no<00:02:11.319> you're<00:02:12.319> really<00:02:12.560> good

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
cue down here no you're really good

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410 
cue down here no you're really good
you're<00:02:14.180> gonna<00:02:14.359> make<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.750> cue<00:02:16.269> exactly<00:02:17.269> like

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
you're gonna make the cue exactly like

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.979 
you're gonna make the cue exactly like
your<00:02:17.599> o<00:02:20.980> remember<00:02:21.980> there's<00:02:22.160> an<00:02:22.310> axis<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.930> is

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
your o remember there's an axis this is

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.720 
your o remember there's an axis this is
gonna<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:24.500> an<00:02:24.620> axis<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.400> want<00:02:25.609> to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
gonna be an axis that you want to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.059 
gonna be an axis that you want to
harmonize<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.540> all<00:02:27.079> year<00:02:27.349> round<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.709> strokes

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
harmonize and all year round it strokes

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.729 
harmonize and all year round it strokes
I'm<00:02:28.849> gonna<00:02:29.120> let<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.599> tail<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.170> tail<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.620> the

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
I'm gonna let that tail the tail of the

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.900 
I'm gonna let that tail the tail of the
queue<00:02:30.889> that's<00:02:31.160> its<00:02:31.340> distinguishing

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
queue that's its distinguishing

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.159 
queue that's its distinguishing
characteristic<00:02:34.359> minimal<00:02:35.359> I<00:02:35.510> wouldn't<00:02:35.930> go

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:36.169 
characteristic minimal I wouldn't go

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:41.530 
characteristic minimal I wouldn't go
into<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:37.450> counter<00:02:38.530> personally
