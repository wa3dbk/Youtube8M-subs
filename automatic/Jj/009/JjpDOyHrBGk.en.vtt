probably<00:02:35.650> give<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.510> 5<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.870> 10<00:02:39.269> just

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
probably give it a 5 out of 10 just

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.020 
probably give it a 5 out of 10 just
because<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.870> mean<00:02:41.049> it's<00:02:41.739> pretty<00:02:42.099> basic<00:02:43.410> fun<00:02:44.410> I
