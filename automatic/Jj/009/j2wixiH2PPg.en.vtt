00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.779
 good guys, how are you? 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.000
 well and ready because I'm going to start 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.849
 my new guide will also be the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 first thing I do to see how it will come out and going 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 to be about the riddler challenges in 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.580
 batman arkham city â€‹â€‹' many will think that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.400
 is a pretty absurd guide since the 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.699
 game came out in 2011 but hey may 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.690
 some will help them start 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.860
 probably the first thing that one thinks 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 when facing the challenges the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.910
 riddler is that the challenges of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.489
 predators are much simpler 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.019
 that the combat challenges that happened to me 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.239
 to me personally and in the end I finished 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.739
 thinking just the opposite if you're 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.540
 new and you're not familiar with the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.699
 fighting style of the game sure you 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.559
 it costs a good number of attempts to get there 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.930
 to the astronomical score that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.250
 they require fighting for that since they 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 you are beginning with the challenges of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.880
 combat you may appreciate these 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.500
 basic tips that I'm going to give you 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.030
 to understand the mechanics that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.890
 requires our bat friend 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.200
 and so understand how it works by 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.189
 over roughly the fight system 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.350
 1 the important thing is the points to have that 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.909
 in mind all the time the medals are 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.920
 they get only thanks to the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.719
 points that are obtained by giving cinnamon 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.969
 fine to enemies in succession without 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.469
 commit failures as well at once with the 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.390
 so as to increase your combo and 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.159
 multiply the puntable is not necessary 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.319
 eliminate enemies quickly at 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.390
 otherwise avoid leaving them unconscious 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.280
 for as long as possible is the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.350
 best method to get points 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.479
 2 Not all attacks have the same 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.190
 score if you're interested in earning points 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.110
 you'll want to know what attacks provide 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.240
 the largest number of them the most 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.340
 Juicy for non- yellow enemies 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.560
 are the beating attack and the elimination of 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.600
 That's why it's highly recommended 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.550
 carry out beating attacks because they increase 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 our combo and also provide the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.360
 enough points and at the end of each phase 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.680
 it's always good to make the combo profitable 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 that we have already achieved with a 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.130
 removal of soil for it 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.869
 simply performs the triple attack of 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 layer and then press the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.370
 Soil removal buttons like this 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 batman will jump directly to the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.780
 enemy and you will receive the welcome 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.390
 reward 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.160
 3 Critics dominates the blows 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.110
 critics besides making you look cool 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.940
 so the point multiplier 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.650
 increase of 2 environments can be performed 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.600
 critical hits if we hit in the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.459
 exact moment just requires a little bit of 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.680
 ease and elegance when attack 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.750
 and do not press buttons like a ripple 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.940
 if you do not see yourself capable of making a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.010
 succession of practical critical hits 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.920
 until you get it 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.099
 4 the concentration or free flow mode 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.420
 no agreement as it is called is very useful 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.700
 batman enters this mode when he performed 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.439
 a combo of 12 hits and leaves him at 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.659
 make a special move or lose 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.970
 the combo during this mode the screen 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.370
 it becomes a very annoying blur 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.530
 but the enemies move and attack 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.239
 much slower than batman 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.519
 thus it is allowing you to have a greater 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.730
 reaction time to counterattacks and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.370
 perform faster hits 5 do not have 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.470
 afraid to use the layer the layer although it can 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.569
 seem unsightly is one of the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.310
 most useful complements of batman 2 is 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.620
 the key to the beating attacks and the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.629
 soil removals despite this 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.769
 its effect against several enemies can 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.659
 fail so it is recommended 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.380
 monitor the surroundings before 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.500
 throw yourself using it 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.730
 6 counterattack saves combos do not go up 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.950
 you have the power of a good counterattack 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.360
 allows you to reject enemy attacks in 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.070
 almost all situations and they are 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.690
 especially useful to stop 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.490
 enemies while we make an attack 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.840
 beating in another do not forget that 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.880
 pressing the counterattack button 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.640
 as many times as enemies attack 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.650
 we can stop the turns 7 evade 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.360
 also saves combos 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.310
 although counterattack sounds very tempting 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.110
 when we are surrounded by enemies the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.180
 best option is to move abroad 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.070
 of the mass that surrounds you gaining space 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.320
 and attacking the most distant enemies 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.240
 It is also a safe option for 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.270
 keep the combo if you're not sure of 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.960
 what to do evade 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.610
 8 evade is not rolling on the ground the 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.560
 same combination that makes batman 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.540
 jump over an enemy evading 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.520
 can make the bat roll 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.500
 on the ground if the combination that 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.290
 we touch does not target an enemy 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.970
 this is often quite counterproductive 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.920
 because unlike evade roll 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.430
 on the floor several times in a row if 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.350
 break the combo 9 the gadgets are not 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.270
 only to hesitate although at first sight 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.400
 look like no batman gadgets 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.080
 They are useful in combat wash your claw 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.610
 will prevent us from losing a combo when 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.010
 let's have the enemies away and 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.810
 disarming the enemies with rifles the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.160
 will kill are useful to destabilize 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.170
 enemies that carry objects to 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.420
 launch yourself or stop enemies to the point 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.250
 of catching guns ice grenades 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.590
 they allow to freeze and immobilize a 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.450
 enemy the electrical charge is similar to 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.850
 the ice grenade only that its effect 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.410
 of the video is passenger but it makes up for it 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.540
 with an extra effect against the 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.330
 battleships and against the Soviets more 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.550
 the explosive gel is probably the 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.810
 less useful as it is slow and quite 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.540
 prone to light loading 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.490
 10 different enemies require 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.950
 different strategies each enemy 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.570
 has its weak point as you will know the 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.310
 enemies with knife can be eliminated 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.470
 dodging them alternating the button 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.020
 counterattack do not write guns 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.880
 the enemies disarm with the earth 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.740
 battleships require a beating attack 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.590
 those who carry riot shields 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.020
 they need a good air attack what 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.700
 dodge a 6-0 back a stick 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.830
 Stunner according to how you want to call 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.230
 they have to be attacked by the back 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.180
 After an evasion the enemies go 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.010
 big guys then they are following another line 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.680
 based on a triple layer attack and 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.940
 then hit as if there were no tomorrow 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.650
 keep in mind the strategy to win 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.840
 to every enemy because a bad move 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.870
 how to hit a battleship can 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.580
 make you lose a body 11 disarm and 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.040
 you will win you are not tired of the 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.940
 damn shields and knives this has 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.920
 an easy solution 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.150
 this special movement destroys the 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.100
 weapon that the enemy is using 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.110
 preventing anyone else from being 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.930
 do with it for it to find you 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.210
 with enemies with knives shields rifles 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.070
 or stunner sticks you should think what 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.620
 first to get a combo of 5 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.740
 blows and thus disarm the to remove from 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.260
 over those annoying weapons 12 and last 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.630
 do not lose sight of the surroundings 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.520
 when you're battering an enemy not 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.740
 forget that there will usually be more than 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.540
 your colleagues surrounding you move the camera 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.790
 It is vital to be able to see what is around you 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.280
 and seeing what is around you is vital for 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.350
 control the scenario takes advantage of 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.910
 automatic movements like 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.920
 eliminations and other movements 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.490
 special to be able to rotate the camera 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.039
 looking for possible threats 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.479
 and well this has been all I hope that if 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:45.169
 you are starting in the game these 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.880
 advice serve you something remember that 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.560
 the river challenges are not so 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.199
 difficult even if at first I can 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.819
 Apparently yes and I'm getting ahead is 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.069
 that soon you will have the next part 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:57.650
 of the guide we will get fully into 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.750
 the campaign challenges so nothing 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.050
 thank you very much for being there and up 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.050
 other
