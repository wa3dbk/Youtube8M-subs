00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
minutes or so and yeah it's just a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
minutes or so and yeah it's just a
really<00:01:18.090> good<00:01:18.240> quick<00:01:18.479> experience<00:01:19.110> run<00:01:19.350> right

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
really good quick experience run right

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.710 
really good quick experience run right
here<00:01:21.530> number<00:01:22.530> three<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.159> Saturn<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> run

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
here number three is Saturn now the run

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.390 
here number three is Saturn now the run
to<00:01:24.840> Saturn<00:01:25.170> takes<00:01:25.409> roughly<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.220> same

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to Saturn takes roughly about the same

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.429 
to Saturn takes roughly about the same
amount<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.729> time<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> run<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> bunker<00:01:27.930> but

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
amount of time as the run to bunker but

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
amount of time as the run to bunker but
you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.860> shortcut<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.490> shave<00:01:29.670> off<00:01:29.880> some<00:01:29.909> time

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you can shortcut and shave off some time

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
you can shortcut and shave off some time
by<00:01:30.509> grenade<00:01:30.810> jumping<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.470> rocket<00:01:31.799> jumping

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
by grenade jumping or rocket jumping

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
by grenade jumping or rocket jumping
over<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> wall<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> his<00:01:32.759> area<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.659> Saturn

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
over the wall to his area now Saturn

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.420 
over the wall to his area now Saturn
gives<00:01:34.320> experience<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.009> par<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
gives experience on par with the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
gives experience on par with the
previous<00:01:35.790> two<00:01:35.939> bosses<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.900> found<00:01:37.110> this

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
previous two bosses but I found this

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
previous two bosses but I found this
fight<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.860> quite<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:39.060> quicker<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.689> you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
fight to be quite a bit quicker so you

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.510 
fight to be quite a bit quicker so you
can<00:01:39.930> level<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.229> faster<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.220> honest

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
can level up faster here to be honest

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.819 
can level up faster here to be honest
with<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.210> matter<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.450> fact<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.560> one

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
with you as a matter of fact this one

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920 
with you as a matter of fact this one
was<00:01:44.009> such<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> short<00:01:44.610> clip<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.149> don't<00:01:45.630> even

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
was such a short clip that I don't even
