00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:03.710
 therefore 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.250
 mantova 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.949
 beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.949
 there 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.099
 to install a mortise lock 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.349
 we must first measure on the entrance door of the lock you have to 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.010
 to have 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.340
 in our example we then choose the locks I will say 74 35 with ahahah plates 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.720
 round edges and finish 8 born in the version with entrance from 70000 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.900
 let's see how it goes with a simple operation the latch is reversible 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.490
 in order to be able to adapt right and left doors, install it 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.490
 do oo aspic 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.080
 unlike most of the mortise locks available in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.950
 trade 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 the viro locks have a front plate 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.660
 to replace in case it is 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.900
 scratched oxidized oooh vary the aesthetic finish without having to change 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.900
 the lock 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 let's apply it to the jamb 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 and fix it with the three supplied screws 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 then insert the door lock 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.100
 hey let's stop it with the two supplied screws 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.149
 I fell in love 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.149
 the total thickness of the door 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:15.119
 considering also that of the possible insignia for the cylinder 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:21.739
 we identify what size the two sides of the cylinder suitable for the door must have 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.209
 in our example the outer side is 30 millimeters 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.779
 the inner side 40 mm 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.230
 then we slip in 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.370
 the cylinder in the door to find yourself in the right position 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.370
 let's send the lock bolt 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:40.829
 finally 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.949
 we stop the cylinder with the supplied screw 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:48.439
 we want now the newly assembled cylinder with a rosette of 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.749
 safety of rho article 800 8 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.389
 using the inner ring with medimax we want the door and move on 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.269
 he has two through the holes in the din standard on the case of the super tour and shooting 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.269
 mandates 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.799
 the rosette can be adjusted according to the external protrusion of the chile 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.759
 and it must be fixed from the inside tightening the two screws provided 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:30.089
 then we apply the internal escutcheon with aesthetic function by pressure 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:35.149
 the last necessary operation is the assembly of the handle we insert the 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.989
 framework and who we are the insignia with the relative victims 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.579
 finally we verify the correct functioning of the lock 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.709
 let's see now how the cylinder is protected by the safety washer la 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.709
 whose conical shape prevents me from tearing 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.999
 and whose tempered steel votive plate contrasts the action 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.999
 of the drill 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.670
 in our example a 700 series cylinder was installed 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.750
 equipped with an emergency opening that allows you to enter from the outside with the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.400
 key even if another key remained inserted from the inside 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.200
 however the mortise locks and the black 7 safety locks will be suitable for everyone 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.370
 the types of profiled cylinders 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.699
 Thanks for the attention 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.499
 but 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:45.709
 beautiful mantova beautiful star 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.000
