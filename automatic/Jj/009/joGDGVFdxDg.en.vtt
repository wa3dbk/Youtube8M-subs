00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
isn't necessary I mean you can't just

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.300 
isn't necessary I mean you can't just
run<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:48.080> through<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.409> machine<00:01:50.080> holding<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.310> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
run it through the machine holding it a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.490 
run it through the machine holding it a
little<00:01:53.090> slower<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.740> trick<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.220> not<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.970> I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
little slower the trick is not that I

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.710 
little slower the trick is not that I
have<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.770> seam<00:01:58.130> stick<00:01:58.610> up<00:01:58.789> so<00:01:59.060> high<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.330> it

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
have this seam stick up so high that it

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.130 
have this seam stick up so high that it
looks<00:01:59.869> like<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.050> back<00:02:00.409> bone<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.750> middle<00:02:03.049> of

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
looks like a back bone the middle of

looks like a back bone the middle of
your<00:02:03.259> seat<00:02:07.869> then<00:02:08.869> we'll<00:02:09.019> take<00:02:09.229> our

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
what you're working with

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.310 
what you're working with
you've<00:02:20.000> got<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.239> place<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.630> directly<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
you've got to place it directly in the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.310 
you've got to place it directly in the
middle<00:02:22.690> where<00:02:23.690> you're<00:02:23.810> going<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> make<00:02:24.140> your

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
middle where you're going to make your

middle where you're going to make your
scene<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.450> shares<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:27.079> equal<00:02:27.380> parts<00:02:27.709> here

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.300 

got<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.109> lift<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.440> up<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.739> make<00:02:33.920> sure<00:02:33.950> that

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
got to lift it up and make sure that

00:02:34.310 --> 00:03:10.470 
got to lift it up and make sure that
it's<00:02:34.489> centered<00:02:34.790> as<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.540> drop<00:02:35.870> it

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.849 

sometimes<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.659> have<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.870> do<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.349> method

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
sometimes you have to do this method

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.420 
sometimes you have to do this method
that's<00:03:13.459> what<00:03:13.670> I'll<00:03:13.849> have<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:14.060> do<00:03:14.329> on<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.629> sides

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that's what I'll have to do on the sides

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.379 
that's what I'll have to do on the sides
but<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:18.620> trim<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.099> excess<00:03:19.579> away<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.239> this

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
but you trim this excess away and this

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:34.449 
but you trim this excess away and this
is<00:03:20.569> about<00:03:20.810> as<00:03:21.019> flat<00:03:21.200> as<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.590> can<00:03:21.769> get<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:33.459> you

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
is about as flat as you can get it you

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.429 
is about as flat as you can get it you
can<00:03:34.609> definitely<00:03:34.760> take<00:03:35.239> your<00:03:35.420> hand<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.959> rub<00:03:36.079> it

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
can definitely take your hand and rub it

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.210 
can definitely take your hand and rub it
and<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:37.069> can<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.909> can<00:03:37.970> feel<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.689> raised<00:03:39.220> part

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
and you can you can feel the raised part

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.689 
and you can you can feel the raised part
of<00:03:40.549> where<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.090> folded
