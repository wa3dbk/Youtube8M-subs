00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
 My goodness 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.800
 That is fermented soybeans 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.660
 I know 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.860
 I just saw the dead fish 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.040
 Awkward 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.060
 (American children taste breakfast around the world) 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.640
 Korea 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 These three look very spicy 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.600
 Don't you like it? 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 It will make me feel like this 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.180
 Good special taste 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.240
 Brazil 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.840
 Is that coffee? 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 I think it makes the Brazilian kids coffee very strange. 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.080
 I hate coffee 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.500
 What does it feel like coffee to drink? 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.060
 I was serious 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.120
 Like a cow 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.580
 Finland 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.880
 Do not 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.340
 I won't eat fish in the morning. 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.920
 I know that I won't like this. 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 I hate eating salmon. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.360
 This piece of bread is so soft 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 Can use it as my pillow 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.980
 It can be used as my breakfast 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.900
 Guess what country it is for breakfast 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 Africa? 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.760
 Finland? 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.400
 Yes, it is Finland. 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.140
 What is Finland? 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.160
 He is a country in Europe 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.060
 Oh 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.300
 Ok 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.640
 Vietnam 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 This won't be my breakfast 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.720
 I have never seen a black egg 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.320
 Is that egg delicious? 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.960
 He smells like a mobile toilet 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.460
 with 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.200
 Rotten egg 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.200
 this is delicious 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.320
 Must you eat the whole egg? 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.140
 This is super delicious 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.680
 Super delicious 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.920
 Poland 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.240
 Eat like french fries 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.400
 As delicious as French fries 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.300
 Where is Poland? 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.060
 I really don't know geometric analysis? 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.880
 I went to the big size 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.740
 If I eat too much, my mom will call me "pig" 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.700
 Mom, have you heard it? 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.900
 Are you full? 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.160
 Netherlands 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.580
 I think my friend won't take this as breakfast. 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.140
 Because their mother would say this is very unhealthy 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.860
 This is delicious 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.020
 People take this as breakfast? 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.960
 If you fold it in half, you donâ€™t know how it tastes. 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.060
 Is it up to me? 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.720
 it is good 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.420
 End
