00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.139
 very short slot because just 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.089
 have hinted for many is yes 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.279
 national now dortmund in front of the bavaria 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.990
 if I understood you correctly 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 do not see new number one im 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.680
 German football but you would the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.090
 international success while higher 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.730
 assess and still say with us 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 the number one in germany 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.820
 We do not just want to be sporty and sporty 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 Of course if you can, of course you can 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.620
 the match bavaria munich in dortmund 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 See how tight that was because the punishment 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.719
 goes in from robin and bayern munich 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 wins in still playing nuts I say 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.280
 bavaria will still be german champion 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.629
 even though 103 points before had to make 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 the next away game bavaria 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.750
 Home game would be pari pari that must 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.730
 to wait 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.300
 but here are the blocks and the two 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.210
 she already finds the players 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.469
 already find each other like that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.629
 introduce the coach 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 Of course we have a problem 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.690
 we also have to bend something and that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.799
 the most important or very important 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.590
 performance cases not the most important 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.000
 but very important, namely an axis 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.400
 mertesacker schweinsteiger and klose 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.650
 all to do with prolonged injuries 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.869
 everyone did not come with a lot 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.920
 game practice and absolutely 100 percent 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.600
 fit for this european championship 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.159
 now the game or I play the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.409
 yes, already done 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.939
 that gives him competition of course 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.780
 experience that is important for one 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.360
 defender 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.100
 yes and of course he has here and there 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 still slight problems but these two 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 games that he did there and so there 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950
 it will rely more on him than on 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.850
 hummels 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.200
 because that's the decision 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.600
 Löw ultimately gave up clearly 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.490
 badstuber set as a spectator salt 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 Of course hummels must play but as 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.290
 Trainer I say you have of course 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.210
 badstuber and after the ak also a few 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.409
 as they played the qualification 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.600
 you have more confidence 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.100
 but again we have no problem in 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.100
 the defensive not at all 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.600
 he says something different in switzerland 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.360
 important important is that we are ahead 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.310
 the defense against our four-chain that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.319
 we always have two players for 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.220
 we are always in need of it 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.110
 take care that we have more than enough 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.410
 Of course, by the victory of the Swiss 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.879
 we were always under number in below 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.980
 of course that will not be allowed 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.540
 there you are right it will be 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.360
 therefore not happen anymore because 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 He very clearly showed how 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.380
 the Germans are not allowed to play 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.239
 You can not do one internationally today 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.630
 come to one against one situations 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.209
 to let 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.250
 You only ever have two situations 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.750
 therefore one criticizes the four-chain 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.540
 but the two players in front of them 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.120
 to have room to set the must have to be there 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.970
 That's why I say at ball loss 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.069
 We switch immediately that we outnumber 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.410
 have on the defensive 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.209
 the steak does not go back to the front 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.760
 at poldi at the beginning also at 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.170
 gomez or at klose then of course 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.660
 khedira schweinsteiger are with the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.030
 system of the khedira schweinsteiger 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.980
 özil 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.889
 they have to move we have to move them 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.299
 offensive for defensive yes big now 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.889
 plays for Schweinsteiger 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.489
 that is a pity that schweinsteiger is 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:23.269
 of course and I believe that joachim 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.010
 Loew also no risk that received 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.120
 Schweinsteiger does choose it is a pity he 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.420
 deserves it 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.590
 he was injured for a long time but had 1996 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.720
 I also have a few failures 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.310
 Of course that brings one or the other 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.359
 other players say we have to go now 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.549
 do more 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.859
 there is the german the mentality of 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.299
 German is totally different that you look 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.590
 then have to pull together right now 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.510
 We also do not have pigs 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.510
 more and we can do it
