the<00:01:10.330> idea<00:01:10.690> of<00:01:10.810> improvisation<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.640> very

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
the idea of improvisation is a very

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.139 
the idea of improvisation is a very
personal<00:01:13.780> approach<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.710> express<00:01:15.460> oneself<00:01:15.909> I

personal approach to express oneself I
think<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:16.690> for<00:01:17.590> me<00:01:17.770> improvisation<00:01:18.610> is<00:01:18.820> really

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
think and for me improvisation is really

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.270 
think and for me improvisation is really
a<00:01:20.460> lifetime<00:01:21.460> path<00:01:21.759> I<00:01:22.060> think<00:01:22.960> my<00:01:23.440> love<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.920> jazz

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.540 
a lifetime path I think my love to jazz
music<00:01:24.880> comes<00:01:25.060> from<00:01:25.180> really<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:25.990> deep<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.649> wish

music comes from really a deep in a wish

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.320 
music comes from really a deep in a wish
and<00:01:27.820> deep<00:01:28.060> inner<00:01:28.360> source<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:29.759> express<00:01:30.759> myself

and deep inner source to express myself

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.770 
and deep inner source to express myself
in<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.810> way<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.020> discover<00:01:32.560> things<00:01:33.780> improvising

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
in a way to discover things improvising

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.749 
in a way to discover things improvising
to<00:01:34.990> create<00:01:35.289> something<00:01:35.770> out<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.250> moment

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
to create something out of the moment

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.230

so<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.539> really<00:01:38.340> each<00:01:39.340> concert<00:01:40.000> each

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
so that really each concert each

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.559 
so that really each concert each
performance<00:01:40.899> has<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> unique<00:01:41.800> character<00:01:42.610> for

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
performance has a unique character for

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.040 
performance has a unique character for
me<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.380> be<00:01:44.560> happy<00:01:45.009> as<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:46.330> would<00:01:46.600> call<00:01:46.840> the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
me to be happy as a I would call the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.770 
me to be happy as a I would call the
lifetime<00:01:47.590> job<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.220> not<00:01:48.550> something<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.630> have

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
lifetime job it's not something you have

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.139 
lifetime job it's not something you have
one<00:01:50.050> experience<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.039> then<00:01:51.159> you<00:01:51.460> say<00:01:51.700> oh<00:01:51.880> now

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149
