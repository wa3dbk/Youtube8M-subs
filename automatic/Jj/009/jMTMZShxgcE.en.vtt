00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
each other the ricochet would bug out

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
each other the ricochet would bug out
and<00:00:47.160> bounce<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.670> infinite<00:00:48.149> number<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.420> times

and bounce an infinite number of times

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.869 
and bounce an infinite number of times
causing<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> insta<00:00:50.160> kill<00:00:50.340> both<00:00:50.670> targets

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Fiddlesticks insta-kill bug it was a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
Fiddlesticks insta-kill bug it was a
little<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.719> easier<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.109> reproduce<00:00:58.649> them<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
little bit easier to reproduce them the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.740 
little bit easier to reproduce them the
Sivir<00:00:59.280> bug<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> time<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.449> she<00:01:00.510> could

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
Sivir bug at the time but she could

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299 
Sivir bug at the time but she could
throw<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.109> Dark<00:01:01.440> Wind<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.129> bug

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
throw out a Dark Wind and it would bug

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
throw out a Dark Wind and it would bug
out<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:03.329> Sara's<00:01:03.690> ricochet<00:01:04.110> bounce<00:01:04.619> an

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
out and like Sara's ricochet bounce an

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.410 
out and like Sara's ricochet bounce an
infinite<00:01:05.250> number<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> times<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.180> an

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
infinite number of times for an

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.450 
infinite number of times for an
insta-kill<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> target<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:08.159> quite

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
insta-kill on the target it's quite

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.370 
insta-kill on the target it's quite
similar<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> Sivir<00:01:09.270> bug<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.750> once<00:01:10.229> again

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
similar to the Sivir bug and once again

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.200 
similar to the Sivir bug and once again
led<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> some<00:01:11.040> pretty<00:01:11.280> hilarious<00:01:11.549> moments

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
led to some pretty hilarious moments

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.480 
led to some pretty hilarious moments

I know I say League of Legends is an
objective<00:01:19.619> focused<00:01:20.159> game<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
objective focused game but it's kind of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
objective focused game but it's kind of
hard<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.380> play<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.580> 0<00:01:23.880> is

this<00:03:38.329> bug<00:03:38.600> essentially<00:03:39.380> made<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.709> invincible

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
this bug essentially made you invincible

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.890 
this bug essentially made you invincible
and<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.850> could<00:03:41.000> just<00:03:41.090> run<00:03:41.329> around<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.720> do

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
and you could just run around and do

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.900 
and you could just run around and do
anything<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.319> want<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:43.220> was<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.489> little<00:03:43.760> bit

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
anything you want it was a little bit

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.160 
anything you want it was a little bit
more<00:03:44.060> finicky<00:03:44.389> than<00:03:44.660> some<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.049> other

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
more finicky than some of the other

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.330 
more finicky than some of the other
invincibility<00:03:45.799> bugs

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
invincibility bugs

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.390 
invincibility bugs
so<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.790> takes<00:03:46.880> home<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.150> bronze<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:48.400> number

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
so it takes home the bronze and number

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.059 
so it takes home the bronze and number
two<00:03:49.579> we<00:03:49.760> have<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:49.970> collection<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.859> what<00:03:51.859> were

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
two we have a collection of what were

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.879 
two we have a collection of what were
essentially<00:03:52.639> pure<00:03:53.329> invincibility<00:03:54.109> bugs<00:03:54.560> it

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
essentially pure invincibility bugs it

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.129 
essentially pure invincibility bugs it
was<00:03:55.400> mainly<00:03:55.670> producible<00:03:56.239> with<00:03:56.480> Karthus<00:03:56.930> and

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
was mainly producible with Karthus and

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.590 
was mainly producible with Karthus and
it<00:03:57.260> caused<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.769> be<00:03:57.859> completely

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
it caused you to be completely

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.819 
it caused you to be completely
invincible<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.810> everything

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
invincible to everything

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.099 
invincible to everything
I<00:04:00.859> never<00:04:01.400> thought<00:04:01.579> Qarth<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:02.060> passive<00:04:02.540> being

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
I never thought Qarth is passive being

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.520 
I never thought Qarth is passive being
so<00:04:03.620> useless<00:04:04.190> could<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:04.819> so<00:04:05.120> overpowered<00:04:05.959> you

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
so useless could be so overpowered you

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.259 
so useless could be so overpowered you
would<00:04:06.680> literally<00:04:07.160> just<00:04:07.310> run<00:04:07.609> around<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.090> do

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
would literally just run around and do

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.879 
would literally just run around and do
whatever<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.900> want<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.410> if<00:04:09.590> you<00:04:09.709> were<00:04:09.859> really

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
wanting to win the game you could just

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.800 
wanting to win the game you could just
go<00:04:12.019> take<00:04:12.260> all<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.560> towers<00:04:12.859> and<00:04:13.010> win<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.220> game

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810

that<00:04:48.030> makes<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.300> invincible<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:48.990> just<00:04:49.230> so

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
that makes you invincible is just so

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.350 
that makes you invincible is just so
insane<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.610> makes<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.910> game<00:04:51.030> totally

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
insane and it makes the game totally

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.690 
insane and it makes the game totally
unusable<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:53.070> could<00:04:53.250> really<00:04:53.460> just

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
unusable and you could really just

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.120 
unusable and you could really just
steamroll<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.240> entire<00:04:54.630> enemy<00:04:54.960> team<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:55.440> 1v5
