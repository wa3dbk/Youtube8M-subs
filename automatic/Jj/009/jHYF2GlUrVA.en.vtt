our<00:03:04.980> mind<00:03:05.310> by<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.730> way<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.150> where<00:03:06.300> we<00:03:06.390> get

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
our mind by the way this is where we get

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.930 
our mind by the way this is where we get
most<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.959> our<00:03:07.050> resources<00:03:07.440> as<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:07.980> see<00:03:08.160> and

lots<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:45.050> resources<00:04:46.240> because<00:04:47.240> we're<00:04:47.539> actually

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
lots of resources because we're actually

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.810 
lots of resources because we're actually
run<00:04:48.470> really<00:04:48.800> low<00:04:48.979> we<00:04:49.360> have<00:04:50.360> rebuilt<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:52.669> house

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
run really low we have rebuilt the house

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.940 
run really low we have rebuilt the house
that<00:04:53.000> was<00:04:53.120> burned<00:04:53.300> down<00:04:54.729> initially<00:04:55.729> and<00:04:56.950> it's

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
that was burned down initially and it's

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.950 
that was burned down initially and it's
not<00:04:58.130> exactly<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.580> same<00:04:58.850> we're<00:04:59.630> gonna<00:04:59.780> hold

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
not exactly the same we're gonna hold

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.719 
not exactly the same we're gonna hold
off<00:05:00.139> using<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.830> fire<00:05:01.400> thing<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:02.780> then<00:05:02.960> just

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
off using the fire thing and then just

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.730 
off using the fire thing and then just
while<00:05:04.729> we<00:05:05.000> kind<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.300> figure<00:05:05.780> out<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.960> bugs

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
while we kind of figure out the bugs

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.550 
while we kind of figure out the bugs
will<00:05:07.039> so<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:07.639> speak<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:09.080> fact<00:05:09.320> that<00:05:09.380> I've

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560
