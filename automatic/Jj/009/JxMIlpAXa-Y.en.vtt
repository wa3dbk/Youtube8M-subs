life I think we should always keep on
learning<00:04:51.490> but<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.060> think<00:04:52.419> we<00:04:52.599> need<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.990> be

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
learning but I think we need to be

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.559 
learning but I think we need to be
especially<00:04:53.229> shrewd<00:04:54.009> when<00:04:54.310> we<00:04:54.460> choose<00:04:55.240> whether

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
especially shrewd when we choose whether

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.200 
especially shrewd when we choose whether
or<00:04:55.750> not<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.110> go<00:04:56.289> to<00:04:56.770> college<00:04:57.389> for<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.449> particular

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
or not to go to college for a particular

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.920 
or not to go to college for a particular
particular<00:05:02.610> genre<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:04.000> if<00:05:04.330> you're<00:05:04.630> thinking
