be 12 hidden chests in this tutorial

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.200 
be 12 hidden chests in this tutorial
world<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.500> zoom<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.670> see

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
world also and if we zoom in you can see

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.270 
world also and if we zoom in you can see
this<00:00:51.539> arm<00:00:52.190> stone<00:00:53.190> brick<00:00:54.320> building<00:00:55.320> right

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this arm stone brick building right

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
this arm stone brick building right
behind<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.820> chest<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.960> sure<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.350> can

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
behind the chest I'm not sure if you can

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.430 
behind the chest I'm not sure if you can
see<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> well<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.670> some<00:01:00.390> breaking<00:01:00.930> stone

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
see it well but it's some breaking stone

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.750 
see it well but it's some breaking stone
and<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.539> thinking<00:01:04.080> maybe<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:05.250> um<00:01:07.760> made

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and so I'm thinking maybe they um made

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.440 
and so I'm thinking maybe they um made
another<00:01:09.180> castle<00:01:09.540> possibly<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.979> probably

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
another castle possibly or it's probably

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.560 
another castle possibly or it's probably
like<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> house<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:15.500> um<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.979> goes<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.610> pretty

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
like a house and um it goes it pretty

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
like a house and um it goes it pretty
much<00:01:18.689> covers<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> whole<00:01:19.890> village<00:01:20.310> power

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
much covers up the whole village power

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.010 
much covers up the whole village power
possibly<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.650> also<00:01:22.650> um<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.810> see

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
possibly and also um as you can see

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.160 
possibly and also um as you can see
there's<00:01:25.290> fire<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> top<00:01:26.580> too<00:01:27.170> that's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
there's fire on the top too that's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
there's fire on the top too that's
probably<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.159> welcome<00:01:29.820> son<00:01:30.060> or

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
probably just like a welcome son or

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.980 
probably just like a welcome son or
something<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.880> also<00:01:35.360> 4j<00:01:36.360> Studios

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
something like that and also 4j Studios

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
something like that and also 4j Studios
said<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> youtube<00:01:38.700> accounts

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
said that they have a youtube accounts

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.340 
said that they have a youtube accounts
it's<00:01:39.840> 4j<00:01:40.320> Studios<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.159> course<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.990> will

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350

I<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.869> will<00:01:49.079> probably<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.770> an

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I think this will probably be an
