00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.930
 and hello everyone with you frost ball 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.880
 mister lololoshka pioneer and morgue fe 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 Hello, hello again, I 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.860
 however hello we are on 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.960
 nanotech pvp server three and now we 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.399
 we will review it as we were late 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 all our past servers 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.800
 let's start with the fact that I move on spawn 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.440
 Now we reel circle and get the most 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 lair spawn someone probably running 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
 well ahead of me that i don't see them 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 cunning move so go here with us 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.430
 as usual in style but you che 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.980
 graphic display steering fixed everything 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.690
 things if we go down to the floor below here 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 we can watch this one with you 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.420
 wonderful indoor chest is written here 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.020
 squeezed 124 the whole server went down all 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.340
 server came down heard only as 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.619
 ladder pops from the pressure of the players damn I'm 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.380
 also the whole server went down again 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.990
 got up well oh hell come down again 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.189
 let me get out 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.290
 great let's look at the spawn 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.110
 from above not everyone can take off not everyone 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.340
 will master it but someone can still 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.430
 so it looks on top 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.070
 big pool he is very guarded in 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.950
 principle here we have portals to hell and in 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.490
 the edge not everyone will find them I think but 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.409
 not less 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.290
 placed not quite comfortable here 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.540
 enchanted I understand from that side 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.780
 most likely yes pig 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.390
 fed to but here sense no no no fed 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.310
 to pigs shorter for players this here 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.729
 what else do we have here let's see 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.690
 if there is no splif there is no phone here 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.240
 wait for me to spliff it 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:11.870
 there is a good big Ramadan here 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.820
 home i sing niro and oh no yes against this background 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.420
 something really beautiful built 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.420
 new city 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.140
 so let's wait until all 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.910
 progruzutsya here the skeleton poor thing 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.040
 burning poor-poor enough to burn everything 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.790
 Okay, all is well, all so we have here 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.830
 there are some houses here all slowly 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.590
 loaded pretty but we wake up 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.660
 fly and everything will be faster beautiful 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.280
 fence 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.050
 incomprehensible stylistic some 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:52.160
 decorated well like direct this for 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.870
 I fly so the gate here but in general 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.610
 so here is such a city me a city 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.470
 unusually every server we have by the way you 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.280
 noticed almost every server is something he 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.739
 notable 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.950
 somewhere there is a city somewhere splif 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.750
 beautiful arena somewhere morgue on the roof 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.370
 standing here for 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.380
 here the fence here is so healthy straight 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.829
 built well it would be all on that 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.200
 nights so realize damn by the way 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.940
 maternity hospital for some reason does not participate in them 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.130
 well and let me think go home 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.600

 anus port is not something wrong here, see how 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.230
 he built his house 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.400
 I didnâ€™t expect him to be this guy 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.280
 you are watching this guy and that could 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:00.079
 left let's slap him 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.460
 he took off his true face wow you are on it 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:06.760
 armor grows 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.760
 and you saw my cool raincoat 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.500

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.360

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.330
 good house again bees don't like bees in 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.190
 last time bit from another player well 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.900
 yes his house is really nice but 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.240
 here is a plot of some kind 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.170
 little sarah and i would say here 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.050
 watching cows 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.500
 disputes you breed sheep board 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.710
 rolls 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.900
 I have a cool house she writes to him 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.090
 still converges to it on the condition it is anonymous but 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.770
 he is also not a bad solar house 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.450
 the panels are basically all decorated and 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.760
 more than I do, in general, I do not have 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.460
 Perhaps they and the tradition of top-down probably 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:04.130
 only on solar panels and and survives 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:06.380
 so who else answered me there too 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.420
 unfinished so send it to me 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.310
 Freeda Freeda is not any shorter than Humphrey 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.380
 dowtham but let's still have his house for prices 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.880
 and I think that's enough to check out at home 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.810
 well this is of course a wonderful house 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.600
 built from 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:29.930
 in st in pocket scam styled from some 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.230
 chocolate and not chocolate boards windows 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:38.270
 no windows no stove but there is no window 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:44.000
 there is actually on the first floor 22 th 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:46.700
 2 to the floor of the river so you 4 let's go 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.760
