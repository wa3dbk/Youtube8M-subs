00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you can see how they're kind of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.920 
you can see how they're kind of
unpredictable<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.460> very<00:00:41.760> powerful<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.809> it's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
unpredictable but very powerful but it's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770

hourglass<00:00:46.350> allows<00:00:47.309> her<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> double<00:00:47.940> herself

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
hourglass allows her to double herself

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.930 
hourglass allows her to double herself
that<00:00:49.559> will<00:00:49.710> follow<00:00:49.980> shortly<00:00:50.100> behind<00:00:50.610> her

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that will follow shortly behind her

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.350 
that will follow shortly behind her
copying<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.489> before<00:00:53.489> effectively

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
copying what you do before effectively

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
copying what you do before effectively
breaking<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.379> hourglass<00:00:55.800> again<00:00:56.160> exploding

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
breaking that hourglass again exploding

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
breaking that hourglass again exploding
and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.989> her<00:00:58.379> tertiary<00:00:58.859> attack<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and then her tertiary attack is the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.580 
and then her tertiary attack is the
ability<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.760> create<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.270> black<00:01:01.020> hole<00:01:01.050> which

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
ability to create this black hole which

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.520 
ability to create this black hole which
will<00:01:01.739> suck<00:01:01.949> villains<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.789> well<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.719> kind<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
will suck villains in as well as kind of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
will suck villains in as well as kind of
your<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:05.129> own<00:01:05.250> attacks<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
your your own attacks and the more you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.940 
your your own attacks and the more you
attack<00:01:06.600> around<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> create<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.710> black

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
attack around that you create a black

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
attack around that you create a black
hole<00:01:08.189> which<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.549> explode<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.299> she's<00:01:10.200> got

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
hole which will explode so she's got

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840 
hole which will explode so she's got
some<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.830> unique<00:01:10.979> attacks<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.760> the

some really unique attacks and the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
some really unique attacks and the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
ability to have that double see you so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
ability to have that double see you so
we<00:01:14.070> made<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> black<00:01:14.520> hole<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:15.119> well<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
we made a black hole right well if you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.370 
we made a black hole right well if you
use<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.960> double<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.700> create<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.390> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
use the double and then create one you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
use the double and then create one you
then<00:01:19.560> effectively<00:01:19.920> create<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:20.880> your

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
then effectively create two because your

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.499 
then effectively create two because your
double<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> same<00:01:23.210> doubling<00:01:24.210> your

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
double will do the same doubling your

did and do it again with now double the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580 
did and do it again with now double the
power<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.780> let's<00:01:49.020> hop<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
power so let's hop in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.190 
power so let's hop in
so<00:01:49.979> yeah<00:01:50.130> her<00:01:50.340> space-time<00:01:50.909> shots<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so yeah her space-time shots they have a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.010 
so yeah her space-time shots they have a
slight<00:01:52.560> homing<00:01:53.070> ability<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.610> great<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
slight homing ability which is great the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
slight homing ability which is great the
past<00:01:55.350> selves<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.250> showed<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.610> where

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
past selves is what we showed you where

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.969 
past selves is what we showed you where
you<00:01:56.850> double<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.659> character<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.799> can

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
you double your character and you can

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.499 
you double your character and you can
actually<00:01:59.130> switch<00:01:59.670> places<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> which

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
actually switch places with it which

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
actually switch places with it which
I'll<00:02:00.659> show<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> shortly<00:02:01.320> by<00:02:01.920> tapping<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I'll show you shortly by tapping the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.459 
I'll show you shortly by tapping the
button<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> time<00:02:03.329> rifts<00:02:03.630> which<00:02:04.259> if

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
button and then the time rifts which if

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.530 
button and then the time rifts which if
you<00:02:04.649> shoe<00:02:04.890> create<00:02:05.310> an<00:02:05.399> explosive<00:02:05.850> black<00:02:06.270> hole

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
you shoe create an explosive black hole

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900 
you shoe create an explosive black hole
but<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.710> upgrade<00:02:08.069> err<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
but then as you upgrade err you have the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.949 
but then as you upgrade err you have the
long-term<00:02:09.149> memory<00:02:09.569> they<00:02:09.929> play<00:02:10.110> longer

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
long-term memory they play longer

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.229 
long-term memory they play longer
the<00:02:11.409> time<00:02:11.650> rift<00:02:11.950> allows<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.730> make<00:02:12.849> more<00:02:13.060> of

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
the time rift allows you to make more of

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.170 
the time rift allows you to make more of
them<00:02:13.420> thus<00:02:13.689> making<00:02:14.049> more<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.349> these<00:02:15.180> explosive

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
them thus making more of these explosive

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.500 
them thus making more of these explosive
black<00:02:16.659> holes<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:18.549> know<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> past<00:02:19.030> selves

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
black holes and you know the past selves

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.110 
black holes and you know the past selves
firing<00:02:20.019> additional<00:02:20.560> attacks<00:02:20.920> as<00:02:21.129> well<00:02:21.159> but

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
firing additional attacks as well but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.670 
firing additional attacks as well but
then<00:02:22.239> when<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.510> upgrade<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.590> know

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
then when you upgrade you have you know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.740 
then when you upgrade you have you know
your<00:02:23.859> two<00:02:23.980> choices<00:02:24.189> so<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
your two choices so we have the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.720 
your two choices so we have the
explosion<00:02:26.500> deja<00:02:26.859> vu<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.340> past<00:02:27.519> self

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
explosion deja vu and the past self

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.330 
explosion deja vu and the past self
explodes<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.569> explosion<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.170> repeated<00:02:29.709> two

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
explodes the explosion is repeated two

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.309 
explodes the explosion is repeated two
more<00:02:30.579> times<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.150> lot<00:02:31.359> of<00:02:31.389> crazy<00:02:31.780> repeating

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
more times so a lot of crazy repeating

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.830 
more times so a lot of crazy repeating
time<00:02:32.549> time<00:02:33.549> heals<00:02:33.819> all<00:02:34.000> wounds<00:02:34.269> when<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.599> past

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
time time heals all wounds when a past

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.420 
time time heals all wounds when a past
self<00:02:35.049> takes<00:02:35.260> damage<00:02:35.500> you're<00:02:35.829> healed

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
self takes damage you're healed

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.390 
self takes damage you're healed
which<00:02:37.319> it's<00:02:38.319> kind<00:02:38.469> of<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.590> paradox<00:02:38.739> which<00:02:39.250> is

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
which it's kind of a paradox which is

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.059 
which it's kind of a paradox which is
fun<00:02:39.609> and<00:02:39.849> then<00:02:40.569> press<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.590> square<00:02:41.739> button<00:02:41.829> to

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
fun and then press the square button to

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.280 
fun and then press the square button to
shoot<00:02:42.189> two<00:02:42.700> shots<00:02:42.970> at<00:02:43.150> once<00:02:43.329> so<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.109> can

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
shoot two shots at once so you can

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.539 
shoot two shots at once so you can
imagine<00:02:44.409> having<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.859> past<00:02:45.069> selves<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.430> now

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
imagine having a past selves you're now

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.240 
imagine having a past selves you're now
shooting<00:02:45.849> four<00:02:46.239> times<00:02:46.540> which<00:02:47.379> is<00:02:47.530> completely

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
shooting four times which is completely

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.520 
shooting four times which is completely
crazy<00:02:48.549> but<00:02:49.329> then<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.629> this<00:02:49.780> one<00:02:50.049> where

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
crazy but then it's this one where

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.050 
crazy but then it's this one where
you're<00:02:50.709> able<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.980> shoot<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.430> past<00:02:51.639> self<00:02:51.909> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
you're able to shoot a past self to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.420 
you're able to shoot a past self to
create<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.299> work<00:02:52.510> field<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:53.799> interacting

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
create a work field so it's interacting

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.670 
create a work field so it's interacting
with<00:02:54.459> your<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.510> your<00:02:56.019> past<00:02:56.260> selves

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
with your you know your past selves

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.920 
with your you know your past selves
their<00:02:56.980> past<00:02:57.909> selves<00:02:58.150> do<00:02:58.239> extra<00:02:58.510> damage<00:02:58.689> and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
their past selves do extra damage and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.649 
their past selves do extra damage and
freeze<00:02:59.319> nearby<00:03:00.040> enemies<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:01.480> when<00:03:01.629> a

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
freeze nearby enemies and then when a

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.750 
freeze nearby enemies and then when a
pass-off<00:03:02.109> explodes<00:03:02.829> or<00:03:03.250> when<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.459> switch

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
pass-off explodes or when you switch

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.149 
pass-off explodes or when you switch
with<00:03:03.969> it<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.510> releases<00:03:04.840> additional<00:03:05.829> attacks

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
with it it releases additional attacks

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.849 
with it it releases additional attacks
and<00:03:06.519> then<00:03:07.090> finally<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:08.019> black<00:03:08.260> hole<00:03:08.469> bedlam

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
and then finally the black hole bedlam

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.080 
and then finally the black hole bedlam
this<00:03:09.040> thing's<00:03:09.250> really<00:03:09.430> cool<00:03:09.549> where<00:03:09.909> if<00:03:10.000> you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
this thing's really cool where if you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.940 
this thing's really cool where if you
power<00:03:10.299> it<00:03:10.450> up<00:03:10.659> you'll<00:03:11.139> actually<00:03:11.319> see<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.739> bunch

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
power it up you'll actually see a bunch

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.819 
power it up you'll actually see a bunch
of<00:03:12.040> grandfather<00:03:12.669> clocks<00:03:13.319> rotating<00:03:14.319> around<00:03:14.439> it

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
of grandfather clocks rotating around it

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.680 
of grandfather clocks rotating around it
when<00:03:14.949> it<00:03:15.040> does<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.340> black<00:03:15.519> hole<00:03:15.819> thus

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
when it does the black hole thus

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.890 
when it does the black hole thus
creating<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:17.260> more<00:03:17.440> time<00:03:17.979> attacks<00:03:18.510> yeah<00:03:19.510> so

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
creating you more time attacks yeah so

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.500 
creating you more time attacks yeah so
she's<00:03:20.079> all<00:03:20.229> about<00:03:20.319> time<00:03:20.650> manipulation

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
she's all about time manipulation

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.909 
she's all about time manipulation
utilizing<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.599> secondary<00:03:23.109> character<00:03:23.709> so

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
utilizing a secondary character so

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.699 
utilizing a secondary character so
you'll<00:03:24.069> see<00:03:24.250> let's<00:03:24.879> attack<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.239> bit<00:03:25.560> switch<00:03:26.560> to

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
you'll see let's attack a bit switch to

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.800 
you'll see let's attack a bit switch to
our<00:03:26.799> past<00:03:27.040> selves<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.639> we're<00:03:28.150> doing<00:03:28.359> stuff<00:03:28.449> but

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
our past selves so we're doing stuff but

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.289 
our past selves so we're doing stuff but
by<00:03:29.079> tapping<00:03:29.379> and<00:03:29.739> then<00:03:30.220> switching<00:03:30.879> back<00:03:31.239> and

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
by tapping and then switching back and

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.220 
by tapping and then switching back and
