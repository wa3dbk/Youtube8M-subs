00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.320
 the guys from our kidnapping post and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.190
 every bike race is what was a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 little weird 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 ie do not really know exactly what 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.490
 does it think it's a circuit in plan 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 here air all the time and x giving 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.970
 turns the plan of wise and I already but 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 because I have a bad luck guys 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.800
 he liked it and when he seems to write and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.079
 what is amazing, the good thing is that I think 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.180
 that have stuck those that I go all 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.219
 that he carried ahead so that's because 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.219
 you are here 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.940
 and I think I can catch you honestly 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.010
 I think and think that if garbage therefore 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.010
 time the war is very short 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.760
 I have this pole in front but I get to 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 me that I'm not is a career visit the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.979
 then really, well, a good lesson 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.009
 that just finished basic then let's go 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.659
 to play the same but with a race 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.100
 quite difficult at the time of turning but 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.330
 at the time of the line and we are going to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.770
 give a lot of speed so let's say to 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.119
 trick the critic that I'm back 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.470
 like this example that will perform the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.690
 bet with return so it will be a bit 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.550
 longer and we will give you with reading 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.869
 this bike runs much more than these 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.190
 others that he carried forward at the time of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.080
 create a little anticipating a play 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.850
 to overtake is not going to be that he threw me 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.050
 wait here for my colleagues' mistake 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.910
 are two laps we have time like this 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.710
 that quiet guys at the moment not 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.570
 why we get bad first 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.070
 eye now let's slow down here 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.140
 waiting for these people to stick it 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.090
 basically logically the recommendation 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.410
 of the race puts you worth the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.720
 escort and with the we see that it is easy with 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.070
 This bike is difficult and not good if 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.149
 it's really hard athletic to live it 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.710
 hit all 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.380
 oh what a pity it would really be stuck 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.420
 you do not get to hit and the free way 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.090
 for me but he has not stuck to the boy 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.679
 the guy takes the same bike that I take 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.789
 he does not believe he really advances is that 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.789
 as the front we are going to paste 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.330
 I also knew it would be in one 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.590
 from this first I have sure uncle came to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.440
 take off I'll try to access 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.670
 here to the maximum possible and advance a 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.590
 It will put me in the middle to create 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.810
 that he threw it not to God we are the days 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.840
 Ropes girdles already gone has been left to me 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.910
 they have all put forward the first 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.500
 try to play it guys 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.120
 worth man is worth at least have fallen 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.200
 the first one I'm seeing from here but 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.340
 I do not get life 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.340
 the life but neither of coÃ±a 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 but what's ahead of me but 70 of 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:50.050
 fall if he fell lovillo said but 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:52.290
 we all know that we are in machine 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.290
 true 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.409
 what are you going for, look, I want another, or 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.969
 I really want another rematch of 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.950
 please this same villa until 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.230
 we go through and over and any 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.030
 career is in the good and so 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.500
 I win I have other people 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.300
 I have behind June too 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.650
 is worth the back in the snag we brake 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.650
 here a little bit in the names 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:23.290
 only relaxes and spends race 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.290
 in plan perfectly 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.600
 really the curves I have no need 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.980
 from the previous one tell me that you do not have it 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.390
 I is that this time it is impossible will 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.450
 really leave me time to finger up 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.100
 for boys the good thing is that now in a 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.620
 network on the straight we will win more 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.360
 quite more speed I guess that's what 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.130
 only good good if not if I do not stick it 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.010
 more is that if I stick that 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.360
 speed we win is countered 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.360
 what it comes to be 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:58.480
 this is the first moment forward 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.099
 ok we hit him taught us but if a 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.110
 smack that flipates stadiums and almost 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.629
 sent to the moon 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.629
 eye can not send it to life 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.290
 the jump that 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.430
 Not that I knew I not not say no 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.870
 that not the guys that is not that is not worth 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.579
 I think so 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.549
 all I know is that this is already 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.760
 impossible you have that the rock uncle the rock 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.350
 is very bad with me I think that the one 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.260
 we have in front is the one that gives the first 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.270
 what else he threw before he has sinned mother 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.040
 Alan my son is that I really welcome 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.270
 the guys me what we could confirm 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.410
 that the bicycle is not my thing 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.520
 what are we going to do let's go let's go 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.229
 Come on come on come on come on Come on, I shit on 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.300
 everything already and the goal will be here not 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.300
 I think so 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.729
 for expression work next 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.729
 video 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.910
 yes
