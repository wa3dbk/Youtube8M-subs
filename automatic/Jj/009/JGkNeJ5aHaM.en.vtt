point<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> view<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.020> bead<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.620> actually

point of view the bead in here actually

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680 
point of view the bead in here actually
does<00:00:35.340> an<00:00:35.579> awful<00:00:35.969> lot<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> work<00:00:36.420> not<00:00:36.630> only

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
does an awful lot of the work not only

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.360

does it look beautiful but it's there

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.979 
does it look beautiful but it's there
for<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> reason<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.239> you've<00:00:39.719> got<00:00:39.840> these

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
for a reason because you've got these

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.299 
for a reason because you've got these
lines<00:00:40.290> running<00:00:40.649> around<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.129> again

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
lines running around here and again

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
lines running around here and again
drawing<00:00:41.610> attention<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.809> which

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
drawing attention right in here which

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.779 
drawing attention right in here which
means<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.860> slimming<00:00:44.160> down<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.640> way

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
means it's really slimming down that way

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.340 
means it's really slimming down that way
so<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.059> else<00:00:45.270> helps<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:45.870> well<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.170> just
