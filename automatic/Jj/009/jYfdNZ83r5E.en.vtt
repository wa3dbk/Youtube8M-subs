00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.940
 qualitative review of effects only 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.410
 youtube.com slash nikich movie 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.410
 super speed sense in direct 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.310
 welcome to the studio nikich movie 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.690
 my name is Nikita kulaks and in this 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.730
 video tutorial I will tell you how to do 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.879
 sony super speed effect 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.739
 vegas pro 3 on to do this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.840
 effect we need a cool sweatshirt 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.180
 any superhero who has a super 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.370
 speed and this is sure yes it is 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.229
 sure to do 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.300
 this effect in a static frame us 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.600
 will need to take 2 frames with motion 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.149
 on the z axis or x 1 the frame will contain 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.800
 imagine free space the second frame 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:18.020
 will contain an actor who 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.020
 Moves along the z or x axis 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.740
 next action we have to combine 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 our two captured videos as you could 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.720
 notice at this stage with us 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.340
 the result is a frame composition change on 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 general plan we have to make a sharp 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.220
 movement in the side thereby showing that we 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.810
 already ready to make a quick move 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.479
 now at the junction of the frames we have to do 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.369
 one screenshot for this we need 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.100
 on the preview window, click on the button 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.900
 save the image we have to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.180
 save the image of the end of the first 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.939
 video and the beginning of the second after which 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.450
 put them on the video track higher on 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.700
 frame junction after that we have to go in 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.009
 in the panorama trimming fragment choose 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.439
 function mask anchor creation tool 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.810
 and cut our displacement objects 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.420
 now we have to select the function f and 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.600
 fx and select effect 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.120
 garsing vertical value bler 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.680
 we reduce to zero and value across 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.780
 exhibiting at 500 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.580
 but that 's not the point is that we 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.740
 disassembled how to make this effect with 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.420
 using static frame now 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.860
 let's see how to do this 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.560
 panorama effect 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.510
 accompanying the principle of this effect with 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.670
 panorama is no different 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.530
 from static we do the same 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.900
 screen and just as we cut the video on 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.360
 certain time intervals but for 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.790
 our place of walking on 7z or express 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.239
 frame composition change we put video with 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.910
 our panorama also we must speed up 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.980
 our panorama and on the video track which 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:55.130
 is above add a copy of one of 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.870
 screen then go to the event fx and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.640
 horizontal value unload on 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.170
 maximum we all know what I do magic 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.570
 using video editing 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.000
 and here is my friend eric doing this magic without 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.920
 applications of my video tutorials therefore 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.140
 I advise you to subscribe to his magic 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.300
 channel and put your thumb up a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.459
 just subscribe to the channel is not the seventh 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.620
 Join our group VKontakte 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.049
 thumb up our between tell 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.220
 friends and remember that our eye is the same 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.810
 the diaphragm 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.810
 my name is Nikic yet
