00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
I need to take a protein powder if I'm

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.250 
I need to take a protein powder if I'm
in<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> gym<00:00:22.380> /<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:24.180> trying<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.600> body<00:00:24.840> build

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
in the gym / if I'm trying to body build

in the gym / if I'm trying to body build
/<00:00:26.070> /<00:00:26.880> /<00:00:27.180> /<00:00:27.740> now<00:00:29.689> this<00:00:30.689> question<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.470> fairly

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
/ / / / now this question is fairly

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.850 
/ / / / now this question is fairly
simple<00:00:33.980> but<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.370> people<00:00:35.730> may<00:00:35.880> complicate<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
simple but some people may complicate it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.380 
simple but some people may complicate it
no<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:39.260> need<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.800> protein<00:00:41.430> powder<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
no you do not need a protein powder in

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
no you do not need a protein powder in
order<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.200> protein<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
order to get your protein and now a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.380 
order to get your protein and now a
protein<00:00:45.629> powder<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.590> does<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.390> pure

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
protein powder what it does is pure

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.160 
protein powder what it does is pure
protein<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:50.010> mix<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.460> other<00:00:50.520> things

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
protein you know mix with other things

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
protein you know mix with other things
basically<00:00:52.170> what<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> protein<00:00:52.949> powder<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
basically what a protein powder is a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.299 
basically what a protein powder is a
supplement<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.690> supplementing<00:00:57.690> your

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
supplement so it's supplementing your

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.209 
supplement so it's supplementing your
protein<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.930> know<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.559> protein<00:01:02.160> from

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
protein so you know you get protein from

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.859 
protein so you know you get protein from
you<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.210> foods<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.739> eat<00:01:04.920> every<00:01:05.489> day

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
you the foods that you eat every day

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.300 
you the foods that you eat every day
however<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.100> need<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:09.560> 250<00:01:10.560> grams<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
however if you need to get 250 grams of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.140 
however if you need to get 250 grams of
protein<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.810> body<00:01:12.869> per<00:01:13.710> day<00:01:14.130> it'll<00:01:14.939> be

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
protein in your body per day it'll be

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.960 
protein in your body per day it'll be
I'm<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.080> even<00:01:16.140> once<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.590> harder<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.610> some

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
I'm not even once a harder because some

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
I'm not even once a harder because some
people<00:01:18.240> can't<00:01:18.509> eat<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.710> let's<00:01:19.950> say

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
people can't eat like that but let's say

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.990 
people can't eat like that but let's say
if<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.580> certain<00:01:21.000> piece<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.600> meat<00:01:21.840> has<00:01:22.610> 22<00:01:23.610> grams

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
if a certain piece of meat has 22 grams

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.410 
if a certain piece of meat has 22 grams
of<00:01:24.299> protein<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> need<00:01:25.890> three<00:01:26.850> pieces<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
of protein so you need three pieces of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.710 
of protein so you need three pieces of
that<00:01:27.720> meat<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.070> 22<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:32.150> 4466<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.360> hope<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that meat the 22 the 4466 I hope that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.390 
that meat the 22 the 4466 I hope that
math<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:33.990> ready<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.619> embarrassing<00:01:35.280> on

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
math is ready to be embarrassing on

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
math is ready to be embarrassing on
YouTube<00:01:35.850> matter<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> fact<00:01:36.509> before<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.829> not

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
YouTube matter of fact before I'm not

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
YouTube matter of fact before I'm not
even<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> set<00:01:39.150> myself<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
even going to set myself up like that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.969 
even going to set myself up like that
he'd<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.439> given<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.770> 22<00:01:41.340> times<00:01:41.700> 3<00:01:42.360> yep<00:01:43.079> 66<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
he'd be given out 22 times 3 yep 66 I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.179 
he'd be given out 22 times 3 yep 66 I
was<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.689> that'll<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.780> 66<00:01:46.530> grams<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.009> protein

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
was right that'll be 66 grams of protein

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
was right that'll be 66 grams of protein
from<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.790> three<00:01:48.270> pieces<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.930> meat<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.229> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
from the three pieces of meat that you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.429 
from the three pieces of meat that you
had<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.729> people<00:01:50.939> can't<00:01:51.630> scarf<00:01:52.079> down

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
had now some people can't scarf down

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.209 
had now some people can't scarf down
three<00:01:53.250> pieces<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.909> meat<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.950> one

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
three pieces of meat you know for one

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.240 
three pieces of meat you know for one
meal<00:01:56.549> it'll<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.270> harder<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:57.780> them<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.649> they'll

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
meal it'll be harder for them so they'll

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330 
meal it'll be harder for them so they'll
have<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.299> piece<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.869> meat<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.799> 22

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
have that one piece of meat which is 22

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.919 
have that one piece of meat which is 22
grams<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.939> protein<00:02:04.700> plus<00:02:05.700> um<00:02:06.320> let's<00:02:07.320> say<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
grams of protein plus um let's say a

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.690 
grams of protein plus um let's say a
protein<00:02:09.929> powder<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.670> are

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
protein powder that you that you are

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 
protein powder that you that you are
putting<00:02:12.360> into<00:02:12.540> your<00:02:12.660> system

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
putting into your system

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.340 
putting into your system
has<00:02:13.650> 22<00:02:14.460> grams<00:02:14.760> per<00:02:15.030> scoop<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> take<00:02:16.140> two

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
has 22 grams per scoop so you take two

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.990 
has 22 grams per scoop so you take two
scoops<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.010> um<00:02:19.340> I'm<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.490> I'm<00:02:20.640> making<00:02:20.910> this

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
scoops of that um I'm a I'm making this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.610 
scoops of that um I'm a I'm making this
much<00:02:21.300> more<00:02:21.510> difficult<00:02:21.720> for<00:02:22.020> everybody<00:02:22.350> else

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
much more difficult for everybody else

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.920 
much more difficult for everybody else
but<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.160> take<00:02:23.400> two<00:02:23.610> scoops<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.240> at<00:02:24.420> 22

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
but you take two scoops of that at 22

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.250 
but you take two scoops of that at 22
per<00:02:25.320> scoop<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.160> instead<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.150> having<00:02:27.420> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
per scoop so instead of you having that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.660 
per scoop so instead of you having that
meet<00:02:29.240> three<00:02:30.240> times<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:31.650> had<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:32.220> piece<00:02:32.640> of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
meet three times you just had a piece of

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.970 
meet three times you just had a piece of
meat<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.210> something<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> drink<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
meat and something to drink and you

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.280 
meat and something to drink and you
still<00:02:35.250> got<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.550> sixty<00:02:36.540> six<00:02:36.780> grams<00:02:37.080> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
still got that sixty six grams of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.040 
still got that sixty six grams of
protein<00:02:37.760> hope<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.000> makes<00:02:39.210> sense<00:02:39.420> that's<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
protein hope that makes sense that's I

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.720 
protein hope that makes sense that's I
tried<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> break<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.920> down<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.190> easy<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.610> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
tried to break it down as easy as I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.200 
tried to break it down as easy as I
could<00:02:42.020> however<00:02:43.020> it's<00:02:43.350> always<00:02:43.830> better<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.700> get

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
could however it's always better to get

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.450 
could however it's always better to get
your<00:02:45.510> protein<00:02:46.020> from<00:02:46.500> whole<00:02:46.740> food<00:02:47.100> sources

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
your protein from whole food sources

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.790 
your protein from whole food sources
then<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.570> supplement<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.650> powder<00:02:49.920> um

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
then to supplement it with the powder um

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.740 
then to supplement it with the powder um
it's<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.520> just<00:02:53.700> better<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.300> way

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
it's just it's just better that way

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.440 
it's just it's just better that way
however<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.710> mean<00:02:55.950> everybody<00:02:56.430> everybody<00:02:57.180> uses

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
however I mean everybody everybody uses

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.970 
however I mean everybody everybody uses
protein<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.990> mean<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.320> that's<00:02:58.440> that's<00:02:58.650> all<00:02:58.860> I

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
protein I mean that that's that's all I

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.890 
protein I mean that that's that's all I
can't<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.550> will<00:02:59.820> I<00:03:00.090> can't<00:03:00.480> even<00:03:00.570> say<00:03:00.660> that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
can't just will I can't even say that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.710 
can't just will I can't even say that
sometimes<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.380> can<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.950> said<00:03:02.100> I'm<00:03:02.190> only<00:03:02.720> 170

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
sometimes I can like I said I'm only 170

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.960 
sometimes I can like I said I'm only 170
pounds<00:03:04.620> right<00:03:04.860> now<00:03:04.890> um<00:03:07.460> sometimes<00:03:08.460> I<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.820> eat

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
pounds right now um sometimes I can eat

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.880 
pounds right now um sometimes I can eat
like<00:03:09.210> a<00:03:09.840> sometimes<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.470> eat<00:03:10.680> four

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
like a sometimes I eat four

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.980 
like a sometimes I eat four
pieces<00:03:11.040> at<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.610> meat<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.060> mean<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:12.750> at<00:03:12.870> the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
pieces at that meat I mean but at the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.610 
pieces at that meat I mean but at the
same<00:03:13.260> time<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:15.180> other<00:03:15.990> in<00:03:16.140> there<00:03:16.380> this

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
same time it's other in there this

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.600

is not a video that cater towards of

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.190 
is not a video that cater towards of
macros<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.640> Mike<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:21.480> know<00:03:21.600> all<00:03:21.810> that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
macros and Mike you know all that

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.800 
macros and Mike you know all that
right<00:03:22.380> there<00:03:22.410> but<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.610> piece<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.270> meat<00:03:24.630> is

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
right there but in that piece of meat is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.150 
right there but in that piece of meat is
more<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.440> there<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:25.890> probably

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
more in there that you probably

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.130 
more in there that you probably
shouldn't<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.730> hitting<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.450> know<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.870> that's

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
shouldn't be hitting you know so that's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.050 
shouldn't be hitting you know so that's
that's<00:03:28.320> part<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.680> your<00:03:28.800> nutrition<00:03:29.310> plan<00:03:29.550> so

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that's part of your nutrition plan so

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.330 
that's part of your nutrition plan so
the<00:03:30.180> protein<00:03:30.600> powder<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.320> makes<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.800> you

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
the protein powder just makes it you

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.790 
the protein powder just makes it you
know<00:03:32.370> better<00:03:33.000> um<00:03:33.330> that's<00:03:34.200> why<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.470> should

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
know better um that's why you should

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680 
know better um that's why you should
take<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:35.100> like<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.400> did<00:03:35.670> some<00:03:36.030> protein<00:03:36.420> powder

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
take it like I did some protein powder

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.260 
take it like I did some protein powder
reviews<00:03:37.170> but<00:03:37.860> mama<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:38.580> throw<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.850> protein

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
reviews but mama just throw a protein

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.259 
reviews but mama just throw a protein
powder<00:03:39.510> out<00:03:39.660> there<00:03:39.870> like<00:03:40.080> muscle<00:03:40.680> milk<00:03:40.920> um

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
powder out there like muscle milk um

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.720 
powder out there like muscle milk um
let's<00:03:42.269> say<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.480> eat<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.840> meat<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.730> muscle

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
let's say you eat that meat and muscle

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.140 
let's say you eat that meat and muscle
only<00:03:45.360> has<00:03:45.570> 16<00:03:46.110> grams<00:03:46.650> per<00:03:46.980> scoop<00:03:47.280> plus<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:48.000> has

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
only has 16 grams per scoop plus it has

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.870 
only has 16 grams per scoop plus it has
a<00:03:48.180> lot<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.480> fat<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.050> sodium<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.680> too<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.459> two

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
a lot of fat and sodium in it too so two

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.090 
a lot of fat and sodium in it too so two
scoops<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.510> muscle<00:03:51.840> milk<00:03:52.200> behind<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
scoops of that muscle milk behind that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.449 
scoops of that muscle milk behind that
might<00:03:53.370> put<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.989> puts<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.620> over<00:03:55.650> your

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
might put you on it puts you over your

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.790 
might put you on it puts you over your
micro<00:03:56.970> Jam<00:03:57.120> your<00:03:57.420> macro<00:03:57.750> your<00:03:58.380> for<00:03:58.620> that

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
micro Jam your macro your for that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.830 
micro Jam your macro your for that
you<00:03:58.950> supposed<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.250> be<00:03:59.310> reaching<00:03:59.760> for<00:04:00.720> that

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
you supposed to be reaching for that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.320 
you supposed to be reaching for that
time<00:04:01.140> period<00:04:01.170> or<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.980> date<00:04:02.280> because<00:04:02.940> that's

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
time period or that date because that's

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.600 
time period or that date because that's
not<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> good<00:04:03.840> source<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.410> protein<00:04:04.650> powder<00:04:05.250> if

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
not a good source of protein powder if

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.220 
not a good source of protein powder if
that<00:04:05.790> even<00:04:06.120> makes<00:04:06.150> sense<00:04:06.540> what<00:04:06.660> I'm<00:04:06.810> saying<00:04:07.080> I

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
that even makes sense what I'm saying I

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.610 
that even makes sense what I'm saying I
hope<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.590> does<00:04:07.769> um<00:04:08.330> so<00:04:09.330> yeah<00:04:09.959> because<00:04:10.230> like

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
hope it does um so yeah because like

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.370 
hope it does um so yeah because like
like<00:04:11.160> isolate<00:04:11.700> proteins<00:04:12.180> or<00:04:12.600> good<00:04:12.930> protein

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
like isolate proteins or good protein

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.680 
like isolate proteins or good protein
should<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:13.800> like<00:04:13.980> between<00:04:15.109> a<00:04:16.370> hundred<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.690> 120

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
should be like between a hundred and 120

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.770 
should be like between a hundred and 120
calories<00:04:18.900> per<00:04:19.410> scoop<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.370> would<00:04:20.940> think<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.359> you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
calories per scoop I would think so you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.290 
calories per scoop I would think so you
wouldn't<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.800> know<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.070> know<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.700> get<00:04:24.120> where

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
wouldn't you know you know you get where

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.990 
wouldn't you know you know you get where
I'm<00:04:24.360> going<00:04:24.419> with<00:04:24.720> this<00:04:24.780> um

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
I'm going with this um

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.870 
I'm going with this um
you<00:04:27.210> wouldn't<00:04:27.510> want<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.690> put<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:29.160> okay<00:04:29.850> so

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
you wouldn't want to put so okay so

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.320 
you wouldn't want to put so okay so
let's<00:04:30.450> say<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:31.500> piece<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.950> meat<00:04:32.160> per<00:04:32.790> serving

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
let's say that piece of meat per serving

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.330 
let's say that piece of meat per serving
there's<00:04:33.480> 300<00:04:34.080> calories<00:04:34.620> um<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:37.100> purty<00:04:38.100> I'm

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
there's 300 calories um so purty I'm
