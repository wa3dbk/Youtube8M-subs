I guess by bead gallery elements and
it's<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.280> sterling<00:01:35.700> silver<00:01:36.180> plated<00:01:36.619> necklace

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.670 

but<00:01:45.939> I<00:01:46.329> thought<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.899> would<00:01:46.990> be<00:01:47.140> kind<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.439> cool

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
but I thought it would be kind of cool

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.280 
but I thought it would be kind of cool
to<00:01:47.740> do<00:01:48.640> this<00:01:48.880> because<00:01:49.210> summer<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.780> coming<00:01:49.960> up

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
to do this because summer is coming up

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.660 
to do this because summer is coming up
and<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.740> know<00:01:50.920> when<00:01:51.100> you're<00:01:51.250> wearing<00:01:51.490> your

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
and you know when you're wearing your

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.389 
and you know when you're wearing your
son<00:01:52.210> dresses<00:01:52.689> and<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:52.990> tank<00:01:53.259> tops<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.310> things

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
son dresses and the tank tops and things

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.149 
son dresses and the tank tops and things
like<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:55.149> want<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.360> nice<00:01:55.740> piece<00:01:56.740> on<00:01:57.009> your
