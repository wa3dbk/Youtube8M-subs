00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.530
 the mayor 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.530
 it reaches a maximum of restraint for peace 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.929
 by putting to his wife 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 and I'm here to penalize missions 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 - just with a look you come muslim 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.170
 you resist 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.360
 it will come 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.570
 good before I start I would like to take the opportunity to make some 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 thanks and thanks to the people without whom I would not be there 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.610
 today so I'm going to make a huge pickup to my father and to all 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 the fathers of the world 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.890
 thanks my father felt everything would have been possible 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.530
 will he be able to operate the arrival of France in 74 and when he arrived he 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.580
 took the French language 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.150
 and I say well taken 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.200
 and not learned 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.520
 he took the French language and staging blender 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 he added dates 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.230
 semolina 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.060
 and gazelle horns 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.549
 he mixed everything for a few months and we only released one material a 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.180
 substance is a language that he has appropriated and which became star when 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.590
 from al 8 single boat no one else 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.590
 we have things to ask for political asylum 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
 with extraterrestrial expressions for example my daily father I 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.119
 do not want to rush a life 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.320
 free 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 but the danger is not as far as his quest shows us 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.890
 my father for example daily warns Monday ahmadi a wise man 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.029
 and Patrick's dad of choice 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.709
 if losing my opel father took off especially one thing insel 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.829
 it's when they arrive in France to choose a region 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.269
 and unfortunately the only places left was in the north 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.869
 pas-de-Calais 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.109
 59 of 62 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.249
 so I was born there 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.839
 walsh arrives in paris i was 20 years old i will remember it all my life doing 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.829
 run and then in paris I got off the train with my little sister 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.989
 and I did but we are not in Paris 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.349
 we are in the future 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.349
 but in view of all these carriages that move san siro 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.249
 but the soler lasts even when it rains 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.249
 go we are nice we have little hope for them 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.389
 and with all due respect to the people of the north 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.779
 but they know it's rotten 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.999
 besides, it would be necessary to flee 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.999
 the only problem is that for his son we need roads 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.069
 Well, I like the north side, besides, I have friends who often come to us 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.239
 see and they say we see she only took it off and all had the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.359
 same drop it is all about suddenly 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.779
 the north happened for aurillac based as the difference that enters the 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.779
 north of paris the agent the station of orthez electricity 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.310
 the goal to the good I speak to you from the north I will tell you where I come from 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.709
 I come from a small town called third armand and the motto 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:23.700
 armand tiercé 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 ar braz third and for that dies 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.340
 sm we were not very rich I am thoroughly in the war in the former Yugoslavia 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.269
 and journalists fr3 who could not go there to have 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.359
 imagery 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.559
 he is filmed at home 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.809
 we saw my little sister under the plaid duvet it's a little 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.799
 bosnia side in kinshasa 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.709
 salt spreaders already 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.189
 good for those who do not know or if you take the map of France weather 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.589
 and you see the cloud 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:53.599
 this is the north 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.639
 it's because we are staging the saying that tears in the north c 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.279
 january february march april may june july august september october november 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.549
 December it's cold 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.279
 there is a kind of microclimate in the north of France means we during 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.079
 the heat wave we loved 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.429
 we had just gone above zero 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:13.669
 we all went out to tan doubt that I do not know these two days 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.229
 able maybe 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.229
 my mother not pollinating the sea is like that 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.189
 I'm going to stop I'm going to stop with the north because that's the baule I've 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.569
 grown these labs I was born and it's not done 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.020
 besides, I had some after-effects 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.249
 my accent 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:37.829
 because here I'm talking to you with clean letters that have gone to the 

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:40.469
 washing machine like sahara 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.469
 but if I have to go like that like voice 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.939
 me my first date I read with ap a mother who had an accent 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.819
 it was great 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.139
 miss 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.819
 wanted a drink 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.819
 mike gillis who goes far 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.479
 her orange strategy for me and the plant for her 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.479
 and if in spite of all that you still want to visit the north 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.960
 know that the bayaâ guide of the backpacker 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.469

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.189
