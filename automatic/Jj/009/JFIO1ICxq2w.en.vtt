00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
the seam runs down the side right there

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.740 
the seam runs down the side right there
it's<00:00:48.730> important<00:00:49.149> when<00:00:49.269> you're<00:00:49.359> saving<00:00:49.539> the

champagne bottle that you run along that
seam<00:00:53.519> right<00:00:54.519> once<00:00:54.760> you've<00:00:55.059> located<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.510> seam

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
seam right once you've located the seam

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.790

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
do this because if this works there will

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.160 
do this because if this works there will
be<00:00:58.839> a<00:00:59.079> cork<00:00:59.530> wrapped<00:00:59.829> in<00:01:00.129> broken<00:01:00.760> glass

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
hold it at about a 45 degree angle up in

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.550 
hold it at about a 45 degree angle up in
the<00:01:06.520> air<00:01:06.640> away<00:01:07.180> from<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.480> towards<00:01:07.810> hopefully

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
pretty flat angle like so and then

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.790 
pretty flat angle like so and then
you're<00:01:18.160> gonna<00:01:18.250> want<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.490> hit<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.730> at<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.180> lip
