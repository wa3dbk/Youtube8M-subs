00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
memory challenge as far as I can tell

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.460 
memory challenge as far as I can tell
which<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.459> pretty<00:02:47.819> interesting<00:02:48.120> I'm<00:02:48.840> not<00:02:49.200> sure

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
which is pretty interesting I'm not sure

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.110

exactly<00:02:49.799> what<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.430> about<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.879> haven't

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
exactly what that is about I haven't

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.509 
exactly what that is about I haven't
heard<00:02:51.299> much<00:02:51.450> about<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.340> I

guess what it is basically like any
other<00:02:55.590> minute<00:02:55.860> uh<00:02:56.090> um<00:02:57.140> like<00:02:58.140> any<00:02:59.040> other<00:02:59.390> memory

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390
