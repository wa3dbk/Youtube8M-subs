 the kilns move the electric select 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.520
 They are designed with an interior enclosure 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.010
 composed of refractory plates 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.730
 lightweight high quality and conductivity 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.660
 high content of alumina and 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.210
 free of asbestos and iron oxide 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.030
 the heating elements are 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.300
 evenly distributed with son 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.489
 special high melting point and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.330
 recognized by high frequency 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.720
 ensuring an exceptionally long duration 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.720
 long 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.149
 It also has excellent insulation 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.539
 thermal glass ceramic pasta 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.479
 density and thermal conductivity which 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.450
 causes a reduced consumption to a maximum 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:10.610
 the swing door performance and 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.610
 easily interchangeable elements 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 for installation, place the device 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.400
 near an adequate power outlet 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.220
 to your consumption on a flat surface 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.040
 level and robust enough to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.890
 support the weight of the equipment 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.990
 leave a free space of 20 centimeters 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.689
 around 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 this equipment will cause a great 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.220
 technical tender 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.160
 that could affect other equipment 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.550
 do not install the device in atmospheres 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.010
 explosive or in places where they are used or 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.580
 store susceptible substances 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.580
 form explosive or inflamed mixtures 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 make say that the computer connects to 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.180
 a network attention that matches 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.359
 indicated on the rating plate 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.040
 do not use the equipment without being connected 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:21.470
 to the ground outlet 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.730
 Use only the supplied cable to 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.730
 the connection to the network 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.180
 the control panel is comprised of 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.180
 The following elements 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.760
 a defect of the general 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.370
 the resistance indicator 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.370
 indicates cuts on temperature 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:57.489
 and the door open indicator 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.489
 in addition to the temperature regulator 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.470
 to launch first 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.010
 operate the general switch 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.010
 Y 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.850
 and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.709
 has the error gate 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.569
 then select the temperature 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.840
 according to the slogan of the tiles 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.840
 up and down the controller 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.530
 modify the temperature with the keys 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.530
 go up and down 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.380
 the camera should not be overloaded 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.830
 interior in terms of weight and quantity 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.950
 objects subject to treatments do not 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.590
 should a pair but from 30 to 50 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.920
 hundred of the volume of the cameras 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.520
 The maximum admissible load is about 10 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.039
 to 15 kilograms 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.349
 the impurities often occasions 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.139
 a premature destruction of the 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.620
 heating elements and plates 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.949
 ceramics 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.550
 metal oxides tempering agents and 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:15.280
 reduction salts and so on should not 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.550
 get in touch with them 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.190
 It will therefore be advisable not to 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.720
 material directly at the base of the 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.360
 camera 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.290
 special trays must be used 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.040
 for hearth in special steel 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.040
 selective refractory 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.020
 do not forget that the team is 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.840
 high temperatures is why it is 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.480
 recommends using asbestos gloves 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.050
 to prevent any incident by 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.050
 Burns 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.139
 once the objects inside the 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.930
 the camera 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.160
 you can proceed to turn off the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.800
 team 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.440
 and for that you must turn off 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:17.220
 turning the knob 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.220
 General power off and on 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.830
 you have to wish 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:31.090
 a quick cooling 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:34.240
 can lower the door of the bed 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:38.970
 but do not forget to put signs of 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.970
 Safety indicating the state of the oven 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.210
 do not
