00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
quite tight accurate and dim boy you'd

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
quite tight accurate and dim boy you'd
expect<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.750> cut<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.140> such<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> high<00:01:25.710> body

to<00:01:26.370> lean<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.900> turn<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
to lean a little bit when you turn it

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.130 
to lean a little bit when you turn it
into<00:01:28.350> corners<00:01:28.800> but<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.310> stays<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:30.240> flat<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
into corners but it stays very flat and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.230 
into corners but it stays very flat and
you<00:01:31.980> can<00:01:32.130> place<00:01:32.370> it<00:01:32.400> quite<00:01:32.850> accurately

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
you can place it quite accurately

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
you can place it quite accurately
steering<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.600> also<00:01:37.080> surprisingly<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:37.980> it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
steering is also surprisingly good it's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.880 
steering is also surprisingly good it's
really<00:01:38.610> nicely<00:01:38.790> weighted<00:01:39.440> pointy<00:01:40.440> without

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
really nicely weighted pointy without

a<00:01:42.930> straight<00:01:43.020> line<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.830> what<00:01:43.950> surprised<00:01:44.280> me

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
a straight line but what surprised me

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.310 
a straight line but what surprised me
the<00:01:44.550> most<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.300> it's<00:01:45.660> actually<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.140> some

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the most is that it's actually got some

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.520 
the most is that it's actually got some
feel<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.010> it<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.580> does<00:01:48.210> give<00:01:48.510> you<00:01:48.690> an<00:01:48.869> idea<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
feel to it this does give you an idea of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
feel to it this does give you an idea of
the<00:01:49.920> texture<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.550> road<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.660> one<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the texture of the road I think one of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.870 
the texture of the road I think one of
the<00:01:52.140> reasons<00:01:52.500> why<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.770> feels<00:01:53.130> quite<00:01:53.550> tight

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the reasons why it feels quite tight

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.310 
the reasons why it feels quite tight
ease<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:54.479> Citroen<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.020> made<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
ease that Citroen have made the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.880 
ease that Citroen have made the
anti-roll<00:01:55.770> bars<00:01:56.510> 25%<00:01:57.510> stiffer<00:01:57.900> than<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.560> normal

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
anti-roll bars 25% stiffer than a normal

anti-roll bars 25% stiffer than a normal
c4<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.670> springs<00:01:59.970> 10%<00:02:00.690> stiffer<00:02:00.960> it's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
c4 and the springs 10% stiffer it's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.990 
c4 and the springs 10% stiffer it's
basic<00:02:02.130> stuff<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.970> has<00:02:03.330> worked<00:02:04.700> however<00:02:05.700> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
basic stuff but it has worked however it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.240 
basic stuff but it has worked however it

isn't quite the revelation that Citroen
