the paradox of the Information Age
because<00:00:39.350> we<00:00:39.589> should<00:00:39.769> think<00:00:39.949> but<00:00:40.549> the<00:00:40.670> more

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
because we should think but the more

you're<00:00:42.949> going<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.159> make<00:00:43.280> but<00:00:44.180> it's<00:00:44.299> not<00:00:44.390> always

you're going to make but it's not always

you're going to make but it's not always
so<00:00:46.239> when<00:00:47.239> we<00:00:47.420> are<00:00:47.449> in<00:00:47.600> doubt<00:00:47.960> as<00:00:48.199> to<00:00:48.229> which

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
so when we are in doubt as to which

so when we are in doubt as to which
decision<00:00:49.879> they're<00:00:50.030> going<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.299> take<00:00:50.449> what

decision they're going to take what

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.380

action to perform what believes to hold

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.420 
action to perform what believes to hold
if<00:00:54.290> we<00:00:54.409> don't<00:00:54.559> have<00:00:54.680> enough<00:00:54.860> information<00:00:55.129> that

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
if we don't have enough information that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.590 
if we don't have enough information that
we<00:00:55.580> can<00:00:55.670> gather<00:00:55.879> for<00:00:56.210> my<00:00:56.299> immediate

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
we can gather for my immediate

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.869 
we can gather for my immediate
circumstance<00:00:57.290> but<00:00:57.409> we<00:00:57.559> tend<00:00:57.799> to<00:00:57.920> do<00:00:58.159> is<00:00:58.400> to

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
circumstance but we tend to do is to

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.210 
circumstance but we tend to do is to
look<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.360> see<00:00:59.570> what<00:00:59.780> others<00:01:00.170> are<00:01:00.379> doing<00:01:00.439> so

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
look to see what others are doing so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.679 
look to see what others are doing so
actually<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:01.939> the<00:01:02.089> fact<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.449> we<00:01:02.659> are

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:02.689 
actually it's the fact that we are

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.649 
actually it's the fact that we are
driven<00:01:03.080> by<00:01:03.860> uncertainty<00:01:04.339> we<00:01:04.760> don't<00:01:05.000> know<00:01:05.210> we

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
driven by uncertainty we don't know we

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.300 
driven by uncertainty we don't know we
don't<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:06.049> enough<00:01:06.260> information<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.250> if

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
don't have enough information and so if

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.069 
don't have enough information and so if
we<00:01:07.400> don't<00:01:07.640> have<00:01:07.820> an<00:01:07.939> information<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:08.750> tend<00:01:09.020> to

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
we don't have an information we tend to

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.410 
we don't have an information we tend to
tab<00:01:09.469> from<00:01:10.219> our<00:01:10.399> surroundings<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.270> other

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
tab from our surroundings and other

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.149 
tab from our surroundings and other
people<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.079> that<00:01:12.560> can<00:01:12.710> sometimes<00:01:12.859> be

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
people and that can sometimes be

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.709 
people and that can sometimes be
rational<00:01:13.700> because<00:01:13.939> then<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:14.179> are<00:01:14.270> using<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
rational because then we are using the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.810 
rational because then we are using the
experiences<00:01:15.289> of<00:01:15.320> others<00:01:15.679> but<00:01:16.159> they<00:01:16.369> if<00:01:16.549> they

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
experiences of others but they if they

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.660 
experiences of others but they if they
do<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.240> same<00:01:17.479> at<00:01:17.719> the<00:01:17.840> exact<00:01:18.200> same<00:01:18.409> time<00:01:18.799> based

on as little information as we have that

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
buying books on the internet because you

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.749 
buying books on the internet because you
think<00:01:42.499> that<00:01:42.590> everybody<00:01:43.069> buys<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.520> because

that's the great book that might not be

the way out of these problems are

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.170 
the way out of these problems are
basically<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.650> make<00:03:09.800> sure<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.550> means<00:03:10.880> or

basically to make sure that the means or

basically to make sure that the means or

choice are based on truthful information
one<00:03:20.660> should<00:03:20.810> be<00:03:20.959> careful<00:03:21.200> relying<00:03:22.190> on<00:03:22.430> others

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
one should be careful relying on others

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.120 
one should be careful relying on others
for<00:03:23.030> good<00:03:23.660> decision<00:03:24.110> because<00:03:24.560> sometimes<00:03:24.920> that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
for good decision because sometimes that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.470 
for good decision because sometimes that
decision<00:03:25.610> that's<00:03:25.700> going<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:25.940> be<00:03:26.030> rational

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
decision that's going to be rational

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.390 
decision that's going to be rational
just<00:03:27.050> because<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> lot<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.650> lemmings<00:03:27.950> walk<00:03:28.220> that

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
just because a lot of lemmings walk that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.979 
just because a lot of lemmings walk that
direction<00:03:28.580> doesn't<00:03:29.030> entail<00:03:29.360> at<00:03:29.480> every<00:03:29.690> lemon

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
direction doesn't entail at every lemon

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.500 
direction doesn't entail at every lemon
should<00:03:30.230> or<00:03:30.590> other<00:03:31.010> projects<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:31.670> no<00:03:32.150> lemming

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
should or other projects that no lemming

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.570 
should or other projects that no lemming
should<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.230> from<00:03:33.709> every<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.010> often<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.459> every

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
should but from every so often and every

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.060 
should but from every so often and every
so<00:03:34.700> often<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.450> basically<00:03:35.810> collectively<00:03:36.530> make

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
so often we basically collectively make

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.070 
so often we basically collectively make
giant<00:03:37.370> mistakes<00:03:37.910> although<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.930> may

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
giant mistakes although we may

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.199 
giant mistakes although we may
individually<00:03:39.860> be<00:03:40.010> actually<00:03:40.310> be<00:03:40.430> rational<00:03:40.850> so

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
individually be actually be rational so

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.810 
individually be actually be rational so
think<00:03:41.420> about<00:03:41.510> that
