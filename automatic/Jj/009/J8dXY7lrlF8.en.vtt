and when I'm patting dough that I'm
going<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.510> roll<00:01:37.660> out<00:01:37.870> I<00:01:38.140> always<00:01:38.470> try<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:38.950> make

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
going to roll out I always try and make

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.770 
going to roll out I always try and make
it<00:01:39.100> as<00:01:39.280> flat<00:01:39.490> as<00:01:39.640> possible<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.480> beginning

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.050 

so<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:46.890> dough<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> chilled<00:01:47.250> we're<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:48.000> to

so our dough is chilled we're going to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.850 
so our dough is chilled we're going to
roll<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.690> parchment<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.620> becomes

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
roll out on parchment because it becomes

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
roll out on parchment because it becomes
easier<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.700> cut<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.390> shapes<00:01:51.630> flour<00:01:52.200> both

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
easier to cut out shapes flour both

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
easier to cut out shapes flour both
sides<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:53.790> we're<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> start

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
sides so now we're going to start

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.090 
sides so now we're going to start
rolling<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:55.410> want<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> put<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.830> piece<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
rolling and you want to put a piece of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
rolling and you want to put a piece of
parchment<00:01:56.220> on<00:01:56.460> top<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.600> flour<00:01:57.840> dough<00:01:58.140> just

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
parchment on top of the flour dough just

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
parchment on top of the flour dough just
to<00:01:58.590> make<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.920> much<00:01:59.640> easier<00:01:59.990> periodically<00:02:00.990> it's

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
to make it much easier periodically it's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.610 
to make it much easier periodically it's
nice<00:02:01.380> she<00:02:01.920> lifts<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:02.880> parchment<00:02:03.530> dust<00:02:04.530> a
