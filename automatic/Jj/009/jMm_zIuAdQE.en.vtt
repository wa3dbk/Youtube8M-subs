alright<00:00:00.420> in<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.570> video<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.079> to

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170 
alright in this video we're going to

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.110 
alright in this video we're going to
teach<00:00:01.290> you<00:00:01.410> how<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.650> tie<00:00:02.040> the<00:00:02.070> Bimini<00:00:02.790> twist

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
teach you how to tie the Bimini twist

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.730 
teach you how to tie the Bimini twist
this<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> knot<00:00:03.840> that<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.230> very<00:00:04.470> popular

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
this is a knot that is very popular

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is a knot that is very popular
especially<00:00:05.520> with<00:00:05.790> offshore<00:00:06.480> fishermen<00:00:07.140> and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
especially with offshore fishermen and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.379 
especially with offshore fishermen and
I've<00:00:07.379> had<00:00:07.529> some<00:00:07.770> across<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.309> how<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.550> tie<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.849> so

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
I've had some across on how to tie it so

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.610 
I've had some across on how to tie it so
this<00:00:09.540> video<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.960> just<00:00:10.200> teach<00:00:10.410> you

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
this video is going to just teach you

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.680 
this video is going to just teach you
how<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.920> tie<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.490> Bimini<00:00:11.940> twists<00:00:12.210> as<00:00:12.420> quickly

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
how to tie the Bimini twists as quickly

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.749 
how to tie the Bimini twists as quickly
as<00:00:12.840> possible<00:00:12.870> alright<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> first<00:00:14.219> step<00:00:14.610> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
as possible alright so the first step is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.460 
as possible alright so the first step is
to<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.150> get<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.839> loop<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.199> your<00:00:16.320> line<00:00:16.440> just

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
to just get a loop in your line just

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.370 
to just get a loop in your line just
simply<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> tag<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.840> create<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> loop

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
simply a tag in and just create a loop

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.830 
simply a tag in and just create a loop
and<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.160> need<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.730> make<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.420> 20

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and what you need to do is make about 20

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.679 
and what you need to do is make about 20
to<00:00:21.990> 25<00:00:22.320> wraps<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.939> simple<00:00:24.180> twists<00:00:24.510> in

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to 25 wraps or just simple twists in

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.140 
to 25 wraps or just simple twists in
this<00:00:24.750> line<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.260> my<00:00:25.830> left<00:00:26.070> hand<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.000> this

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
this line so my left hand is on this

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.519 
this line so my left hand is on this
side<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> loop<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:28.230> gonna<00:00:28.320> get<00:00:28.439> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
side with the loop so I'm gonna get in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.529 
side with the loop so I'm gonna get in
there<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.949> start<00:00:29.220> twisting<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.390> do

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
there and just start twisting so we do

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.220 
there and just start twisting so we do
this<00:00:30.689> 20<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> 25<00:00:32.070> times<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.870> really

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
this 20 to 25 times and this is really

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.740 
this 20 to 25 times and this is really
what<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.130> gets<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.910> twist<00:00:36.329> that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
what you know what gets the twist that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.260 
what you know what gets the twist that
obviously<00:00:37.110> make<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> Bimini<00:00:38.340> twist<00:00:38.610> so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
obviously make up the Bimini twist so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
obviously make up the Bimini twist so
we're<00:00:39.480> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> keep<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.079> looping<00:00:40.320> around<00:00:40.530> or

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
we're going to keep on looping around or

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.670 
we're going to keep on looping around or
we're<00:00:41.040> probably<00:00:41.280> about<00:00:41.579> 20<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.200> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
we're probably about 20 right now so so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.560 
we're probably about 20 right now so so
this<00:00:43.829> next<00:00:44.129> step<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.300> easy

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
this next step just to make this as easy

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990 
this next step just to make this as easy
and<00:00:45.750> quick<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.020> possible<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:47.070> need<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.399> put

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and quick as possible is we need to put

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.750 
and quick as possible is we need to put
this<00:00:48.270> loop<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.649> fixed<00:00:50.070> object<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.550> some<00:00:50.730> sort

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
this loop on a fixed object of some sort

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
this loop on a fixed object of some sort
a<00:00:51.059> lot<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> people<00:00:51.539> use<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> handle<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
a lot of people use that the handle of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.680 
a lot of people use that the handle of
the<00:00:53.100> reel<00:00:53.370> since<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.390> chair<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the reel since I'm on this chair that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.990 
the reel since I'm on this chair that
has<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.280> handle<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> put<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
has a handle now I'm going to put the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.430 
has a handle now I'm going to put the
loop<00:00:57.180> around<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> will<00:00:58.170> show<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
loop around that and it will show you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.069 
loop around that and it will show you
how<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.129> cinch<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> down<00:00:59.850> alright<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:00.960> we

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
how to cinch this down alright so we

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.470 
how to cinch this down alright so we
just<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.710> attached<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> loop<00:01:02.640> side<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
just we just attached the loop side to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.000 
just we just attached the loop side to
the<00:01:03.570> chair<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.229> our<00:01:04.379> fixed<00:01:04.619> object

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the chair so we have our fixed object

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
the chair so we have our fixed object
now<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.939> these<00:01:06.090> twists<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.990> going

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
now we have all these twists just going

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.330 
now we have all these twists just going
up<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> line<00:01:07.590> they're<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.220> straight

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
up the line they're all going straight

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
up the line they're all going straight
up<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.580> line<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:09.299> next<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> our<00:01:09.750> job<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.140> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
up the line are next to our job now is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
up the line are next to our job now is
to<00:01:10.350> condense<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.670> twists<00:01:12.150> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to condense get the all these twists in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
to condense get the all these twists in
the<00:01:12.390> smallest<00:01:12.780> most<00:01:13.560> condense<00:01:14.040> space

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the smallest most condense space

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.999 
the smallest most condense space
possible<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.560> grab<00:01:16.799> with

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
possible so to do that we we grab with

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.100 
possible so to do that we we grab with
one<00:01:17.040> arm<00:01:17.369> hold<00:01:17.700> onto<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> main<00:01:18.210> line<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.689> pull

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
one arm hold onto the main line and pull

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
one arm hold onto the main line and pull
up<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> other<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.729> pull<00:01:20.939> in

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
up and with the other one just pull in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.210 
up and with the other one just pull in
the<00:01:21.119> tag<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:22.320> bit<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.619> than<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> 90

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the tag and a little bit more than a 90

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.280 
the tag and a little bit more than a 90
degree<00:01:23.460> angle<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:25.049> those

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
degree angle if you can see all those

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.160 
degree angle if you can see all those
all<00:01:25.650> those<00:01:25.710> twists<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.880> getting

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
all those twists are just getting

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
all those twists are just getting
compacted<00:01:28.170> they're<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.829> area<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
compacted they're in that one area so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880 
compacted they're in that one area so
now<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> forefinger<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
now with with the forefinger you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
now with with the forefinger you
actually<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> crevasse

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
actually put it down and in the crevasse

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.590 
actually put it down and in the crevasse
and<00:01:33.869> we're<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> pull<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and we're going to pull up with with a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.560 
and we're going to pull up with with a
four<00:01:36.869> finger<00:01:37.100> while<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> same<00:01:38.340> time

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
four finger while at the same time

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.600 
four finger while at the same time
lessening<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.900> tension<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> tag<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
lessening the tension on the tag in and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.460 
lessening the tension on the tag in and
what<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.140> going

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
what that's going to do is that's going

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.859 
what that's going to do is that's going
to<00:01:43.590> basically<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> doubling<00:01:45.180> over<00:01:45.450> on

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to basically just do a doubling over on

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.469 
to basically just do a doubling over on
all<00:01:45.930> those<00:01:46.649> wraps<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.820> integrate<00:01:48.240> all

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
all those wraps and all integrate all

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
all those wraps and all integrate all
the<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:48.720> down<00:01:48.930> until<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.350> can't<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.710> anymore

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the way down until you can't do anymore

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
the way down until you can't do anymore
so<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> keep<00:01:51.210> moving<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.780> with

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
so we're going to keep moving up with

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
so we're going to keep moving up with
that<00:01:52.170> forefinger<00:01:52.829> until<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> way

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that forefinger until we get all the way

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
that forefinger until we get all the way
to<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.840> very<00:01:54.930> top<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.890> this

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
to the very top one and now at this

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
to the very top one and now at this
point<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.490> take<00:01:56.520> our<00:01:56.790> tension<00:01:57.030> off<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
point we can take our tension off of the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
point we can take our tension off of the
main<00:01:58.350> line<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.189> our<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.909> really

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
main line so this is our this is really

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.240 
main line so this is our this is really
our<00:02:00.240> Bimini<00:02:00.509> twist<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.649> our<00:02:01.680> next<00:02:01.979> step

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
our Bimini twist here so our next step

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.039 
our Bimini twist here so our next step
our<00:02:02.430> final<00:02:02.729> step<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.329> lock<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.780> into

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
our final step is just to lock that into

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.870 
our final step is just to lock that into
place<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.369> ahead<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.670> grab

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
place so just going to go ahead and grab

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
place so just going to go ahead and grab
it<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.270> fingers<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.840> can't<00:02:07.140> go

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
it with my fingers so I can't go

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.380 
it with my fingers so I can't go
anywhere<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:08.700> need<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.940> make<00:02:09.000> what

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
anywhere and we now need to make what

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.420 
anywhere and we now need to make what
are<00:02:09.420> called<00:02:09.509> hitch<00:02:09.959> knots<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.250> is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
are called hitch knots and what that is

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.559 
are called hitch knots and what that is
is<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.970> first<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.629> on<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.260> this

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
is the first one to do on this on this

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.569 
is the first one to do on this on this
on<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.870> leg<00:02:14.049> that's<00:02:14.079> closest<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.769> me<00:02:14.920> they

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
on the leg that's closest to me they

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.250 
on the leg that's closest to me they
just<00:02:15.610> go<00:02:15.939> around<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.659> then<00:02:16.840> through<00:02:17.230> that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
just go around it and then through that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.199 
just go around it and then through that
loop<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.650> just<00:02:17.829> made<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.400> go<00:02:18.549> through<00:02:18.879> it<00:02:19.030> and

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
loop you just made you go through it and

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.410 
loop you just made you go through it and
then<00:02:19.840> pull<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.409> all<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> way<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.980> top

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
then pull it all the way up to the top

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.390 
then pull it all the way up to the top
another<00:02:22.420> hitch<00:02:22.599> knot<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.290> other<00:02:23.950> leg<00:02:24.219> on

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
another hitch knot on the other leg on

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.490 
another hitch knot on the other leg on
the<00:02:24.489> leg<00:02:24.670> that's<00:02:24.849> closest<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> me<00:02:25.659> or<00:02:25.930> furthest

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the leg that's closest to me or furthest

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.979 
the leg that's closest to me or furthest
for<00:02:26.650> me<00:02:26.739> closest<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.310> camera<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.510> again

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
for me closest the camera so again

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.289 
for me closest the camera so again
around<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.409> once<00:02:29.590> pull<00:02:29.950> up<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:31.000> final

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
around it once pull up and the final

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.089 
around it once pull up and the final
step<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.510> what<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:32.379> do<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:33.010> do<00:02:33.069> a

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
step is what I just do is just do a

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.460 
step is what I just do is just do a
double<00:02:33.340> hitch<00:02:33.730> knot<00:02:33.970> around<00:02:34.120> both<00:02:34.510> strands<00:02:35.170> so

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
double hitch knot around both strands so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.770 
double hitch knot around both strands so
we're<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:35.680> going<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.829> wrap<00:02:36.579> around<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:37.629> then

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
we're just going to wrap around and then

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.059 
we're just going to wrap around and then
go<00:02:37.870> through<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.170> twice<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.980> there's<00:02:39.879> one<00:02:40.209> two

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
go through it twice so there's one two

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.830 
go through it twice so there's one two
so<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:42.250> was<00:02:42.340> again<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.700> same<00:02:42.969> same<00:02:43.420> premise

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
so that was again the same same premise

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.780 
so that was again the same same premise
just<00:02:44.079> around<00:02:44.349> both<00:02:44.680> strands<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.489> doing<00:02:45.700> it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
just around both strands and doing it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.599 
just around both strands and doing it
twice<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.389> then<00:02:46.870> pull<00:02:47.200> forward<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.799> that's<00:02:48.310> it

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
twice and then pull forward so that's it

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.460 
twice and then pull forward so that's it
so<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:48.879> have<00:02:49.030> our<00:02:49.180> Bimini<00:02:49.420> twist<00:02:49.689> now<00:02:49.870> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
so we have our Bimini twist now the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.080 
so we have our Bimini twist now the
final<00:02:50.980> step<00:02:51.129> will<00:02:51.250> be<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.669> cut<00:02:51.849> off<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
final step will be just to cut off the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.080 
final step will be just to cut off the
tag<00:02:52.299> end<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:52.720> as<00:02:53.709> far<00:02:53.889> as<00:02:53.950> attaching<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
tag end and as far as attaching to the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.610 
tag end and as far as attaching to the
line<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.480> would<00:02:55.599> then<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.470> this

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
line you would then just have this

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.830 
line you would then just have this
double<00:02:57.010> line<00:02:57.189> to<00:02:57.519> tie<00:02:57.909> whatever<00:02:58.180> type<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.569> knot

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
double line to tie whatever type of knot

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.720 
double line to tie whatever type of knot
you<00:02:59.019> prefer<00:02:59.349> so<00:02:59.709> anyhow<00:03:00.280> if<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.579> any

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
you prefer so anyhow if you have any
