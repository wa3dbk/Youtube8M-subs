00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
tank here this still works perfectly

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.270 
tank here this still works perfectly
well<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> striker<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> firesteel

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.020 
well as a striker for a firesteel
perfectly<00:01:35.280> well<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.850> last

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
perfectly well as this for the last

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550 
perfectly well as this for the last
point<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.720> they've<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.020> kind<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> squared

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
point but they've just kind of squared

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020 
point but they've just kind of squared
it<00:01:37.680> off<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> refine<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> profile<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.909> a
