00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
game so far with very closely followed

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.170 
game so far with very closely followed
by<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.589> ak-12<00:00:39.979> in<00:00:40.400> my<00:00:40.519> opinion<00:00:40.790> but<00:00:41.030> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
by the ak-12 in my opinion but the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.780 
by the ak-12 in my opinion but the
battle<00:00:41.479> 27<00:00:41.989> does<00:00:42.110> seems<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.470> take<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:42.949> though

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
battle 27 does seems to take it though

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.520 
battle 27 does seems to take it though
there<00:00:43.970> may<00:00:44.120> be<00:00:44.150> particular<00:00:44.809> weapon<00:00:44.989> variants

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
there may be particular weapon variants

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.960 
there may be particular weapon variants
so<00:00:45.589> you<00:00:45.680> get<00:00:45.830> from<00:00:45.979> Supply<00:00:46.280> Drop<00:00:46.339> so<00:00:46.729> maybe

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
so you get from Supply Drop so maybe

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.820 
so you get from Supply Drop so maybe
better<00:00:47.330> with<00:00:47.600> other<00:00:47.750> guns<00:00:48.080> and<00:00:48.470> especially

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
better with other guns and especially

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.490 
better with other guns and especially
the<00:00:49.100> power<00:00:49.250> 27<00:00:49.760> itself<00:00:50.180> but<00:00:50.720> first<00:00:50.989> perk<00:00:51.290> I

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
the power 27 itself but first perk I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500 
the power 27 itself but first perk I
always<00:00:51.710> take<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:52.040> this<00:00:52.430> with<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.850> Beltway<00:00:53.180> 7

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
always take with this with the Beltway 7

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.719 
always take with this with the Beltway 7
is<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:54.049> foregrip<00:00:54.440> because<00:00:54.769> it<00:00:54.890> has<00:00:55.070> got<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.489> bit

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
is the foregrip because it has got a bit

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.390 
is the foregrip because it has got a bit
of<00:00:55.850> vertical<00:00:56.299> recoil<00:00:56.650> if<00:00:57.650> you<00:00:57.949> use<00:00:58.129> it<00:00:58.309> without

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
of vertical recoil if you use it without

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.219 
of vertical recoil if you use it without
it<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.570> kind<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.809> want<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.019> to<00:01:00.140> be

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
it and that you kind of want it to be

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:01.570 
it and that you kind of want it to be
like<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.470> laser<00:01:00.650> beam<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.190> plays<00:01:01.430> like

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
like the laser beam and it plays like

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.420 
like the laser beam and it plays like
the<00:01:01.729> ACR<00:01:02.320> then<00:01:03.320> I<00:01:03.350> run<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.979> parabolic

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430

they're bunny hopping all over the place

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.710 
they're bunny hopping all over the place
like<00:01:27.800> they<00:01:27.920> do<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.100> advanced<00:01:28.460> warfare<00:01:29.030> then

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
like they do in advanced warfare then

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.410 
like they do in advanced warfare then
perkone<00:01:30.290> it's<00:01:30.620> very<00:01:30.860> close<00:01:31.160> um<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.850> personally

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
perkone it's very close um I personally

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.330 
perkone it's very close um I personally
go<00:01:32.510> a<00:01:32.540> low<00:01:32.720> profile<00:01:33.230> because<00:01:33.500> there<00:01:33.980> are<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.159> lot

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
go a low profile because there are a lot

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.040 
go a low profile because there are a lot
of<00:01:34.370> UAVs<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.150> because<00:01:35.360> most<00:01:35.540> people<00:01:35.810> will<00:01:35.930> run

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
of UAVs and because most people will run

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.190 
of UAVs and because most people will run
the<00:01:36.200> support<00:01:36.560> addition<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:38.030> like<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.720> up<00:01:38.930> core

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
the support addition to like the up core

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.260

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.149 
support upgrade to the UAV there are
tens<00:01:41.630> are<00:01:41.780> gonna<00:01:41.960> be<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.170> lot<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.500> UAVs<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.070> the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
tens are gonna be a lot of UAVs in the

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.149 
tens are gonna be a lot of UAVs in the
game<00:01:43.370> then<00:01:44.090> if<00:01:44.330> I<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.440> lot<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.740> people<00:01:45.860> had

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
game then if I this a lot of people had

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.530 
game then if I this a lot of people had
a<00:01:46.190> bit<00:01:46.370> of<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.490> debate<00:01:46.610> saying<00:01:47.030> it's<00:01:47.210> better<00:01:47.390> to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
a bit of a debate saying it's better to

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.300 
a bit of a debate saying it's better to
run<00:01:47.690> cold<00:01:47.960> blood<00:01:48.140> but<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.380> run<00:01:48.710> peripherals

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
run cold blood but I run peripherals

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.060 
run cold blood but I run peripherals
because<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.150> mini-map<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.870> so<00:01:51.260> important<00:01:51.950> in

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
because the mini-map is so important in

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.100 
because the mini-map is so important in
call<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.280> duty<00:01:52.510> it<00:01:53.510> gives<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:53.870> a<00:01:53.900> bigger

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
call of duty it gives you a bigger

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.690 
call of duty it gives you a bigger
mini-map<00:01:54.500> it's<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.770> lot<00:01:54.920> easier<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.400> see<00:01:55.520> where

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
mini-map it's a lot easier to see where

me<00:02:03.020> guys<00:02:03.170> definitely<00:02:03.650> get<00:02:03.920> into<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.159> habit<00:02:04.220> of

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
me guys definitely get into the habit of

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.120 
me guys definitely get into the habit of
using<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.909> perk<00:02:05.390> 3<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:05.870> easy<00:02:06.110> toughness<00:02:06.920> and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
using it perk 3 it's easy toughness and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.729 
using it perk 3 it's easy toughness and
then<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.400> use<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> wild<00:02:08.119> card<00:02:08.299> to<00:02:08.599> get<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.019> this

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
then I use a wild card to get to this

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.170 
then I use a wild card to get to this
way<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.009> becomes<00:02:10.129> difficult<00:02:10.519> you<00:02:10.849> kind<00:02:11.120> of

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
way it becomes difficult you kind of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.220

stuff<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:23.180> leaves<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.510> with

stuff like that and that leaves you with

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
zone last longer threat detection so it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360 
zone last longer threat detection so it
works<00:02:32.570> like<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> Oracle<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.290> black<00:02:33.440> ops<00:02:33.590> not

black ops 2 ink orgy goes and then

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.930 
black ops 2 ink orgy goes and then
thrown<00:02:36.710> support<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.430> don't<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.790> to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
thrown support so you don't have to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.400
