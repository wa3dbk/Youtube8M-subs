400 but it is a there t line of laptops

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.149 
400 but it is a there t line of laptops
and<00:00:59.760> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.839> look<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.229> it<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.589> way<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> has<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
and if you look at it one way it has a

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.700 
and if you look at it one way it has a
lot<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.549> similarities<00:01:03.269> with<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.689> t<00:01:03.900> 400<00:01:04.530> and

lot of similarities with the t 400 and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.940 
lot of similarities with the t 400 and
yet<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.339> vastly<00:01:05.909> different<00:01:06.210> than<00:01:06.810> P<00:01:07.140> 400<00:01:07.799> as

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
yet it is vastly different than P 400 as

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.289 
yet it is vastly different than P 400 as
well<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.380> let's<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.590> over<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.250> laptop<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
well so let's go over the laptop and

well so let's go over the laptop and
I'll<00:01:12.450> point<00:01:12.689> out<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.049> differences<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.890> go

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I'll point out some differences as we go

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.249 
I'll point out some differences as we go

tech your guide calm so here let's look

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.020 
tech your guide calm so here let's look
at<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> dimension<00:01:29.070> wise<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.490> exactly

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
at it the dimension wise it's exactly

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.139 
at it the dimension wise it's exactly
the<00:01:30.180> same<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.689> T<00:01:31.380> 400<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.700> different

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
the same as T 400 what is different

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.219 
the same as T 400 what is different
however<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.970> battery<00:01:35.970> part<00:01:36.690> of<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.080> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
however is the battery part of it that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.330 
however is the battery part of it that
is<00:01:37.290> sticking<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.990> looks<00:01:40.979> quite

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
is sticking out and that looks quite

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.990 
is sticking out and that looks quite
different

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
different

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.520 
different
and<00:01:43.520> let's<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.880> once<00:01:45.300> we<00:01:45.690> look<00:01:45.900> at<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.229> side

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and let's see once we look at the side

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.880 
and let's see once we look at the side
you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.310> notice<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.680> optical<00:01:49.680> drive

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
you can notice that the optical drive

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.990 
you can notice that the optical drive
has<00:01:50.700> moved<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:52.320> firewire<00:01:52.860> also<00:01:53.370> moved<00:01:53.610> from

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
has moved the firewire also moved from

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.469 
has moved the firewire also moved from

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the the wireless on and off switch has

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.539 
the the wireless on and off switch has
moved<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.229> side<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.190> very

then you know all of a sudden they can't

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.190 
then you know all of a sudden they can't
get<00:02:17.580> Wi-Fi<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.209> then<00:02:18.330> they<00:02:18.510> end<00:02:18.689> up<00:02:18.780> having<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
get Wi-Fi and then they end up having to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.350 
get Wi-Fi and then they end up having to
call<00:02:19.319> tech<00:02:19.590> support<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.209> very

see<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.529> different<00:02:41.010> vent<00:02:41.340> design

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
see a different vent design

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.789 
see a different vent design
the<00:02:43.760> Ethernet<00:02:44.719> jack<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:45.200> still<00:02:45.439> here<00:02:45.650> the

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
the Ethernet jack is still here the

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.910 
the Ethernet jack is still here the
modem<00:02:46.099> jack<00:02:46.310> has<00:02:46.459> moved<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.319> this<00:02:48.319> side<00:02:48.620> of

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
modem jack has moved to the this side of

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.789 
modem jack has moved to the this side of
the<00:02:49.099> laptop<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.909> coming<00:02:50.750> back<00:02:50.930> here<00:02:51.349> you<00:02:51.590> can

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
the laptop and coming back here you can

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.959 
the laptop and coming back here you can
see<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.700> DisplayPort<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.719> three<00:02:54.049> USB<00:02:54.349> ports

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:54.969 
see the DisplayPort and three USB ports

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.649 
see the DisplayPort and three USB ports
and<00:02:57.099> not<00:02:58.099> much<00:02:58.340> difference<00:02:58.849> on<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.180> backside

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
and not much difference on the backside

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.899 
and not much difference on the backside
of<00:02:59.689> the<00:02:59.870> laptop<00:03:00.260> now<00:03:00.409> underneath<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:03.909> docking

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
of the laptop now underneath the docking

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.059 
of the laptop now underneath the docking
station<00:03:04.939> slot<00:03:05.689> looks<00:03:06.049> different<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.799> that's

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
station slot looks different and that's

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.240 
station slot looks different and that's
because<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.730> uses<00:03:08.120> different<00:03:08.750> dock<00:03:09.049> then<00:03:09.500> come

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
because it uses different dock then come

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.550 
because it uses different dock then come
what<00:03:10.849> we<00:03:11.180> used<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.599> use<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.109> t-series

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
what we used to use for the t-series

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.849 
what we used to use for the t-series
laptop<00:03:13.159> which<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.340> model<00:03:14.030> 25<00:03:14.750> or<00:03:15.079> for<00:03:15.409> docking

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
laptop which is model 25 or for docking

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.699 
laptop which is model 25 or for docking
station<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.939> that's<00:03:17.150> no<00:03:17.329> longer<00:03:17.359> the<00:03:17.720> case<00:03:17.750> so

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
station so that's no longer the case so

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.300 
station so that's no longer the case so
that<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:19.129> the<00:03:19.340> exterior<00:03:19.879> difference<00:03:20.569> of<00:03:21.310> this

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
that is the exterior difference of this

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.190 
that is the exterior difference of this
laptop<00:03:22.669> between<00:03:23.209> T<00:03:23.419> 400

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
laptop between T 400

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.280 
laptop between T 400
so<00:03:24.560> now<00:03:24.769> let's<00:03:25.040> pop<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.700> open<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.329> latch<00:03:26.569> also

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
so now let's pop it open the latch also

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.520 
so now let's pop it open the latch also
has<00:03:27.439> moved<00:03:27.769> as<00:03:28.219> well<00:03:28.849> and<00:03:29.230> there<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.260> our

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
has moved as well and there is our

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.509 
has moved as well and there is our
laptop<00:03:31.189> the<00:03:32.139> what<00:03:33.139> is<00:03:33.319> immediately<00:03:33.739> different

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
laptop the what is immediately different

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.429 
laptop the what is immediately different
when<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.849> use<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.329> laptop<00:03:35.629> is<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:35.959> trackpad

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
when you use this laptop is the trackpad

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:42.490 
when you use this laptop is the trackpad
has<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.519> very<00:03:39.010> tactile<00:03:40.209> texture<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.139> as

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
has a very tactile texture to it so as

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.490 
has a very tactile texture to it so as
you<00:03:42.709> glide<00:03:42.919> your<00:03:43.819> finger<00:03:44.180> over<00:03:44.629> you<00:03:45.200> will<00:03:45.319> see

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
you glide your finger over you will see

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.899 
you glide your finger over you will see
the<00:03:45.709> difference<00:03:46.129> also<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:47.090> think<00:03:47.199> this<00:03:48.199> I<00:03:48.909> don't

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
the difference also I think this I don't

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.909 
the difference also I think this I don't
want<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.150> say<00:03:50.239> this<00:03:50.449> is<00:03:50.599> rubbery<00:03:51.109> but<00:03:51.409> it<00:03:51.650> has<00:03:51.889> a

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
want to say this is rubbery but it has a

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.949 
want to say this is rubbery but it has a
different<00:03:52.220> texture<00:03:52.790> than<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.629> T<00:03:53.900> 400<00:03:54.769> where

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
different texture than the T 400 where

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.439 
different texture than the T 400 where
over<00:03:56.959> years<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.889> used<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.310> trackpad<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.269> the

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
over years have used the trackpad on the

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:04.689 
over years have used the trackpad on the
T<00:03:59.689> series<00:04:00.079> will<00:04:00.949> get<00:04:01.189> shiny<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:03.859> will

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
T series will get shiny and it will

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:05.679 
T series will get shiny and it will
change

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
change

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.110 
change
I<00:04:05.720> think<00:04:06.470> this<00:04:06.739> finish<00:04:07.280> right<00:04:07.549> here<00:04:07.579> will

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
I think this finish right here will

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.360 
I think this finish right here will
prevent<00:04:08.569> that<00:04:08.780> from<00:04:08.840> happening<00:04:09.079> and<00:04:09.709> the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
prevent that from happening and the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.920 
prevent that from happening and the
fingerprint<00:04:10.849> reader<00:04:11.030> has<00:04:11.269> now<00:04:11.449> moved<00:04:11.720> the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
fingerprint reader has now moved the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.800 
fingerprint reader has now moved the
closer<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.769> trackpad<00:04:13.629> compared<00:04:14.629> to

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
closer to the trackpad compared to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.259 
closer to the trackpad compared to
before<00:04:14.930> where<00:04:15.409> the<00:04:15.729> fingerprint<00:04:16.729> reader<00:04:16.970> used

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
before where the fingerprint reader used

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.979 
before where the fingerprint reader used
to<00:04:17.449> be<00:04:17.539> right<00:04:17.810> over<00:04:17.989> here<00:04:18.970> now<00:04:19.970> I'm<00:04:20.630> not<00:04:20.959> sure

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
to be right over here now I'm not sure

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.080 
to be right over here now I'm not sure

mean by the time you're done with all

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.780 
mean by the time you're done with all
those<00:05:02.290> stickers<00:05:02.590> as<00:05:02.950> well<00:05:03.130> as<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.310> think<00:05:03.580> that

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
those stickers as well as I think that

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.210 
those stickers as well as I think that
laptop<00:05:04.300> were<00:05:04.600> I'm<00:05:05.320> already<00:05:05.950> feeling

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
laptop were I'm already feeling

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.520 
laptop were I'm already feeling
claustrophobic<00:05:06.580> here<00:05:07.300> maybe<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.200> little<00:05:08.440> bit

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
claustrophobic here maybe a little bit

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.800 
claustrophobic here maybe a little bit
exaggeration<00:05:09.460> but<00:05:10.140> that's<00:05:11.140> what<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:12.810> T

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
exaggeration but that's what it is so T

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.470 
exaggeration but that's what it is so T
410<00:05:14.380> one<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.220> difference<00:05:15.700> between<00:05:16.210> that

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
410 one of the difference between that

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.860 
410 one of the difference between that
and<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:16.990> T<00:05:17.140> 400<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.890> that<00:05:18.130> it<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:19.210> can<00:05:19.420> spec<00:05:19.720> it

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
and the T 400 is that it you can spec it

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.630 
and the T 400 is that it you can spec it
all<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.200> way<00:05:20.290> up<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:21.090> Core<00:05:22.090> i7<00:05:22.500> CPU<00:05:23.500> when<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.280> did

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
all the way up to Core i7 CPU when I did

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.130 
all the way up to Core i7 CPU when I did
a<00:05:24.670> geek<00:05:24.940> bench<00:05:25.150> benchmark<00:05:25.840> on<00:05:25.990> this

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
a geek bench benchmark on this

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.320 
a geek bench benchmark on this
particular<00:05:26.650> laptop<00:05:26.920> I<00:05:27.280> believe<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.790> register

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
particular laptop I believe it register

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.560 
particular laptop I believe it register
around<00:05:28.860> 4900<00:05:29.860> deep<00:05:30.430> bench<00:05:30.670> benchmark<00:05:31.240> score

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
around 4900 deep bench benchmark score

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.690 
around 4900 deep bench benchmark score
so<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.320> is<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.470> very<00:05:32.770> high<00:05:32.980> performance<00:05:33.550> machine

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
so it is a very high performance machine

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.680 
so it is a very high performance machine
it<00:05:34.240> runs<00:05:34.540> very<00:05:34.660> cool<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.200> does<00:05:35.380> not<00:05:35.560> feel<00:05:35.800> hot

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
it runs very cool it does not feel hot

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.110 
it runs very cool it does not feel hot

here and the design up at the top has

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.530 
here and the design up at the top has
changed<00:05:42.970> slightly<00:05:43.920> if<00:05:44.920> you<00:05:45.160> ask<00:05:45.310> me<00:05:45.550> I'm<00:05:45.940> I

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
changed slightly if you ask me I'm I

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.000 
changed slightly if you ask me I'm I
think<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:46.990> like<00:05:47.170> the<00:05:47.290> old<00:05:47.560> T<00:05:48.520> 400<00:05:49.120> design<00:05:49.450> better

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
think I like the old T 400 design better

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.590 
think I like the old T 400 design better
the<00:05:51.010> speaker<00:05:51.460> grille<00:05:51.730> is<00:05:51.940> a<00:05:51.970> little<00:05:52.330> bit<00:05:52.419> more

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
the speaker grille is a little bit more

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.190 
the speaker grille is a little bit more
pronounced<00:05:53.350> now<00:05:53.650> on<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:54.220> on<00:05:54.760> each<00:05:55.600> side<00:05:56.020> of

pronounced now on the on each side of

pronounced now on the on each side of
the<00:05:56.350> laptop<00:05:56.560> and<00:05:57.160> another<00:05:57.910> difference<00:05:58.270> with

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
the laptop and another difference with

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.370 
the laptop and another difference with

the T 400 and T series in general from
the<00:06:02.470> passes<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:03.490> hinges<00:06:04.030> are<00:06:04.180> now<00:06:04.390> even

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
the passes the hinges are now even

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.060 
the passes the hinges are now even
before<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:07.480> left-hand<00:06:08.260> jewels<00:06:08.500> bigger<00:06:08.770> and

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
before the left-hand jewels bigger and

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.370 
before the left-hand jewels bigger and
the<00:06:09.190> right<00:06:09.370> hinge<00:06:09.700> was<00:06:09.940> a<00:06:09.970> much<00:06:10.540> smaller<00:06:10.780> so

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
the right hinge was a much smaller so

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.860 
the right hinge was a much smaller so
that's<00:06:11.890> now<00:06:12.190> a<00:06:12.220> change<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.970> unless<00:06:13.540> you<00:06:13.690> have

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
that's now a change and unless you have

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.530 
that's now a change and unless you have
already<00:06:14.080> noticed<00:06:14.770> another<00:06:15.640> difference<00:06:16.270> is

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
already noticed another difference is

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.880 
already noticed another difference is
the<00:06:17.280> bezel<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.550> side<00:06:18.880> bezel<00:06:19.300> is<00:06:19.479> now

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
the bezel the side bezel is now

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.360 
the bezel the side bezel is now
symmetrical<00:06:20.890> not<00:06:21.720> asymmetrical<00:06:22.720> as<00:06:23.370> before

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
symmetrical not asymmetrical as before

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.700 
symmetrical not asymmetrical as before
and<00:06:26.370> key<00:06:27.370> 410<00:06:27.880> you<00:06:28.090> can<00:06:28.270> also<00:06:28.479> spec<00:06:28.990> it<00:06:29.200> with<00:06:29.410> a

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
and key 410 you can also spec it with a

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.150 
and key 410 you can also spec it with a
webcam<00:06:30.490> which<00:06:31.180> I'm<00:06:32.080> not<00:06:32.290> sure<00:06:32.380> if<00:06:32.500> I'm<00:06:32.650> showing

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
webcam which I'm not sure if I'm showing

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.520 
webcam which I'm not sure if I'm showing
them<00:06:33.400> properly<00:06:33.760> on<00:06:33.940> the<00:06:34.000> camera<00:06:34.330> by<00:06:35.290> the<00:06:35.320> way

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
them properly on the camera by the way

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.260 
them properly on the camera by the way
I'm<00:06:35.680> moving<00:06:35.919> the<00:06:36.190> laptop<00:06:36.669> around<00:06:36.820> rather<00:06:37.150> than

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
I'm moving the laptop around rather than

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.540 
I'm moving the laptop around rather than
the<00:06:37.510> camera<00:06:37.900> around<00:06:38.169> so<00:06:38.350> the<00:06:38.680> videos<00:06:39.310> not

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
the camera around so the videos not

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.270 
the camera around so the videos not
jittery<00:06:40.000> and<00:06:40.270> shaky<00:06:40.750> giving<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.229> what<00:06:42.130> your

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
jittery and shaky giving you what your

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.969 
jittery and shaky giving you what your
cygnets<00:06:42.850> so<00:06:43.540> that's<00:06:44.169> what<00:06:44.380> that's<00:06:44.620> all<00:06:44.950> about

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
cygnets so that's what that's all about

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.570 
cygnets so that's what that's all about
and<00:06:45.580> also<00:06:46.180> the<00:06:46.750> code<00:06:46.990> and<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.620> webcam<00:06:48.130> area

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
and also the code and the webcam area

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.070 
and also the code and the webcam area
also<00:06:48.820> has<00:06:49.030> the<00:06:50.669> nightlight<00:06:51.669> little<00:06:52.450> LED<00:06:52.960> up

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
also has the nightlight little LED up

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.640 
also has the nightlight little LED up

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
one is better than the other obviously

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.499 
one is better than the other obviously
this<00:07:21.969> unit<00:07:22.360> has<00:07:22.509> core<00:07:22.840> i5<00:07:23.590> or<00:07:23.620> i7<00:07:24.509> therefore

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:25.509 
this unit has core i5 or i7 therefore

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.300 
this unit has core i5 or i7 therefore
the<00:07:25.659> memory<00:07:25.990> controller<00:07:26.199> is<00:07:26.650> embedded<00:07:27.099> into

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
the memory controller is embedded into

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.909 
the memory controller is embedded into
the<00:07:27.430> CPU<00:07:27.789> so<00:07:28.150> it<00:07:28.270> eliminates<00:07:29.169> the<00:07:29.289> bottom<00:07:29.800> the

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
the CPU so it eliminates the bottom the

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.749 
the CPU so it eliminates the bottom the
performance<00:07:30.430> bottleneck<00:07:31.000> that's<00:07:31.240> a<00:07:31.479> that<00:07:32.289> was

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 
performance bottleneck that's a that was

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:36.779 
performance bottleneck that's a that was
existing<00:07:33.759> up<00:07:34.000> to<00:07:34.240> Core<00:07:34.719> 2<00:07:34.930> Duo<00:07:34.960> processors<00:07:35.889> so

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:36.789 
existing up to Core 2 Duo processors so

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.920 
existing up to Core 2 Duo processors so
that<00:07:37.150> is<00:07:37.300> a<00:07:37.330> one<00:07:37.659> big<00:07:37.840> huge<00:07:38.110> advantage<00:07:39.930> this

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930 
that is a one big huge advantage this

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.540 
that is a one big huge advantage this
particularly<00:07:41.560> and<00:07:41.680> it<00:07:41.740> was<00:07:41.889> Dec<00:07:42.159> that<00:07:42.340> was<00:07:42.520> a

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.550 
particularly and it was Dec that was a

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.360 
particularly and it was Dec that was a
7200<00:07:43.449> rpm<00:07:43.840> Drive<00:07:44.110> didn't<00:07:44.979> quite<00:07:45.099> get<00:07:45.250> the

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.370 
7200 rpm Drive didn't quite get the

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.839 
7200 rpm Drive didn't quite get the
solid<00:07:45.759> state<00:07:46.029> but<00:07:46.840> the<00:07:47.680> wireless<00:07:48.099> coverage<00:07:48.340> is

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:48.849 
solid state but the wireless coverage is

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:51.899 
solid state but the wireless coverage is
super<00:07:49.599> and<00:07:49.900> the<00:07:49.960> performance<00:07:50.949> again<00:07:51.099> overall

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:51.909 
super and the performance again overall

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:55.350 
super and the performance again overall
is<00:07:52.240> excellent<00:07:53.229> so<00:07:53.319> I'm<00:07:53.680> out<00:07:54.099> of<00:07:54.159> five<00:07:54.699> stars<00:07:55.060> I

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 
is excellent so I'm out of five stars I

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.659 
is excellent so I'm out of five stars I
will<00:07:55.599> give<00:07:55.810> this<00:07:56.020> unit<00:07:56.770> four<00:07:57.430> and<00:07:57.580> a<00:07:57.639> half

00:07:57.659 --> 00:07:57.669 
will give this unit four and a half

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:00.209 
will give this unit four and a half
stars<00:07:58.090> out<00:07:58.240> of<00:07:58.300> five<00:07:58.569> that's<00:07:59.439> it<00:07:59.680> my<00:07:59.830> review

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:00.219 
stars out of five that's it my review

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:03.029 
stars out of five that's it my review
for<00:08:00.250> a<00:08:00.759> Lenovo<00:08:01.449> ThinkPad<00:08:01.779> T<00:08:02.050> 410<00:08:02.469> until<00:08:02.949> next

00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 
for a Lenovo ThinkPad T 410 until next

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.939 
for a Lenovo ThinkPad T 410 until next
time<00:08:03.279> take<00:08:03.879> care
