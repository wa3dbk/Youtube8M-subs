cannon<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.290> pretty<00:00:34.770> much<00:00:34.950> almost<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
cannon this is pretty much almost a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
cannon this is pretty much almost a
direct<00:00:35.579> copy<00:00:35.820> associate<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.540> scorpions

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
direct copy associate with scorpions

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.549 
direct copy associate with scorpions
eastern<00:00:39.390> handlebars<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.200> where<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
eastern handlebars here are where the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.040 
eastern handlebars here are where the
elites<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.950> hold<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.960> there's<00:00:42.960> this

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
elites can hold on to and there's this

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.709 
elites can hold on to and there's this
yellow<00:00:43.260> pad<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.300> flash<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.510> whenever

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
yellow pad here that flash is whenever

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.819 
yellow pad here that flash is whenever
you<00:00:46.260> aim<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.520> enemy<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.440> simply

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you aim at an enemy and so that simply

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.200 
you aim at an enemy and so that simply
goes<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:52.460> just<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:57.000> will

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
goes on here just like that so this will

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.549 
goes on here just like that so this will
bar<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.500> the<00:01:00.020> troop<00:01:01.020> transport

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
bar here that's for the troop transport

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.810 
bar here that's for the troop transport
which<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.489> later<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.750> video<00:01:04.820> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
which will be later in this video so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.250 
which will be later in this video so
this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> Gosport<00:01:06.630> hog<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:08.180> then<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
this is the Gosport hog and then a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
this is the Gosport hog and then a
take-off<00:01:10.260> nas<00:01:10.619> cannon<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:13.189> then<00:01:14.189> take<00:01:14.640> out

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
take-off nas cannon and then take out

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:25.219 
take-off nas cannon and then take out
this<00:01:18.140> put<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.380> base<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.450> take<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
this put in this base and take the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.539 
this put in this base and take the
flamethrower<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:28.140> put<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.829> on

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
flamethrower and just put that right on

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.560 
flamethrower and just put that right on
this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.640 

there's<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.840> little<00:01:36.049> stock<00:01:36.259> connector

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
there's that little stock connector

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.520 
there's that little stock connector
don't<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:36.950> down<00:01:37.130> there<00:01:37.340> from<00:01:37.729> my

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
don't you down there from my

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.590 
don't you down there from my
flamethrower<00:01:39.530> design<00:01:40.009> this<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.369> what<00:01:40.400> I<00:01:40.600> put

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
flamethrower design this is what I put

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.560 
flamethrower design this is what I put
that<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:41.900> for<00:01:42.820> this<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:43.939> my<00:01:44.090> scissors<00:01:44.479> well

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
that on for this is my scissors well

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.020 
that on for this is my scissors well
actually<00:01:44.750> uh<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.549> flamethrower

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
actually uh so this is the flamethrower

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.480 
actually uh so this is the flamethrower
warthog<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.950> think<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.040> would<00:01:49.159> be<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.280> pretty

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
warthog I think this would be a pretty

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.130 
warthog I think this would be a pretty
cool<00:01:49.580> addition<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.270> game<00:01:50.450> especially<00:01:50.690> on

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
cool addition to the game especially on

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.609 
cool addition to the game especially on
a<00:01:51.409> little<00:01:52.130> like<00:01:52.399> floodgate<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.000> Cortana<00:01:53.899> time

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
a little like floodgate and Cortana time

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.779 
a little like floodgate and Cortana time
to<00:01:54.740> flood<00:01:54.979> around<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.310> could<00:01:55.430> drive<00:01:55.610> one<00:01:55.759> of

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
to flood around you could drive one of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.039 
to flood around you could drive one of
these<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.149> just<00:01:56.240> burn<00:01:57.049> them<00:01:57.170> down<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.810> take

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
these and just burn them down so take

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.679 
these and just burn them down so take
off<00:02:00.229> those<00:02:01.100> both<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.640> those<00:02:01.880> pieces<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.799> then

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
off those both of those pieces and then

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.380 
off those both of those pieces and then
for<00:02:05.689> my<00:02:05.899> favorite<00:02:06.319> one

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
for my favorite one

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
take a simple one of these and just put

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.979 
take a simple one of these and just put
that<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.200> there<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:14.319> then<00:02:15.319> just<00:02:16.989> stick

that right in there and then just stick

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.080 
that right in there and then just stick
this<00:02:18.170> up<00:02:18.410> here<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.750> makes<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.580> halo<00:02:22.819> one

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090

stick that right in there

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.249 
stick that right in there
actually<00:05:49.270> I<00:05:49.300> other<00:05:49.840> way<00:05:51.960> let's<00:05:52.960> take<00:05:53.110> that

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
actually I other way let's take that

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.929 
actually I other way let's take that
right<00:05:53.500> there<00:05:54.029> and<00:05:55.379> now<00:05:56.379> wait<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.590> minute

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
so when this bulbs down this should go

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.200 
so when this bulbs down this should go
right<00:06:03.009> in<00:06:03.159> there<00:06:03.509> take<00:06:04.509> one<00:06:04.539> of<00:06:04.779> these<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:06.210> put

right in there take one of these and put

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.529 
right in there take one of these and put
that<00:06:07.629> round<00:06:07.840> there<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.289> you<00:06:08.500> lock<00:06:08.770> in<00:06:09.539> the

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539
