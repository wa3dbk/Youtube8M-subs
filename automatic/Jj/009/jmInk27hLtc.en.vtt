00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
to my java game development series so

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.310 
to my java game development series so
first<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.420> would<00:00:15.540> like<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.780> thank<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> for

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.500 
first I would like to thank you for
leaving<00:00:16.529> suggestions<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> last<00:00:17.940> episode

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.970 
leaving suggestions in the last episode
I<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.930> taken<00:00:19.320> them<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.560> tonight<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
I have taken them in tonight and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.670 
I have taken them in tonight and
hopefully<00:00:20.520> they<00:00:21.119> will<00:00:21.240> be<00:00:21.300> added<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.470> this

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
hopefully they will be added so this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.740 
hopefully they will be added so this
episode<00:00:23.100> she<00:00:23.369> isn't<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.150> as<00:00:24.240> long<00:00:24.480> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
episode she isn't going to be as long in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.349 
episode she isn't going to be as long in
that<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.350> because<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.920> am<00:00:25.949> added<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.580> many

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that is because I am added as many

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 
that is because I am added as many
features<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> game<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> did<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.519> last

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
features to a game as I did in the last

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.429 
features to a game as I did in the last
episode<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> last<00:00:30.960> episode<00:00:31.320> was

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
episode because the last episode was

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
episode because the last episode was
like<00:00:31.560> 12<00:00:31.830> minutes<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:32.520> explaining

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
like 12 minutes and I was explaining

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600 
like 12 minutes and I was explaining
like<00:00:33.000> everything<00:00:33.680> but<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.130> episode

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
like everything but in this episode

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.700 
like everything but in this episode
today<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.910> haven't<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:36.540> added<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.410> much

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
today I haven't really added that much

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
today I haven't really added that much
and<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.820> I've<00:00:39.030> been<00:00:39.149> working

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and that's because I've been working

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.520 
and that's because I've been working
more<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.809> coding<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.000> creating<00:00:42.000> some<00:00:42.210> Maps<00:00:42.530> so

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
more on coding and creating some Maps so

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.190 
more on coding and creating some Maps so
the<00:00:44.489> feature<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.300> added<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.899> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the feature that I have added in this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.830 
the feature that I have added in this
episode<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> mini-map<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.210> some<00:00:48.450> person

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
episode is the mini-map so some person

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840 
episode is the mini-map so some person
did<00:00:49.050> suggest<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.280> added<00:00:50.640> up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
did suggest this but I actually added up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
did suggest this but I actually added up
before<00:00:51.300> he<00:00:51.480> suggested<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.350> technically<00:00:53.160> he

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
before he suggested it so technically he

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
before he suggested it so technically he
didn't<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:53.730> suggest<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.590> see

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
didn't really suggest it so you can see

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.619 
didn't really suggest it so you can see
in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> top<00:00:56.129> right<00:00:56.160> corner<00:00:56.579> before<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.420> had

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
in the top right corner before we had

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.599 
in the top right corner before we had
just<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> square<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.399> have

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
just the square but now we actually have

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.319 
just the square but now we actually have
the<00:00:59.969> map<00:01:01.219> getting<00:01:02.219> rendered<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the map getting rendered in there and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
the map getting rendered in there and
this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> actual<00:01:04.199> pixel<00:01:04.769> map<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
this is the actual pixel map that is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
this is the actual pixel map that is
rendering<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> tiles<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.380> still<00:01:07.590> makes

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
rendering the tiles and it still makes

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
rendering the tiles and it still makes
sense<00:01:07.920> though<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.299> yeah<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.659> got

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
sense though and so yeah it's got

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
sense though and so yeah it's got
pinpoint<00:01:10.380> accuracy<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
pinpoint accuracy so if I go in this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
pinpoint accuracy so if I go in this
bottom<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.270> corner<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.780> you'll<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
bottom right corner here you'll see that

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.060 
bottom right corner here you'll see that
I'm<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.580> bottom<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.150> corner<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
I'm at the bottom right corner of the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.719 
I'm at the bottom right corner of the
fence<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.900> corner

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
fence there if I go up to this corner

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.039 
fence there if I go up to this corner
over<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.880> you'll<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> white<00:01:21.780> dot

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
over here you'll see that the white dot

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
over here you'll see that the white dot
is<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.950> corner<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.460> fence<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
is at that corner of the fence there so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
is at that corner of the fence there so
that<00:01:24.390> tells<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.869> where<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> position<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that tells you where the position of the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.370 
that tells you where the position of the
map<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.130> also<00:01:26.280> helps<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.780> find<00:01:28.049> paths

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
map it also helps you out to find paths

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.910 
map it also helps you out to find paths
or<00:01:28.920> something<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> level<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.920> right

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
or something or on a level because right

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
or something or on a level because right
now<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.159> can't<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.420> fence<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.930> over<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
now you can't see the fence at over on

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
now you can't see the fence at over on
the<00:01:34.530> mini-map<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> fence<00:01:35.610> which

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the mini-map you can see the fence which

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.289 
the mini-map you can see the fence which
is<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.869> cool<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.770> press<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:39.090> now

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
is a really cool if I press in right now

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.590 
is a really cool if I press in right now
just<00:01:39.900> because<00:01:40.320> I've<00:01:40.470> set<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.030> test<00:01:42.420> on

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
just because I've set this for a test on

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
just because I've set this for a test on
this<00:01:42.689> episode<00:01:43.229> I've<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.250> got<00:01:45.060> another

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this episode I've actually got another

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.940 
this episode I've actually got another
map<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> little<00:01:46.590> town<00:01:46.920> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
map here and this is a little town that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
map here and this is a little town that
I've<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.369> working<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.750> takes

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I've been working on and actually takes

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.630 
I've been working on and actually takes
me<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> while<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.950> draw<00:01:50.159> these<00:01:50.399> up

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
me a while to actually draw these up

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.330 
me a while to actually draw these up
because<00:01:51.079> every<00:01:52.079> pixel<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
because every pixel is different and you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.310 
because every pixel is different and you
just<00:01:53.430> got<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> click<00:01:54.090> everywhere<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.960> all

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
just got to click everywhere and all

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.179 
just got to click everywhere and all
that<00:01:55.439> stuff<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:57.439> here's<00:01:58.439> an<00:01:58.530> example<00:01:58.890> this

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
that stuff like here's an example this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.789 
that stuff like here's an example this
this<00:02:00.060> block<00:02:00.390> right<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
this block right here that I'm on is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.230 
this block right here that I'm on is
different<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.759> right<00:02:03.000> there

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
different to that one right there

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.719 
different to that one right there
because<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.649> see<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.520> has

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
because as you can see this one here has

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.219 
because as you can see this one here has
like<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.270> gray<00:02:06.600> bit<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:06.990> front

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
like that little gray bit at the front

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.040 
like that little gray bit at the front
and<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.770> one's<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.629> top<00:02:09.840> bit

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and this one's just that the top bit

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
and this one's just that the top bit
there<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.280> there<00:02:11.280> are<00:02:11.340> actually<00:02:11.550> different

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
there so there are actually different

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.370 
there so there are actually different
pixels<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.690> got

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
pixels and I just got

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.420 
pixels and I just got
I<00:02:14.810> draw<00:02:15.810> each<00:02:16.020> one<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:16.740> yeah<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.250> takes

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
I draw each one there so yeah that takes

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.790 
I draw each one there so yeah that takes
a<00:02:17.580> while<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.020> don't<00:02:19.320> know<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.770> call

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
a while so I don't know what to call

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.920 
a while so I don't know what to call
this<00:02:20.160> town<00:02:20.400> yet<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.910> might<00:02:21.120> not<00:02:21.300> even<00:02:21.450> be<00:02:21.720> one

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
this town yet it might not even be one

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.300 
this town yet it might not even be one
of<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.080> towns<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> game<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.190> because

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
of the towns in the game just because

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580 
of the towns in the game just because
I've<00:02:24.150> been<00:02:24.330> showing<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> off<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.020> these<00:02:25.110> game

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
I've been showing it off in these game

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.440 
I've been showing it off in these game
devs<00:02:25.860> videos<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> don't<00:02:26.640> want<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.910> guys<00:02:27.060> seeing

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
devs videos I don't want you guys seeing

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.650 
devs videos I don't want you guys seeing
the<00:02:28.080> actual<00:02:28.260> map<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.700> might<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.000> changed

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the actual map so this might be changed

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.680 
the actual map so this might be changed
in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.840> episode<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:31.410> modified<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.690> little

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
in the episode or just modified a little

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.960 
in the episode or just modified a little
bit<00:02:33.810> more<00:02:33.960> different<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:35.220> different

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
bit more different so it's different

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.420 
bit more different so it's different
yeah<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.080> house<00:02:37.350> might<00:02:37.710> change<00:02:38.040> it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
yeah like this house might change it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.980 
yeah like this house might change it
might<00:02:38.580> be<00:02:38.700> different<00:02:39.000> shape<00:02:39.390> or<00:02:39.540> sighing<00:02:39.810> like

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
might be different shape or sighing like

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.650 
might be different shape or sighing like
that<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.880> see<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.210> mini-map

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
that so as you can see on the mini-map

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.160 
that so as you can see on the mini-map
I<00:02:42.900> Pro<00:02:43.470> shouldn't<00:02:43.710> be<00:02:43.770> talking<00:02:44.130> about<00:02:44.220> that

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
I Pro shouldn't be talking about that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.720 
I Pro shouldn't be talking about that
it's<00:02:46.170> giving<00:02:46.440> me<00:02:46.470> point<00:02:46.740> pinpoint<00:02:47.280> accuracy

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
it's giving me point pinpoint accuracy

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.420 
it's giving me point pinpoint accuracy
and<00:02:48.060> actually<00:02:48.390> handles<00:02:48.930> any<00:02:49.200> map<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:50.280> you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and actually handles any map that you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.330 
and actually handles any map that you
give<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.300> map<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.600> 71<00:02:52.380> by<00:02:52.530> 71<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
give it so this map is 71 by 71 the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.870 
give it so this map is 71 by 71 the
previous<00:02:53.910> one<00:02:54.090> was<00:02:54.270> 31<00:02:54.780> by<00:02:54.960> 31<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:56.490> then<00:02:56.760> you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
previous one was 31 by 31 and then you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.430 
previous one was 31 by 31 and then you
can<00:02:57.000> tell<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.450> hand<00:02:57.750> had<00:02:57.900> worked<00:02:58.110> really

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
can tell that a hand had worked really

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.540 
can tell that a hand had worked really
perfectly<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.550> it<00:03:00.030> shows<00:03:00.710> again<00:03:01.710> I<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.130> how

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
perfectly and it shows again I like how

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.850 
perfectly and it shows again I like how
it<00:03:02.670> shows<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.630> area<00:03:04.080> around<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
it shows you the area around that you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.370 
it shows you the area around that you
can't<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.550> screen<00:03:05.940> say<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:07.140> could<00:03:07.290> be

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
can't see on the screen say you could be

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.080 
can't see on the screen say you could be
like<00:03:07.560> hmm<00:03:07.800> there's<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.160> house<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.640> over<00:03:08.820> here

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
like hmm there's a house just over here

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.320 
like hmm there's a house just over here
that's<00:03:09.270> pretty<00:03:09.480> cool<00:03:09.720> let's<00:03:09.870> go<00:03:09.930> check<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.380> out

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
that's pretty cool let's go check it out

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.150 
that's pretty cool let's go check it out
so<00:03:12.330> yeah<00:03:12.570> again<00:03:12.960> as<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.440> said<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.770> is<00:03:13.830> wasn't

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
so yeah again as I said this is wasn't

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.010 
so yeah again as I said this is wasn't
going<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.550> be<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.670> long<00:03:15.090> episode<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.990> is

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
going to be a long episode and that is

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.740 
going to be a long episode and that is
because<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.800> didn't<00:03:17.100> really<00:03:17.220> add<00:03:17.460> any<00:03:17.790> much

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
because I didn't really add any much

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.310 
because I didn't really add any much
features<00:03:19.370> I've<00:03:20.370> been<00:03:20.580> working<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.930> thing

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
features I've been working on this thing

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.410 
features I've been working on this thing
called<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.310> screen<00:03:23.610> manager<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.300> this

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
called a screen manager and this

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.920 
called a screen manager and this
practically<00:03:24.890> makes<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.100> lot<00:03:26.310> easier<00:03:26.820> to

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
practically makes it a lot easier to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.720 
practically makes it a lot easier to
handle<00:03:27.930> what's<00:03:28.860> getting<00:03:29.100> rendered<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
handle what's getting rendered on the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.880 
handle what's getting rendered on the
screen<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.470> say<00:03:31.650> render<00:03:33.890> make

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
screen and you can just say render make

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.820 
screen and you can just say render make
game<00:03:35.250> screen<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:35.970> will<00:03:36.150> render<00:03:36.360> all<00:03:36.660> the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
game screen and this will render all the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.110 
game screen and this will render all the
stuff<00:03:37.830> that's<00:03:38.070> supposed<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.460> be<00:03:38.580> on<00:03:38.670> here<00:03:38.910> like

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
stuff that's supposed to be on here like

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.480 
stuff that's supposed to be on here like
the<00:03:39.300> GUI<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.780> mini-map<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.830> background<00:03:41.310> the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
the GUI the mini-map the background the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.820 
the GUI the mini-map the background the
tiles<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.209> objects<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.959> all<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.290> stuff<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
tiles the objects and all that stuff and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.550 
tiles the objects and all that stuff and
then<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.610> could<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:44.880> like<00:03:45.030> render<00:03:45.510> main<00:03:46.140> menu

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
then I could be like render main menu

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.020 
then I could be like render main menu
and<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:46.920> will<00:03:47.070> render<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.670> main<00:03:47.850> menu

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
and that will render the main menu

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.820 
and that will render the main menu
pretty<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.840> will<00:03:48.959> render<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.320> main<00:03:49.500> menu

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
pretty that will render the main menu

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.130 
pretty that will render the main menu
and<00:03:50.010> yeah<00:03:50.670> it's<00:03:50.820> just<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.180> really<00:03:51.420> simple<00:03:51.720> way

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and yeah it's just a really simple way

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.210 
and yeah it's just a really simple way
instead<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.130> writing<00:03:53.400> each<00:03:54.350> method<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.830> some

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
instead of writing each method in some

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.790 
instead of writing each method in some
sort<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.580> if<00:03:56.820> statement<00:03:57.420> crap<00:03:57.810> which<00:03:58.620> is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
sort of if statement crap which is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.580 
sort of if statement crap which is
probably<00:03:59.100> not<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.550> best<00:03:59.580> way<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.590> and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
probably not the best way to do it and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.830 
probably not the best way to do it and
also<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.370> been<00:04:02.520> working<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.000> maps<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.660> I

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
also have been working on maps and I

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.570 
also have been working on maps and I
don't<00:04:03.900> want<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.320> show<00:04:04.650> them<00:04:04.800> off<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.310> this

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
don't want to show them off in this

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.240 
don't want to show them off in this
because<00:04:05.970> they<00:04:06.660> might<00:04:06.840> be<00:04:06.900> official<00:04:07.500> maps<00:04:07.740> in

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
because they might be official maps in

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.070 
because they might be official maps in
this<00:04:08.550> game<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:08.880> didn't<00:04:09.510> really<00:04:09.720> want<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.930> show

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
this game I didn't really want to show

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.380 
this game I didn't really want to show
off<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.380> town<00:04:10.680> but<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.220> thought<00:04:11.640> why<00:04:11.910> not<00:04:12.120> give

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
off this town but I thought why not give

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.120 
off this town but I thought why not give
them<00:04:12.510> an<00:04:12.630> example<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.230> like<00:04:13.530> some<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> new

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130
