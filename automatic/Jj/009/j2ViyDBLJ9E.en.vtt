00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 share with you a cooking recipe 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.700
 chicken liver in cream sauce 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.490
 which turns out incredibly tasty and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.890
 soft that literally melts in your mouth 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.820
 chicken liver is well washed under 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 running water and chop the onion 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 cut into small cubes in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.130
 I add a saucepan for the multicooker 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.040
 a small piece of butter 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:38.190
 including the slow cooker in cupcake mode 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.370
 add to the pot shlok mix 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.110
 very complicated people a little bit to live 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:49.950
 operators our task now is a bit 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 fry onion onion became slightly white 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.530
 transparent and now we sent here and

 as you can see from the liver stands out a little 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.900
 liquids it does not allow the dish to burn 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.210
