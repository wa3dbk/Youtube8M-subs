 darting first line is placed 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.950
 leading the wall at the 6th texas charm which 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.510
 is none other than the titleholder 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.000
 there is also a sensation in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.600
 easily winning the price of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.760
 Bourbonnais 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 lately a confirmation that if 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 expected we will oppose number 4 jean duval 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.829
 second of the price of bourbonnais is him 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.899
 also confirmed in such a society 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.149
 the medical number 8 that is not presented 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.460
 more know that he has postponed by three 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.430
 times this price of burgundy 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.140
 he's still looking for 35000 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.969
 euros needed to validate a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.430
 eventual ticket for a new 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.210
 participation in the grand prix d'america 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.560
 who will have to finish here on one 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.439
 first two steps to ensure 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.240
 this gain is then confirmed in the 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.350
 belgium price 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.270
 about this number 8 hiding him well 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.649
 he has the potential to do it but his 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.899
 number 8 can play him tricks 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.820
 the number 3 timoko who finished 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.490
 third of this race in 2012 he does not 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.170
 lack of speed and in this lot 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.750
 with this good numbers they can 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.070
 worry the previous cities the 5th 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.420
 tiego pond it is in full 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.810
 possession of his means he finished 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.200
 first price of Brittany at the beginning of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.240
 meeting 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.979
 he finished 4th in this year's race 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.929
 last I also remembered in dying 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.850
 the 14th of August, the fifth of the fifth 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.619
 bourbonnais price is riding hard to 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.479
 the effort in my opinion he too can 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.069
 to add to the reports 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.840
 also number 17 only boat that will have 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.459
 especially against him this number outside 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.500
 and in second line behind the wings 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.179
 of the autostart but this horse took a 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.009
 encouraging third place in the 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.899
 price of bourbonnais on the occasion of his 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.939
 debut on our soil confirmation is 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.159
 here waited I will also make me the 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.390
 american mare the 7 maven who does 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.030
 the object of flattering noise is a 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.920
 mare who has speed and the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.360
 central by jean detector the man from 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.049
 moneymaker who had won the award 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.040
 of america in 1999 so for this quinté 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.079
 impossible to do without the system 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.880
 task arms the 4th rank of the valais on May 8 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.400
 the caches for places I will remember 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.010
 the 3 timoko the 5 tiego pond on the 14th 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.650
 victims of valdo 17 soldiers early on the 7th 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.480
 maven following the program in vincennes 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.160
 nice test in the first with the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.840
 presence of the blood of ismaïl looked like you 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.209
 know her she had won her 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.290
 first three outings under saddle 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.579
 before being faulty in the price 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.620
 of vincennes lately in a 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.819
 classic where she is getting closer to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.190
 resources was competitive for a 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.770
 podium it must be redeemed 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.000
 I think here if she does not do the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.740
 fault at the intersection of tracks like 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.550
 last time she can reconnect with the 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.350
 victory the number 9 numbers 11 forgiveness 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.460
 verdict tomorrow which counts a second 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.050
 place and a more recent victory 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.460
 two attempts under the saddle will lead 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.920
 opposition in the company of new blood 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.220
 blue island beginner ambitious trotting 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.630
 mounted 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.250
 attention also for a place at 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.020
 rib baraka breast if she is wise 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.390
 she seems to me able to come 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.940
 tickle the previous ones also t110 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.620
 ben ali lee 120 beds of May 109 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.710
 blood island and the 102 baraka rib 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.080
 for a possible 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.090
 more profitable trio in the seventh 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.540
 game clears with two fillies 2 507 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.460
 coco beach and the 709 cardesse de blary 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.340
 placed on the podium of a test of 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.540
 same invoice December 10 in vincennes 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.310
 Also know that coco beach since 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.600
 was tried in the price of a May when 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.830
 she made the mistake but she left 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.050
 gallop then she followed well in 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.620
 withdrawal my opinion it has the size 707 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.300
 coco beach 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.370
 in my opinion she's a postulant at 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.470
 success of its main rival will be the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.120
 709 blary carries I have a 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.710
 information also about 902 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.670
 bat caroline manage but kobe i'm 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.410
 coach always told me it was 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.390
 a quality filly last time 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.770
 has shown the offending is not so 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.790
 following she followed well before 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.360
 to draw five more bears 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.610
 encouraging 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.870
 know that she owns in a 14.7 the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.720
 best time in the peloton on this 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.800
 course also know that a lotto 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.670
 stark does not pose him problem is 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.410
 she's gains delay 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.420
 always been preserved and spared by 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.980
 Jeremy Bichard by living this lot 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.070
 his rating should be interesting and 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.230
 she can why not impose herself on a 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.540
 pretty rapport 902 bat caroline has a cost 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.240
 tried to win placed so for this 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.160
 target vincennes first 7th and 9th small 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.600
 word on arles in meeting 2 in the 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.650
 first I recommend the 106 kg 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.570
 guillaume she does not have the gains in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.130
 relationship with its potential after 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.360
 outputs to the key she comes back between 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.680
 goes up his last two 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.150
 under saddle trips were crowned 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.470
 of success it's a first chance 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.990
 theoretical if it shows 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.220
 wise in the second I know that 220 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.570
 good case potting talent had prepared 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.100
 accordingly for these races 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.450
 it is true that the number 1 but he knows 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.320
 start relatively quickly behind the 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.610
 hedges the high sarthe 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.720
 he has finished the year well see your 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.360
 movements in the horse is at best 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.010
 fbi peter knows his young driver 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 well, having recently conducted 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.530
 know also that the horse will be 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.660
 strapless four feet for the occasion 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.610
 it will be the fifth time of his career 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.780
 and that's more than 50 races run 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.670
 in short all the lights are green 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.470
 he should not be far from the truth 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.910
 In my opinion, it constitutes a serious 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.130
 rival for the one he should leave 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.810
 among the favorites the 205 g razzano to 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.380
 horse of the most regular at this level of 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.889
 competition 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.719
 106 home support 201 know 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.550
 vagabond delays he will be asked 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.900
 105.0 of the rings I would also have a 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.259
 favorite in meeting iii deauville 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.129
 will be 1904 henri ii smoker I could 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.379
 to talk with his friend 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.939
 coach claude lelaie know he 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.979
 is very confident in smoker network has 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.270
 won this race last year the 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.770
 last time to the mans the horse had 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.479
 not his land 1 reason why 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.830
 he could not provide his full measure but 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.599
 he finds the sand a surface he 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.349
 particularly appreciates the distance 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.779
 is in his strings 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.490
 he is in optimal shape he has well 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.990
 worked for this race and his 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.729
 coach would be disappointed not to see him 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.529
 play the leading roles in this 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.849
 race it's true that these disabilities a 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.139
 pot-au-feu it must be okay 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.849
 you have to have a good journey 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.979
 but my opinion it should not be 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.080
 surprised to see this 904 smoker network 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.430
 retain his title in this handicap he 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.219
 must admit and modest bill 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.930
 so meeting iii deauville of 904 henry 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:54.090
 to store here for information 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.740
 from this Sunday to December 28th I will 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.939
 wishes excellent must all a 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.419
 excellent Sunday and see you soon on 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.419
