00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and you can make many of these but we're

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
and you can make many of these but we're
not<00:01:22.259> using<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> much<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
not using that much you this will be the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.690 
not using that much you this will be the
last<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> lifetime<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.619> since<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> doesn't

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
last you a lifetime so since it doesn't

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.249 
last you a lifetime so since it doesn't
last<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.090> lifetime<00:01:27.299> try<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> smaller

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
last a lifetime try and get a smaller

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
last a lifetime try and get a smaller
ball<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.790> we'll<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
ball so what we'll do is just going to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.770 
ball so what we'll do is just going to
go<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.750> cocktail<00:01:30.990> glass<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:32.159> per<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> recipe

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
first off with all the extra ice I'm

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.650 
first off with all the extra ice I'm
hoping<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:07.039> chill<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.820> glass<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.119> little<00:02:08.509> bit

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
hoping to chill the glass a little bit

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.630 
hoping to chill the glass a little bit
the<00:02:08.840> mixing<00:02:09.229> glass<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.920> I'm<00:02:10.220> going<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.429> pour

the<00:02:10.819> alcohol<00:02:10.970> which<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.569> getting<00:02:12.500> hot<00:02:12.920> over

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
the alcohol which is getting hot over

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.600 
the alcohol which is getting hot over
the<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.940> stick<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.540> bring<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.080> back<00:02:15.230> down<00:02:15.470> a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the I stick to bring it back down a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.509 
the I stick to bring it back down a
temperature<00:02:16.610> that's<00:02:16.840> desirable<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.400> we're

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
temperature that's desirable so we're

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.960 
temperature that's desirable so we're
going<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.700> measure<00:02:19.910> out<00:02:20.260> two<00:02:21.260> ounces<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.970> the

why it's only half an ounce it doesn't

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.420 
why it's only half an ounce it doesn't
take<00:03:49.850> much<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.739> impress<00:03:51.739> your<00:03:51.920> senses
