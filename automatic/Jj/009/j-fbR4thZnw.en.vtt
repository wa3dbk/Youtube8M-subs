00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.080 
after the first vessel I'm going to turn
down<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.170> heat<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.680> cook<00:01:18.310> this<00:01:18.490> for<00:01:18.670> about<00:01:18.790> 15

down the heat and cook this for about 15
minutes

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
minutes

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.480 
minutes
the<00:01:20.020> cooking<00:01:20.200> time<00:01:20.320> actually<00:01:20.770> depends<00:01:21.340> on<00:01:21.400> the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
the cooking time actually depends on the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.910 
the cooking time actually depends on the
quality<00:01:21.910> of<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.120> rajma<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:23.050> adjust<00:01:23.770> your

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
quality of the rajma so adjust your

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.850 
quality of the rajma so adjust your
timing<00:01:24.280> recording

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.040 

so<00:01:28.340> while<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.730> rajma<00:01:28.910> is<00:01:29.150> cooking<00:01:29.510> i<00:01:29.600> am<00:01:29.690> going
