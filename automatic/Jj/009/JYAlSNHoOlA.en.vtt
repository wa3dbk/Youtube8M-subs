00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.610
 we return here to the favorite little corner 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.939
 of this ring that does not create the night of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.699
 MarcaTV boxing and we're back 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:19.010
 let's go back with a small cycle of 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.100
 questions that you are asking us through 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.900
 of the network and today one that I had desire 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.720
 also a little to comment it with 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.850
 you what is the way to paste the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.289
 uppercut normally as we have taught 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.599
 both this season and the previous one 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.079
 to the previous the uppercut we have 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.269
 worked with this fist position me 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.019
 ask why no one could 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:45.409
 paste well so gentlemen can also be 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.130
 hit the uppercut like this but when in what 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.960
 moment 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.350
 precisely when the rival boxer 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.670
 is very closed on duty when the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.820
 boxer is closed 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.100
 We seek to enter find loopholes of that 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.210
 guard in each wash to lift him 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 head and for that we're going to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.830
 serve to work in a device that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.590
 I have not yet taught you here of the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.330
 gym what the corrector of parente 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.690
 for that we go to the gym 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.780
 we go in and we're going to work this upper 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.000
 of guard opening to continue it 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.430
 with a strike 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 see you here in front of the proofreader 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.010
 as we see is a device that is fixed to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.780
 the wall to be able to hit with a little 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.479
 of forcefulness that here would not be 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.120
 damaged the wrist we see how we accommodate 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.770
 one side we drop our arm a little 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.200
 with a little bit of risk and from there 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 we grow with a little bit with the upper 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 lateral the same we do it from the side 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.190
 right I stand aside and from there I grow up 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.840
 with the implement and we see how we continue 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.030
 with a chain of blows that is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.759
 perfect and we see that the concealer 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.560
 we could also work with the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.960
 how I really like it a little 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.489
 then with side step we have how 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.380
 we do the lateral steps and we 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.959
 we go to the circles that the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.360
 corrector with another type of work 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.290
 new to the side we are leaving us 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:24.380
 of the line 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:26.990
 in achieving strokes twist and stick 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.920
 and here's the technical section of today 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.150
 I hope we have a little bit 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.880
 unraveled some of the doubts that 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.220
 they raise us on the net we wish 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.380
 as long as you continue to consult us 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.120
 delighted to be able to give our 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.220
 knowledge that they are small but what 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.200
 we try but that's always here and the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.630
 more next week at night
