you

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.780 

I<00:00:08.230> think<00:00:09.230> the<00:00:09.410> goal<00:00:09.590> for<00:00:09.950> our<00:00:10.010> time<00:00:10.519> here<00:00:10.700> in

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
I think the goal for our time here in

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.119 
I think the goal for our time here in
Austria<00:00:11.180> for<00:00:11.570> first<00:00:11.870> game<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.350> just<00:00:13.010> to

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.129 
Austria for first game is just to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.680 
Austria for first game is just to
obviously<00:00:13.670> get<00:00:14.059> used<00:00:14.269> to<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:14.450> time

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
obviously get used to the time

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.230 
obviously get used to the time
adjustment<00:00:15.200> and<00:00:15.350> I<00:00:15.620> think<00:00:16.070> just<00:00:16.250> to<00:00:16.340> kind<00:00:17.150> of

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
adjustment and I think just to kind of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.600 
adjustment and I think just to kind of
rest<00:00:17.509> a<00:00:17.689> little<00:00:17.779> bit<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:18.320> that<00:00:18.349> we<00:00:18.860> have<00:00:19.340> so

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
rest a little bit so that we have so

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.429 
rest a little bit so that we have so
much<00:00:19.730> energy<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.509> so<00:00:20.540> much<00:00:20.779> excitement<00:00:21.200> and

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
much energy and so much excitement and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.920 
much energy and so much excitement and
passion<00:00:21.590> for<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.430> whole<00:00:22.700> first<00:00:23.000> game<00:00:23.300> but<00:00:23.540> you

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
passion for the whole first game but you

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.529 
passion for the whole first game but you
know<00:00:24.019> our<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.260> six<00:00:24.590> game<00:00:24.740> because<00:00:25.279> um<00:00:25.640> it's<00:00:26.390> a

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
know our a six game because um it's a

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.660 
know our a six game because um it's a
long<00:00:26.750> road<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.560> lot<00:00:27.830> of<00:00:27.980> games<00:00:28.160> in<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.400> short

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
long road a lot of games in a short

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.029 
long road a lot of games in a short
amount<00:00:28.699> of<00:00:28.910> time<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.420> I<00:00:30.019> think<00:00:30.170> this<00:00:30.529> time<00:00:30.859> is

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
amount of time so I think this time is

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.810 
amount of time so I think this time is
just<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.400> kind<00:00:32.090> of<00:00:32.269> fine<00:00:33.019> tune<00:00:33.370> all<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.580> little

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
just a kind of fine tune all the little

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.390 
just a kind of fine tune all the little
things<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.480> just<00:00:35.930> feel<00:00:36.290> ready<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.620> prepared

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
things and just feel ready and prepared

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.950 
things and just feel ready and prepared
I<00:00:37.430> think<00:00:37.850> traveling<00:00:38.269> you<00:00:38.540> know<00:00:38.570> across<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
I think traveling you know across the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.200 
I think traveling you know across the
world<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.680> World<00:00:39.860> Cup<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.309> always<00:00:40.790> exciting

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
world the World Cup is always exciting

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.479 
world the World Cup is always exciting
just<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.350> know<00:00:42.440> going<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.770> different<00:00:43.070> country

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
just you know going to different country

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.310 
just you know going to different country
the<00:00:43.700> World<00:00:43.910> Cup<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.420> build-up<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.200> also

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
the World Cup the build-up but also

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.959 
the World Cup the build-up but also
there's<00:00:45.739> still<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:45.980> long<00:00:46.340> way<00:00:46.489> out<00:00:46.520> before<00:00:46.760> the

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
there's still a long way out before the

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.630 
there's still a long way out before the
games<00:00:47.149> happen<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.780> kind<00:00:47.960> of<00:00:48.020> have<00:00:48.170> that

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
games happen so you kind of have that

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.950 
games happen so you kind of have that
kind<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.730> almost<00:00:49.820> odd<00:00:50.090> in-between<00:00:50.570> period

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
kind of almost odd in-between period

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.720 
kind of almost odd in-between period
where<00:00:51.170> you're<00:00:51.469> getting<00:00:52.160> really<00:00:52.309> ready<00:00:52.610> but

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
where you're getting really ready but

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.220 
where you're getting really ready but
it's<00:00:53.090> not<00:00:53.180> quite<00:00:53.449> there<00:00:53.780> yet

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
it's not quite there yet

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.619 
it's not quite there yet
so<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.039> think<00:00:55.160> just<00:00:55.489> kind<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.820> in<00:00:56.420> that

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
so I think just kind of in that

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:35.940 
so I think just kind of in that
transition<00:00:57.170> period

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.250

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.550 

today<00:02:33.860> was<00:02:34.040> really<00:02:34.459> hard<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.690> think<00:02:36.019> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
today was really hard I think the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.670 
today was really hard I think the
combination<00:02:36.830> between<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:39.110> know<00:02:39.200> having<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
combination between you know having the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.830 
combination between you know having the
two<00:02:39.830> practices<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.970> was<00:02:41.090> really<00:02:41.360> cold<00:02:41.510> rainy

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
two practices it was really cold rainy

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.340 
two practices it was really cold rainy
outside<00:02:43.690> you're<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.840> really<00:02:44.959> hard<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.320> us

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
outside you're just really hard on us

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.830 
outside you're just really hard on us
but<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.950> think<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.190> was<00:02:46.280> good<00:02:46.459> kind<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.450> finally

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
but I think it was good kind of finally

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.140 
but I think it was good kind of finally
to<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.019> ever<00:02:48.230> went<00:02:48.440> together<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:50.030> had

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
to have ever went together so we had

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.759 
to have ever went together so we had
some<00:02:50.300> really<00:02:50.540> good<00:02:50.720> training<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.650> was

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
some really good training but it was

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.210 
some really good training but it was
definitely<00:02:52.040> difficult<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.580> think<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:53.090> have<00:02:54.220> one

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
definitely difficult I think we have one

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.860 
definitely difficult I think we have one
more<00:02:55.400> prep<00:02:55.760> game<00:02:56.030> coming<00:02:56.450> up

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
more prep game coming up

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
more prep game coming up
we're<00:02:57.230> playing<00:02:57.440> it's<00:02:57.620> Norway<00:02:58.040> pretty<00:02:58.280> soon

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
we're playing it's Norway pretty soon

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.729 
we're playing it's Norway pretty soon
and<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.950> think<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.310> would<00:03:01.489> be<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:02.060> last<00:03:02.739> kind

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
and I think that would be the last kind

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.470 
and I think that would be the last kind
of<00:03:03.920> send-off<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:05.630> know<00:03:05.750> going<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.080> woke<00:03:06.380> up<00:03:06.620> so
