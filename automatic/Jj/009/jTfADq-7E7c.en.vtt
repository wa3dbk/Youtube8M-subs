00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.900
 thank you store plug dot com for 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.360
 provided for review and accessory and 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.500
 so this will help us a set of lenses 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.690
 asino three in one in the set there are two 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.620
 lens one of which is disassembled on 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 two parts 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.989
 Also in the set there is a clip for mounting 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.720
 lenses and a carrying bag and so 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.970
 The first lens is fish with it 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.800
 we can take photos or videos 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:03.180
 significantly with a large angle of 180 degrees 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.770
 the picture will be like a fish's eye 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.500
 second lens as i said earlier 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.479
 consists of two parts if these parts 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.340
 will be together then get a lens with 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.740
 by which we can get 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.220
 picture with a wider angle but without 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.430
 distortions and if we spin 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.930
 these lenses are in two parts 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.229
 macro lens that will help us 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.210
