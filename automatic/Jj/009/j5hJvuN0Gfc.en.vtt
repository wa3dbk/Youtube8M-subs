because<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.700> would<00:03:43.120> do<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.329> same<00:03:43.540> thing<00:03:43.750> with

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
because I would do the same thing with

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.930 
because I would do the same thing with
just<00:03:44.200> an<00:03:44.320> individual<00:03:44.950> heat<00:03:45.190> protector<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.760> want

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
just an individual heat protector I want

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.520 
just an individual heat protector I want
to<00:03:46.030> make<00:03:46.180> sure<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.540> use<00:03:46.630> my<00:03:46.989> hands<00:03:47.380> and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
to make sure that I use my hands and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.920 
to make sure that I use my hands and
really<00:03:48.040> really<00:03:48.190> work<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:49.060> each<00:03:49.600> strand

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
really really work it in to each strand

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.199 
really really work it in to each strand
and<00:03:50.290> work<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.620> into<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.010> end<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.609> my<00:03:51.760> hair<00:03:51.970> as

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
and work it into the end of my hair as

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.120 
and work it into the end of my hair as
well<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.690> that's<00:03:53.170> why<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.380> kept<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:53.739> part<00:03:54.010> and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
well so that's why I kept this part and

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.680 
well so that's why I kept this part and
I<00:03:54.220> want<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.549> show<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.790> exactly<00:03:55.209> what<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.569> did

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.509 
I want to show you exactly what I did
and<00:03:56.109> more<00:03:56.319> importantly<00:03:56.769> emphasize<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
and more importantly emphasize the

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.370 
and more importantly emphasize the
importance<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.180> using<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.569> heat<00:03:58.810> protectant

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
importance of using a heat protectant

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.740 
importance of using a heat protectant
and<00:03:59.530> making<00:04:00.190> sure<00:04:00.370> it's<00:04:00.670> really<00:04:01.450> really

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
and making sure it's really really

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.970 
and making sure it's really really
penetrated<00:04:02.350> into<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> hair

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
penetrated into the hair

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.890 
penetrated into the hair
so<00:04:03.400> then<00:04:03.579> I<00:04:03.670> take<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:03.940> section<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.660> of

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
so then I take that section and of

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.900 
so then I take that section and of
course<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.319> make<00:04:05.500> smaller<00:04:05.829> sections<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.459> don't

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
course I make smaller sections you don't

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.000
