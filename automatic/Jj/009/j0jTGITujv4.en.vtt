00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 zuma and return 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.529
 hello hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.029
 a new video and it's fast the 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.040
 information is a very fast video the 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.480
 which I will surely do the gameplay 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.820
 when they are watching will be a 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.769
 Dallas Mavericks against Boston 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.230
 celtics because the news today has 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.329
 in these two teams I'm not the rondo 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.880
 is transferred to the dallas mavericks to 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.710
 change of jake crowder and elections 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.149
 tickets not and good some others 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.550
 supplements some other players 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.829
 but actually is information the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.110
 which is now being 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.510
 managing king honoring is the new 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.860
 player of the dallas mavericks the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.710
 information is not totally official 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.240
 but it seems already imminent in the absence of just 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.370
 that the Boston celtics of the dallas 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.710
 mavericks information and confirm 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.600
 in this news but good I already say from 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 this moment that the side reigned is the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.880
 new player player forgiveness of the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.730
 dallas mavericks and I really want to give 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.350
 my opinion about what has happened 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.900
 because the truth seems to me that this 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.550
 movement is perhaps the most bad thing that I've 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.049
 seen in a lot of time in the nba 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.580
 is trespassing to the third best for 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.840
 much better league base the better 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.170
 pure base if it is that 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.100
 that is to say the league in exchange for 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.750
 players which are not so good 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.049
 which can not perform as much as 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.109
 will the error is fully 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.090
 totally is great which is 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.920
 committing these boston celtics of jay 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.479
 cutler in the position of eaves having 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.360
 there in the end the truth that I think something 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.759
 totally ridiculous on the part of these 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.229
 Boston celtics and I do not know what will be 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.380
 thinking because I already believe that my 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.969
 reconstruction can be done and eye with 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.950
 many things which can be done 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.049
 a reconstruction which I wanted to 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.530
 it came from region stealing that 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.969
 then they spent lamarcus smart that is 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.200
 very rare movements which 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.189
 They are doing 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.390
 in the franchise pardon boston is very 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.879
 difficult to analyze what it is that you 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.429
 look today is from boston team 

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:00.020
 that all we know is what is not 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.090
 look what you do not look for is a championship 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.549
 of the nba because by these 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.110
 movements obviously no I do not think that 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.789
 have a team not even to be able to 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.049
 to enter a playoffs I think they have 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.569
 a team more back but now good 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.220
 positions in the draft nothing more than that 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.790
 is 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.620
 totally wrong this election and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.230
 that's like the main idea the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.030
 which one wants to give now the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.750
 Boston Celtics out there have maybe 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.790
 one of the worst rosters in the nba he 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 and it also reinforces that of the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.560
 dallas mavericks that are everything 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.540
 opposite a team that already serves them 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.640
 rolando to have a team totally 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.190
 solidified to even be champions 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.960
 right now believe me you are without a doubt 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.780
 some serious seriously serious 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.390
 candidate to be champion of the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.300
 nba it is very very rare that this team 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.340
 escape the possibility of reaching high 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.700
 in a bs conference which is 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.950
 totally shooting is not the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.680
 maximum four aces solis four aces 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.360
 good at a stay on conference 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.320
 walk 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.030
 jon walker laurie irvine and derick hulse 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.070
 these are the maximum base which 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.360
 there may be in a conference destinen 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.150
 the conference this I do not think there's 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.160
 team which has a bad foundation all 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.690
 team today from the conference of 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.060
 this is fine so right now if 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.640
 they are boston fan know they are coming 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.070
 difficult times but that at the end of the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.510
 path surely there is now a light 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.910
 remember that they are the team that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.170
 sometimes the nba has won I do not think everything 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.270
 be bad 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.640
 have marcuse smart can also 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.989
 serve a lot at this time but the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.340
 truth marcus smart has not yet 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.830
 demonstrated what the bacon has shown 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.200
 rondo this is the truth which can be 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.420
 say but good lack of confirmation 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.750
 but most likely and what already appears 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.940
 something which can not escape from anything 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.730
 is that the rondos will go to the dallas 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.190
 mavericks and this would be like everything in 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.830
 the video and already tomorrow or in two days 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.660
 different the following chapters of 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.180
 mike avilÃ©s may and have come loaded with 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.209
 everything in this small period of 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.319
 holidays and nothing you know I do not go to 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.940
 dallas rumor which explodes in a 99 90 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.260
 percent confirmed and good 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.400
 thank you very much for watching see you in 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.400
