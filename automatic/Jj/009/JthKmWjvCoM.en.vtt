 onion 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.540
 then you are going to use a tomato 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 complete the next thing you're going to use 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.890
 is going to be two cans of tuna in water 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.940
 you will also use a sauce of 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.980
 duck 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.080

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.940
 minutes 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.180
 or that since they have passed the 10 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.830
 minutes 5 minutes more or less nothing more 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.760
 to sauté the tuna or it has to be 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.150
