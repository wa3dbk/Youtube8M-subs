of course this gets really hot when the
cars<00:00:56.290> run<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.680> then<00:00:56.769> that's<00:00:56.920> where<00:00:57.070> most<00:00:57.220> of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
cars run and then that's where most of

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.670 
cars run and then that's where most of
the<00:00:57.489> smell<00:00:57.760> will<00:00:58.000> be<00:00:58.089> coming<00:00:58.420> from<00:00:58.600> now<00:00:59.530> in<00:00:59.619> the

back cover gasket inside here we gotta

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.359 
back cover gasket inside here we gotta
check<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.810> holy<00:01:10.990> intake<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.710> car<00:01:11.920> off<00:01:12.159> in

order to get to and change that back
asking<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.090> guess<00:01:16.390> q-tip<00:01:16.810> doesn't<00:01:17.170> cost

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
asking now I guess q-tip doesn't cost

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
place now here's a trick I learned years

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.200 
place now here's a trick I learned years
ago<00:01:49.540> get<00:01:49.870> a<00:01:49.900> pry<00:01:50.140> bar<00:01:50.340> put<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.430> on<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.640> metal<00:01:52.030> on

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
ago get a pry bar put it on the metal on

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.720 
ago get a pry bar put it on the metal on
the<00:01:52.840> head<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.380> then<00:01:53.710> under<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.340> valve<00:01:54.490> cover

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
the head and then under the valve cover

harder than this easily front side now
this<00:02:05.350> Lexus<00:02:05.770> gasket<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.370> great<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:07.120> got

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
this Lexus gasket is great it's got

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.240 
this Lexus gasket is great it's got
little<00:02:07.570> ribs<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:08.019> it<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.560> when<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:08.800> put<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.099> in

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
little ribs in it so when you put it in

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.670 
little ribs in it so when you put it in
place<00:02:09.489> it<00:02:10.060> actually<00:02:10.239> snaps<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:11.200> holds<00:02:11.440> itself

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
place it actually snaps and holds itself

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.699 
place it actually snaps and holds itself
in<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> when<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.659> put<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.930> back<00:02:14.019> together<00:02:14.230> you

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
in so when you put it back together you

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.289 
in so when you put it back together you
don't<00:02:15.099> need<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.250> put<00:02:15.370> any<00:02:15.549> glue<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.030> because

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
don't need to put any glue on it because

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.449 
don't need to put any glue on it because
it'll<00:02:16.480> stay<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:16.989> since<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.709> ridges<00:02:18.069> hold<00:02:18.310> it

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
it'll stay on since the ridges hold it

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.670 
it'll stay on since the ridges hold it
in<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.610> little<00:02:18.849> groove<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.379> cover<00:02:20.590> just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
in the little groove then the cover just

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.030 
in the little groove then the cover just
goes<00:02:20.980> back<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.519> get<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.330> little<00:02:22.630> push<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.200> then

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
goes back on get a little push and then

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.390 
goes back on get a little push and then

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
these don't cover bolts pretty much up

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.479 
these don't cover bolts pretty much up
stops<00:02:41.329> on<00:02:41.599> so<00:02:42.109> once<00:02:42.319> they<00:02:42.470> hit<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.769> metal<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
stops on so once they hit the metal you

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.490 
stops on so once they hit the metal you
can't<00:02:43.760> turn<00:02:43.970> them<00:02:44.150> any<00:02:44.269> more<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.959> just<00:02:44.989> get<00:02:45.290> my

millimeter<00:03:30.949> that's<00:03:31.280> almost<00:03:31.609> impossible<00:03:32.150> to

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
millimeter that's almost impossible to

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.449 
millimeter that's almost impossible to
get<00:03:32.389> to<00:03:32.569> so<00:03:33.079> I've<00:03:33.169> got<00:03:33.379> one<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.680> these<00:03:33.769> swivel

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
get to so I've got one of these swivel

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.449 
get to so I've got one of these swivel
head<00:03:34.609> sockets<00:03:35.299> that'll<00:03:35.750> help<00:03:35.870> take<00:03:36.079> it<00:03:36.139> off

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
head sockets that'll help take it off

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.309 
head sockets that'll help take it off
it's<00:03:37.459> invisible<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:38.120> see<00:03:38.449> inside<00:03:38.840> here<00:03:39.139> so

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
it's invisible to see inside here so

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.500 
it's invisible to see inside here so

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
first time I ever did one of these I had

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.729 
first time I ever did one of these I had
one<00:03:53.480> hell<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.900> time<00:03:54.049> trying<00:03:54.229> to<00:03:54.409> figure<00:03:54.680> out

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
one hell of a time trying to figure out

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.500 
one hell of a time trying to figure out
where<00:03:54.949> that<00:03:55.129> stuff<00:03:55.370> was<00:03:55.579> but<00:03:56.269> with<00:03:56.449> that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510

where that stuff was but with that
special<00:03:56.989> wrench<00:03:57.199> I<00:03:57.440> got<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:57.949> off<00:03:58.099> and<00:03:58.340> it's<00:03:58.430> not

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
special wrench I got it off and it's not

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.219 
special wrench I got it off and it's not
that<00:03:58.790> bad<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.209> really<00:03:59.239> need<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.959> wrench

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:00.229 
that bad you really need to get a wrench

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.530 
that bad you really need to get a wrench
like<00:04:00.409> that<00:04:00.650> thought<00:04:00.889> they<00:04:01.849> were<00:04:02.030> on<00:04:02.180> in<00:04:02.329> there

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
like that thought they were on in there

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.300 
like that thought they were on in there
you'll<00:04:02.659> see<00:04:02.810> there's<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.109> PCV<00:04:03.620> hose<00:04:03.650> we<00:04:04.099> have<00:04:04.190> to

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
you'll see there's a PCV hose we have to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.039 
you'll see there's a PCV hose we have to
pull<00:04:04.519> that<00:04:04.729> out<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.180> way<00:04:05.299> cuz<00:04:05.870> that's

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
pull that out of the way cuz that's

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.710 
pull that out of the way cuz that's
connected<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.739> intake<00:04:07.099> tube<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:07.720> we

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
connected to the intake tube then we

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.689 
connected to the intake tube then we
take<00:04:08.959> off<00:04:09.169> the<00:04:09.199> wiring<00:04:09.799> assembly<00:04:10.340> that's<00:04:10.549> in

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
take off the wiring assembly that's in

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.420 
take off the wiring assembly that's in
the<00:04:10.790> way<00:04:10.909> the<00:04:11.090> bolts<00:04:11.769> then<00:04:12.769> take<00:04:12.949> a<00:04:12.979> ball<00:04:13.250> to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
the way the bolts then take a ball to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.479 
the way the bolts then take a ball to
all<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.760> intake<00:04:14.090> manifold<00:04:14.629> on<00:04:15.190> then<00:04:16.190> we<00:04:16.310> pull

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
all the intake manifold on then we pull

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.800 
all the intake manifold on then we pull
the<00:04:16.609> attack<00:04:16.909> manifold<00:04:17.329> out<00:04:17.570> of<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.750> way<00:04:19.810> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
the attack manifold out of the way and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.899 
the attack manifold out of the way and
we<00:04:20.959> can<00:04:21.109> finally<00:04:21.349> access<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.159> bolts<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.699> take

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
we can finally access the bolts to take

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.480 
we can finally access the bolts to take
the<00:04:23.060> cover<00:04:23.240> off<00:04:23.389> just<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:23.990> front<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:25.220> pry

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
the cover off just like a front you pry

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.450 
the cover off just like a front you pry
it<00:04:25.550> off<00:04:25.729> just<00:04:26.030> like<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.360> other<00:04:26.479> one<00:04:27.340> then<00:04:28.340> we

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
it off just like the other one then we

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.250 
it off just like the other one then we
got<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.820> off<00:04:29.000> we<00:04:29.270> put<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.539> new<00:04:29.659> gasket<00:04:29.690> on

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
got that off we put the new gasket on

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.100 
got that off we put the new gasket on
the<00:04:30.289> other<00:04:30.590> side<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:32.030> if<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.240> notice<00:04:32.659> this

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
the other side and if you notice this

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.899 
the other side and if you notice this
one<00:04:33.169> is<00:04:33.500> blue<00:04:33.710> because<00:04:34.159> it's<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.700> special

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
one is blue because it's a special

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.330 
one is blue because it's a special
silicone<00:04:35.360> gasket<00:04:35.840> since<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.770> one's<00:04:36.979> so<00:04:37.130> hard

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
silicone gasket since that one's so hard

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.920 
silicone gasket since that one's so hard
to<00:04:37.460> get<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.880> replacement<00:04:38.450> one<00:04:38.570> is

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
to get to the replacement one is

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.249 
to get to the replacement one is
our<00:04:39.050> quality<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:40.039> we'll<00:04:40.340> leak<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.789> fast<00:04:41.259> then

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
our quality so we'll leak is fast then

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.320 
our quality so we'll leak is fast then
of<00:04:42.350> course<00:04:42.560> we<00:04:43.100> bolt<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.460> all<00:04:43.580> back<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:44.000> like

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
of course we bolt it all back on like

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.150 
of course we bolt it all back on like
the<00:04:44.449> other<00:04:44.630> side<00:04:44.930> but<00:04:45.560> I'm<00:04:45.650> not<00:04:45.740> gonna<00:04:45.889> film

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
the other side but I'm not gonna film

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.620 
the other side but I'm not gonna film
all<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.520> because<00:04:46.789> I<00:04:46.910> really<00:04:47.150> show<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.449> front

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
all that because I really show the front

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.960 
all that because I really show the front
one<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.990> would<00:04:48.080> be<00:04:48.199> too<00:04:48.350> boring<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.970> it's

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
one it would be too boring and it's

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.909 
one it would be too boring and it's
getting<00:04:50.270> ready<00:04:50.360> for<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.690> spring<00:04:51.020> storm<00:04:51.380> here<00:04:51.740> so
