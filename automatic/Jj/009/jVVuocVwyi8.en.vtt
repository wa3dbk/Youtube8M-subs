00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
can cut back some of the suckers let air

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650 
can cut back some of the suckers let air
circulate<00:00:35.219> throw<00:00:36.000> them<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.450> makes

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
circulate throw them and it just makes

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.910 
circulate throw them and it just makes
for<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.989> healthier<00:00:37.410> tomato

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
for a healthier tomato

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.100 
for a healthier tomato
if<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.850> don't<00:00:39.090> prune<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
if you don't prune them this is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.389 
if you don't prune them this is
basically<00:00:40.649> what's<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> happen<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
basically what's going to happen you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.459 
basically what's going to happen you
just<00:00:41.640> could<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.790> tomatoes<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.750> sprawl<00:00:43.200> all

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
just could have tomatoes that sprawl all

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.750 
just could have tomatoes that sprawl all
over<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:43.980> garden<00:00:44.129> beds

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
over your garden beds

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.580 
over your garden beds
wherever<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> main<00:00:45.510> vines<00:00:45.809> touch<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.559> earth

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
wherever the main vines touch the earth

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190 
wherever the main vines touch the earth
they<00:00:47.070> usually<00:00:47.280> root<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.390> will<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.750> Tomatoes

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
they usually root you will get Tomatoes

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500 
they usually root you will get Tomatoes
but<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.710> becomes<00:00:50.160> sort<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> overgrown

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
but it just becomes sort of overgrown

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.110 
but it just becomes sort of overgrown
and<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.989> hard<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> manage<00:00:52.789> I'm<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and it is hard to manage I'm going to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
and it is hard to manage I'm going to
show<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.079> stick<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.920> how

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
show you how you stick them up and how

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.150 
show you how you stick them up and how
you<00:00:56.460> tie<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> post<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.129> stake<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you tie them to the post you stake a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.910 
you tie them to the post you stake a
tomato<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> manage<00:01:00.390> its<00:01:00.570> growth<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.170> there's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
tomato to manage its growth and there's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.399 
tomato to manage its growth and there's
a<00:01:01.980> couple<00:01:02.129> ways<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.270> use

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
a couple ways you can do it you can use

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.020 
a couple ways you can do it you can use
tomato<00:01:04.409> cages<00:01:04.769> that's<00:01:05.460> great<00:01:05.760> when<00:01:05.909> your

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
tomato cages that's great when your

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
tomato cages that's great when your
tomatoes<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.540> starting<00:01:06.960> off<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.470> you're

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
tomatoes are starting off and if you're

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.310 
tomatoes are starting off and if you're
growing<00:01:08.119> indeterminate<00:01:09.119> tomatoes<00:01:09.570> usually

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
growing indeterminate tomatoes usually

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
growing indeterminate tomatoes usually
you<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.650> also<00:01:10.740> put<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> stake<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you have to also put a stake in to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.350 
you have to also put a stake in to
secure<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.780> tomato<00:01:13.140> cage<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
secure that tomato cage to it so that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420 
secure that tomato cage to it so that
the<00:01:15.600> heavy<00:01:16.049> tomato<00:01:16.380> doesn't<00:01:16.590> topple<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.130> over

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the heavy tomato doesn't topple it over

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.050 
the heavy tomato doesn't topple it over
I<00:01:17.549> usually<00:01:18.240> stake<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:20.250> couple<00:01:20.759> different

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
I usually stake in a couple different

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.850 
I usually stake in a couple different
ways<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:21.960> Tomatoes<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.619> getting

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
ways when your Tomatoes are just getting

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.280 
ways when your Tomatoes are just getting
started<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.460> these<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.720> use<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
started like these you can use just a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.590 
started like these you can use just a
bamboo<00:01:25.740> pole<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.729> sink<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
bamboo pole like this and sink it in the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
bamboo pole like this and sink it in the
ground<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.340> maybe<00:01:29.520> two

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
ground and it's I don't know maybe two

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
ground and it's I don't know maybe two
and<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> half<00:01:30.329> three<00:01:30.509> feet<00:01:30.810> tall<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:32.009> won't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and a half three feet tall that won't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.149 
and a half three feet tall that won't
support<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.970> fully<00:01:33.900> grown<00:01:34.170> indeterminate

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
support a fully grown indeterminate

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.940 
support a fully grown indeterminate
tomato<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:37.020> starting<00:01:37.439> point<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
tomato but it's the starting point and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.719 
tomato but it's the starting point and
you<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.790> me<00:01:38.970> lift<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.360> plant<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.729> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
tomato by using something thin and they

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.389 
tomato by using something thin and they
like<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.750> use<00:01:54.780> towels<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.590> rags<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.250> like

like to use towels or rags that are like
1/2<00:01:56.700> an<00:01:56.850> inch<00:01:56.939> wide<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.450> feel<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.439> just

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
1/2 an inch wide and feel that it just

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.050 
1/2 an inch wide and feel that it just
more<00:01:59.969> gently<00:02:00.540> ties<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.649> tomato<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.790> stake

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
more gently ties the tomato to the stake

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 
more gently ties the tomato to the stake
I<00:02:03.270> find<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.719> jute<00:02:04.049> works<00:02:04.290> perfectly<00:02:04.740> fine

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
I find that jute works perfectly fine

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.910 
I find that jute works perfectly fine
what<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.729> want<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> gap

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
what you want to do is just have a gap

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.830 
what you want to do is just have a gap
in<00:02:08.099> there<00:02:08.250> between<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.849> tomato<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
in there between the tomato and the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.570 
in there between the tomato and the
stake<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> state<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.099> still<00:02:11.310> grow

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
stake so that the state can still grow

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.670 
stake so that the state can still grow
that<00:02:12.030> there's<00:02:12.270> some<00:02:12.420> room<00:02:12.599> for<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.110> move

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that there's some room for it to move

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.530 
that there's some room for it to move
and<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.069> string<00:02:14.400> if<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.939> do<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.269> won't

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and the string if you do that won't

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.360 
and the string if you do that won't
really<00:02:15.870> rub<00:02:16.109> through<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:16.620> cut<00:02:17.040> into<00:02:17.280> your

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
really rub through and cut into your

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.140 
really rub through and cut into your
tomato<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.209> also<00:02:18.390> want<00:02:18.719> to<00:02:18.780> make<00:02:18.959> sure<00:02:20.150> you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
tomato you also want to make sure you

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.410 
tomato you also want to make sure you
put<00:02:21.420> enough<00:02:21.450> ties<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.829> tomato<00:02:23.159> so<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
put enough ties in the tomato so that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.959 
put enough ties in the tomato so that
the<00:02:24.689> weight<00:02:24.900> isn't<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.859> one<00:02:26.280> kind<00:02:26.909> of

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
the weight isn't just on one kind of

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.670 
the weight isn't just on one kind of
pressure<00:02:27.150> point<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:27.989> put<00:02:28.260> another<00:02:28.439> one<00:02:28.650> up

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
pressure point so you put another one up

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.429 
pressure point so you put another one up
a<00:02:29.040> couple<00:02:29.790> inches<00:02:30.000> higher<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:33.290> tie<00:02:34.290> your

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
a couple inches higher and tie your

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:40.190 
a couple inches higher and tie your
tomato<00:02:34.769> off<00:02:35.989> like<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:39.420> that's<00:02:39.930> all<00:02:40.079> you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
tomato off like that and that's all you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.360 
tomato off like that and that's all you
need<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.829> start<00:02:41.810> training<00:02:42.810> your<00:02:42.959> tomato

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
need to do to start training your tomato

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.090 
need to do to start training your tomato
so<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.519> can<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.879> this

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.460 

so<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:51.090> two<00:02:51.480> points<00:02:51.870> where<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.020> tied<00:02:52.320> it

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so you have two points where you tied it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.380 
so you have two points where you tied it
off<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.040> support<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.520> tomato<00:02:53.820> now

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
off and that will support the tomato now

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.150 
off and that will support the tomato now
these<00:02:54.570> Tomatoes<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.470> might<00:02:55.620> notice<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.130> a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
these Tomatoes you might notice have a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.890 
these Tomatoes you might notice have a
lot<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.520> suckers<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:57.060> them<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.600> haven't

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
lot of suckers in them that I haven't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.140 
lot of suckers in them that I haven't
removed<00:02:58.260> these<00:02:58.560> are<00:02:58.710> my<00:02:58.940> Tomatoes<00:02:59.940> well

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
removed these are my Tomatoes well

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.170 
removed these are my Tomatoes well
actually<00:03:00.600> all<00:03:00.720> my<00:03:00.870> garden<00:03:01.380> was<00:03:01.710> hit<00:03:02.190> by<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> late

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
actually all my garden was hit by a late

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.850 
actually all my garden was hit by a late
frost<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.050> letting<00:03:04.260> these<00:03:04.500> grow<00:03:04.830> a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
frost so I'm just letting these grow a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.130 
frost so I'm just letting these grow a
little<00:03:05.070> bit<00:03:05.190> more<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.270> will<00:03:06.330> prune<00:03:06.750> some<00:03:06.990> of

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
little bit more and I will prune some of

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.730 
little bit more and I will prune some of
this<00:03:07.230> out<00:03:08.300> one<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.560> reason<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.590> you

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
this out one of the reason that you

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.380 
this out one of the reason that you
stake<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> tomato<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.610> because<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.120> want<00:03:12.330> to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
stake a tomato is because you want to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.030 
stake a tomato is because you want to
manage<00:03:12.720> its<00:03:12.900> growth<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.440> don't<00:03:13.470> want<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
manage its growth you don't want the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.550 
manage its growth you don't want the
vine<00:03:14.220> sprawling<00:03:14.700> all<00:03:14.940> over<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.360> ground<00:03:15.660> where

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
vine sprawling all over the ground where

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.610 
vine sprawling all over the ground where
it<00:03:16.830> can<00:03:17.040> pick<00:03:17.070> up<00:03:17.340> diseases<00:03:17.880> from<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> soil

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
it can pick up diseases from the soil

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.410 
it can pick up diseases from the soil
block<00:03:19.620> other<00:03:20.010> Tomatoes<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:20.880> block<00:03:21.180> other

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
block other Tomatoes out block other

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.140 
block other Tomatoes out block other
vegetables<00:03:21.930> out<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.740> just<00:03:22.770> grow<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.310> you

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
vegetables out and you just grow it you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.330 
vegetables out and you just grow it you
know<00:03:24.270> vertically<00:03:24.900> up<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.200> stake<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:26.100> this

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
know vertically up a stake now this

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.140 
know vertically up a stake now this
stake<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.210> said<00:03:27.390> isn't<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:27.990> to<00:03:28.170> hold<00:03:29.150> this

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
stake as I said isn't going to hold this

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.730 
stake as I said isn't going to hold this
tomato<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.660> what<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> do<00:03:30.960> is<00:03:31.260> then<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:31.710> a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
tomato so what I do is then I get a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.670 
tomato so what I do is then I get a
stronger<00:03:32.550> stake<00:03:33.240> this<00:03:33.480> one<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.230> can't<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.650> on

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
stronger stake this one you can't see on

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.260 
stronger stake this one you can't see on
camera<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.340> little<00:03:35.610> bit<00:03:35.700> taller<00:03:35.910> than

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
camera but is a little bit taller than

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.720 
camera but is a little bit taller than
the<00:03:37.170> bamboo<00:03:37.800> stake<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.340> what<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.360> do<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:40.730> I'll

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
the bamboo stake and what I do is I'll

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.670 
the bamboo stake and what I do is I'll
tie<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.030> tomato<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.990> grows<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.500> both

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
tie the tomato as it grows to both

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.090 
tie the tomato as it grows to both
stakes<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:45.810> will<00:03:45.990> tie<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.230> stakes<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.980> each

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
stakes and I will tie the stakes to each

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.310 
stakes and I will tie the stakes to each
other<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.580> that<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.880> provides<00:03:48.320> extra

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
other and that just provides extra

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.260 
other and that just provides extra

tall<00:04:40.750> tomato<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:41.680> would<00:04:41.890> also<00:04:42.040> get

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
tall tomato and that would also get

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.820 
tall tomato and that would also get
secured<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:42.910> here<00:04:43.150> but<00:04:43.840> now<00:04:44.140> I<00:04:44.170> have<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.560> extra

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830

the smaller stakes get tied together

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.580 
the smaller stakes get tied together
right<00:04:53.440> there<00:04:53.710> then<00:04:54.700> they<00:04:55.300> get<00:04:55.510> tied<00:04:55.780> off<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.230> a
