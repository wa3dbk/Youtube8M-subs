00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.840
 I thought so because I was asked if 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.870
 I'm a bit of a tutorial 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.759
 How can I make my hair so high 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 The bandana should actually be watching 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.600
 and I first thought it's pretty 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 pointless then to a higher that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.810
 because it is totally easy but 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.750
 sometimes the simplest things are here 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.580
 the ones you get the hardest 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.369
 do you understand me in any case show 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.760
 I like you my husband 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.350
 your fest is much fun as 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.969
 Of course you do it first 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 hair together 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.329
 depending on how you want it you can 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.059
 just i would take her right up there 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 tie together 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.879
 you can also wear them open and that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.530
 to make a purse I like to do it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.120
 this pressure and I wear the bandana 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.280
 or cloth usually only 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.289
 otherwise we would have all the extensions 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 everything i think is coming up 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.489
 sideways a bit the extensions 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.449
 out so that one does not wear them I 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.299
 just a cloth a bandana is easy 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.439
 only a rectangular cloth with 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.689
 different patterns 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.729
 Classically, it is this squiggly 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.290
 if your muscles do not know if it is 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.479
 mainz has a name now 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 something in drackenstein anger like 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.580
 Shrunken heads stuttgart for a few 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.130
 Skulls and a few skulls 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.680
 bones are right here once 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 a corner in this is a bit 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.100
 over which passes with and the other 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:39.390
 corner exactly so that here, so to speak 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.130
 Here is how such a long cloth completes 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.460
 relatively wide 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.979
 I then usually go in again 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.189
 because it does not want to go that far 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.750
 it folds up to the middle back again 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.170
 and then the other side as well 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.170
 to the middle and thus we have 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.979
 a folded cloth a bit something like 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.270
 a tie and about the width 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.520
 Of course you can vary that already 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.020
 depending on how you want it if you want it 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.899
 you also want to be able to do that more directly 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.940
 So take the cloth and stick to it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.010
 make or you can not quite get that far 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.450
 collapse that really leave you 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.430
 above all, a little bit of attention comes to one 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.750
 I believe in a head shape so I believe 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.700
 with every head shape you have to be a bit 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.840
 keep that up for the first time 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.470
 maybe a bit more in 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.910
 try 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.910
 I take that now 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.489
 Next, you take your own 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.140
 folded cloth that is now the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.329
 outside to see the quasi down here 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:44.049
 is and that the inside is the quasi 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:46.780
 Folded up here is difficult me 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.790
 just take my towel here 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:56.170
 below 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:03:01.989
 if he firmly and put it to first 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.060
 head around then this is so here 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.639
 Drews is a bit away 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.319
 once that it is straight and is 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.500
 usually once here 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:15.450
 on the other side just once a 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.450
 turned that it fits tight here 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.519
 and then you just do it like at 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.739
 shoes bind a little sand first 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.359
 only 1 and then you look in the mirror like 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.400
 sits one can of course members 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.669
 make the grind or lateral 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.709
 I usually have it on the right side 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.599
 you limp again and watch out 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.699
 and if everything is ok you do it 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.590
 his second grind and that was it 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.060
 with me already with me it is real 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.859
 relatively simple I do not know exactly 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.690
 my head shape is but I have to 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:54.010
 mooring cling nothing 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.690
 if if you actively relatively flat 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.840
 So have your bones behind you 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.680
 So we need this apartment is the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.949
 Right this way 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.609
 Here he is considered high and the head goes 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:08.500
 you call out and so on and this one here 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.269
 make man oxy vitalis behind the head 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.310
 and if it's cracking then it can be 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.930
 that it constantly seeks to slip up 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.209
 then just take some bobby 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.159
 pins so a few small h clamp and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.409
 one goes from below into the hairline 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:22.720
 be that they are in here then 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.289
 the other side should be here once and 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.760
 but then it should last 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.979
 I usually know it that way in the beginning 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.810
 over the order the band but over the 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.099
 even behind the ears that day 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.360
 Not that bad because I got that 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.260
 not so prominent ears or I have 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.770
 protruding ears 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.080
 I'm not so 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.879
 that's about it that was the whole thing 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.210
 magic and put it is really simple 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:50.129
 i might like that attitude as well 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.900
 how to fold the cloth maybe 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.120
 it is very important is yes 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.550
 different methods maybe times 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.020
 that is faster or whatever it is 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.090
 I came to fold very differently 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.009
 But I think with this method super 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.860
 it is beautiful, it is uniform 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:11.220
 evenly the ducks are beautiful 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:13.259
 pointed one can already knot exactly me 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.199
 Today I have my first tutorial 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.789
 So please, as I said so far not 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.759
 so special 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.080
 but maybe because of what I am 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.789
 I would be very happy if micha boni 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.199

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.630
 if you 're pretty boring and 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.610
 also meaningless flag then gives me thumbs 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.430
 she is then down in the ratings 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.539
