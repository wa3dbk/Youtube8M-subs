00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.340
 a 100 pizzas we had to fight 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.200
 us out pizzas and that can today 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.880
 definitely be fun because 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
 We also have some special skills 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.230
 have and so and yes before that here now 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.880
 but the whole thing starts 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.699
 make an announcement very shortly 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.020
 and that will take place today at 16 o'clock 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.090
 a live stream is taking place 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.650
 So I thought I would come 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.510
 once again a stream is played like 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.810
 always of course minecraft pvp and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.030
 minigames and maybe later too 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.390
 something else on your force server 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.340
 So as I like to look over and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 yes as I said stream will stop and 16 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.489
 clock in Schlink is in the video 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.760
 description to find 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 and yes I would be very happy if you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.579
 would drop by and then I would 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.629
 we'll just see you soon 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.629
 the round to the same 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.710
 we are already there again 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.390
 to end round pizzas letter and yes how 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.500
 said the special is just stop 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.150
 this letter version 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.510
 That's these blocks you give 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.830
 can break down and yes if you have this 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 block degrades you get one 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.190
 special effect for example such a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.900
 jump effect or something but somehow 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.760
 I always have this when I have this 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.530
 Take the green block here, for example 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.030
 because that is such a jump effect 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.680
 then I always stop taking it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.070
 I do not know what that is either 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 here 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 dg bank okay the pig dog understand 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 I'm not so easy 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.270
 walking around is announced and the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.740
 other people should intercept the types 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.300
 Here we get the name we get 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.399
 it is not clear in any case 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.690
 and so we look, I think so 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.920
 is so synonymous a small round because 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.390
 I 'll be back in the morning 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.210
 So I have to go right back 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.830
 In any case, school has been running 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.270
 three hours and well, we still look 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.500
 that maybe others will get here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.119
 many people are still alive 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.710
 We can read that in the scoreboard 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.720
 also get out of the ambush or 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.659
 but I do not see anything the olives are 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.130
 not tasty enough here is die 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.439
 clean desktop runs so the red ones are 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 always very short, therefore, must 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.610
 i take care that i dont go directly to 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.400
 at the beginning dying because otherwise the rounds still 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.019
 shorter than they already are me 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.280
 just do not see anything I have so much 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.920
 I'm fat as a pizza 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.480
 piece of shit 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.940
 okay okay now we can finally 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.209
 see again and potato for die 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.260
 okay that died 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.549
 Let's eat here first 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.660
 Fully that is correct in any case 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.820
 I'll take good care of it like 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.560
 said I take as the other effect 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.970
 now simply not even because I 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.570
 somehow then always die when I see her 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.230
 take 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.090
 okay that also watched down 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.860
 In any case , we have to be careful here 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.340
 should type that comes now but he will 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.769
 to die 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.180
 He does not want to take us away with us 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.380
 We do not have colleagues with us 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.560
 now also wiped away 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.470
 yes and there too okay now now 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.440
 through now through 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.000
 and sport that were creeper crass that 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.680
 in any case, so who is also 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 flying down will be among them 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.570
 her under with her and he is also under 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.650
 flown 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.540
 okay and we are heldt is dead 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.640
 bribery like not sometimes you die 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.350
 here just so pointless where is the sense 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.480
 I do not understand it 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.640
 I do not understand it if you tell me that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.420
 somehow people can explain what we do 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.830
 definitely cool 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.450
 That's why I want to say the round was like that 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.860
 In a word, we are hanging on very small ones 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.500
 then we'll see you soon 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.180
 Again, there we are again 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.530
 back in the second round and now 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.750
 we will even try to reel 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.820
 shaving i understand somehow 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.560
 not why I have only one heart 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.690
 and the others somehow 10,000 pieces 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.310
 they can die continuously 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.140
 the yog that no i die once 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.209
 Dirt is my playing but ok 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.800
 we have to look that's how it is 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.940
 We also get the company in life 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.840
 so that he did not expect the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.490
 Schlawiner here 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.290
 and as I said I think the game has 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.970
 just pretty cool by that 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.959
 These special skills exist and 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.850
 the beating here goes down the new and 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.450
 already we are out of there as fast can do it 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.920
 go 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.260
 the round but still too short 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.720
 so still go for a round and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.730
 to the same and can be found here also again 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.959
 the last round peters letter because us 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.459
 yes just the type but again one 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.380
 dashed through the bill 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.920
 and well let's see if we something 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.630
 create 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.070
 as I said you can probably 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.900
 seeing a length is the longest today 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.169
 video is simply just another one 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.830
 I'll say a little new gas game 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.510
 my channel 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.790
 I thought of the change 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.400
 once that suits and then I take that 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.690
 everything just once but as I said 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.490
 I will not do that either now 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.590
 somehow often brings you but her 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.729
 want to see that so often you see 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.290
 can write here in the combo 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.610
 if you want but I think so 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.200
 demand will not be so great so 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.030
 I leave that with the frequent 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.919
 bring pizzas letter probably 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.840
 but good that should not be the topic 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.790
 you can still be at 16 o'clock today 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.419
 stop by the livestream if you like 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.669
 want 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.010
 there we will just minecraft pc 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.979
 play and i understand this game 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.200
 not i just dying so i believe 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.070
 just uninterrupted so the game 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.080
 I really like format 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.940
 but somehow I do not understand that 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.490
 quite why am I always the can 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.410
 I do not explain that is the pizza 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.750
 poisoned the shit that tastes like that 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.640
 I vomit and just die 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.210
 or no idea i can not 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.430
 to explain 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.140
 anyway, what I can explain to myself is 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.880
 that she will definitely follow 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.470
 It is over and I will be happy 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.640
 if you despite the positive rating 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.040
 could leave behind 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.780
 and yes, if you are on the livestream 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.520
 Of course you are welcome too 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.440
 like to leave a review as I said 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.820
 Today at 16 o'clock kicking is in the 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.400
 description and will be here again

 we show pvp and minigames 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.020
 will gamble with you and otherwise yes 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.730
 maybe a little yours 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.350
 but that's what it was supposed to be 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.350
 lets stay there and chih people
