 special that you're going to enjoy right 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 Tomorrow, you should take note of the RPG 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.750
 but let's talk about it then . 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 Today's video is similar to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.039
 subject of yesterday's video is who you see 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.690
 the video you're learned yesterday brought 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.850
 a video talking a little about the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 dynamic mapping which is one of the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.629
 local news sheltered others will 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.579
 to play in multiplayer mode is through 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.960
 of some interviews given to sites 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.309
 and gringas magazines 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.110
 we can get some ideas from 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.580
 How best is this map going to work? 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.229
 dynamic in another video of yesterday giving 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.340
 my opinion by saying a little about the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 what I thought about what he could 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.479
 I expect a certain number today, too. 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.760
 address a subject that we have discovered 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.650
 through interviews was actually 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.020
 through the same interview you have 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.049
 yesterday that joe I'll have the deal 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 animation leader of infinity ward gave 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.729
 for official playstation magazine and the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 This is the topic we 're going to talk about. 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 about the new ending 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 Okay, you know the couple fought each other. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 no one is 9 so he is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.350
 I'll see you said a little about this 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.400
 change and it was not revealed that in fact 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.409
 true even the indy is the same as what 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 We 've already seen it and all the latest 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.860
 copper years 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.149
 but in a gigantic improved form 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 of the sheet say they can already 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.610
 consider as a new engine or 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.969
 it's the same engine I already suspected 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.860
 A lot of this because it gives you 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.750
 to realize you know you realize by 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.020
 for a short time - or at least 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.060
 less expensive some is some it 's kind I know 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.280
 there but you know in day understood 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.300
 so for March to be changed I know I have 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.649
 sure that a lot of you too 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.690
 They got the impression through 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.600
 rails that they revealed that it was 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.610
 even in 2011 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.260
 much improved form is something I 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.690
 I realized that it was also clear that they 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.060
 They not exchanged and it made me a little 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.230
 yes it was the question of the wives and must have 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.250
 perceived that some moments of some 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.380
 explosions 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.270
 the explosions appeared to be identical with 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.610
 explosions that we have today 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.870
 hence in the current calculations did not disappoint 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.060
 rather they will have to improve this 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.680
 I do not have the slightest idea either. 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.970
 how hard it must be for them 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.470
 change it will be there I think it should 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.840
 have tried to give a little effort 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.930
 and in doing so will strive for a 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.870
 little at this point but ultimately bind in 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.250
 that the statement is not the flight and 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.600
 the official playstation magazine itself 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.010
 just open quotation marks 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.660
 when we 're talking about a 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.880
 new engine we're talking about 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.440
 significant improvements in 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.720
 of the one in me 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.250
 we are not talking about throwing everything 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.650
 out and saying that people are 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.540
 starting from scratch again does not close quotes 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.030
 what happens 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.470
 the indy in the same cordel why the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.270
 gameplay I think it will continue very 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.010
 very much like what people 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.780
 have on the current consoles and do not 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.870
 Just understand this, this is so much for me. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.880
 Good, and I like it, you understand, it's us. 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.500
 will have great improvements 5 will have the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.610
 better physics better graphics 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.310
 I believe things like that. 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.200
 certain is is going to be very similar to 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.640
 broth that we currently have is that 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.470
 I now want to put some 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.590
 some points on the agenda here for 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.900
 You certain first I do not care. 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.210
 with graphic improvement not having been 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.890
 big is for me broth and never was nor 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.780
 will never be based on graphics for 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.200
 my cause has the best gameplay 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.120
 from an fps I played in ve 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.580
 me the main decod I think is the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.740
 which attracts so many fans every day and I 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.830
 I also think that the real fans are the 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.720
 real fans and not like in the game right 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.730
 changing it for me is the main one is 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.800
 way it will not change right then it will not 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.270
 It does not matter to me if the club will have 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.680
 a big graphic improvement is not stupid 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.720
 I never wanted to and I do not want him to have 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.430
 battlefield level graph by 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.520
 example to me it does not fit it would not stay 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.770
 cool understand whatever is to have a 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.850
 nice graphic of that beginning with 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.610
 a slightly more caught gameplay 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.620
 a little more is that you know you do not 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.150
 had that fluidity at the time the player 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.590
 quality I preferred to continue the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.030
 the way they are, they can improve 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.910
 graphic understood 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.560
 Another thing is I think this time as 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.370
 now we have new consoles with 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.870
 potential 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.500
 now they could finally make a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.760
 engine that really is 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.500
 had a significant change because 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.729
 are calling 9mm and it really goes 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.400
 have a very big change in 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.650
 comparison with hygiene is with 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.260
 situation in India's current reality. 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.910
 is in box 2 today for example understood 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.470
 I think now they can change a lot 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.270
 thing can really improve the part 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.710
 can really improve this 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.000
 structure knows these things all is 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.979
 lighting because now the new 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.889
 consoles have a much greater capacity to 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.870
 It's not accepting that the consoles 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.580
 Current perhaps do not know but there 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.470
 suddenly not worth it to him 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.120
 to improve so much that they are going to 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.280
 have stagnates in certain points and 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.900
 now maybe they might be advancing 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.910
 a little more and the third Portuguese 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.160
 also has to emphasize that this game 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.539
 fell a game of cross generation or 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.850
 a game that will come out for two generations 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.580
 different from the seventh and eighth islands 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.889
 so they could not create a 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.449
 entirely new India that was not 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.130
 supported on the current consoles because 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.780
 whether or not you want a large 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.669
 their sales will still be in the seventh 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.289
 No one will buy because they have 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.120
 a lot of people are going to buy new 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.280
 will compare the number of people who 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.840
 will buy the new consoles already in 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.180
 budget with the number of people already 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.340
 have the current islands do not know that much 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.800
 People will only buy the ps4 xbox ball 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.620
 for 2014 sometimes until 2015 I do not know 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.360
 so a lot of people the vast majority 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.700
 great majority will not even play the 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.139
 Heat of the new generation's goals is still 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.599
 most likely the vast majority will 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.940
 start playing the new urine cup 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.400
 generation only next year is that it should be 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.470
 the next-generation treyarch club there 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.199
 Yes, you should not go out to 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.250
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 will depend 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.539
 much of how the market will be 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.220
 in that moment we have as 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.380
 to prevent it gives the environment that a 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.440
 failure in sales the price of the consoles is 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.360
 very high, but let's suppose that in the 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.310
 next year because of the pain coming out 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.199
 only for the eighth generation, there it is 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.240
 It is possible that we may have a 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.389
 change of indie or better 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.590
 and not that now is not the 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.300
 really better in the charts yet 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.470
 one more significant improvement still 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.990
 that can go further 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.150
 understood, it's just you take as an example there 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.650
 also the jacket 23 of the safe 3 was a 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.570
 code that came out for two generations of 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.610
 his practice and for the seventh generation of 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.469
 consoles and the graphic difference of the club 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.280
 did because of four that left only 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:42.200
 in current code generation 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.970
 the first model only appears in xbox 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.610
 360 and ps3 did not leave 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.620
 the ps2 xbox these things so you see the 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.720
 graphic difference was gigantic and is 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.370
 The same engine understood was from the 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.350
 four club that we had the standard 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.940
 graph which life went on 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.860
 seventh generation of consoles you take 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.260
 also compares the value of 44 black ops 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.480
 two the gigantic graphic difference 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.300
 also the gigantic even then I go 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.950
 over the years I ascended to me this new 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.840
 in quotation marks that the goal box is 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.370
 adopting will be very professional to 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.650
 You will have the grace of getting better 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.240
 and from that year's code here the boy 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.470
 He called the cut next year to 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.480
 people will probably make a difference 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.919
 very big because it puts it like I said 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.169
 I believe it happens next year. 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.450
 go out only for the new generation they will 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:25.190
 really delve into everything they 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.360
 Get a new engine and then 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.880
 how were the years we spent 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.590
 will have something better right but more 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.780
 there then that's it wanted to bring today 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.340
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.750
 comment below you think about 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.460

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.530
 about the maps gives us there was fine 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.330
 cool to gameplay was also so more 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.500
 Easy, I know you like it. 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.300
 gameplay of the game is a little strange 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.190
 appear on the channel and I'm staying for 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.350
 here then if you liked chocolate the 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:54.310
