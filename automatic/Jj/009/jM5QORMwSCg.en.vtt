much<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.970> our<00:00:06.060> landscape<00:00:06.569> planning<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.230> put<00:00:07.500> in

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
much of our landscape planning is put in

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.009 
much of our landscape planning is put in
as<00:00:07.859> xeriscape<00:00:08.849> planning<00:00:09.300> which<00:00:09.450> means<00:00:09.719> very

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
as xeriscape planning which means very

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.589 
as xeriscape planning which means very
little<00:00:10.380> water<00:00:10.710> use<00:00:11.070> but<00:00:11.700> sometimes<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.330> trees

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
little water use but sometimes the trees

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.320 
little water use but sometimes the trees
benefit<00:00:13.170> from<00:00:13.410> some<00:00:13.650> some<00:00:13.920> extra<00:00:14.250> water<00:00:14.400> this

benefit from some some extra water this

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.980 
benefit from some some extra water this
is<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.719> varied<00:00:16.560> line<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.029> put<00:00:18.210> barely

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
is a varied line that we just put barely

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
is a varied line that we just put barely
underneath<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> mulch<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.400> has<00:00:20.550> inline

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
underneath the mulch and it has inline

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.640 
underneath the mulch and it has inline
emitters<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.630> here's<00:00:22.080> where<00:00:22.320> we've<00:00:22.470> got<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
emitters and here's where we've got a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.269 
emitters and here's where we've got a
hole<00:00:22.920> coming<00:00:23.369> out<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.789> every<00:00:24.600> foot<00:00:25.010> there<00:00:26.010> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
hole coming out and every foot there is

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.220 
hole coming out and every foot there is
a<00:00:26.310> hole<00:00:26.730> already<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> line<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.199> can

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
a hole already in the line and you can

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.750 
a hole already in the line and you can
buy<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:28.980> garden<00:00:29.340> centers<00:00:29.609> or

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
buy these at your garden centers or

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.120 
buy these at your garden centers or
hardware<00:00:30.150> stores<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.650> tree<00:00:31.920> we've

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
hardware stores now on this tree we've

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.709 
hardware stores now on this tree we've
got<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:32.880> six<00:00:33.239> inches<00:00:33.540> in

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
got one that's about six inches in

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.630 
got one that's about six inches in
diameter<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.500> set<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.890> three<00:00:35.280> feet

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
diameter so it's set about three feet

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
diameter so it's set about three feet
out<00:00:35.850> from<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> trunk<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> younger

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.170 
out from the trunk if it's a younger
tree<00:00:37.890> we'd<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> closer<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> trunk

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
tree we'd have it closer to the trunk

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
tree we'd have it closer to the trunk
maybe<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> foot<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> half<00:00:40.079> away<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.160> the

maybe a foot and a half away and as the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790 
maybe a foot and a half away and as the
trees<00:00:41.520> get<00:00:41.670> larger<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.320> dig<00:00:43.320> them<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
trees get larger you can dig them and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
trees get larger you can dig them and
set<00:00:44.010> them<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.190> further<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.390> we're<00:00:45.719> only

set them out further this way we're only

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.840 
set them out further this way we're only
watering<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:46.860> during<00:00:47.160> drought<00:00:47.460> stress

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
do this if this were a small tree say

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.910 
do this if this were a small tree say
one<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.700> recently<00:01:06.540> planted<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> take

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
one just recently planted going to take

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
one just recently planted going to take
this<00:01:08.070> line<00:01:08.369> wrap<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.820> around<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.360> it's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this line wrap it around there so it's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.789 
this line wrap it around there so it's
going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.960> foot<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> half<00:01:10.409> from

when you buy it you'll want to buy the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
when you buy it you'll want to buy the
splicing<00:01:16.259> supplies<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.799> come<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> also

this is a tee now I'm imagining I've got

a a line coming up to it buried from
underground<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:23.939> go<00:01:24.150> ahead<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
underground and we will go ahead and
