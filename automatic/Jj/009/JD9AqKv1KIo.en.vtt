00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello I'm obi juan and in this micro 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.799
 tutorial we will instruct drawings with 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.469
 curves I've taught you in the tutorial 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.200
 happened to how how to destroy drawings but 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.900
 those of x efe can only contain lines 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.449
 not straight curves can not put it 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.460
 ok let's see how we can use 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.550
 the link scape to make a figure with 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.500
 curves and be able to destroy what we will do 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.059
 will be to turn it into straight lines 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.290
 we open the skype link and we are going to draw 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.690
 our drawing with curves for example 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.370
 an arrow that has curves 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.410
 let's increase 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.520
 we give here the pencil and started 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.050
 build the curve 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.510
 now let's use what they are called 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.710
 the curves of beziers this is used a lot 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.740
 in 2d design we give to start in a 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.010
 position we give to the click of the mouse 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.800
 now the click only gives you one time now 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.750
 we leave it tight and we move the mouse and it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.700
 generates a point that has two 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.330
 shooters these shooters allow me 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.040
 change the curvature of this curve so 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.770
 now I repeat again I will put another 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.900
 Here I give you a tight button 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.340
 I move the left mouse 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.340
 they generate the loose shooters 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.260
 and now we are going to 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180
 let's put a normal point here I do 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.050
 normal click I get the straight line 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.930
 normal click normal click normal click 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.430
 normal click now here another curve left 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.370
 tight left button pulled out the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.020
 shooters loose another curve here to 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:45.170
 tight left loose now that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.450
 normal click and normal click there we have 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.680
 generated our our kind of 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.540
 arrow with curve 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.150
 now let's edit it if we edit it 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.420
 and we point out all the points we see that 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.190
 we see the normal points that is 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.010
 that we can move them normally and 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.640
 these are the special points that 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.620
 we can change its curvature with the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.509
 shooters so that we can adjust 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.280
 this curve like we want 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.799
 well here I 'm not going to take much care what 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.750
 I'm going to leave it a little bit shabby like that 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.370
 Well now we mark all the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.260
 points and what we are going to do is 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.830
 convert this into segments first thing 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.860
 is to add more points 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.690
 let's divide this into more pieces 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 shorts and then we'll turn them into 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.300
 lines so we give here the button 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.720
 more and every time we give it between each 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.580
 two points a new point appears 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.140
 if we return to again I get more 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.330
 points and we give you again more points 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.120
 The more times we give you more points 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.900
 will come out and more resolution will have the curve 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.110
 now we give this option here 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.810
 up and we'll turn it all into lines 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.940
 we give you straight lines 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.530
 and now notice that none of the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.940
 points has shooters because they have already 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.940
 become normal points 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.489
 and now yes if we edit it 'bases are 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.780
 all normal points then now 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.650
 we do what we always did in 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.680
 the last tutorial we export recorded 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.660
 like we're going to call him 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.319
 curve arrow 2 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.010
 and we do it in xf format 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.010
 the dx efe this 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.980
 We give you to record with the units in 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.790
 millimeters and we have it now we open 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.690
 the open is cut 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:47.590
 and we import 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.590
 curve arrow 2 of x f 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.770
 look here here this happens this happening 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.360
 I have often found here the curve what 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.010
 what happens is that I have not put it in him 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.470
 in the center this happens many times 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.329
 remember that the origin we have here 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.519
 so I'm going to put it this time we're going to 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.980
 put what the origin is in this 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.210
 part of the curve 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.800
 we put it there and we record again 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.330
 this is also what you see because there 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.890
 Sometimes you give it and it does not appear at all 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.180
 if it appears but appears in another 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.310
 different part because it is not in the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.510
 good origin because it is already back to 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.490
 record as already the cover of xf not 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.190
 forgive I'm afraid I'm going to record it record 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.100
 as 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.830
 curved arrow there is we want 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.889
 replace the file that we already had 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.780
 and forgive us not 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.310
 is not taking it, you see me 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.629
 taking this other format that is this 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.270
 I do not want it the good is this now yes 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.699
 it's the curved arrow we recorded has me 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.219
 to get out of the units now if what 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.340
 we replace and we're already going 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:55.979
 new to the open is here we give the f 5 and 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.740
 now it does appear here in the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.360
 center and we exclude it as we have done 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.750
 before 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.510
 linear extruded 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.550
 let's give more for example 20 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.940
 and here we have our object with curves 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.730
 in 3-d 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.350
 this is all from tijuana academy that 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.350
 they see it is cat to accompany you
