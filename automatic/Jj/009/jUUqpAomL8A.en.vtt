00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.579
 as we always do friends we try 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.349
 for you some of the products 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.090
 cars available in our 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.010
 market I said a lot of joy I'm going to 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.720
 try one of the cars that I love 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.210
 really the cars that have acronyms 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.640
 who say gti or who have at least 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.540
 people or they say w king cheese they have 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.510
 something more than a normal anodyne and 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.970
 boring they usually bring something very 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.059
 cute inside and peugeot does the expected- 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.820
 presenting us the 308 gti is a 308 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.320
 spicy of which we are going to talk enough 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.119
 today continue discovering in the images 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.500
 from Gonzalo Mateu and let's see what is 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.030
 available with five body 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.820
 doors and has an engine 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.530
 200 horsepower really something really 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.009
 important for this type of weight and 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.070
 size 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.840
 this 308 gti returns the essence of the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.670
 balanced combination between a 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.740
 most successful aesthetics and a powerful engine 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.560
 in the modern style with a displacement 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.540
 low and a controlled consumption the price 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.880
 300 8 offers customers enough 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.550
 but something was missing from his clothing and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.330
 also for those who want a 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.100
 little bit more power 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.170
 something else in the engine maybe a 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.600
 dress a little more daring and a 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.060
 turbo in that 1,600-centimeter engine 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.100
 cubic all this comes with the 308 gti 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.290
 which is quite different from any 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.660
 another synthetic 308 includes a 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.270
 Front bumper type sport 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.640
 comes from 308 cc and a new defense 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.290
 back with diffuser in black pearl 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.750
 which includes the tubes left 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.370
 chrome exhaust that also carries some 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.250
 beautiful alloy wheels 18 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.000
 inches with some great tires 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.110
 225 225 r18 inside the passenger compartment 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.750
 essence people say is not 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.770
 exclusively the small details 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.990
 focused particularly on the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.570
 driver because this is a vehicle that 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.600
 it will really make your driver very happy 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.610
 It will give you great sensations and 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.020
 It is left as long as we 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.270
 like sports driving a 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.680
 smile reflected on the face the leather 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.450
 makes owner of the gear lever and 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.670
 of the sports steering wheel with a base 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.860
 flattened although both differ by 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.090
 bring elements in aluminum the console 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.330
 central is finished in black 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.970
 lacquered earning enough points with this 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.720
 the armchair are sporty but 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.580
 maintains 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.940
 well the driver in all kinds of 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.650
 situation are made of leather and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.990
 they complement directly with the steering wheel 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.790
 and the knob of the gearbox respect 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.280
 to the concrete equipment of 308 gti 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.480
 It takes of course climate control headlights 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.550
 xenon cd radio with mp3 and usb connection 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.590
 as a good European vehicle of the beautiful 308 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.050
 Gti is really comfortable for both the 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.340
 driver as for the accompanied the 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.560
 quality materials like 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.660
 equipment does not disappoint one of the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.340
 more demanding four passengers travel 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.340
 comfortably with enough space to 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.520
 the legs and the trunk is 432 liters and 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.010
 can increase to 1,400 liters with the 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.140
 folded seats the differential factor 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.630
 of all gti hides under its hood by 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.100
 course in the case of the Gallic model 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.630
 it's like we said about an engine 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.480
 four cylinders with high turbo 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.760
 pressure and 1600 cubic centimeters of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.180
 cylinder displacement of 200 horses 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.910
 power delivered between 5500 and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.890
 5 thousand 800 revolutions per minute so 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.360
 regarding the transmission will be only 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.530
 the front wheels and by a 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.990
 six manual gearbox 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.820
 really delicious speeds 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.380
 in terms of your speed records and 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.920
 acceleration the cover letters 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.240
 of a gti like this one are 237 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.020
 kilometers per hour of maximum speed 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.240
 and 7.7 seconds to 100 kilometers with 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.120
 the output for the average consumption that 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.850
 Peugeot certifies that it is 6.9 liters 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.640
 100 kilometers 9 point 2 liters of 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.340
 urban cycle and 5.5 liters in cycle 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.400
 extra-urban behavior is 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.860
 really cheerful since 308 gti is not 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.050
 really an atomic bomb but it's a 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.970
 vehicle that is using the box 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.980
 really like a dirt bike 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.989
 we could say using the box 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.840
 taking the laps the car advances from 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.150
 a really spooky way this 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.010
 mechanical choice of a 1.6 to 1.6 engine 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.600
 gasoline with turbo is the confirmation of 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.610
 that the current fashion of reducing 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.830
 engine displacement and complement 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.440
 his loss of benefits with the 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.540
 incorporation of supercharging arrives 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.390
 also to the gt category and with 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.800
 the 308 whenever we have a version 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.840
 of a car with a power fits 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.160
 configure your chassis to be capable 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.230
 of facing more complicated situations 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.600
 and higher speeds 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.010
 for the case of 308 gti peugeot has 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.690
 chosen a suspension scheme with 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.970
 a pseudo type front axle 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.340
 mcpherson and a rear axle with bar 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.050
 torsion on both trains is used a 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.180
 2.2 Carriers' Stem 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.490
 centimeters in diameter compared to 2 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.410
 usual centimeters likewise the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.030
 free height to the floor of the set is 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.940
 cut by 10 millimeters in comparison 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.890
 with the rest of the 308 of course 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.480
 reducing the center of gravity further 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.240
 respect of suspensions and 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.620
 cushioning is 308 gti this amount 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.870
 to larger brake discs 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.880
 with 34 centimeters in diameter on the shaft 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.680
 front and 29 centimeters on the shaft 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.330
 rear with which to make sure to 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.450
 make a good braking ability is 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.550
 fundamental and this gti the 308 pesos 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.710
 really brakes remarkably 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.410
 Various electronic controls help 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.900
 maintain the stability of 308 gti the 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.060
 esp program is standard and includes the 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.790
 dynamic stability control the cd is 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.550
 with electronic brake force distribution the 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.370
 rf helps emergency braking to 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.960
 efe and the traction control to that erc 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.940
 it can be disconnect it in any 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.460
 moment using the button 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.870
 af to these helps adds the address 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.670
 variable assisted and airbags 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.710
 curtain and side curtain 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.210
 head the main virtue of this 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.520
 vehicle is divided into two things for me 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.170
 power and maneuverability the first 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.670
 part is perceived optimally in 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.280
 any driving condition either in 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.500
 magazine or in curves where the 308 advances 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.300
 no problems and really surprised 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.890
 at the moment of starting one feels that 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.780
 the 200 horses together with the turbo 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.940
 they do their job very well and in everything 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.130
 moment invites me or invites him though 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.870
 also to step on the accelerator impresses 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.030
 because it works like a ve 6 but in 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.250
 actually is a 4 - cylinder engine to 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.530
 grant a good power in 308 gti it 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.360
 It behaves agile and fierce without losing its 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.070
 fine touch French one sits on the 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.750
 self circulates a block and realizes 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.310
 that is in a peugeot in transit 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.960
 daily maybe it does not exploit its 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.210
 maneuverability of the whole but what 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.490
 will thank you when you want to change 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.040
 lane when you want to drive from a 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.020
 way a little more agile in route moves 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.120
 very well to the rhythm with the curves in the 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.830
 straight feels very stable nonetheless 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.320
 the suspension is a bit hard because 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.790
 for a high performance car the 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.410
 Tire profile should be more 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.210
 under the suspension is a little bit more 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.840
 hard this is not bad but 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.940
 to accentuate sportsmanship as 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.220
 good french the peugeot 308 gti turbo is 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.289
 a vehicle of fine and dynamic handling in 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.729
 truth amazes his performance at the wheel and 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.849
 response also when stepping on the accelerator 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.800
 is to its main virtue it is also a 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.720
 really nice car in sight to his 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.520
 Exterior and interior design is very 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.160
 attractive if you are one of those 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.690
 drivers you want from time to time 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.630
 Enjoy sports driving 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.900
 want to get on a track and enjoy and 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:28.330
 learn and improve your driving like 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.910
 pilot can also do it with the 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.259
 chest 308 gti your lady can wear the 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.090
 guys at school and you can 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:38.410
 Enjoy the weekends as 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:42.360
 formula pilot with thoughts of 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.360
 heart are confession 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.070
 with the same stone
