00:00:01.407 --> 00:00:03.244
 I don't want to marry you, Joy. I'm leaving you. 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.033
 This is actually my apartment, so you'll have to leave here. 

00:00:07.363 --> 00:00:09.074
 Joy got the boots ... 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.541
 Jeff! You are fired! 

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:13.664
 - Don't take it wrong. You're like a son to me. - Dad, I'm your son. 

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:15.657
 ... Jeff got fired. 

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:18.619
 There is one place where you can be a real man. 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.502
 College? 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.144
 Where do people go to forget all the worries? 

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:24.196
 - Vegas! - Vegas! 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.884
 There were only two strangers ... 

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:28.238
 I'm not usually so funny! 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.275
 ... who longed for an unforgettable night. 

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.736
 They got the next morning ... 

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:40.303
 ... they will never forget. 

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:42.981
 - Well, I'll want to divorce. - Hundred percent! 

00:00:42.982 --> 00:00:44.525
 Vegas will stay with us forever! 

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:53.053
 - It was my quarter. - But I put him in the slot machine. 

00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:57.099
 What's yours is mine too, baby. We're married, remember? 

00:00:58.713 --> 00:01:04.195
 I freeze the three million and condemn you to six months of hard marriage. 

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.429
 - Objection! - Objection! 

00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:06.942
 Welcome home, darling. 

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:08.108
 Hups. 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.793
 If you want me to report that you are working on this marriage ... 

00:01:10.794 --> 00:01:12.546
 ... you'll have to do it. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.447
 Marriage is difficult. 

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:19.904
 I almost am! 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.168
 Men and women are not created to live together. 

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:26.854
 Oh yes, that is really happening. Otherwise, today you are in line with the dishes. 

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:29.880
 20th CENTURY FOX AND REGENCY ENTERPRISES SHOW ... 

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.786
 If I can get Joy to end this marriage. 

00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:35.925
 - Not only would you get rid of your marriage ... - but you'd also get three million. 

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:37.120
 - Hi. - Hi. 

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.626
 Could we settle down here before the locksmith comes to us? 

00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.031
 There's a party full of cats in my living room. 

00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:44.363
 Dude, it's a trap. 

00:01:44.694 --> 00:01:47.729
 - Nene, it happens. - No, it doesn't. 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.839
 ... a comedy about two people who have three million reasons to be together. 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.027
 She doesn't look bad, Uncle Jeff. 

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:56.028
 In good... 

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:57.454
 - Well, is that possible? - No. 

00:01:57.455 --> 00:01:59.690
 You fall in love with your wife, you idiot! 

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.235
 Keep your eyes on the win. 

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:02.236
 ... even in the wrong. 

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:06.245
 It must have been real to make you beat him. 

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:08.004
 Jeff? What's with your face? 

00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:13.625
 I should have set the towels exactly. And I just didn't do it. I'm sorry. 

00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:15.028
 I deserve it. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.651
 WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS 

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:23.116
 But not! No! No! ------------------------------ cecb714c8ef2--
