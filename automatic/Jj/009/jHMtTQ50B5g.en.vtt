00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
fix here is getting this out without

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.430 
fix here is getting this out without
damaging<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.269> paint<00:00:09.860> when<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.950> found<00:00:11.280> is

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
damaging the paint when I found is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.749 
damaging the paint when I found is
painters<00:00:13.440> tape<00:00:13.650> backs<00:00:14.040> off<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.340> end<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
painters tape backs off the end of the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.310 
painters tape backs off the end of the
screwdriver<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:16.550> get<00:00:17.550> rid<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.320> use

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
screwdriver so get rid of that use

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
screwdriver so get rid of that use
something<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> little<00:00:19.980> more<00:00:20.010> robust<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.939> this

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
something a little more robust in this

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.710 
something a little more robust in this
case<00:00:21.680> electrical<00:00:22.680> tape<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.880> main<00:00:27.119> trick<00:00:27.420> here

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
case electrical tape the main trick here

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.930 
case electrical tape the main trick here
is<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.560> want<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.269> get<00:00:30.269> leverage<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.940> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
is that we want to get leverage on the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.810 
is that we want to get leverage on the
Gil<00:00:33.210> without<00:00:33.930> placing<00:00:34.680> pressure<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Gil without placing pressure on the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370 
Gil without placing pressure on the
paint<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.420> too<00:00:36.660> much<00:00:36.809> pressure<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
paint or too much pressure on the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.060 
paint or too much pressure on the
bodywork<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.030> gonna<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
bodywork so what I'm gonna do here is

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
bodywork so what I'm gonna do here is
wrap<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.100> blade<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.760> screwdriver<00:00:42.120> an

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
wrap the blade of the screwdriver an

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
wrap the blade of the screwdriver an
electrical<00:00:43.739> tape<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.610> little<00:00:44.879> more

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
electrical tape which is a little more

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.569 
electrical tape which is a little more
flexible<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> little<00:00:46.230> more<00:00:46.379> sticky<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
flexible and a little more sticky and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.090 
flexible and a little more sticky and
the<00:00:47.730> painters<00:00:48.149> tape<00:00:48.379> no<00:00:49.379> offense<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.890> guy

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the painters tape no offense to the guy

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
the painters tape no offense to the guy
who<00:00:50.160> made<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.520> guy<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> good<00:00:51.600> idea

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
who made that guy that was a good idea

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.830 
who made that guy that was a good idea
I<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
I just think this is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.040 
I just think this is
a<00:00:53.870> little<00:00:54.080> bit<00:00:54.320> easier<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:56.030> deal<00:00:56.510> with<00:00:56.540> I

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
a little bit easier to deal with I

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.510 
a little bit easier to deal with I
already<00:00:57.380> did<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.680> one<00:00:57.830> side<00:00:58.130> and<00:00:59.230> also<00:01:00.520> use

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
already did the one side and also use

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.350 
already did the one side and also use
your<00:01:01.940> own<00:01:02.270> fingers<00:01:03.160> for<00:01:04.160> leverage<00:01:04.550> we're

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
your own fingers for leverage we're

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.139 
your own fingers for leverage we're
going<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:05.570> do<00:01:05.720> here

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149
