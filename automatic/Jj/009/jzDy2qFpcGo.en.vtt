00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.370
 hi it's manu for a new video 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.620
 this time for the smoc bug 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.510
 so if you have already followed our lives 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.349
 you looked in vod you have 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.880
 maybe had to hear just a few times 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.419
 that I said he uses the bug of the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.279
 smoke 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.499
 but if you do not necessarily know what 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.489
 that I'm going to show you what 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.949
 it's just in this video 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.779
 so we are on inferno small 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.329
 illustration is when for example 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 we launch a pit level 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.000
 in fact what to do is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 look down 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 little by little and gold look look 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.760
 look at the top of the screen not at 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
 middle but from above 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.809
 the ja the smoke the asmo disappears see 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.489
 so suddenly if there is someone who is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.789
 in the rocks that believe he does not 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.660
 can not be seen since since vodka 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.660
 and very little to be killed because of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.820
 this famous smoke so or because 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.589
 of this famous bug since see I see 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 very good the entry of the same vodka 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.009
 shifted like that there I see all this 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.619
 who's going for sure the good ones 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.590
 reflexes in Cairo sees him moving forward on 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.460
 pull and it's a kim clearly that's it 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.759
 go very very fast 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.950
 alas the potting soil that rock can nothing 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:27.240
 make loopback issued for the purpose of the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:29.790
 video lille 10 instructions to but 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.619
 good if you want the water that goes 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.450
 to be embarrassing is that we will have the name 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.580
 players of what I'm going to you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.610
 just advise to go in 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.860
 your options game settings and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.820
 choose proposal from the mini array of 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.810
 score you put down and so suddenly 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.470
 when you play well you have it in 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.090
 down we do not care 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.940
 thin ah a little too far I used it 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.420
 with the truck for example here is on the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.920
 truck 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.550
 I got myself but basically I'm here 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 will disappear the smoke oh 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.100
 wait I'll do another thing I 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.510
 was not worth going into the banana for 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.650
 show you a little bit more about 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.900
 the entrance of the pine talking bp mocks here 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.910
 if you have the proper angle can be here one 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.400
 can see if it was going on 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.100
 at the level of the fountain and therefore the blow 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.340
 see that thanks to the score that is down 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.290
 well we can see better so here 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.670
 it was for the presentation of this bug 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.500
 of the asmo it is not available that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.770
 on inferno it is especially used on 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.640
 mirage at the level of the height b so 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.610
 here you have it do not hesitate to use it 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.590
 if you need it or if you have 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.970
 want to test it thank you have watched 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.970
