00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 all right 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.880
 hello youtube people in this tutorial 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.180
 of how to make fireworks here 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 in minecraft good there are three good ways 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.200
 three ways there are many different ways of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.610
 do them but for me these are the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.300
 top 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.840
 well the first way is the diamond 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.420
 with diamond 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.550
 they grab the diamond 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.850
 and the gunpowder and the dyes that you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.340
 like any dye has to be 6 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.130
 since they have that they put first the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.950
 gunpowder the first the gunpowder at once 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.680
 the diamond in the center and the dye 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.930
 for a rocket powder to come out and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.130
 the chair is born until they finish 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.260
 with all its dyes 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.260
 and do what I'm doing 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.710
 I do not know 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.870
 well here we have finished all the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.630
 six dyes we have already changed it to 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.190
 gunpowder since they have done that everything 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.640
 what you have to do is install the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.650
 crafter and good here they are going to put the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.870
 gunpowder but if you want the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.790
 fireworks go very high they put it 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.979
 three if they want me to go half put two 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.479
 if they want me to go to little they put one I 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.479
 I'm going to put two because for me it will go up 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.850
 better in two then what they have to 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.040
 do is put the paper here and the 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.610
 fill them all with gunpowder to 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 rockets 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.290
 in all that 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 and grabbing the rocket like you see here 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.590
 security action 2 flight for the small 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.930
 green this raised the little one and all that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.400
 they grab the rocket and as you see here is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.530
 the diamond rocket 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.210
 diamond rocket track will look 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.700
 so it depends on the color that you are 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.500
 essential to have different good there are 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.320
 two there was the diamond rocket 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.430
 well here we are going to go to the form 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.130
 of artificial clipper good grabbing the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.150
 gunpowder the cause of kripan and the six 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.730
 dyes 1 2 3 4 5 and the 6 dyes but not 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.450
 without dyes san mamÃ©s el kraft e today 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.280
 they do the same 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.640
 they put the head of cri but in the middle 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.860
 the gunpowder here and the ball dyes and so 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.190
 they change them until they have all 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.190
 the gunpowder 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.959
 yes 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.810
 good and have finished everything grabbing 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.110
 they grab the gunpowder they are by the paper 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.849
 and they're going to massacre theo and put 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.430
 put here the level they want me to go 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.450
 the rocket to me I like more than half what 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.599
 I'm going to put two and paper here 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.959
 and then put the gunpowder do not fill it with 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.959
 gunpowder 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.020
 yes 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.290
 grab the rocket as you see here we have 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.980
 the clip- shaped rocket but this one 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.330
 it's very cool the truth look if I 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.350
 they saw well it 's way to write but as 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.350
 I am using many colors 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.910
 you look different must be two good 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.260
 artificial fire in the form of cri but 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.070
 after that followed the simpler the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:38.850
 the artificial fire of feather to great the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.850
 pen the gunpowder and the seven dyes 6 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.150
 they put the gunpowder the pen and the reds 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.940
 and they keep changing until all the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.940
 gunpowder 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.109
 and Alberto came to that war in the 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.709
 powder gunpowder was gunpowder and 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.709
 grab the paper 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.040
 put in the level that you want me 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.519
 I put it 2 and fill it with gunpowder 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.519
 for the bridge 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.610
 puts on the role of the rocket 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.610
 as you see here is the rocket with pen 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.670
 then like that has another design of 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.670
 they burst and that 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.470
 well that was all the three forms of 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.660
 rockets those were the three forms of 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.520
 account for me the best ones if they want 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.690
 that goes up the second part just give the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.690
 that video and comment
