00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 the other day I saw people on the internet 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.910
 photographed with drops I think 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.220
 interesting how they or the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.219
 how the photos came out of the boots 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.549
 so I said that a woman photo 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.350
 balls and I did not try at my house but 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.390
 unfortunately our blessed is very 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.330
 fast to be able to photograph the drops 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.340
 freeze them in motion is I had to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.890
 raise a lot he did a lot more 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.570
 beyond 12 thousand 6400 and since my house 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.810
 it is not very illuminated worse to the photo 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.399
 much noise one would be disastrous 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.430
 frightening thing does not even want to look 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.879
 so what I did was to go out to my 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 ceiling in broad daylight are 12 o'clock 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.540
 noon when it is only at its maximum 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.190
 power and now you can use the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.410
 faster speeds I think that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
 can give me good final results 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.320
 I'm here 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.550
 let's bet to drop drops and we're going to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.920
 see that it does not come out I'm using 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.829
 basically a tripod a camera in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.879
 this case a canon eos 60d a goal 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.430
 which is 18 200 and nothing a container with 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.010
 water in this case I use a 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.720
 container full of water and a bottle 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.159
 which is a hole of anyone is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.619
 a hole in the lid fills it with water and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.260
 I control with my hand the flow of 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.570
 no drops and nothing you have to have a lot 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.299
 patience because sometimes it does not focus 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 very well the drop I was shooting 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.630
 with a diaphragm of 2.8 or 3.5 and the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.049
 depth of field he had it like that 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.049
 little girl like me 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 little girl then she could not capture the 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.210
 water waves so I went up a 6 with 3 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.580
 since the sun allows me 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.080
 where I want to get a little better 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.020
 let's practice to see how we get 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.820
 and they assure to bring enough water to 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.430
 wet your head if you are in the sun as 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.440
 me because they are going to boil the brain 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.440
 let's start 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.049
 this is my bottle with the waters here 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.450
 It has a little hole 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.350
 you can see out there 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 this is the camera 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.630
 for the camera the manual 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.550
 I'm shooting at a speed of 1 is 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.350
 the 8 thousand 126 thousand then they can not 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.440
 try according to the light that you like 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.560
 the diaphragm I'm not putting in 6.5 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.489
 I think it 's 55 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.590
 and ready is 100 100 125 depending 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.470
 is shooting the images in format 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.310
 raw to then process the ones themselves 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.140
 some retouching they need minimal to 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.650
 that is not very exaggerated look 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.080
 basically that the manual-free approach 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.030
 nothing automatic and in this case I 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.310
 to be able to find since that 's when 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.590
 I put the zoom the maximum blue what you see 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.720
 it's all white is to use the peak of the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.040
 bottle where more or less will be the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.040
 drop to be able to frame 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.270
 once in frame my image is already 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.910
 Start 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.600
 It was the j 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.600
 and shoot 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.610
 it could also fire bursts and it was a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.610
 little bottle 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.700
 in this case he shot one by one 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.700
 just when the drop falls
