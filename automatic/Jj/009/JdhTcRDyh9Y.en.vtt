very<00:03:18.340> good<00:03:18.550> game<00:03:18.730> against<00:03:19.180> Clemson<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.870> when

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
very good game against Clemson and when

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.380 
very good game against Clemson and when
he<00:03:20.530> got<00:03:20.740> blocked<00:03:20.980> by<00:03:21.340> Brandon<00:03:21.850> Thomas<00:03:22.090> he

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.350 
he got blocked by Brandon Thomas he
stayed<00:03:22.720> blocked<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.980> criticism<00:03:24.310> on<00:03:24.910> this

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
stayed blocked so the criticism on this

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.340 
stayed blocked so the criticism on this
young<00:03:25.540> man<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.680> he<00:03:26.890> flashes<00:03:28.350> explosion

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
young man is that he flashes explosion

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.980 
young man is that he flashes explosion
every<00:03:29.980> game<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:30.760> he<00:03:30.880> doesn't<00:03:31.330> do<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.570> enough

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
every game but he doesn't do it enough

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.520 
every game but he doesn't do it enough
and<00:03:32.290> really<00:03:33.100> I<00:03:33.460> think<00:03:33.690> what<00:03:34.690> Houston<00:03:35.170> has<00:03:35.350> to

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
and really I think what Houston has to

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.590 
and really I think what Houston has to
do<00:03:35.710> is<00:03:36.100> get<00:03:36.430> him<00:03:36.580> in<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:36.850> defensive<00:03:37.330> lying

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
do is get him in that defensive lying

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.660 
do is get him in that defensive lying
