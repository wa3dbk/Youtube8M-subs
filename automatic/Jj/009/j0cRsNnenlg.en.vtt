00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
ends or not tape the ends if you're

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.890 
ends or not tape the ends if you're
using<00:01:30.250> one<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.700> plastic<00:01:30.940> tables<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.750> might

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
using one of the plastic tables it might

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.240 
using one of the plastic tables it might
be<00:01:32.050> better<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.410> take<00:01:32.560> both<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.010> ends

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
be better to take both of the ends

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.380 
be better to take both of the ends
because<00:01:33.490> they<00:01:33.640> tend<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.940> be<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.120> little

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
because they tend to be a little

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.840 
because they tend to be a little
slippery<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:35.710> not<00:01:35.950> going<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.220> take<00:01:36.370> my<00:01:36.610> hands

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
slippery I'm not going to take my hands

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.420 
slippery I'm not going to take my hands
so<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.780> skirt<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:38.470> am<00:01:38.620> using<00:01:38.860> has<00:01:39.160> been

it<00:02:11.060> round<00:02:11.920> picks<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.450> tape<00:02:14.690> sticks

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
it round picks it and this tape sticks

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.800 
it round picks it and this tape sticks
really<00:02:16.190> well<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> doesn't<00:02:17.269> make<00:02:17.569> your

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
really well but it doesn't make your

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.380 
really well but it doesn't make your
cover<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.890> doesn't<00:02:19.160> make<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.370> cover<00:02:19.580> sad<00:02:19.910> so

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
continue with it around try to keep that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.199 
continue with it around try to keep that
a<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:26.480> bit<00:02:27.349> of<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.620> lip<00:02:28.190> at<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.400> top<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
a little bit of a lip at the top of the

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.089 
a little bit of a lip at the top of the
table

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
table

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.920 
table
I'm<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.340> pull<00:02:31.849> it<00:02:32.030> because<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.720> little

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
I'm just pull it because it's a little

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.069 
I'm just pull it because it's a little
difficult<00:02:33.530> with<00:02:33.680> one<00:02:33.860> person<00:02:34.810> easier<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:35.959> to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
difficult with one person easier just to

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.610 
difficult with one person easier just to
pull<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.500> tight<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:37.489> stick<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:41.440> tight<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
pull it tight and stick it tight and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.149 
pull it tight and stick it tight and
stick<00:02:42.890> it

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.490 

I<00:02:49.189> think<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.299> skirts<00:02:50.659> going<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.930> go<00:02:51.019> all<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
I think this skirts going to go all the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:02.640 
I think this skirts going to go all the
way<00:02:51.530> around<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.099> table<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.859> not<00:02:58.989> but<00:03:00.340> that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
way around the table it is not but that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.170 
way around the table it is not but that
smooths<00:03:03.650> out<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:03.890> table<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.489> probably<00:03:04.790> should

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
smooths out the table I probably should

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.360 
smooths out the table I probably should
have<00:03:05.239> taped<00:03:05.540> my<00:03:05.720> end

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
have taped my end

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.800 
have taped my end
okay<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.609> skirt<00:03:08.030> could<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.359> have<00:03:08.569> on<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
okay this skirt could I have on the

twist it up and we're just going to

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.059 
twist it up and we're just going to
start<00:04:30.060> sticking<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.629> onto<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:31.590> back<00:04:31.770> side

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
start sticking that onto the back side

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:37.670 
start sticking that onto the back side
of<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.430> double<00:04:32.699> sticky<00:04:33.000> tape<00:04:34.250> around<00:04:36.560> like<00:04:37.560> I

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
of the double sticky tape around like I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.230 
of the double sticky tape around like I
said<00:04:37.860> sometimes<00:04:38.069> it<00:04:38.370> might<00:04:38.460> be<00:04:38.610> easier<00:04:39.000> for

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
said sometimes it might be easier for

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.330 
said sometimes it might be easier for
someone<00:04:39.419> up<00:04:39.629> to<00:04:39.780> people<00:04:40.199> once<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.949> person<00:04:41.280> you

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
someone up to people once a person you

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.270 
someone up to people once a person you
can<00:04:41.520> kind<00:04:41.759> of<00:04:41.819> fold<00:04:42.389> it<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:42.949> take<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:43.979> all<00:04:44.250> the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
can kind of fold it and take it all the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.770 
can kind of fold it and take it all the
way<00:04:44.430> around<00:04:46.669> this<00:04:47.669> it's<00:04:48.090> very<00:04:48.150> easy<00:04:48.419> very

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
way around this it's very easy very

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.379 
way around this it's very easy very
quickly<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:52.039> once<00:04:53.039> again<00:04:53.340> I<00:04:53.520> have<00:04:53.789> a<00:04:53.819> longer

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
quickly and once again I have a longer

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.869 
quickly and once again I have a longer
valency<00:04:55.050> or<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.349> I'm<00:04:55.560> going<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.800> just<00:04:56.460> cut<00:04:56.849> the

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
valency or so I'm going to just cut the

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.189 
valency or so I'm going to just cut the
end<00:04:57.210> off<00:04:57.979> or<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.159> meets<00:04:59.400> with<00:04:59.750> the<00:05:00.750> end<00:05:00.870> here

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
end off or it meets with the end here

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.749 
end off or it meets with the end here
and<00:05:01.620> so<00:05:01.740> there<00:05:01.949> you<00:05:02.039> have<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.550> have<00:05:02.729> a
