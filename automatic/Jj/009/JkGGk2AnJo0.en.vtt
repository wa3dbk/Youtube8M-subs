00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:11.060
 the limit box inc there I'm going to make a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.090
 very short video 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:21.480
 you were explained the principle of 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:24.029
 dispense so it'll be very short for 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.749
 me there is in boxing r3 distance and I 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.970
 want to in just 3 then there is the 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.810
 distance we will say neutral that is to say 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:39.390
 you are out of reach of the opponent 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:42.210
 in fact it is further away there is this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.880
 distance there the opponent is too far 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 and can not touch here in fact there 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.120
 can give himself an impulse but hey 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.750
 it's something we can 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.920
 can see happen if we are a pro on 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.930
 to say that's the distance really from 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 security the other this distance you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:11.159
 will you go back use the ring in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.150
 take a little breath so it's 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.010
 an observation distance we will say the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.010
 second distance that's what I'm going 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.229
 I will call here the mid distance 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.780
 the normans not the importance 1 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.729
 I call it just the mid distance 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.400
 is remote shots so wear 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.820
 here I can hit the opponent 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.960
 so for me it's here 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.090
 here here it's the same it's the same sense 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.280
 same thing that's the midway 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.560
 there is the third distance what is it 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.530
 it's the distance from clint of body to 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.650
 body so in this distance a year 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.920
 will not do that hitting that make 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.750
 stuff like that often even this is 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.970
 very annoying and besides seven goals 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.470
 he hits like that but hey the referee 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.979
 can you take away points if you 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.180
 do it good it is useless unless 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.310
 you really want pissed off other 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.750
 opponents of what you do to him there 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.789
 will you do it to you too so here 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 the in his distances the goal this is 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.320
 not to hit because there is no 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.800
 could not embarrass with the force with 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.860
 its colors 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.540
 in any case one boxing in 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.630
 recording boxing but the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.340
 distance here what is science 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.340
 climate we'll see later 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.540
 it's how to turn the opponent on 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.320
 master position him in a place 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.610
 you want with the techniques of 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.950
 arms could twist my arm and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.570
 even at his arms like that you do not have to 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.739
 do it 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.829
 for example he did it very well 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.290
 do not do it because 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.760
 the arbitrator will be able 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.400
 referee you must know a new 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.680
 referee if you do things like 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.840
 that I mean you do things 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.329
 legal in according to the rules of boxing 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.209
 ie techniques you have 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.820
 hit the arm and you can you 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.850
 you turn the opponent where you and 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:15.860
 that he go so it's not to break 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.500
 morale is just an example there is 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.030
 several techniques 1 that I you 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.350
 will also show how to move 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.160
 the opponent with the forearm 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.720
 by not moving your head so that's the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.110
 clint techniques we'll see that more 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.810
 late is there so that was the distance 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.040
 of melee the distance klose have 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.650
 do it as you want when all 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.510
 so plan it was simply 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.370
 a video like that you'll tell me 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.520
 yes but it's useless at all if that 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.930
 serves it's very important 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.180
 you will see later why this is 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.180
 important next to the next video
