00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.790
 It is 15 July 2013 at the airport 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.770
 Cologne / Bonn is the starting point for a 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.510
 new administration building the 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.510
 Flight operator germanwings 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.399
 Office space with modern infrastructure for 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.829
 around 200 employees 6300 square meters 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.690
 on six floors and already in november 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.269
 the tenants want to move in here 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 an ambitious plan is that 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.170
 architects clear 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 that you also have to do later 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.430
 can change 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.240
 while the principle of research stands 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.770
 the mirror before finished in the shop and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.600
 pull up in place of the fast 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.600
 book that is the big advantage 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.180
 after a few days are the first 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.950
 mounted modules and already stand the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.620
 drywall in the starting holes 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.230
 the time is running out now inside and 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.480
 worked outside parallel 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.160
 a big advantage the outside walls of the 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.650
 modules carry the main load 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.110
 This allows the interiors to be flexible 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.100
 Plan and the floors can be used anytime 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.100
 be rebuilt 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.520
 and it turns up here plan office 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.790
 clear surfaces 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.620
 little ill 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.890
 a lot of glass modern 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:10.340
 another picture mid august the building 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.920
 is completed 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.510
 The 420 individual modules are mounted 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
 is barely recognizable 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.030
 now the work on the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.590
 facade the whole complex becomes one 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.310
 twelve centimeters thick insulating layer 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.310
 wrapped 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.640
 which submit a substance regulation 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.720
 the advantage here is that here the life 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.970
 in the same 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.300
 not as the charge is energetic 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.140
 that just as well 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.140
 conventional 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.020
 at the end of september the final spurt begins 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.000
 The last month will be exciting again 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.220
 At the construction site are temporarily over 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.730
 100 workers of different trades in the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.010
 commitment 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.010
 They all work on an appointment 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.720
 the end of october made it to only three 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.810
 Months is the office building 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.810
 ready for occupancy germanwings can fly in 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.560
 my first impression is fantastic 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.930
 So I think here we are right 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.800
 Good building will be even if you have the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.970
 framework conditions once again 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.129
 consider a very short bit 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.190
 construction time so I'm very positive 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.069
 surprised by the open space story 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.450
 that looks much more generous than how 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.769
 if the individual had made big 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.959
 I like that very much 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.580
 I think our choice of materials is ours 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.900
 very well done that is very 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.660
 high quality impression 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:01.040
 super great 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.110
 inside as well as outside and kreuzberg 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.670
 has with its modular design once 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.670
 shown more what is possible 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.690
 kreuzberg 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.690
 we will give space for the future
