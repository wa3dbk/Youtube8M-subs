and yeah let's just get started

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.240 
and yeah let's just get started
so<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.869> I'm<00:01:34.079> taking<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.799> triangle

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so first I'm taking my little triangle

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
so first I'm taking my little triangle
cutout<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.789> my<00:01:35.909> piece<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.299> leather<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.810> then

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
cutout and my piece of leather and then

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
cutout and my piece of leather and then
I'm<00:01:37.109> just<00:01:37.320> tracing<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> triangle<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.520> there

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I'm just tracing the triangle on there

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.120 
I'm just tracing the triangle on there
and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.570> flipping<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.229> tracing<00:01:40.799> another

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and then flipping it and tracing another

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
and then flipping it and tracing another
triangle<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:42.090> backside<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
triangle on backside of it so when you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
triangle on backside of it so when you
finish<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.250> should<00:01:44.429> have<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> diamond

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
finish out you should have a diamond

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:58.249 
finish out you should have a diamond
like<00:01:45.210> shape<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:56.390> once<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.600> finish<00:01:57.899> making<00:01:58.049> my

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
like shape and once I finish making my

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
like shape and once I finish making my
first<00:01:58.649> diamond<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.189> shape<00:01:59.490> I'm<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.789> going

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
first diamond like shape I'm just going

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
first diamond like shape I'm just going
to<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.209> making<00:02:00.390> another<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:01.020> except<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to be making another one except this

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
to be making another one except this
time<00:02:02.069> instead<00:02:02.459> of<00:02:02.549> doing<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> triangle<00:02:03.390> thing

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
time instead of doing the triangle thing

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
time instead of doing the triangle thing
you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.929> actually<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.530> trace<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.039> exact

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
you can actually just trace the exact

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:18.550 
you can actually just trace the exact
one<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.819> you<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.090> made

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.580 

and<00:02:20.030> once<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.540> both<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.870> my<00:02:22.050> little<00:02:22.350> ear

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and once I have both of my little ear

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.210

shapes

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
shapes

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.010 
shapes
I<00:02:23.250> am<00:02:23.490> positioning<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.480> headband<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
I am positioning them on the headband to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.900 
I am positioning them on the headband to
see<00:02:25.200> where<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.380> want<00:02:25.620> them<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.520> I'm<00:02:26.700> just

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
see where I want them and then I'm just

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.790 
see where I want them and then I'm just
hot<00:02:27.180> gluing<00:02:27.540> them<00:02:27.660> down

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.250 

and<00:02:33.570> make<00:02:34.570> sure<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.990> don't<00:02:35.140> burn

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
and make sure that you don't burn

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.350 
and make sure that you don't burn
yourself<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.010> did<00:02:36.400> several<00:02:36.670> times<00:02:37.000> and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
yourself because I did several times and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.820 
yourself because I did several times and
also<00:02:37.510> if<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.990> little<00:02:38.110> bit<00:02:38.260> messy<00:02:38.590> here

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
also if it's a little bit messy here

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.410 
also if it's a little bit messy here
don't<00:02:39.220> worry<00:02:39.460> because<00:02:39.730> you're<00:02:40.120> just<00:02:40.240> going<00:02:40.360> to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
don't worry because you're just going to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.930 
don't worry because you're just going to
