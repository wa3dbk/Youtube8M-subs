dancer my whole life so health was never
a<00:02:01.259> problem<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.680> guess<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.040> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.310> took<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.579> for

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
a problem I guess I kind of took it for

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.109 
a problem I guess I kind of took it for
granted<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:04.460> when<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.729> these<00:02:05.880> things

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
granted and when all of these things

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.510 
granted and when all of these things
happened<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> brought<00:02:08.220> all<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
happened this is when I brought all the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.140 
happened this is when I brought all the
animals<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.489> they<00:02:11.489> helped<00:02:11.760> me<00:02:11.879> through<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
in so many ways that it's hard to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.050
