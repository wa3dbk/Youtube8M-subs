broom today and this is easier than

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.150 
broom today and this is easier than
teacup<00:00:28.539> so<00:00:29.539> to<00:00:29.990> do<00:00:30.140> which<00:00:30.320> is<00:00:30.500> very<00:00:30.529> me<00:00:30.890> first

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
teacup so to do which is very me first

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.939 
teacup so to do which is very me first
start<00:00:31.430> out<00:00:31.640> by<00:00:31.910> taking<00:00:32.660> your<00:00:33.080> pointer<00:00:33.530> finger

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
start out by taking your pointer finger

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.340 
start out by taking your pointer finger
and<00:00:33.980> putting<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.790> under<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:35.510> loop<00:00:35.870> here<00:00:36.140> and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
and putting it under this loop here and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.620 
and putting it under this loop here and
twisting<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.010> twice<00:00:37.309> make<00:00:38.000> sure<00:00:38.180> you<00:00:38.300> only

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
twisting it twice make sure you only

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.810 
twisting it twice make sure you only
twist<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.170> twice<00:00:39.350> because<00:00:39.890> if<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:40.430> twist<00:00:40.640> it

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
twist it twice because if you twist it

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.819 
twist it twice because if you twist it
more<00:00:41.059> or<00:00:41.300> less<00:00:41.360> then<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:42.140> will<00:00:42.380> end<00:00:42.559> up<00:00:42.710> with

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
more or less then you will end up with

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.740 
more or less then you will end up with
the<00:00:43.010> wrong<00:00:43.160> thing<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:43.550> just<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.180> twice<00:00:44.390> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
the wrong thing so just it twice and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.350 
the wrong thing so just it twice and
then<00:00:45.530> pull<00:00:45.860> back<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:47.059> did<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.329> correctly
