00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and the nand on the PCB we do all that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
and the nand on the PCB we do all that
design<00:00:43.710> ourselves<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.000> piece<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> can't

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
design ourselves and the piece you can't

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.790 
design ourselves and the piece you can't
see<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.230> important<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.620> the

put<00:01:12.450> into<00:01:12.570> our<00:01:12.600> notebooks<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> make<00:01:13.500> them<00:01:13.650> go

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
put into our notebooks and make them go

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
put into our notebooks and make them go
much<00:01:14.040> faster<00:01:16.880> all<00:01:17.880> right<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.299> we're

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
much faster all right so here we're

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
much faster all right so here we're
looking<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.750> two<00:01:18.780> identical<00:01:19.439> laptops<00:01:19.850> one

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
looking at two identical laptops one

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.190 
looking at two identical laptops one
with<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> hard<00:01:21.270> drive<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.630> came<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> and

the video it's already rebooted here and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.609 
the video it's already rebooted here and
you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.899> little<00:02:01.049> section<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you know just in this little section you

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.959 
you know just in this little section you
can<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.159> hard<00:02:02.369> drive<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.579> still

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
can see that the hard drive is still

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.719 
can see that the hard drive is still
trying<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.360> load<00:02:03.509> images<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:05.159> takes

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
trying to load images and it takes

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.510 
trying to load images and it takes
significantly<00:02:06.299> longer<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.129> SSD

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
significantly longer I think the the SSD

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.910 
significantly longer I think the the SSD
is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.879> little<00:02:09.119> over<00:02:09.300> twice<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.869> fast<00:02:10.110> going

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
is a little over twice as fast going

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.589 
is a little over twice as fast going
through<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.220> it'll<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.610> two<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.180> three<00:02:12.390> loops

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
through this it'll do two to three loops

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.070 
through this it'll do two to three loops
before<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
before the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.950 
before the
dr<00:02:13.350> finishes<00:02:13.740> juan<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.940> got<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.750> max

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
dr finishes juan you got the the max

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.920 
dr finishes juan you got the the max
rewrites<00:02:16.410> piece<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> X<00:02:17.640> equal<00:02:18.270> yeah<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
rewrites piece for the X equal yeah the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.180 
rewrites piece for the X equal yeah the
see<00:02:19.080> 400<00:02:19.290> max<00:02:20.010> rights<00:02:20.390> are<00:02:21.390> at<00:02:21.840> 260<00:02:22.770> megabytes

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
see 400 max rights are at 260 megabytes

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.560 
see 400 max rights are at 260 megabytes
a<00:02:23.280> second<00:02:23.670> which<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.820> an<00:02:24.060> improvement<00:02:24.150> over

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
a second which is an improvement over

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.340 
a second which is an improvement over
the<00:02:24.720> c300<00:02:25.670> c300<00:02:26.670> was<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> 215<00:02:27.690> megabytes<00:02:28.140> per

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the c300 c300 was a 215 megabytes per

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.320 
the c300 c300 was a 215 megabytes per
second<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.830> then<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> read<00:02:29.880> speeds<00:02:30.120> we

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
second and then on the read speeds we

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.090 
second and then on the read speeds we
really<00:02:30.600> got<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> very<00:02:31.290> significant<00:02:31.770> increase

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
really got a very significant increase

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.090 
really got a very significant increase
we<00:02:32.340> went<00:02:32.520> from<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.240> c300<00:02:33.630> which<00:02:34.080> was<00:02:34.230> at<00:02:34.350> 350

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
we went from the c300 which was at 350

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.520 
we went from the c300 which was at 350
five<00:02:35.250> megabytes<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.790> second<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> sea<00:02:37.050> 400

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
five megabytes a second to the sea 400

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.270 
five megabytes a second to the sea 400
being<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.860> 415<00:02:38.700> megabytes<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.240> second<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.280> not

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
being at 415 megabytes a second so not

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.640 
being at 415 megabytes a second so not
only<00:02:41.310> do<00:02:41.580> we<00:02:41.700> move<00:02:41.850> forward<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.530> know

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
only do we move forward to the you know

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.400 
only do we move forward to the you know
the<00:02:43.770> world's<00:02:44.130> leading<00:02:44.520> man<00:02:45.390> process<00:02:45.840> geometry

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the world's leading man process geometry

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.740 
the world's leading man process geometry
but<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.680> also<00:02:46.830> were<00:02:47.160> able<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.580> extract<00:02:47.970> even

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
but we also were able to extract even

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.990 
but we also were able to extract even
more<00:02:48.900> performance<00:02:49.380> out<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> drive<00:02:53.000> price

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
more performance out of the drive price

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.850 
more performance out of the drive price
points<00:02:54.270> will<00:02:54.390> continue<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.170> naturally<00:02:55.650> come

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
points will continue to naturally come

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.310 
points will continue to naturally come
down<00:02:56.040> over<00:02:56.370> time<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.880> obviously<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:58.020> in<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
down over time I obviously have in the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.280 
down over time I obviously have in the
world's<00:02:59.310> leading<00:02:59.490> process<00:03:00.150> geometry<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
world's leading process geometry on the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.100 
world's leading process geometry on the
nand<00:03:01.500> helps<00:03:02.220> bring<00:03:02.430> costs<00:03:02.640> out<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.209> helps<00:03:03.720> you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
nand helps bring costs out and helps you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.540 
nand helps bring costs out and helps you
know<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.709> constant<00:03:05.340> downward

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
know that that constant downward

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.430 
know that that constant downward
trajectory<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.510> price<00:03:07.040> what<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.130> they<00:03:08.250> oh

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
trajectory and price what are they oh

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.490 
trajectory and price what are they oh
yeah<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.860> capacities<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:12.510> c300<00:03:13.020> we<00:03:13.380> had

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
yeah so the capacities the c300 we had

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.760 
yeah so the capacities the c300 we had
64<00:03:14.100> 128<00:03:14.640> 256<00:03:15.000> gigabytes<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.170> sea<00:03:16.320> 400

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
64 128 256 gigabytes for the sea 400

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.110 
64 128 256 gigabytes for the sea 400
we've<00:03:16.920> introduced<00:03:17.310> an<00:03:17.489> additional<00:03:18.000> capacity

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
we've introduced an additional capacity

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.960 
we've introduced an additional capacity
of<00:03:18.660> 512<00:03:19.260> gigabytes<00:03:19.739> that's<00:03:20.280> another<00:03:20.489> benefit

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
of 512 gigabytes that's another benefit

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.030 
of 512 gigabytes that's another benefit
of<00:03:21.030> using<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.600> 25<00:03:21.959> nanometer<00:03:22.320> nand<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.830> it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
of using the 25 nanometer nand is it's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
of using the 25 nanometer nand is it's
able<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.880> give<00:03:24.030> us<00:03:24.150> one<00:03:24.630> more<00:03:24.780> capacity
