hi<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.340> Nash<00:00:06.080> today<00:00:07.080> I'm<00:00:07.170> gonna<00:00:07.319> talk<00:00:07.559> to

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.590 
hi this is Nash today I'm gonna talk to

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.530 
hi this is Nash today I'm gonna talk to
you<00:00:07.740> about<00:00:08.780> two<00:00:10.400> essential<00:00:11.400> hormones<00:00:12.090> in

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
you about two essential hormones in

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.429 
you about two essential hormones in
regard<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> fat<00:00:14.190> loss<00:00:14.960> so<00:00:15.960> we're<00:00:16.139> gonna<00:00:16.230> talk

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
regard to fat loss so we're gonna talk

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.120 
regard to fat loss so we're gonna talk
to<00:00:16.560> me<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.710> insulin<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.580> glucagon<00:00:19.130> let's

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
to me about insulin and glucagon let's

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.909 
to me about insulin and glucagon let's
start<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.490> insulin<00:00:20.970> first

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
start with insulin first

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.620 
start with insulin first
insulin<00:00:22.919> is<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.159> hormone<00:00:23.279> responsible<00:00:24.089> for

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
insulin is the hormone responsible for

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.279 
insulin is the hormone responsible for
taking<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:26.310> blood<00:00:26.550> sugar<00:00:26.970> from<00:00:27.900> your

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
taking the blood sugar from your

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.849 
taking the blood sugar from your
bloodstream<00:00:28.560> into<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.609> glycogen<00:00:30.029> stores<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
bloodstream into the glycogen stores and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.869 
bloodstream into the glycogen stores and
also<00:00:31.859> into<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> fat<00:00:32.850> stores<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.170> your

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
also into the fat stores so if your

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.189 
also into the fat stores so if your
glucose<00:00:35.879> if<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.210> blood<00:00:36.420> sugar<00:00:36.719> level<00:00:37.019> is

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
glucose if your blood sugar level is

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.189 
glucose if your blood sugar level is
high<00:00:37.850> insulin<00:00:38.850> will<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.420> released<00:00:39.750> from

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
high insulin will be released from

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.540 
high insulin will be released from
pancreas<00:00:40.859> and<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:43.320> will<00:00:43.559> take<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.070> extra

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
pancreas and it will take that extra

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.079 
pancreas and it will take that extra
amount<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.679> glucose<00:00:46.679> into<00:00:47.429> the<00:00:47.460> blood<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
amount of glucose into the blood and

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.540 
amount of glucose into the blood and
stores<00:00:48.469> but<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.649> only<00:00:49.829> happens<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.429> your

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
stores but that only happens if your

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.720 
stores but that only happens if your
glycogen<00:00:50.760> stores<00:00:51.239> are<00:00:51.530> empty<00:00:52.559> once<00:00:53.489> your

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
glycogen stores are empty once your

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.779 
glycogen stores are empty once your
glycogen<00:00:53.969> stores<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.600> full

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
glycogen stores are full

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
glycogen stores are full
insulin<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.210> taking<00:00:57.749> extra<00:00:58.289> blood<00:00:58.499> sugar

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
insulin will be taking extra blood sugar

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.160 
insulin will be taking extra blood sugar
into<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> fat<00:00:59.670> cells<00:00:59.999> so<00:01:02.030> think<00:01:03.030> twice<00:01:03.269> if

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
into the fat cells so think twice if

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.920 
into the fat cells so think twice if
your<00:01:04.470> glycogen<00:01:05.810> stores<00:01:06.950> full<00:01:08.630> insulin<00:01:09.630> will

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
your glycogen stores full insulin will

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.800 
your glycogen stores full insulin will
take<00:01:10.260> extra<00:01:10.950> sugar<00:01:11.340> extra<00:01:11.790> blood<00:01:12.000> sugar<00:01:12.360> into

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
take extra sugar extra blood sugar into

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.580 
take extra sugar extra blood sugar into
the<00:01:12.930> fat<00:01:13.200> cells<00:01:14.300> now<00:01:15.300> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.230> only

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the fat cells now this is not the only

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.410 
the fat cells now this is not the only
thing<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:16.950> happens<00:01:17.340> high<00:01:18.030> level<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.690> insulin

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
thing that happens high level of insulin

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.130 
thing that happens high level of insulin
actually<00:01:21.470> releases<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.710> enzyme<00:01:23.220> called

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
actually releases the enzyme called

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.940 
actually releases the enzyme called
lipoprotein<00:01:25.140> lipase<00:01:26.120> that<00:01:27.120> enzyme<00:01:27.950> simply

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
lipoprotein lipase that enzyme simply

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.270 
lipoprotein lipase that enzyme simply
seals<00:01:29.370> fat<00:01:30.030> cells<00:01:30.480> and<00:01:30.960> doesn't<00:01:31.800> allow<00:01:31.890> them

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
seals fat cells and doesn't allow them

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.480 
seals fat cells and doesn't allow them
to<00:01:32.460> break<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.390> release<00:01:33.980> fatty<00:01:34.980> acids

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
to break down and release fatty acids

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.140 
to break down and release fatty acids
into<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.910> bloodstream<00:01:37.100> basically

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
into the bloodstream basically

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.380 
into the bloodstream basically
lipoprotein<00:01:39.260> lipase<00:01:40.260> is<00:01:40.530> an<00:01:40.860> enzyme<00:01:41.390> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.310 
lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that
prevents<00:01:43.020> fat<00:01:43.740> loss<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.540> high<00:01:45.870> level<00:01:46.230> of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
prevents fat loss so high level of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.780 
prevents fat loss so high level of
insulin<00:01:46.980> are<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.990> reason<00:01:49.440> why<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.340> cannot

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
insulin are the reason why you cannot

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.110 
insulin are the reason why you cannot
lose<00:01:51.450> body<00:01:51.990> fat<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.130> even<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.760> don't<00:01:54.000> eat

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
lose body fat so even if you don't eat

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.890 
lose body fat so even if you don't eat
many<00:01:54.360> calories<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.680> most<00:01:55.980> of<00:01:56.160> your<00:01:56.310> food<00:01:56.520> is

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
many calories but most of your food is

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.840 
many calories but most of your food is
made<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:58.140> simple<00:01:58.440> sugars<00:01:58.980> you<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.490> still

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
made of simple sugars you will still

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.930 
made of simple sugars you will still
produce<00:02:00.530> too<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.710> insulin<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.730> will

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
produce too much insulin which will

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.570 
produce too much insulin which will
prevent<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.690> from<00:02:03.950> breaking<00:02:05.090> fat<00:02:06.090> cells<00:02:06.480> and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
prevent you from breaking fat cells and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.510 
prevent you from breaking fat cells and
starting<00:02:08.580> fat-burning<00:02:09.209> procedure<00:02:10.400> just<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
starting fat-burning procedure just to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.449 
starting fat-burning procedure just to
remind<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> again<00:02:12.380> inside<00:02:13.380> insulin<00:02:13.830> level

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
remind you again inside insulin level

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.500 
remind you again inside insulin level
trigger<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:18.129> production<00:02:19.129> of<00:02:19.610> enzyme<00:02:20.269> called

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
trigger the production of enzyme called

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.910 
trigger the production of enzyme called
a<00:02:20.659> lipoprotein<00:02:21.200> lipase<00:02:22.129> which<00:02:22.400> simply<00:02:23.239> seals

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
a lipoprotein lipase which simply seals

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.559 
a lipoprotein lipase which simply seals
fat<00:02:24.920> cells<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.519> doesn't<00:02:26.030> allow<00:02:26.120> them<00:02:26.390> to

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
fat cells and doesn't allow them to

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.080 
fat cells and doesn't allow them to
break<00:02:26.810> down<00:02:26.989> into<00:02:27.200> fatty<00:02:27.409> acids<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.879> you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
break down into fatty acids so you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.589 
break down into fatty acids so you
cannot<00:02:29.450> lose<00:02:29.870> body<00:02:30.799> fat

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.839 

now<00:02:35.599> while<00:02:35.870> progress<00:02:36.590> produces<00:02:37.220> insulin

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
now while progress produces insulin

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.080 
now while progress produces insulin
functions<00:02:38.629> also<00:02:39.230> produces<00:02:39.829> a<00:02:40.129> hormone<00:02:40.730> called

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
functions also produces a hormone called

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.899 
functions also produces a hormone called
glucagon<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.519> are<00:02:43.579> thinking<00:02:43.819> about

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
glucagon so if you are thinking about

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.770 
glucagon so if you are thinking about
fat<00:02:44.390> burning<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.829> fat<00:02:46.040> loss<00:02:46.280> remember<00:02:47.239> insulin

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
fat burning of fat loss remember insulin

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.580 
fat burning of fat loss remember insulin
is<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.019> your<00:02:48.170> friend

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
is not your friend

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.160 
is not your friend
but<00:02:48.829> local<00:02:49.250> go<00:02:49.400> glucagon<00:02:49.879> will<00:02:50.269> be<00:02:50.420> your<00:02:50.810> very

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
but local go glucagon will be your very

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.819 
but local go glucagon will be your very
good<00:02:51.349> friend<00:02:51.409> so<00:02:51.920> why<00:02:52.099> is<00:02:52.159> that<00:02:52.629> well<00:02:53.829> when

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
good friend so why is that well when

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.009 
good friend so why is that well when
blood<00:02:55.190> sugar<00:02:55.639> level<00:02:55.879> is<00:02:56.000> high<00:02:56.299> obviously
