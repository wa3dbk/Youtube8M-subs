terrorism or the fact they want to pray
for<00:00:50.530> me<00:00:50.770> like<00:00:51.250> I<00:00:51.280> couldn't<00:00:51.850> even<00:00:52.000> figure<00:00:52.540> out

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
for me like I couldn't even figure out

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.030 
for me like I couldn't even figure out
where<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.260> hate<00:00:53.470> was<00:00:53.770> worse<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.490> I<00:00:56.040> question

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
where the hate was worse and I question

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.610 
where the hate was worse and I question
what<00:00:57.970> social<00:00:58.480> media<00:00:58.510> has<00:00:59.050> done<00:00:59.290> terror

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
what social media has done terror

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.700 
what social media has done terror
compassion<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.520> I<00:01:01.240> think<00:01:01.840> that<00:01:02.079> social<00:01:02.500> media

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
compassion and I think that social media

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.399 
compassion and I think that social media
has<00:01:03.040> really<00:01:03.430> empowered<00:01:04.420> bullies<00:01:04.780> because<00:01:05.259> you

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
has really empowered bullies because you

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.350 
has really empowered bullies because you
get<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.860> do<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:06.189> from<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.820> comfort<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.270> your

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
get to do it from the comfort of your

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.040 
get to do it from the comfort of your
own<00:01:07.510> home<00:01:07.980> completely<00:01:09.000> anonymously<00:01:10.000> with<00:01:10.840> no

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
ramifications and that's what's

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.840 
ramifications and that's what's
happening<00:01:13.570> on<00:01:13.750> social<00:01:14.230> media<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:15.130> see<00:01:15.159> people

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
from each side dehumanizing the people
