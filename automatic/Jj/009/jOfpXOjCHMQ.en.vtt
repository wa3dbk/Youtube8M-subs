00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and you saw my last video and it's a big

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.150 
and you saw my last video and it's a big
difference<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.360> time<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.619> was<00:00:19.679> really

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
difference in time but it was really

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400 
difference in time but it was really
only<00:00:20.279> few<00:00:20.730> days<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.179> it<00:00:21.689> started<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> get

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
only few days and it started to get

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.560 
only few days and it started to get
chipped<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.009> i'm<00:00:23.220> also<00:00:23.429> bored<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.090> having<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
chipped and i'm also bored of having the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
chipped and i'm also bored of having the
same<00:00:24.720> thing<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.259> glitter<00:00:26.009> polish<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.550> usually

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
same thing and glitter polish is usually

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.019 
same thing and glitter polish is usually
hard<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.779> annoying<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.920> takes<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.820> long<00:00:30.000> time

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
hard and annoying and takes a long time

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.200 
hard and annoying and takes a long time
to<00:00:30.330> get<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.490> a<00:00:32.640> quick<00:00:33.150> way

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
to get off and so this is a quick way

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.300 
to get off and so this is a quick way
the<00:00:33.810> only<00:00:34.170> problem<00:00:34.470> is<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> probably

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
the only problem is that it probably

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.630 
the only problem is that it probably
isn't<00:00:35.640> too<00:00:36.239> good<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:36.960> skin<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
isn't too good for your skin but you

isn't too good for your skin but you
don't<00:00:38.850> need<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:40.079> because

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
like if you like me i don't really go to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.700 
like if you like me i don't really go to
plush<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.230> much<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.100> let's<00:00:44.489> get<00:00:44.699> started

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
tutorial are really easy to find the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
tutorial are really easy to find the
first<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.780> need<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.110> hands<00:00:55.559> obviously<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
first you need your hands obviously and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.360 
first you need your hands obviously and
then<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:58.140> nail<00:00:58.949> polish<00:00:59.190> remover

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
then we need some nail polish remover

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.229 
then we need some nail polish remover
and<00:00:59.970> i'm<00:01:00.180> using<00:01:00.860> qtek<00:01:02.030> strengthening<00:01:03.030> nail

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and i'm using qtek strengthening nail

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.230 
and i'm using qtek strengthening nail
polish<00:01:03.719> remover<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.280> eighty<00:01:05.759> percent

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
polish remover and it has eighty percent

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.100 
polish remover and it has eighty percent
acetone<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:08.280> works<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:08.909> well<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
acetone and this works really well but I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
acetone and this works really well but I
think<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.770> fun<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.430> other<00:01:11.610> brands<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.300> don't

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
think it's fun with other brands I don't

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.180 
think it's fun with other brands I don't
think<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:12.869> mattered<00:01:13.409> whether<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.009> has

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
think it really mattered whether it has

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.040 
think it really mattered whether it has
a<00:01:14.399> certain<00:01:14.460> owner<00:01:15.060> either<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:17.570> i'm<00:01:18.570> also

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
a certain owner either and i'm also

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.359 
a certain owner either and i'm also
using<00:01:20.149> some<00:01:21.149> cotton<00:01:21.840> balls<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.500> data<00:01:22.890> home

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
using some cotton balls and data home

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.109 
using some cotton balls and data home
brand<00:01:24.800> you<00:01:25.800> don't<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.310> use<00:01:26.429> combos<00:01:26.910> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.570 
brand you don't have to use combos you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
combos because as easy and i had a lot

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
combos because as easy and i had a lot
more<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.250> them<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:36.570> last<00:01:36.750> thing<00:01:36.929> you<00:01:37.110> need

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
more of them and the last thing you need

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.730 
more of them and the last thing you need
is<00:01:37.590> some<00:01:37.679> squares<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.820> tin<00:01:39.240> foil<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.110> i'm

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
is some squares of tin foil and i'm

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.469 
is some squares of tin foil and i'm
using<00:01:41.300> multics<00:01:42.300> al<00:01:42.630> foil<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.179> even<00:01:45.179> that's<00:01:45.330> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
using multics al foil and even that's a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.180 
using multics al foil and even that's a
stronger<00:01:45.929> than<00:01:46.050> ordinary<00:01:46.649> cool<00:01:46.950> i<00:01:47.130> really

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
stronger than ordinary cool i really

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.720 
stronger than ordinary cool i really
don't<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:47.819> it<00:01:48.119> matters<00:01:48.350> yeah

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.130 

so<00:01:54.730> the<00:01:54.850> first<00:01:55.090> thing<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.360> we're<00:01:55.870> going<00:01:56.050> to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
so the first thing that we're going to

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.680 
so the first thing that we're going to
want<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.380> do<00:01:56.650> is<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.550> get<00:01:57.670> your<00:01:58.120> cotton<00:01:58.390> ball

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
want to do is to get your cotton ball

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.050 
want to do is to get your cotton ball
and<00:01:58.840> pull<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.560> part<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.980> it<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.730> makes<00:02:00.880> a

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and pull it a part of it so it makes a

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.030 
and pull it a part of it so it makes a
bit<00:02:01.210> longer<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:01.870> if<00:02:02.050> you<00:02:02.170> have<00:02:02.350> gotten<00:02:02.800> pads

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
bit longer and if you have gotten pads

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.010 
bit longer and if you have gotten pads
you<00:02:03.310> obviously<00:02:03.850> don't<00:02:04.090> need<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.360> do<00:02:04.540> that<00:02:04.570> step

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
you obviously don't need to do that step

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.740 
you obviously don't need to do that step
but<00:02:05.710> i<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.310> used<00:02:06.730> to<00:02:06.850> could<00:02:07.060> involve<00:02:07.270> because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
but i just used to could involve because

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.469 
but i just used to could involve because
of<00:02:07.900> what<00:02:08.110> i<00:02:08.140> said<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.560> Fox<00:02:08.770> so<00:02:09.310> we're<00:02:10.180> going<00:02:10.360> to

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
of what i said the Fox so we're going to

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.080 
of what i said the Fox so we're going to
