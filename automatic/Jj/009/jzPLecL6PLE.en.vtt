00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.010
 you are interested in leaving blocked or carpeted 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.540
 these parts of the floor of the car in this 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.130
 case 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.519
 if you can count and practical that with a 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.519
 little rough 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.300
 and my intention is to leave carpeted this 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.220
 pasta that we are here 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.150
 now let's know already 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.510
 I'm going to make a little thinner 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.150
 this mixer 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 a lot of black paint that previously 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.440
 I was shaking a little 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.050
 and proceeded to paint this part in color 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.050
 black 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.600
 it is an action that ends in 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.600
 a layer a little plentiful 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.660
 almost all the interior of the vehicle do 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.660
 black stays the same 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.689
 in this part everyone to paint 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.799
 because it's going to be hard for the seat 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.250
 this is also going to be black but it's not going to 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.250
 be judged 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.409
 a little thinner 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.200
 this painting since it is opaque is not 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.620
 bright special for interiors by 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 example they require 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.590
 and do a simulation of material 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.119
 vinyl 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.119
 a game as well as find 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.670
 show a little more paint in mind 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.670
 that all black 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.479
 perfect the brush shafts and I'm going to 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.170
 close and what is known as 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.009
 velvet polo 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.450
 and I'm going to use 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.020
 a colour 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.570
 so 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.990
 I'm going to throw them on this product of 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.990
 this form 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.670
 this century 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.210
 well as crying the surface like 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.930
 make overcome 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.930
 in velvet 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.010
 the fact generously so that 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.010
 your skin is enough components 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.490
 a little left over 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.510
 wait a little 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.540
 it was a little 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.540
 that's why I could go 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.400
 and we have a surface that 70 looks a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.209
 little bit 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.209
 and the hat 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.750
 in fact 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.660
 well here I could also go 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.660
 this part also 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.750
 also because there must be agreement 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.780
 because a console that is the lever of 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.780
 changes 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.960
 I am scared 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.789
 and what is now with this for toxo 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.030
 space that difficult to link using a 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.030
 technique 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.090
 while more generous towards painting 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.090
 better is going to hurt the purpose already 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.139
 but one pole 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.720
 then made only space that just 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.540
 paint 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.750
 in this case you will choose the station a bit 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.750
 car 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.060
 since we are 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.260
 they can realize as hard space 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.980
 they are staying 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:27.050
 velvety or with amazed as you 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.050
 we call in chile 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.470
 then to shake 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.290
 but a little good all that is 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.360
 leaving who this newspaper passes it a 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.450
 increase as I lose it so much much 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.450
 plus 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.320
 there we can see a little 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.320
 as already 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.550
 the carpeted floor an acre paint is 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.080
 dry the paint we say in the 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.449
 paint dries anyway and what do I do 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:06.550
 perfectly the astonished the car 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.080
 there we have a technique to be our own 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.870
 then we continue to see the photos of the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.750
 car with machine 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.080
 good to be able to get a little out of this and 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.190
 take out the little space that remained 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.190
 with a powder 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:57.110
 in return it might not end in your case 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.110
 but it is to be able to make an image 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.000
 how could I see that he has painted on your 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.000
 case 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.009
 and about 120 black or slightly 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.860
 the gray 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.490
 and good you, the idea of ​​how 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.490
 could this one 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:18.639
 but now we are on track
