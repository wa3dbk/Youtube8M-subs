how you get to use this FL Studio
program<00:05:40.780> for<00:05:41.020> free<00:05:41.320> I<00:05:41.560> don't<00:05:41.830> use<00:05:41.980> I'm<00:05:42.190> just

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
program for free I don't use I'm just

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.670 
program for free I don't use I'm just
using<00:05:42.580> it<00:05:42.730> as<00:05:42.850> an<00:05:42.910> example<00:05:43.290> but<00:05:44.290> that's<00:05:44.500> why

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
using it as an example but that's why

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.230 
using it as an example but that's why
it's<00:05:44.860> considered<00:05:44.980> a<00:05:45.370> trojan<00:05:45.790> is<00:05:45.880> because<00:05:46.090> it

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
it's considered a trojan is because it

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.780 
it's considered a trojan is because it
alters<00:05:46.600> your<00:05:46.870> system<00:05:47.320> files<00:05:47.560> all<00:05:48.250> right<00:05:48.400> so
