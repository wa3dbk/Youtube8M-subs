00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.680
 soccer club and deserved soccer blog and scored can count on then the 

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:08.159
 black bridge 0 palm trees not 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.189
 the variety is based on scorching reports 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:16.099
 can pay homage came to give an idea of ​​the channel and the 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.410
 final of the Paulista Championship of 2008 fairly balanced game 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.890
 not to be missed in the first half 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.659
 the dinei with three attackers 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.889
 We do not destroy this function. 

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:28.839
 field 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.350
 behind the three compact friends with should do the quarterback 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.790
 but very distant of the two ruffles ricardo conceição e boa 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.160
 The left sector had a lot of freedom but it was not much 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 besides the right-back was confused in its function and I went to do the function in the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.980
 midfield leaving room for the field sector 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.630
 demonstrated 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.360
 by the side of the palm trees returns to its two defenders very well positioned 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.449
 with what is in front of you making the rush 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.399
 his two sides supported very well the attack his two half-frames 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.020
 diego souza valdir took place well both sides and gave a lot of mobility to the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.170
 palm trees that prevailed for almost the entire first half 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.700
 We noticed that the superiority in the midfield and in the attack was very great 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.290
 palm trees present did not know how to take advantage of the space given and the palm trees knew 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 to enjoy the majority of their adulthood in the attack 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.130
 we go to the second half of the Luxembourg match came from the attackers well 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.870
 open - the prince there by the right 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.900
 pressed the midfield giving many spaces on the defensive waiting 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 with henrique and industry favorites 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.750
 and he kept running in the middle field with the entrance of makelele werley 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.550
 to the left sector 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.470
 julião da costa ramos are from the game stood out and gave a little freedom 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.320
 Meanwhile marcelo soares 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.500
 his stepchild half of the defenders 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 even with the substitutions in the points points concentrated much by the middle not 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 taking advantage of the sides of the field opened by lateral advancements 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.270
 palm trees 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.490
 let's go to the starting point the teams main player bilica 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.640
 decent fragment to left side 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.530
 this kind of black bridge team frame 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 ricardo conceição was another player that already acted enough the destruction of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.120
 balls 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.280
 in the base flow of the palm trees not so the left ball output with 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.880
 henrique on the right with wendel 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.610
 these passed the ball to the two sides that passed in turn the ball 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.740
 for the two attackers the socks with a lot of mobility received the balls through the 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.750
 two attackers and pm who did the maintenance of the frame of the palm trees 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.629
 very well there in the field sector 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.069
 were 4 pass to diego souza 4 pass to kleber and from the space to valdir 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.059
 fed well the front years of the palm trees 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:31.260
 the black bridge in the second 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.250
 The TV time to build the bilica flyers asks a little more 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.300
 advanced and ricardo conceição saw the frame of giuliano by the right 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.169
 by the palm trees we noticed that he came with a very defensive posture in the second 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.989
 time wanting to hold the result and little passed the ball 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.200
 let's play area of ​​the players through it we can see the performance 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.059
 their tactical 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.099
 The left-hand side of the publipan 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.689
 attack by the right raul and did not perform the same performance and acted little by 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.890
 very closed playing field in the midfield 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.500
 by the side of the palm we fight two sides very well positioned being 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.940
 the left-back supported much more than a right-back who got stuck 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.199
 to life marking by vicent 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.429
 still in the area of ​​action we selected four main players from each 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.040
 team we have the region of the feet realized 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.450
 we note that by the black-sp bridge to focus on the defensive sector in the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.019
 left offensive mainly convincing 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.730
 by the palm side pass concentrate on the attack demonstrating a very 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.959
 more offensive from the alviverde team 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.729
 in the table we have described which are the main passers of student teams 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.679
 by the side of the black bridge the four main passers are men of 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:36.739
 marking and by the palm side 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.150
 three of the top four passers are men facing the other pm who did 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.610
 very well the maintenance of the game 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.840
 if we consider the percentage of players' passes relative to the team we will have 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.159
 with the square 2 50% the space of the team 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.469
 accompanying the graphics devolution of part of the teams in the games when it left 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.579
 the goal of the palms 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.209
 20 minutes of play after leaving the nest of possession only palm trees and a 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.579
 under possession 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.739
 just after the goal the two teams alternated years of ownership 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.569
 until the security guards change valdivia by Denilson the palm trees that 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.669
 I was going to bump 5 minutes I fall to the pasi 5 minutes 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.089
 at the end of the game with Cyprus also increased health pass but can not 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:17.349
 produce light 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.339
 observing some specific driving fundamentals buried in addition to 

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.210
 to serve as interception 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.590
 we put team of the black bridge presented vomit stations high of its field 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.539
 defensive 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.949
 concentrations of intersections those he's mostly wrong Diego 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.949
 souza but not only the right sector 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.120
 by the palm side too many interceptions of the defensive sector either 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.599
 offensive but far better distributed on the field showing a tactical cutout 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:41.610
 very good 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.879
 from the left side on the right side some attempts to cross over 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.430
 all wrong 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.020
 in the finals we noticed that the black bridge team had great difficulty in 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.279
 enter the area palmeirense 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.699
 your achievements 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:54.960
 were a large patio 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.120
 outside the area I try to give some tips bessa and all wrong the concierge 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.879
 Pontepretana was not good 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.439
 by the palm side the aim improved the shows were a little over 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.639
 within the area and with that to achieve a goal of the victory with a goal of 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.300
 kleber head 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.680
 This was an analysis of the current 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.110
 the most complete information on football blogging games with all kind of 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.500
 condition
