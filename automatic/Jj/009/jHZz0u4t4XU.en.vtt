sense like you can see it all over his
arms<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.120> his<00:03:03.900> neck<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.320> whatnot<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
arms and is in his neck and whatnot and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.260 
arms and is in his neck and whatnot and
his<00:03:05.040> wings<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.670> wings<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> little<00:03:06.090> better

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
his wings the wings are a little better

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.350 
his wings the wings are a little better
camouflaged<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.760> that's<00:03:08.760> an<00:03:08.880> easy<00:03:09.060> thing<00:03:09.239> to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
camouflaged but that's an easy thing to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.820 
camouflaged but that's an easy thing to
overlook<00:03:09.690> because<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.020> obviously<00:03:10.500> you're

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
overlook because it obviously you're

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.350 
overlook because it obviously you're
buying<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.250> articulated<00:03:11.820> figure<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.270> you

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
buying and articulated figure if you

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.610 
buying and articulated figure if you
didn't<00:03:12.570> want<00:03:12.720> articulated<00:03:13.290> figure<00:03:13.500> you

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
didn't want articulated figure you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.660 
didn't want articulated figure you
probably<00:03:13.709> hunt<00:03:14.010> down<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.130> statue<00:03:14.400> or<00:03:14.550> something

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
probably hunt down a statue or something

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.940 
probably hunt down a statue or something
so<00:03:15.570> that's<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.230> minor<00:03:16.470> thing<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.800> look

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
so that's just a minor thing to look

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.229 
so that's just a minor thing to look
over<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.340> otherwise<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.700> think<00:03:17.850> he<00:03:18.060> looks

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
over but otherwise I think he looks

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.590 
over but otherwise I think he looks
great<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.720> think<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.320> got<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> colors<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:19.950> him

I think the articulation a little bit

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.319 
I think the articulation a little bit
better<00:03:43.440> least<00:03:44.070> in<00:03:44.190> my<00:03:44.310> opinion<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.850> his<00:03:45.090> tail

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
better least in my opinion is his tail

you<00:04:40.500> can<00:04:40.650> move<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.949> side<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.190> side<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.930> a

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
you can move it side to side and a

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.890 
you can move it side to side and a
little<00:04:43.500> bit<00:04:43.620> up<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.860> down<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.389> a<00:04:45.419> very

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
little bit up and down so that is a very

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.920 
little bit up and down so that is a very
cool<00:04:46.580> possibly<00:04:47.580> unnecessary<00:04:48.210> detail<00:04:48.600> i'm<00:04:48.780> not

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
cool possibly unnecessary detail i'm not

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.300 
cool possibly unnecessary detail i'm not
trying<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.199> feel<00:04:49.380> about<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.770> but<00:04:49.919> i<00:04:49.949> think<00:04:50.190> it's

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
trying to feel about it but i think it's

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.640 
trying to feel about it but i think it's
kind<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.550> neat<00:04:50.840> as<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:51.900> can<00:04:52.139> tell<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.440> wings

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
kind of neat as you can tell the wings

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.740 
kind of neat as you can tell the wings
are<00:04:52.800> articulated<00:04:53.490> they<00:04:54.120> can<00:04:54.300> swivel<00:04:54.539> around

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
are articulated they can swivel around

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.320 
are articulated they can swivel around
here<00:04:55.350> right<00:04:56.310> here<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:56.910> can<00:04:57.030> move<00:04:57.120> them<00:04:57.270> up

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
here right here so you can move them up

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.300 
here right here so you can move them up
and<00:04:57.479> down<00:04:57.570> you've<00:04:58.410> got<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.620> nice<00:04:58.770> been<00:04:59.039> joint

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
and down you've got a nice been joint

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.070 
and down you've got a nice been joint
here<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.820> nice<00:05:00.240> engine<00:05:00.479> joint<00:05:00.690> here<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:00.930> mean

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
here a nice engine joint here I mean

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.140 
here a nice engine joint here I mean
been<00:05:01.289> joint<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.280> can<00:05:02.580> get<00:05:02.760> them<00:05:02.970> in<00:05:03.000> a

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
been joint so you can get them in a

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.050 
been joint so you can get them in a
variety<00:05:03.419> of<00:05:03.690> poses<00:05:04.470> so<00:05:05.070> very<00:05:05.370> well<00:05:05.580> done<00:05:05.789> there

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
variety of poses so very well done there

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.140 
variety of poses so very well done there
his<00:05:06.810> legs<00:05:07.110> here<00:05:07.470> are<00:05:07.680> on<00:05:07.979> kind<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.610> large

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
his legs here are on kind of a large

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.279 
his legs here are on kind of a large
ball<00:05:09.389> joint<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.780> like<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:09.930> swivel<00:05:10.199> around

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
ball joint to like a swivel around

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.990 
ball joint to like a swivel around
obviously<00:05:11.280> you're<00:05:11.370> not<00:05:11.430> expecting<00:05:11.820> too<00:05:11.970> much

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
obviously you're not expecting too much

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.730 
obviously you're not expecting too much
because<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.599> the<00:05:12.690> nature<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.139> ways<00:05:13.410> legs

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
because of the nature of the ways legs

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.770 
because of the nature of the ways legs
are<00:05:13.979> I<00:05:14.250> need<00:05:14.729> to<00:05:14.789> have<00:05:14.910> a<00:05:14.970> swivel<00:05:15.270> joint<00:05:15.419> here

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
are I need to have a swivel joint here

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.990 
are I need to have a swivel joint here
swivel<00:05:16.740> joint<00:05:16.919> here<00:05:17.190> so<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:17.460> can<00:05:17.639> get<00:05:17.759> some

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
swivel joint here so you can get some

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.879 
swivel joint here so you can get some
smoky<00:05:18.750> poses<00:05:19.110> in<00:05:19.199> his<00:05:19.320> leg<00:05:19.470> they're<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.770> most

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
smoky poses in his leg they're the most

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.740 
smoky poses in his leg they're the most
hindered<00:05:20.340> but<00:05:20.729> that's<00:05:21.210> just<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.419> way<00:05:21.570> he's

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
hindered but that's just the way he's

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.260 
hindered but that's just the way he's
supposed<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.139> be<00:05:22.349> his<00:05:23.010> tail<00:05:23.280> here<00:05:23.580> not<00:05:24.090> too

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
supposed to be his tail here not too

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.909 
supposed to be his tail here not too
dissimilar<00:05:24.419> from<00:05:24.690> you<00:05:24.930> tues<00:05:25.139> has<00:05:25.349> lots<00:05:25.770> of

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
dissimilar from you tues has lots of

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.279 
dissimilar from you tues has lots of
different<00:05:26.310> little<00:05:26.660> articulation<00:05:27.660> links<00:05:28.050> so

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
different little articulation links so

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.420 
different little articulation links so
you<00:05:28.320> can<00:05:28.440> move<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:28.889> around<00:05:28.949> in<00:05:29.190> various

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
you can move it around in various

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.939 
you can move it around in various
positions<00:05:29.550> you're<00:05:30.510> going<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.690> want<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.949> be

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
positions you're going to want to be

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.350 
positions you're going to want to be
careful<00:05:32.250> when<00:05:32.520> you're<00:05:32.610> moving<00:05:32.880> it<00:05:33.120> just<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:33.330> it

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
careful when you're moving it just so it

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.600 
careful when you're moving it just so it
doesn't<00:05:33.419> pop<00:05:33.630> out<00:05:33.900> but<00:05:34.620> so<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.860> can<00:05:35.070> get<00:05:35.340> the

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
doesn't pop out but so you can get the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.540 
doesn't pop out but so you can get the
variety<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.389> movement<00:05:36.900> there<00:05:37.110> but<00:05:37.949> yeah

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
variety of movement there but yeah

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.850 
variety of movement there but yeah
overall<00:05:39.000> very<00:05:39.389> well<00:05:39.599> done<00:05:39.870> all<00:05:40.710> the

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
overall very well done all the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.899 
overall very well done all the
articulation<00:05:41.430> is<00:05:41.520> right<00:05:41.669> where<00:05:41.820> it's

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
articulation is right where it's

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.040 
articulation is right where it's
supposed<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.270> be<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:42.449> can<00:05:42.630> get<00:05:42.750> them<00:05:42.840> in<00:05:42.900> some

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
supposed to be you can get them in some

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.219 
supposed to be you can get them in some
cool<00:05:43.260> poses<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.970> use<00:05:45.150> tongue<00:05:45.449> articulation

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
cool poses and use tongue articulation

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.779 
cool poses and use tongue articulation
so<00:05:47.039> now<00:05:47.159> let's<00:05:47.370> do<00:05:47.520> this<00:05:47.669> look<00:05:49.010> look<00:05:50.010> everybody

favorites but I think it's a very very
good<00:06:03.360> figure<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:03.930> partly<00:06:04.860> because<00:06:05.010> I<00:06:05.220> like
