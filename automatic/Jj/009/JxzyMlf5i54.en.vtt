00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.310
 today I wish you the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.040

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.860
 learn how to make a lot of money on 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.430
 gt online easily then for 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.210
 start it will have to be two have one 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.810
 motorcycle so you get on the bike without 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.730
 helmet 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.480
 you do a little motorcycle ride like 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.649
 it's the helmet for the wrong passenger 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.539
 at all it is for the driver 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.739
 he will take it off 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:50.000
 we come back we hire so it's not 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.210
 embarrassing then you come back near 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.859
 from your garage you leave your motorcycle 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.960
 in passenger mode with the second player 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:02.289
 on top you go in your cage 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.289
 beautiful garage 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.200
 when you choose the car that you 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.399
 want quotes in duplicate so 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.840
 I 'm going to take this one because at the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.729
 resale is the one that is worth the most 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.350
 dear so you come out with this 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.819
 car 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:29.659
 and that's where the second 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:36.130
 player so you get out of the age is the 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.130
 second player will have to kill you 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.689
 here he is killing you and then I will 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.640
 will show the vision of the second day of 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.360
 following after so for now 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.250
 you reappear normally and there 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.549
 you are going to have your second car 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.770
 keira that will reappear so in the 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.659
 street further there but it is not necessary that the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:08.629
 second player get off the bike 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:10.399
 before you reappeared so that's 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.170
 very important that the player are waiting 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.359
 that you reappeared before you 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.420
 get off the bike otherwise the car does not 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:19.040
 public passes and therefore the latter you 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.500
 put it in your garage the one that 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.269
 you have recovered we can see the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.190
 second player who returns with the same 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.540
 exactly exactly the same car 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.280
 so the one you got back you 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.840
 you put it in the garage 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.109
 then my you get out of the garage to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.109
 foot 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.840
 and the second player who had 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.460
 your car 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.870
 so the second player has to show 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:53.690
 get in the car you make it you 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.690
 go to los santos custom 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.420
 so the most important thing is that the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.640
 player do not get off a motorcycle before 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.640
 that you appeared once the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.890
 player has reappeared it must be that the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.750
 second player is complicated must 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.500
 that the second player goes up in the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.980
 car of the first not to she 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.680
 disappears 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.690
 itself in turn so once 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.480
 los santos custom you go on 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.690
 internet so heading traveling transport 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.140
 you take the last site you 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.440
 choose the rebel karine it's a 4 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.959
 4 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.130
 so you buy it there costs 3000 the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.640
 color that you want it did not 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.370
 important 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.550
 you choose where you are 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.680
 do you want it delivered then you 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.100
 call your mechanic by putting both 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.260
 front wheels 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.580
 in the santos lot that rings for tak the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.180
 door closes so before entering 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.230
 you put the cursor on the rebel 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.980
 you go to the bottom of the los santos custom 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.510
 you confirm the delivery of the vehicle 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.390
 and then you want this done the arrow

 right to repair your vehicle and 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.420
 so sell it 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.860
 so you get repaired and you 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.959
 wait in the bottom right of your 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.280
 screen right next to choose there is a 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.530
 small loading time which 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.269
 appear so here he went to him 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.620
 appeared you expect them to be 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.950
 who defines so who disappear then 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.950
 we will wait 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:36.540
 here and now you can sell 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:39.280
 your vehicle you see more 649 me 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.570
 then you walk out no 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.230
 abnormal as if you were traveling 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.480
 other vehicle 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.970
 we are right now for the ace 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.430
 the second part if you're in 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.010
 passwords and judge so that's it's 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.440
 me the passenger this time so I'm 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.990
 on his bike still without helmet 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.370
 conflict around him a motorcycle he 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.050
 headphones but it's okay as I 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.970
 you told me I say huh it 's really going 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.760
 in importance that the driver and a 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:10.419
 headphones or we so we come back to the 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.930
 garage where he will park so me 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.550
 always on the bike I do not go down there 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.790
 will go into this garage to take 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.790
 his car 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.500
 once that comes out I'll go 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.780
 have to kill him so he will line up 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:35.970
 in front of me for me to improve a 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.060
 better view on his head we will say 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.229
 so here I am watching of course the radar 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.229
 to wait for them to reappear 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.330
 hop once it appeared I can 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.449
 get off his bike and take his 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.449
 car 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.330
 so he 'll do the same with the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.330
 car that reappeared next to him 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.009
 so I have a star mail either by before 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:13.199
 you can see that both cars 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.349
 are exactly the same as everything at 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.349
 time 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.180
 so he's going to put his car in his 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.180
 garage 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.680
 so here he comes to recover his 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.180
 vehicle and will then be able to do this 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.400
 that I showed you previously so 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.170
