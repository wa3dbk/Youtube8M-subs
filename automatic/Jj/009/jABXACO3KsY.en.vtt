it<00:02:04.909> was<00:02:05.149> really<00:02:05.329> fun<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.749> I<00:02:05.840> liked<00:02:06.109> it<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:06.499> it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
it was really fun and I liked it but it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.440 
it was really fun and I liked it but it
was<00:02:06.710> nowhere<00:02:06.920> near<00:02:07.100> as<00:02:07.460> hard<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.060> original

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
was nowhere near as hard as the original

the<00:02:18.020> Wii<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.500> heard<00:02:18.830> there<00:02:18.980> was<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.100> pretty<00:02:19.340> awful

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
the Wii I heard there was a pretty awful

and I don't think I ever will the major

and I don't think I ever will the major
problem<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.030> had<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.390> lack<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.810> good<00:02:26.990> feel

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
problem I had was the lack of good feel

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.080 
problem I had was the lack of good feel
on<00:02:27.319> how<00:02:27.620> smoothly<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.430> pieces<00:02:28.760> were<00:02:28.880> coming

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
on how smoothly the pieces were coming

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.820 
on how smoothly the pieces were coming
out<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.690> don't<00:02:29.930> blame<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.200> programmers<00:02:30.710> for

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
out I don't blame the programmers for

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.080 
out I don't blame the programmers for
this<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.460> was<00:02:31.520> very<00:02:31.730> hard<00:02:32.000> to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
this one because it was very hard to

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.030 
this one because it was very hard to
translate<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:32.750> type<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:32.989> game<00:02:33.379> even<00:02:33.860> though

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
translate this type of game even though

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.220 
translate this type of game even though
boom<00:02:34.459> blocks<00:02:34.819> did<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.150> great<00:02:35.360> job<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.959> couple

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
boom blocks did a great job a couple

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.570 
boom blocks did a great job a couple
years<00:02:36.650> back<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.430> was<00:02:37.459> fun<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.000> play<00:02:38.030> for<00:02:38.420> a

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
years back it was fun to play for a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.710 
years back it was fun to play for a
few<00:02:38.700> minutes<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.330> could<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.630> an

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
few minutes and it could be an

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.240 
few minutes and it could be an
interesting<00:02:39.960> party<00:02:40.470> game<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.130> not

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
interesting party game but it's not

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.380 
interesting party game but it's not
really<00:02:41.460> one<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> those<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.060> keep<00:02:42.240> your

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
really one of those that will keep your

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.660 
really one of those that will keep your
attention<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.960> long<00:02:43.140> pop<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.040> there<00:02:44.460> are<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
attention for long pop it there are a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
attention for long pop it there are a
few<00:02:44.820> games<00:02:45.090> out<00:02:45.270> there<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.450> are<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.810> suited

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
few games out there that are not suited

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.320 
few games out there that are not suited
for<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.440> video<00:02:46.710> game<00:02:46.770> translation<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.060> think

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
for a video game translation and I think

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.220 
for a video game translation and I think
this<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.600> one<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.930> them

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
this is one of them

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.660 
this is one of them
it<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.590> didn't<00:02:49.830> feel<00:02:49.950> right<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.250> play<00:02:50.490> this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
it just didn't feel right to play this

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.430 
it just didn't feel right to play this
game<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.060> Wii<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.750> was<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:52.140> something

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
game on the Wii it was really something

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.810 
game on the Wii it was really something
that<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.620> needed<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.890> hold<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.340> your<00:02:53.370> hand<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
that you needed to hold in your hand to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.640 
that you needed to hold in your hand to
do<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> movements<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.960> object<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.590> game

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
do the movements the object of this game

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.350 
do the movements the object of this game
is<00:02:56.010> easy<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.670> keep<00:02:57.000> making<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
is easy you just keep making the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.700 
is easy you just keep making the
movement<00:02:57.540> they<00:02:57.780> told<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.260> do<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.440> the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
movement they told you to do on the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.130 
movement they told you to do on the
screen<00:02:58.920> until<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.730> screw<00:03:00.060> up<00:03:00.210> sure<00:03:00.720> some<00:03:01.020> of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
screen until you screw up sure some of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.600 
screen until you screw up sure some of
the<00:03:01.200> moves<00:03:01.380> could<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.680> done<00:03:01.890> but<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> lot<00:03:02.490> of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the moves could be done but a lot of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.010 
the moves could be done but a lot of
them<00:03:02.700> made<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.940> do<00:03:03.060> special<00:03:03.330> movements<00:03:03.900> with

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
them made you do special movements with

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.020 
them made you do special movements with
the<00:03:04.110> Wiimote<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.710> just<00:03:05.130> wasn't<00:03:05.430> natural<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.850> do

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
the Wiimote it just wasn't natural to do

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.550 
the Wiimote it just wasn't natural to do
them<00:03:06.240> plus<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.690> think<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.960> motion<00:03:07.110> controls

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
them plus I think the motion controls

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.500 
them plus I think the motion controls
were<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.710> bit<00:03:07.950> broken<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:08.640> one<00:03:08.850> even<00:03:09.360> when

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
were a bit broken on this one even when

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.150 
were a bit broken on this one even when
I<00:03:09.540> did<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> perfect<00:03:10.200> motion<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.680> they<00:03:10.830> wanted

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
I did a perfect motion like they wanted

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.860 
I did a perfect motion like they wanted
me<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.700> still<00:03:12.060> didn't<00:03:12.270> read<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.480> right<00:03:12.720> all

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
me to it still didn't read it right all

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.990 
me to it still didn't read it right all
the<00:03:12.900> time<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.740> sometimes<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.280> got<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.460> bad<00:03:14.700> score

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
the time so sometimes I got a bad score

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.030 
the time so sometimes I got a bad score
for<00:03:15.300> no<00:03:15.420> good<00:03:15.600> reason<00:03:15.960> at<00:03:16.080> all<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.800> very

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
for no good reason at all but it's very

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.800 
for no good reason at all but it's very
least<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.430> have<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.640> give<00:03:17.760> some<00:03:18.030> props<00:03:18.330> for<00:03:18.660> them

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
least I have to give some props for them

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.000 
least I have to give some props for them
to<00:03:18.990> at<00:03:19.080> least<00:03:19.110> attempt<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.770> faithful

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
to at least attempt a faithful

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.220 
to at least attempt a faithful
representation<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> game<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.630> was<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.900> bold

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
representation of the game it was a bold

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.870 
representation of the game it was a bold
idea<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.709> try<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:22.950> use<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> motion<00:03:23.430> controls

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
idea to try and use the motion controls

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.240 
idea to try and use the motion controls
to<00:03:24.209> recreate<00:03:24.630> pop<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.530> unfortunately<00:03:25.680> it

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
to recreate pop it but unfortunately it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.340 
to recreate pop it but unfortunately it
just<00:03:26.280> didn't<00:03:26.730> work<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.910> well<00:03:27.270> Connect<00:03:27.990> four

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
just didn't work that well Connect four

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.770 
just didn't work that well Connect four

classic version by having to use both

classic version by having to use both
sides<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.740> board<00:03:41.040> most<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.640> time<00:03:41.790> you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
sides of the board most the time you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.670 
sides of the board most the time you
would<00:03:42.030> drop<00:03:42.209> one<00:03:42.480> side<00:03:42.720> disks<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.530> could

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
would drop one side disks but you could

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.530 
would drop one side disks but you could
choose<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.890> change<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> both<00:03:44.730> sided<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.300> if

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
choose to change to a both sided one if

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.420 
choose to change to a both sided one if
you<00:03:45.750> had<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.080> available<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.830> whole<00:03:46.980> concept

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
you had one available the whole concept

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.830 
you had one available the whole concept
of<00:03:47.580> playing<00:03:47.790> both<00:03:48.030> sides<00:03:48.360> would<00:03:48.600> have<00:03:48.720> been<00:03:48.810> a

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
of playing both sides would have been a

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.180 
of playing both sides would have been a
lot<00:03:48.989> better<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.530> they<00:03:49.739> showed<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.070> on<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
lot better if they showed you on the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.650 
lot better if they showed you on the
screen<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.790> other<00:03:50.940> side<00:03:51.209> looked<00:03:51.420> like

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
screen what the other side looked like

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.150 
screen what the other side looked like
instead<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.350> have<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.470> see<00:03:52.680> what<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.920> color

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
instead you have to see what the color

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.590 
instead you have to see what the color
is<00:03:53.280> behind<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> main<00:03:54.150> board

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
is behind the main board

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.030 
is behind the main board
I<00:03:54.750> understand<00:03:55.290> they<00:03:55.410> wanted<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.739> put<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> little

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
I understand they wanted to put a little

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.710 
I understand they wanted to put a little
bit<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.250> strategy<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.970> game<00:03:57.000> but<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.600> was

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
bit of strategy in the game but it was

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.630 
bit of strategy in the game but it was
at<00:03:57.870> times<00:03:58.080> very<00:03:58.230> confusing<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.040> play<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
at times very confusing to play and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.009 
at times very confusing to play and
honestly<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.090> wish<00:04:00.300> they<00:04:00.420> would<00:04:00.600> just<00:04:00.630> stuck

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
honestly I wish they would just stuck

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.020 
honestly I wish they would just stuck
with<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.290> original<00:04:01.380> concept<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.640> perfect

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
with the original concept it was perfect

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.930 
with the original concept it was perfect
the<00:04:03.120> way<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.420> was<00:04:03.650> picture<00:04:04.650> Rica<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:05.550> this<00:04:05.730> one

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the way it was picture Rica now this one

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.640 
the way it was picture Rica now this one
was<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> lot<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.390> fun<00:04:06.690> they<00:04:07.200> helped<00:04:07.350> me<00:04:07.440> find

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
was a lot of fun they helped me find

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.350 
was a lot of fun they helped me find
different<00:04:08.010> things<00:04:08.160> inside<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.580> jumbled<00:04:09.060> set<00:04:09.239> of

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
different things inside a jumbled set of

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.500 
pictures the things that you had to find
were<00:04:11.190> determined<00:04:11.700> on<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.790> card<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.330> had

to draw and the dice roll that you got I

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.890 
to draw and the dice roll that you got I
liked<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.000> various<00:04:15.330> ways<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.660> could<00:04:15.780> play
