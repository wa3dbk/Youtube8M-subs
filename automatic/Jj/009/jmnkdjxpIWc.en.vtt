up<00:01:43.820> i<00:01:44.030> think<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.510> pitch<00:01:44.690> will<00:01:44.840> be<00:01:44.930> better<00:01:45.110> so

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
up i think the pitch will be better so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.320 
up i think the pitch will be better so

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
the conditions and i made it difficult

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.360 
the conditions and i made it difficult
to<00:01:52.820> do<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.960> think<00:01:54.290> you'll<00:01:54.410> see<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:55.250> no

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
not for the most part I thought we were

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.010 
not for the most part I thought we were
pretty<00:05:46.830> solid<00:05:47.340> kept<00:05:47.580> him<00:05:47.730> out<00:05:47.900> didn't<00:05:48.900> give

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
pretty solid kept him out didn't give

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.650

him<00:05:49.110> two<00:05:49.290> too<00:05:49.440> many<00:05:49.470> chances<00:05:49.890> so<00:05:50.480> you<00:05:51.480> know<00:05:51.570> on

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
him two too many chances so you know on

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.150 
him two too many chances so you know on
the<00:05:51.780> balance<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.200> things<00:05:52.380> we<00:05:52.680> deserve<00:05:52.980> what<00:05:53.100> we

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
the balance of things we deserve what we

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.980 
the balance of things we deserve what we
got<00:05:53.310> to<00:05:53.430> me<00:05:53.520> it's<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.120> big<00:05:54.330> step<00:05:54.540> along<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:54.840> way

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
got to me it's a big step along the way

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.900 
got to me it's a big step along the way
to<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.380> World<00:05:55.560> Cup<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:56.010> now<00:05:56.130> put<00:05:56.310> ourselves<00:05:56.460> in

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
the in the last round so obviously along

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.410 
the in the last round so obviously along
along<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.620> road<00:06:01.800> there<00:06:02.220> was<00:06:02.400> some<00:06:02.670> some<00:06:03.210> ups

along the road there was some some ups
and<00:06:03.600> downs<00:06:03.870> but<00:06:04.200> that's<00:06:04.770> exactly<00:06:04.920> how<00:06:05.370> we<00:06:05.400> we

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
and downs but that's exactly how we we

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.200 
and downs but that's exactly how we we
expected<00:06:06.450> it<00:06:06.540> would<00:06:06.660> be<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:07.110> so

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
expected it would be and so

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.120 
expected it would be and so
