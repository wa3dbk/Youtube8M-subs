00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
so or I was trying to conditioner in the
pain<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.540> shampoo<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:35.009> good<00:01:35.159> pick

pain of shampoo so if you do good pick
these<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.390> gotta<00:01:36.630> pay<00:01:37.140> attention<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
these up you gotta pay attention to the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
these up you gotta pay attention to the
packaging<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.150> need<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> put<00:01:39.509> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
packaging I think they need to put that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
packaging I think they need to put that
look<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> pet<00:01:40.470> peeve<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
look that's the pet peeve about these is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.200 
look that's the pet peeve about these is
they<00:01:41.670> need<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> make<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:44.030> can<00:01:45.030> identify

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
they need to make it so you can identify

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.609 
they need to make it so you can identify
the<00:01:45.600> difference<00:01:45.960> between<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> two<00:01:46.409> that's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the difference between the two that's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.840 
the difference between the two that's
only<00:01:46.860> thing<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.070> don't<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
only thing I don't like about that is
