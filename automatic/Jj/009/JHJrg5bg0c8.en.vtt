00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.690 

moving<00:00:14.750> on<00:00:14.809> to<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:14.990> fuzzy<00:00:15.200> drive<00:00:15.559> this<00:00:16.490> is

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
moving on to the fuzzy drive this is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.740 
moving on to the fuzzy drive this is
made<00:00:16.880> by<00:00:16.910> EWS<00:00:17.779> and<00:00:18.080> this<00:00:18.980> pedal<00:00:19.700> is<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.450> real

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
made by EWS and this pedal is a real

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.220 
made by EWS and this pedal is a real
extreme<00:00:21.110> fuzz<00:00:21.529> kind<00:00:21.950> of<00:00:22.009> a<00:00:22.099> fuzz<00:00:22.400> face<00:00:22.640> pedal

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
extreme fuzz kind of a fuzz face pedal

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.409 
extreme fuzz kind of a fuzz face pedal
and<00:00:24.230> here<00:00:24.830> is<00:00:24.980> all<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.369> way<00:00:25.640> I<00:00:25.820> think<00:00:25.939> this<00:00:26.239> is

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
and here is all the way I think this is

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.970 
and here is all the way I think this is
with<00:00:26.570> all<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:26.900> way<00:00:27.050> let<00:00:27.380> me<00:00:27.470> turn<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:27.680> on<00:00:27.829> yeah

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
with all the way let me turn it on yeah

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:47.650 
with all the way let me turn it on yeah
this<00:00:28.279> is<00:00:28.399> with<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:28.550> gain<00:00:28.730> all<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.000> way<00:00:29.119> up

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.520 

so<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.020> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.290> fuzz-face

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so you get that kind of fuzz-face

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.990 
so you get that kind of fuzz-face
quality<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.490> but<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> little

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
quality to it but it is a little

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.380 
quality to it but it is a little
different<00:00:51.420> though<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.390> base

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
different though it's not as a base

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.120 
different though it's not as a base
heavy<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.900> fuzz<00:00:55.140> face<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:55.830> a<00:00:55.860> little

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
heavy as a fuzz face it's got a little

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.310 
heavy as a fuzz face it's got a little
bit<00:00:56.250> less<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.990> like<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
bit less of that and I really like it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.350 
bit less of that and I really like it
and<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> roll<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.040> volume<00:00:59.880> down<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> little

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
and if you roll the volume down a little

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:09.770 
and if you roll the volume down a little
bit<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.720> kind<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.080> real<00:01:01.350> nice<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:09.660> can

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
bit you get kind of a real nice it can

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
bit you get kind of a real nice it can
be<00:01:09.870> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.140> versatile<00:01:10.620> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
be kind of versatile you know all the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.500 
be kind of versatile you know all the
way<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:13.580> heavy<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.940> turn<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> down

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
way up it's heavy but you turn it down

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.030 
way up it's heavy but you turn it down
about<00:01:15.780> half<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.260> you<00:01:16.410> get<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:16.890> nice

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
about half way and you get a really nice

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:27.780 
about half way and you get a really nice
overdrive

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:53.440 

and<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.820> cleans<00:01:31.060> up<00:01:31.240> real<00:01:31.450> nice

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:05.260 

you

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.700 

it's<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.480> just<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.900> know<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.500> rolling

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
it's kind of just you know just rolling

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's kind of just you know just rolling
the<00:02:07.890> volume<00:02:08.220> down<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.790> these<00:02:09.090> nice

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the volume down and you get these nice

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.450 
the volume down and you get these nice
different<00:02:10.050> tones<00:02:10.290> you<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
different tones you know you get the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.770 
different tones you know you get the
full-on<00:02:11.790> distortion<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.600> roll<00:02:12.750> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
full-on distortion and then you roll it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.970 
full-on distortion and then you roll it
back<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> little<00:02:13.170> bit<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.770> kind<00:02:13.950> of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
back a little bit you have that kind of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.360 
back a little bit you have that kind of
still<00:02:14.310> again<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.730> nice<00:02:14.970> Hendrix<00:02:15.390> equality

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
still again that nice Hendrix equality

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.730 
still again that nice Hendrix equality
now<00:02:17.370> we're<00:02:18.330> under<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> brute<00:02:18.750> Drive<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
now we're under the brute Drive now the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.020 
now we're under the brute Drive now the
difference<00:02:20.070> between<00:02:20.100> these<00:02:20.400> two<00:02:20.580> pedals<00:02:20.880> from

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
difference between these two pedals from

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.660 
difference between these two pedals from
my<00:02:21.240> ears<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> fuzz<00:02:22.800> meaning<00:02:23.550> it's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
my ears is one is a fuzz meaning it's

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.330 
my ears is one is a fuzz meaning it's
got<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> more<00:02:24.120> fuzzy<00:02:24.390> Distortion<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:26.130> one

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
got a more fuzzy Distortion and this one

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.240 
got a more fuzzy Distortion and this one
is<00:02:26.460> less<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:27.930> more<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.290> more

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
is less of that and it's more of a more

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.650 
is less of that and it's more of a more
of<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.370> mid-range<00:02:29.580> II<00:02:29.910> distortion<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.600> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
of a mid-range II distortion but it's a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.320 
of a mid-range II distortion but it's a
much<00:02:30.810> thicker<00:02:31.080> than<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.860> AC<00:02:32.010> booster<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
much thicker than the AC booster and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:46.160 
much thicker than the AC booster and
this<00:02:33.450> one<00:02:33.600> sounds<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.990> this

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.410 

it's<00:02:46.830> very<00:02:47.010> thick<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.819> know<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.090> got<00:02:48.270> kind

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
it's very thick you know it's got kind

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.940 
it's very thick you know it's got kind
of<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.630> Marshall<00:02:49.140> sound<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.830> know

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
of that Marshall sound to it you know

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:04.210 
of that Marshall sound to it you know
it's<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.160> nice<00:02:50.340> big<00:02:50.610> overdrive

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.090 

you<00:03:05.060> click<00:03:05.330> this<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.740> goes<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.010> to

pretty huge distortion so if you're
wondering<00:03:50.280> what<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.609> differences<00:03:51.030> are<00:03:51.209> I'll

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
wondering what the differences are I'll

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.390 
wondering what the differences are I'll
just<00:03:51.810> show<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.079> real<00:03:52.349> quick<00:03:52.620> excuse<00:03:53.370> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
fuzzy drive again with the same pickup -

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:06.710 
fuzzy drive again with the same pickup -
I'll<00:03:55.650> use<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.430> treble<00:03:56.760> pickup

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.420 

so<00:04:14.870> some<00:04:15.079> huge<00:04:15.379> difference<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.920> mean<00:04:16.070> there's

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
so some huge difference I mean there's

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.159 
so some huge difference I mean there's
more<00:04:16.669> mids<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.329> brute<00:04:17.539> Drive<00:04:17.570> than<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
more mids in the brute Drive than the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.499 
more mids in the brute Drive than the
fuzzy<00:04:18.380> drive<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.759> fuzzy<00:04:19.940> drive<00:04:20.239> is<00:04:20.359> just

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
fuzzy drive and the fuzzy drive is just

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.150 
fuzzy drive and the fuzzy drive is just
supposed<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.900> be<00:04:21.019> kind<00:04:21.199> of<00:04:21.289> a<00:04:21.380> fuzz<00:04:21.620> face<00:04:21.889> you

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
supposed to be kind of a fuzz face you

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.830 
supposed to be kind of a fuzz face you
know<00:04:22.280> it's<00:04:22.460> got<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.639> quality<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.419> but

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
know it's got that quality to it but

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.779 
know it's got that quality to it but
like<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:24.050> said<00:04:24.259> you<00:04:24.380> can<00:04:24.530> mess<00:04:24.710> with<00:04:24.889> it<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:25.669> can

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
like I said you can mess with it you can

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.460 
like I said you can mess with it you can
turn<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.060> game<00:04:26.270> down<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.479> bit<00:04:26.720> -<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.960> have<00:04:27.259> it<00:04:27.350> all

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
turn the game down a bit - I have it all

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.930 
turn the game down a bit - I have it all
all<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.800> way<00:04:28.100> up<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.490> with<00:04:28.639> any<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:28.880> these

all the way up and with any of these

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.629 
all the way up and with any of these
pedals<00:04:29.360> it's<00:04:30.050> obviously<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:31.070> guitar<00:04:31.400> players

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
pedals it's obviously the guitar players

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.480 
pedals it's obviously the guitar players

with<00:04:36.169> them<00:04:36.349> and<00:04:36.530> with<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.830> fuzzy<00:04:37.099> Drive<00:04:37.430> you

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
with them and with this fuzzy Drive you

00:04:37.550 --> 00:05:11.730 
with them and with this fuzzy Drive you
just<00:04:37.699> you<00:04:37.880> know<00:04:37.970> here's<00:04:38.210> about<00:04:38.539> 12<00:04:39.080> o'clock

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.529 

very<00:05:12.740> dynamic<00:05:13.309> -<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.669> more<00:05:13.999> you<00:05:14.029> put<00:05:14.300> in<00:05:14.389> it

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
very dynamic - the more you put in it

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.029 
very dynamic - the more you put in it
into<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.169> more<00:05:15.229> you<00:05:15.409> get<00:05:15.529> out<00:05:15.589> of<00:05:15.740> it<00:05:15.889> you

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
into it the more you get out of it you

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:41.850 
into it the more you get out of it you
can<00:05:16.159> play<00:05:16.309> real<00:05:16.520> dynamic<00:05:16.999> with<00:05:17.120> this<00:05:17.210> pedal

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:51.200 

same<00:05:42.860> thing<00:05:43.040> with<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:43.190> brew<00:05:43.340> drive<00:05:43.610> now

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.030 

and<00:05:52.210> with<00:05:52.330> this<00:05:52.480> pedal<00:05:52.960> it<00:05:53.230> does<00:05:53.560> react<00:05:53.889> to

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
and with this pedal it does react to

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.890 
and with this pedal it does react to
your<00:05:54.160> touch<00:05:54.400> but<00:05:54.430> it's<00:05:55.060> got<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.360> little<00:05:55.630> bit<00:05:55.780> of

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
your touch but it's got a little bit of

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.020 
your touch but it's got a little bit of
compression<00:05:56.200> going<00:05:56.650> on<00:05:56.770> so<00:05:57.070> you<00:05:57.580> don't<00:05:57.760> get<00:05:57.880> as

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
compression going on so you don't get as

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:06.420 
compression going on so you don't get as
much<00:05:58.210> reaction<00:05:58.840> I<00:05:58.960> got<00:05:59.080> of<00:05:59.200> this<00:05:59.290> one<00:06:05.400> go<00:06:06.400> to

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
much reaction I got of this one go to

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:16.350 
much reaction I got of this one go to
the<00:06:06.639> brute<00:06:06.850> Drive<00:06:14.400> now<00:06:15.400> I<00:06:15.430> wasn't<00:06:15.910> halfway<00:06:16.240> on

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
the brute Drive now I wasn't halfway on

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.760 
the brute Drive now I wasn't halfway on
this<00:06:16.510> one<00:06:16.690> so<00:06:16.840> it's<00:06:16.960> go<00:06:17.050> halfway<00:06:17.470> on<00:06:17.590> this

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
this one so it's go halfway on this

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:32.990 
this one so it's go halfway on this
pedal<00:06:18.070> see<00:06:18.220> what<00:06:18.340> happens

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.399 

full-on<00:06:34.000> it<00:06:34.150> sounds<00:06:34.419> amazing<00:06:34.629> sounds<00:06:35.169> huge

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
full-on it sounds amazing sounds huge

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:36.929 
full-on it sounds amazing sounds huge
and<00:06:35.590> then<00:06:35.680> you<00:06:35.770> go<00:06:35.919> halfway<00:06:36.189> and<00:06:36.460> you<00:06:36.699> get<00:06:36.819> this

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
and then you go halfway and you get this

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:44.140 
and then you go halfway and you get this
nice<00:06:37.150> none<00:06:37.449> of

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.430 

kind<00:06:45.150> of<00:06:45.180> a<00:06:45.270> punch<00:06:45.510> here<00:06:45.750> distortion<00:06:46.260> when<00:06:46.350> you

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
kind of a punch here distortion when you

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.760 
kind of a punch here distortion when you
turn<00:06:46.800> it<00:06:46.890> down<00:06:46.980> a<00:06:47.040> little<00:06:47.100> bit<00:06:47.280> so
