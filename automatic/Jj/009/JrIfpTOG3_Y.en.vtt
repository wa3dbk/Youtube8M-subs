I'm more interested in and the parts
that<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> think<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> could<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.070> more

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that that I think it could be more

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.860 
that that I think it could be more
interesting<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.360> particular

interesting for this particular
procedure<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:44.610> two<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.030> different

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
procedure is the two kind of different

procedure is the two kind of different
washes<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.680> apply<00:00:47.070> once<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
washes that I apply once I get the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
washes that I apply once I get the
drawing<00:00:49.469> belt<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> learned<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
drawing belt the first one I learned it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.930 
drawing belt the first one I learned it
from<00:00:51.379> Antonio<00:00:52.379> Lopez<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.370> based<00:00:53.699> on

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
from Antonio Lopez and it's based on

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.049 
from Antonio Lopez and it's based on
eighty<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.989> ninety<00:00:55.289> percent<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.829> water<00:00:56.129> makes

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
eighty to ninety percent of water makes

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.290 
eighty to ninety percent of water makes
with<00:00:57.270> 10<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> 20%<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.680> glue<00:00:58.949> normal<00:00:59.579> standard

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
with 10 to 20% of glue normal standard

with 10 to 20% of glue normal standard
boot<00:01:01.140> glue<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.280> apply<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.059> soft

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
boot glue and I apply it with a soft

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.149 
boot glue and I apply it with a soft
branch<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.379> will<00:01:04.830> spray<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:07.070> what<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
branch or will spray and then what I can

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.420 
branch or will spray and then what I can
do<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:09.930> work<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> fixative<00:01:11.010> so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
do is it's gonna work like a fixative so

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
do is it's gonna work like a fixative so
what<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.060> once<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.720> done<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.710> see

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
what so once it's done as you can see

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.640 
what so once it's done as you can see
here<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.360> remove<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> paper<00:01:16.259> soaked

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
here I can remove it with a paper soaked

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
here I can remove it with a paper soaked
in<00:01:16.830> water<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.640> gonna<00:01:17.759> create<00:01:18.030> nice<00:01:18.330> white

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
in water it's gonna create nice white

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.490 
in water it's gonna create nice white
sand<00:01:19.439> textures<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:21.450> add<00:01:21.689> more<00:01:22.140> black

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
sand textures or I can add more black

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.270 
sand textures or I can add more black
and<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.040> tar<00:01:23.220> parts<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and the tar parts and that will be the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.249 
and the tar parts and that will be the
first<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.030> wars<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> second<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.080> would

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
first kind of wars the second one would

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.380 
first kind of wars the second one would
be<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.650> wanted<00:01:29.009> something<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.670> wanted<00:01:30.030> something

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
be I wanted something I wanted something

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.249 
be I wanted something I wanted something
to<00:01:30.420> help<00:01:31.170> me<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.610> darker<00:01:33.119> level<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to help me to get to a darker level in

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.980 
to help me to get to a darker level in
the<00:01:34.500> black<00:01:34.890> parts<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> tried<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the black parts so I tried with a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
the black parts so I tried with a
fixative<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.799> applied<00:01:38.100> fixative<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.909> over

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
fixative and I applied fixative all over

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.020 
fixative and I applied fixative all over
the<00:01:39.329> drawing<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.700> here

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the drawing and then as you can see here

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.210 
the drawing and then as you can see here
I<00:01:42.119> soaked<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:43.560> alcohol<00:01:44.240> which<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:46.220> kind

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
I soaked it with alcohol which is kind

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.160 
I soaked it with alcohol which is kind
of<00:01:47.250> liquid<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.579> used<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.060> remove<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.960> track

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
of liquid you used to remove the track

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.819 
of liquid you used to remove the track
city<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.820> next<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
city so what I do next is I go with this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
city so what I do next is I go with this
paper<00:01:53.189> soaked<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.850> alcohol<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.479> I've<00:01:54.810> removed

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
paper soaked in alcohol and I've removed

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
paper soaked in alcohol and I've removed
the<00:01:55.380> part<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:55.860> interested<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the part that I'm interested in and I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.780 
the part that I'm interested in and I
create<00:01:57.930> textures<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.100> planning<00:01:59.549> all

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
create textures that I'm planning all

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.880 
create textures that I'm planning all
the<00:01:59.880> time<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.799> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:02.040> remove<00:02:02.640> that
