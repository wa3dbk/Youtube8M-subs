00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
 but we continue to mission 18 just 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.850
 business 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.400
 look, it's the last mission we do 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.330
 for big smoke arrives when arriving at the house 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.369
 of smoke we will notice that the garage 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.780
 of his son who was open not 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.960
 you only see their blend airlines 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.300
 then continuing with the door and but 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.339
 the same one that was hidden in his 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.699
 blend to the good maybe this one was 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:29.160
 arranging or something similar but good 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.759
 then it is mobile and invites to give a 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.180
 return 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.370
 and go to the center well we have to go 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.000
 until commerce that is in the center of the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.300
 city is the yellow mark and in this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.510
 mission this mission is very interesting is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.430
 a mission where there will be a lot of action 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 you will surely like it if you go 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.390
 if you're going to like it because after 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 so many relatively simple missions 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.320
 let's see a mission that there is already a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.750
 little more than shoot things like that 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.329
 good during the road is it tells us 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.829
 things not about some Russians and 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.420
 precisely this mission is about 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.729
 eliminate a few russians 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.530
 tells an anecdote about him it seems that he 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.930
 has lived something with the Russians or a fight 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.970
 but well then let's fight in 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.580
 this mission against the Russians the Russians 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.280
 with him they have a plan and things like that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.289
 business had rivers equal is maxim 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.509
 kissing me has those things and good tonces 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.189
 there before entering it is mole says yes 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.369
 can count on a follow and not then 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.590
 he gives his word that if he has 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.039
 he and how good are the strict grove 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.990
 There is good if a girl wanted 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.370
 is with her but at the end by the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.350
 abyss is not going to be able 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.820
 alright then this mission we have to 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.480
 eliminate all these assholes that 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.870
 We have here if we have to be very 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.710
 a lot of suggestion marksmanship that I tell you 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.780
 that you get the m4 or the 47 that is 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.880
 better than the micro bus and they give us 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.460
 because mysteriously if we have the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 micro smg this is automatically changed 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.130
 by the bus and then better use the m4 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.860
 yes so more accurate so they have more 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.569
 bullets allows you to save and discard them 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.579
 in graffiti 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.920
 cool truth because you're going to always have 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.019
 the gun in your house in the kitchen and if not 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.439
 you can get it in a video that I have 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.670
 written in the saints very well all the 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.430
 money we have here there's also 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.640
 a vest and we got a few pinches 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.530
 assholes 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.150
 and good as a school we have to take care 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.920
 the smoke bar is also very 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.319
 important because if it is based like this it gets low 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.330
 completely failing and we're going to 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.319
 finish this round of here these 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.319
 mailboxes 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.260
 well how do I say the m4 the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.790
 you can find at the airport yes 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.520
 but I still have a video that he found out about 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 how to find weapons in the high 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:04.150
 we have almost finished with these pinches 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:06.400
 culeros more ready we have finished the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.440
 first part the second part by 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.540
 example inside the atrium honor after 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.450
 out there and now between the third 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.310
 part that is the longest and the one that has 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.380
 a little more action of the mind 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.390
 of action but has this more 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.860
 exciting because you are in undertaking 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.010
 a race this is what we have to 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.780
 to do here is to kill the driver if 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.030
 you have to kill in preference to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.670
 driver since if we keep the 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.920
 driver the bike automatically goes 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.420
 to overturn and so you do not waste so much time 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.510
 in killing the copilot that is firing 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.370
 good that change that is easy 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.830
 disparate is not going to increase what's going to 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.790
 explode is going to stay at 5 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.790
 mysteriously but good we have to 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.569
 shoot we have to take care that not 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:58.829
 there are motorcycles behind all are the russians 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.829
 for the preference where the gasoline 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.090
 do not have 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.190
 well I have to take care of the bike in this 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.240
 part in the first part entering the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.340
 two parts of the tri from outside 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.860
 technology the smog bar true now 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.620
 we have to take care of the motorcycle we have to 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.500
 avoid getting too low because of 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.150
 the same way we would fail the emotion 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.670
 old you there are more motorcycles remember that of 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.430
 preference eliminate the pilot to 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.050
 driver and also to the co-pilot who 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.290
 because it also shoots you but not from 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.240
 preference to the driver to the driver and in 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.400
 these vehicles you have to kill if at 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.010
 co-pilot because he is the one 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.680
 waiting if we do not kill him we run the 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.260
 risk of getting us down quite then 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.660
 preferably always kill the copilot 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.300
 in cars or the driver on motorcycles 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.529
 good 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.569
 and here we have to continue eliminating 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:56.789
 and go back to the bikes 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.789
 they are enough their cousins assholes 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.970
 the pilot the co-pilot sorry to the co-pilot 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.730
 which is more important because the co-pilot 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.550
 has the submachine gun that is what we 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.880
 they're going to go down, they 're going to decrease us 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.940
 the engine bar to its state 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.250
 and here they are raised automatically and 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.780
 remember that the co-pilot also follows 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:26.040
 you and more motorcycles come there you know how 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.640
 to the driver in this case for whom 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.510
 because it totally his bike while we are 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.310
 at another good end it is difficult 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.650
 reach that subject 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.520
 and here is another one dies 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.919
 today no longer 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:49.680
 and while there's still more here it 's fine 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.960
 and the copilot is fine 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.870
 well this scene is quite interesting 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.610
 because as soon as you jump they go to 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.050
 seemingly explode possibly a 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:07.550
 pump or similar thing here with only one 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.550
 a single bullet to the car and to another assholes 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.570
 and this scene or this part is a little bit 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.400
 more complicated because it comes in a group and 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.420
 that can get you down quite a bit so 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.310
 remember to shoot the driver and the 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.600
 driver and how did you realize today 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.550
 also shoot at what are the 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.950
 gallons of gas or gasoline so 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.480
 already by the shock wave and grandmother in the 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:32.210
 who are lying down for what happens 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.639
 do well here leave us one where the 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.949
 we have clueless 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.930
 before you count it is a mission 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.969
 quite interesting and quite 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.860
 exciting 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.080
 I suggest that you kill the driver 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.300
 and in the cars the hobbits asses the 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.830
 co-pilot well the year favorites see you 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.720
 in the following video been fans
