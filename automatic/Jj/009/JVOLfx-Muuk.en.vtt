00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I have a comparison between this and the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.500 
I have a comparison between this and the
MGP<00:00:16.740> price-wise<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.029> they<00:00:18.150> both<00:00:18.270> come

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
MGP price-wise and what they both come

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.380 
MGP price-wise and what they both come
with<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.560> size<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.130> all

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390

comparison details and everything to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.099 
comparison details and everything to
comparison<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.420> we're<00:00:24.689> gonna<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.900> using<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
comparison so we're gonna be using the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
comparison so we're gonna be using the
MGP<00:00:25.350> because<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.160> one's<00:00:26.550> too<00:00:26.730> big<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.449> me<00:00:27.570> to

this bunch of tulips on this yeah it's

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.569 
this bunch of tulips on this yeah it's
not<00:00:44.910> really<00:00:45.120> realistic<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.399> kind

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
not really realistic and it's just kind

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.889 
not really realistic and it's just kind
of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> same<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.270> mean<00:00:48.420> they<00:00:48.600> might<00:00:48.750> have

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
of the same thing I mean they might have

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.500 
of the same thing I mean they might have
fun<00:00:49.079> doing<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.500> that's<00:00:49.680> good<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
fun doing that that's good but this is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.160 
fun doing that that's good but this is
more<00:00:51.690> realistic<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.350> cooler<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.600> just<00:00:54.600> looks

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
more realistic and cooler and just looks

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.340 
more realistic and cooler and just looks
more<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.500> professional<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:57.140> when<00:00:58.140> where<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
more like professional so when where you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.540 
more like professional so when where you
can<00:00:58.469> hold<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.039> put<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.309> index

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
can hold it as you can put your index

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
can hold it as you can put your index
finger<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.000> thumb<00:01:00.030> around<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
finger and your thumb around one of the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.390 
finger and your thumb around one of the
grip<00:01:01.230> sides<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.550> Bry<00:01:02.820> flips<00:01:04.400> like

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
grip sides so you can do Bry flips like

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.929 
grip sides so you can do Bry flips like
that<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.130> still<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.460> tail<00:01:08.700> whips

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that and you can still do tail whips

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
that and you can still do tail whips
with<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.630> mean<00:01:10.020> they're<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> little<00:01:10.350> bit

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
with this I mean they're a little bit

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
with this I mean they're a little bit
harder<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:11.580> scooter<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.750> like

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
harder because scooter is a little like

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260 
harder because scooter is a little like
wobbly<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.890> holding<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.250> side<00:01:14.430> another<00:01:15.119> way

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
wobbly just holding one side another way

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.460 
wobbly just holding one side another way
is<00:01:15.390> putting<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> index<00:01:16.020> finger

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
is putting the index finger

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390 
is putting the index finger
don't<00:01:17.310> across<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> bars<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:19.400> your

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
don't across the bars like this your

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.890 
don't across the bars like this your
thumb<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.909> back<00:01:21.409> your<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.590> fingers<00:01:22.950> there

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
thumb on the back your two fingers there

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
thumb on the back your two fingers there
so<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.320> other<00:01:25.890> ways<00:01:26.280> index

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so that's one way other ways index

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.289 
so that's one way other ways index
finger<00:01:27.180> thumb<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.530> brow<00:01:28.710> flips

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
finger thumb you can do your brow flips

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.380 
finger thumb you can do your brow flips
land<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> we're<00:01:32.490> gonna<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.729> doing<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.180> way

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
land so we're gonna be doing this way

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.760 
land so we're gonna be doing this way
because<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.350> tricks

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
because it's you can do way more tricks

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.399 
because it's you can do way more tricks
easier<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.490> way<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> let's<00:01:37.110> say<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
easier this way so let's say you just

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.410 
easier this way so let's say you just
got<00:01:37.650> your<00:01:38.100> finger<00:01:38.369> scooter<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
got your finger scooter and you have a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.179 
got your finger scooter and you have a
ramp<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.900> maybe<00:01:40.320> from<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.979> take

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
ramp like this maybe from if you take

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.710

first one you can do a manual you can

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.370 
first one you can do a manual you can
land<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> back<00:01:56.490> tire<00:01:56.990> do<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> manual

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
and then those are pretty simple back

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.920 
and then those are pretty simple back
