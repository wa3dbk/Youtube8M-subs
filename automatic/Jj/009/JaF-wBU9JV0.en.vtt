00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.009
 well let's talk about a 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.519
 good product a recent product those 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.519
 headphones 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.900
 24 the first the first ones that throw 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.700
 micro for the market for your consoles 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.700
 in this case for watson 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.470
 I do not want to overtake but friend are 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.020
 very good these things are made very 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.590
 well what games do you have to do 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.960
 accessories to this console task I already have 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.140
 to talk about the aesthetic first 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.140
 we started the box justify colors 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.590
 green boat with black very well finished 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.199
 piano type on the sides already know to me 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.449
 I love it so much I'm a fan of finishing myself 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.339
 puteen although he has considerable and what 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.229
 deep that is the scratches to the dust 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.229
 everything is too delicate 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.650
 Y 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:07.410
 the cooked here I have cities like 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.450
 my end is very good cover movements 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.290
 ears comfortable to use them for 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.960
 hours 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.970
 the detail would be the heat, although it is a 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 hot place like in this case like me 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.630
 you have to sweat too much hollow sweating 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.729
 although our season I lock myself 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.310
 with the air has understood all the time 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.400
 so it's not the problem but I guess 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.979
 that many yes and this one later where is 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.050
 and take into account that if I could feel 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.100
 the heat in his ears would be the only thing 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.470
 the microphone come together perfectly 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.570
 bag is necessary because once in 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.470
 its waters but also very good 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.840
 hide that incidentally the 3.5 entry 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.070
 millimeters the standard that serves to 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:59.430
 raw mp3 player 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.430
 your cell phone or your computer next 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.960
 used for any act or any 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:13.410
 device that you have 3.5 entry 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.410
 millimeters although as it feeds with 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.660
 the same pair of batteries that you put 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.310
 commanded is enough to feed 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.330
 have this sound that 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.819
 talking 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.730
 lot 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.200
 mango technical aspect go friend 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.680
 you are 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.310
 they have set a bass level that is not 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.700
 a lot and it's not enough to be 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.440
 so accurate that good another detail that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.620
 I wanted to mention that I like it a lot 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.620
 which is based on the application of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.620
 design 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.660
 this unification of everything from the brand and 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.940
 they no longer only use it to serve 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.190
 video games are already using it to 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.950
 talk about entertainment in general already 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.050
 is doing the same 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.879
 a very good job with the brand the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.980
 spot seal is becoming a 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.910
 entertainment brand and not just 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.650
 of video games 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.130
 and well I guess that's taking it to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.320
 another good level has liked a lot how 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.360
 He has evolved all this but that 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.830
 is another issue this case we are for 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.180
 talk about this and let's talk about what 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.950
 technical 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.840
 I already mentioned the good mateo bass 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.850
 some too very little distant 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.860
 excellent you can control it very 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.990
 easily with your command you want to listen 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.100
 more the voice of your friends wants to be your 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.870
 controls 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.720
 thanks to this addition that also 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.460
 the controls are printed 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.040
 listen more to the game to be more 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.710
 your friends more volume minus what you measure 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.200
 slowly with everything at the height of their 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.720
 places not to miss a lot of relationship 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.590
 and have fire 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.290
 in quick accesses and it goes very well 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.260
 there is no 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.050
 there is no loses there 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.710
 concentration time 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.380
 here the video that I put at random I chose it 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.420
 something that we burn my recent 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.510
 fact was not even updated 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.340
 of the tie either and there I had saved 200 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.720
 I could not save anything today I was 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.910
 just playing and testing it 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.330
 listening to music in fact I dedicated myself to 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.389
 try them are very very well 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:37.060
 I recommend it is a live xbox one 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.500
 needed let's say forward 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.540
 I recommend buying the purchased ones 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.760
 too good in the offer for the 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.610
 price is fine if your need is 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.710
 something competitive of 5.1 channels get away 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.540
 of them here you will not find if 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.550
 you need direction of the sound of 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.260
 bullets forget you get away from your friends 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.260
 Stereo and forehead hearing aids
