started<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.290> first<00:02:02.320> thing<00:02:02.620> we<00:02:02.680> need<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.830> do<00:02:03.010> is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
started the first thing we need to do is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.550 
started the first thing we need to do is
sift<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.120> flour<00:02:04.360> now<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.750> guys<00:02:04.960> already<00:02:05.350> know

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
sift the flour now you guys already know

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.200 
sift the flour now you guys already know
that<00:02:05.590> I'm<00:02:05.830> not<00:02:05.980> a<00:02:06.010> big<00:02:06.220> fan<00:02:06.400> of<00:02:06.430> sifting<00:02:07.000> just

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
that I'm not a big fan of sifting just

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.749 
that I'm not a big fan of sifting just
because<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.540> takes<00:02:07.690> time<00:02:07.990> but<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:09.129> time<00:02:09.429> you

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
because it takes time but this time you

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.700 
because it takes time but this time you
need<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.149> sift<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.780> don't<00:02:11.080> only<00:02:11.320> have<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
need to sift and you don't only have the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.420 
need to sift and you don't only have the
sift<00:02:11.950> ones<00:02:12.250> but<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.090> sip

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
sift ones but you have to sip

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.910 
sift ones but you have to sip
this<00:02:13.579> three<00:02:14.329> times<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.319> want<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.560> make<00:02:15.680> sure

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
this three times you want to make sure

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.399 
this three times you want to make sure
that<00:02:16.549> this<00:02:16.879> is<00:02:17.170> lump-free

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
that this is lump-free

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.190 
that this is lump-free
and<00:02:18.620> by<00:02:19.069> sifting<00:02:19.579> it<00:02:19.700> gets<00:02:20.000> nice<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.450> airy<00:02:20.989> and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and by sifting it gets nice and airy and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.599 
and by sifting it gets nice and airy and
just<00:02:21.680> delicious<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.189> gives<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.579> that

this bowl to this bowl to this bowl see
those<00:02:31.609> little<00:02:31.849> lumps<00:02:32.030> there<00:02:32.359> you<00:02:32.719> don't<00:02:32.930> want

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
those little lumps there you don't want

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.660 
those little lumps there you don't want
any<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.319> those<00:02:33.439> so<00:02:33.889> now<00:02:34.010> I'm<00:02:34.069> going<00:02:34.219> to<00:02:34.310> exactly

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
any of those so now I'm going to exactly

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.420 
any of those so now I'm going to exactly
the<00:02:34.939> same<00:02:34.969> thing<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.739> sift<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.920> into<00:02:37.069> this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
the same thing and sift it into this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.289 
the same thing and sift it into this
bowl<00:02:39.040> last<00:02:40.040> time<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:40.849> sift<00:02:43.000> perfect<00:02:44.000> now<00:02:44.239> I'm

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
bowl last time to sift perfect now I'm

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.119 
bowl last time to sift perfect now I'm
going<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.540> set<00:02:44.659> this<00:02:44.750> aside<00:02:44.930> another<00:02:45.769> really

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
going to set this aside another really

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.979 
going to set this aside another really
key<00:02:46.370> point<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.879> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.569> your<00:02:47.840> egg

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
key point to this is that your egg

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.470 
key point to this is that your egg
whites<00:02:48.230> must<00:02:48.560> be<00:02:48.889> a<00:02:49.099> room<00:02:49.400> temperature<00:02:49.970> now

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
whites must be a room temperature now

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.539 
whites must be a room temperature now
it's<00:02:50.959> much<00:02:51.169> easier<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.680> separate<00:02:52.129> your<00:02:52.310> eggs

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
it's much easier to separate your eggs

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.059 
it's much easier to separate your eggs
when<00:02:53.120> they're<00:02:53.269> cold<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.230> separate<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.799> eggs

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
when they're cold so separate the eggs

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.770 
when they're cold so separate the eggs
from<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.519> whites<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.150> yolks<00:02:56.180> put<00:02:56.689> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
from the whites and the yolks put the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.390 
from the whites and the yolks put the
yolks<00:02:56.989> into<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.590> fridge<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:57.980> makes<00:02:58.159> for<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
yolks into the fridge it makes for a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.789 
yolks into the fridge it makes for a
fantastic<00:02:58.579> ice<00:02:59.150> cream<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.079> make<00:03:00.260> custard

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
fantastic ice cream you can make custard

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.740 
fantastic ice cream you can make custard
with<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.159> don't<00:03:01.669> throw<00:03:01.819> them<00:03:01.969> away<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.599> then

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
with it don't throw them away but then

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.909 
with it don't throw them away but then
keep<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.230> egg<00:03:03.349> whites<00:03:03.590> everything

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
keep the egg whites everything

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.589 
keep the egg whites everything
temperature<00:03:04.250> for<00:03:04.430> about<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.609> half<00:03:04.879> an<00:03:05.030> hour<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
now I'm just going to put these into my

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.390 
now I'm just going to put these into my
mixer<00:03:08.750> along<00:03:09.079> with<00:03:09.349> a<00:03:09.379> cream<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.769> tartar<00:03:10.280> and

stabilizes the egg whites stabilizes the
egg<00:03:14.569> whites<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:14.959> makes<00:03:15.230> them<00:03:15.500> kind<00:03:16.069> of<00:03:16.159> colder

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
egg whites and makes them kind of colder

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.000 
egg whites and makes them kind of colder
shape<00:03:16.939> better<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:18.260> all<00:03:18.409> I'm<00:03:18.500> going<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.680> do<00:03:18.799> is

gets<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.890> air<00:04:46.040> bubbles<00:04:46.490> out<00:04:46.580> if<00:04:46.970> there<00:04:47.180> are

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.070 
gets the air bubbles out if there are
any<00:04:47.390> because<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.410> don't<00:04:48.590> want<00:04:48.830> air<00:04:49.040> bubbles

in<00:05:23.780> itself<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.170> become<00:05:24.380> really<00:05:24.650> heavy<00:05:24.860> and

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
in itself and become really heavy and

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.670 
in itself and become really heavy and
you<00:05:25.520> want<00:05:25.730> to<00:05:25.820> put<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.660> pan<00:05:26.900> on<00:05:27.140> something

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
that's going to hold it upside down and

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.810 
that's going to hold it upside down and
I<00:05:29.120> use<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.570> heat<00:05:29.930> proof<00:05:30.320> wine<00:05:30.980> bottle<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.640> works

every<00:05:32.150> single<00:05:32.180> time<00:05:32.450> just<00:05:32.930> make<00:05:33.050> sure<00:05:33.200> there's

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
every single time just make sure there's

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.710 
every single time just make sure there's
actually<00:05:33.710> liquid<00:05:34.100> in<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.490> that<00:05:35.000> holds<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.510> nice

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
actually liquid in it that holds it nice

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.330 
actually liquid in it that holds it nice
