00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.060
 so I'm going to tell you what the recording was like on this video next door 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.859
 What happened in 1992? 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.509
 a company learns music was starting and I was also a simple 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.270
 guitar student and was not had no creek yet have not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.980
 band 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.010
 kachelmann and even had already considered on the farm 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.780
 But I was a student of muse Mello. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.000
 and homos gunsmith indicated 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.470
 Nothing to write home about 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.520
 that they had and teresa that it was legal one of them that could make a video-lesson of 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.910
 rock and until then 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.580
 the songs pen already had some names as country as salomé she was 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.010
 showing more that it is early the corners they speak that it is a face of burial co 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.610
 and then a gunsmith who was 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.490
 my tawfiq teacher stayed with them in five years having class 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.780
 he introduced me to me was bigger 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.880
 Record this video that I never imagined today 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.360
 thirteen years later it still seems to me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.640
 she talks in dvd so many people I get to know me 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 for the whole brazil through this video lesson 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.830
 and I remember that means without my uncompromising crazy studio 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.260
 We have one more incredible thing, huh? 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.640
 I did some 'likes' 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.020
 of making box as well as the modern techniques with the head in the time of its 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.670
 team 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.280
 connected tekken and such 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920
 and there I 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.890
 I decided to put those links within those examples in music that I 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.640
 was 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.370
 playing 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.970
 and it was there and in boaters then all 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.650
 the videotape explains a little bit of fashion scale 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.330
 then it was aggravated bleeding cordeirópolis in portal 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.420
 there canceled the first day 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.860
 The approval was 100% because 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.290
 and then the other day I went to record 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.610
 he spent the whole day recording moka one part by part in photo and 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.610
 I do not know that there in the end homeless from 10 in the morning until eight at night 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.299
 and at the end of the day when it ended 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.770
 The guy tells me that the match is what it is. 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.500
 need to squeeze the super old kandahar reside in the recording then 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.249
 everything that had fully recorded nothing worth 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.599
 I hope now it's the fight 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.829
 are worth nothing 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.049
 d 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.669
 our people have been expelled 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:34.209
 but it turned out that it was ok the protocol is very natural both spoke everything counted with 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.589
 Eden what I was doing back then 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.489
 at 92 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.099
 I think this video lesson helped a lot 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.679
 to divulge name through Brazil and helped the land 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:48.849
 at the beginning of the year a lot of people went back to know the band creek 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.520
 because without a doubt and touching 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.829
 in this video next to 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.669
 so I think it was a 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.669
 a milestone in the patrician career 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:27.780
 and I started playing commercial guitar 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.879
 eleven years 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.819
 and then when I was about 13 years old at the beginning I won my first stage 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.749
 it was cooler black 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.789
 that I was a fan and of the tomé and the noon of Saturday 11 in the residence was well 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.019
 switched on 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.599
 the bands such agency 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.040
 also said that Brazilian music also studies the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.040
 in the 15 6 years I was fool like chanel 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.769
 So when I was 20 years old I was already 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.279
 having class as we did we did 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.450
 almost five years what you can notice in the video as well 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.859
 besides tadim technical toronto so much worse we talk about bread 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:04.860
 single i 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.199
 and talking about third grade screen of the world cup that is there 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.289
 neutron the only smaller scale than he said the monica 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:12.629
 played well 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.789
 is connected with those names with this math and music 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:17.620
 you can 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.059
 I realized right now 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.739
 and something else is legal and spoken of the instruments owns the equipment 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.849
 I was already using humanitarian aid 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.849
 that was made for me - I certainly never bought it until 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.509
 and nowadays I am the back of my foot 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.129
 and I still use the same guitar in the same format, it turned into a model 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.409
 my signature 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.010
 because I went out for all these years this model 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.400
 the closed page he created 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.229
 and finished the background whose models ended up creating an identity with me 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.699
 and turned goal of 40 to card template 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.610
 so have a dog model is never a model 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.199
 the scavengers 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.159
 the Americans in that amount that ended this 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.759
 who has not escaped from the scavenger fields to nationals 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.479
 ef 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.870
 in this very old video 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.130
 something else also sang using personal equipment always ask for 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.830
 that does not appear in the video 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.870
 is the assiduous eye of the state regarding such 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.199
 and in reality at the time I did not even expect it would be a video library so many years there 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.210
 counting 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.789
 we foresee a wine 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.449
 nowadays nor more exists is the human in day 9 million is more or less 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.410
 equivalent to the famous 35 of the 1 that is a little bit cheap that has super 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.800
 the effects and 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.389
 and this is what I'm sanasa visual until the direct guitar connected direct 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.569
 in this 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.289
 pedalzinho das 1 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.740
 hehehe the pedal straight to me that has neither search engine 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.740
 So it's revealed the secret of everything we always ask. 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.990
 tereza
