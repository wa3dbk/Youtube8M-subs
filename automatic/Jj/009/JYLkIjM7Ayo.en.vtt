 huberman that had been so tasty nor 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.040
 cook so fun 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.420
 this is kitchen tower but with a lot 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.490
 hungry I found myself knew that in the end 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.490
 of the book I want to be able to help 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.180
 hello to commemorate our holidays 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.210
 We are going to prepare peppers in 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.210
 nogada 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:38.129
 I do not know what will happen 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.019
 You can start making the chiles 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 which later I'm going to remove the skin 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.129
 I'm going to open them to remove the seeds 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 and that these can be filled in so that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.089
 you can be better the chilies I'm going 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.739
 to spread with a little oil and this goes 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.739
 to make the skin burn faster 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.399
 the tradition of being here 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.160
 two 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.390
 and do not buy ground pork and 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.130
 ground beef and I like that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.260
 have a mixture of the two meats 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.940
 first let's start chopping onion 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.980
 garlic and we will try to fry you 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.990
 let's add the meat and right there 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.750
 let's add the apple the pear the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.420
 peach a little acitrÃ³n and they're going to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.900
 heal with salt cinnamon pepper and clove 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.900
 unity 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.190
 i 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.190
 my life because because I am like that 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.600
 ah 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.600
 but I want 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.909
 my look 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.170
 but I do not want to have 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.170
 other questions highlighted 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.430
 in this 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.870
 m 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.620
 no no 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 yes 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.730
 all right 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.880
 your time I am like that 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.320
 It's worth it for the tomatoes and I'll 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.320
 add the caldillo to our picadillo 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.549
 this lie 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.550
 I'm going to ask 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.160
 yes 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.570
 l 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.570
 but good 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.379
 or not 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.459
 yes 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.150
 I recommend you to moisturize the 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.640
 castilla nuts one night before 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.800
 milk so they absorb enough and 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.960
 then they already remove the milk and they go to 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.050
 Blend with a cup of whipping cream 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.440
 2 tablespoons of sugar medium horse 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.440
 from sherry 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.660
 or not 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.949
 I hope you liked the recipe and
