00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:28.500 

and<00:02:08.690> here's<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.140> CD<00:02:09.410> if<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.560> wanna<00:02:09.710> look<00:02:10.009> at<00:02:10.160> it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.850 

the<00:02:29.510> battery<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:30.320> actually<00:02:30.470> feels<00:02:30.620> pretty

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the battery it actually feels pretty

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.010 
the battery it actually feels pretty
happy<00:02:31.160> actually<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.880> think<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.480> actually

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
happy actually I think this is actually

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.570 
happy actually I think this is actually
heavier<00:02:33.410> than<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.710> computer<00:02:33.980> which<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
heavier than the computer which is the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000 
heavier than the computer which is the
case<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.840> acer<00:02:36.140> aspire<00:02:36.200> one<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:36.890> get

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
case with the acer aspire one if you get

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.430 
case with the acer aspire one if you get
the<00:02:37.100> six<00:02:37.310> cell<00:02:37.460> battery<00:02:37.490> tail<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.930> here<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.320> is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
the six cell battery tail and here it is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.030 
the six cell battery tail and here it is
and<00:02:46.030> I've<00:02:47.030> actually<00:02:47.209> had<00:02:47.570> held<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.140> sec<00:02:48.470> 03<00:02:48.680> saw

and I've actually had held a sec 03 saw
before<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.550> on<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.030> three<00:02:50.240> silvers<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.690> this

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
before and on the three silvers on this

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.520 
before and on the three silvers on this
computer<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.320> this<00:02:51.740> one<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.750> six<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.930> 31<00:02:54.290> hours

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
computer and this one is six to 31 hours

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:10.400 
computer and this one is six to 31 hours
Shh

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:25.110 

here's<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> computer<00:03:23.490> here's<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:24.580> inside<00:03:24.820> of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
here's the computer here's the inside of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:36.950 
here's the computer here's the inside of
it<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:29.940> some<00:03:30.960> weird<00:03:31.960> promotional<00:03:32.500> stickers

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:49.809 

yeah<00:03:43.080> put<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.170> battery<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.530> it

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.759 

I<00:03:49.879> know<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.629> interesting<00:03:50.959> about<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.379> model

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
I know the interesting about this model

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.610 
I know the interesting about this model
is<00:03:51.980> actually<00:03:52.730> has<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.139> sim<00:03:54.139> card<00:03:54.260> right<00:03:54.590> there

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
is actually has a sim card right there

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.110 
is actually has a sim card right there
which<00:03:55.069> means<00:03:55.310> that<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.579> future<00:03:55.730> that's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
which means that in future that's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.220 
which means that in future that's
probably<00:03:56.659> going<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.900> be<00:03:56.959> one<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.170> those

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
probably going to be one of those

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.750 
probably going to be one of those
computers<00:03:57.620> where<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:57.829> can<00:03:57.950> get<00:03:58.099> for<00:03:58.370> free<00:03:58.400> or

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
computers where you can get for free or

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.149 
computers where you can get for free or
at<00:03:59.209> least<00:03:59.359> we're<00:03:59.510> very<00:03:59.689> low<00:04:00.439> subsidized<00:04:01.040> price

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
at least we're very low subsidized price

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.399 
at least we're very low subsidized price
when<00:04:04.159> you<00:04:04.310> get<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.609> with<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:05.239> wireless<00:04:05.510> module

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
when you get it with a wireless module

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.069 
when you get it with a wireless module
like<00:04:06.889> a<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:08.269> ones<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.870> can<00:04:08.989> get

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
like a the ones that you can get
