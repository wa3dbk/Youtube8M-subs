until<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.469> get<00:01:39.710> up<00:01:39.799> here<00:01:40.100> now<00:01:40.130> I'm<00:01:40.460> pretty

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
until you get up here now I'm pretty

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.160 
until you get up here now I'm pretty
sure<00:01:40.999> this<00:01:41.119> chess<00:01:41.389> is<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.539> tier<00:01:41.749> two<00:01:41.899> all<00:01:42.049> those

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
sure this chess is a tier two all those

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.950 
sure this chess is a tier two all those
are<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.590> only<00:01:42.740> one<00:01:42.979> I'm<00:01:43.240> unsure<00:01:44.240> about<00:01:44.689> but<00:01:44.929> I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
are the only one I'm unsure about but I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.569 
are the only one I'm unsure about but I
actually<00:01:45.109> I'm<00:01:45.560> pretty<00:01:46.189> sure<00:01:46.340> that's<00:01:46.490> chair

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
actually I'm pretty sure that's chair

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.550 
actually I'm pretty sure that's chair
too<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:46.969> tushy<00:01:47.210> right<00:01:47.240> there<00:01:47.560> anyone

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
too so it's tushy right there anyone

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.959 
too so it's tushy right there anyone
keep<00:01:48.710> going<00:01:48.859> higher<00:01:49.039> there<00:01:49.429> is<00:01:49.609> I<00:01:49.729> think<00:01:49.759> a

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
keep going higher there is I think a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.789 
keep going higher there is I think a
tier<00:01:50.209> 1<00:01:50.389> yep<00:01:50.569> a<00:01:50.689> tier<00:01:50.929> one<00:01:51.109> right<00:01:51.259> there<00:01:51.499> and

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
tier 1 yep a tier one right there and

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.099 
tier 1 yep a tier one right there and
you<00:01:52.310> want<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.789> keep<00:01:52.909> going<00:01:53.450> higher<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:53.840> higher

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
you want to keep going higher and higher

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.819 
you want to keep going higher and higher
and<00:01:54.289> higher<00:01:54.560> until<00:01:55.959> you<00:01:56.959> reach<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.139> top<00:01:57.350> and

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
and higher until you reach the top and

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.190 
and higher until you reach the top and
that<00:01:58.520> chess<00:01:58.819> right<00:01:58.909> there<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.479> tier<00:01:59.990> two

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
that chess right there is a tier two

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.139 
that chess right there is a tier two
that's<00:02:00.409> like<00:02:00.530> yeah<00:02:00.950> that's<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.399> true<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
that's like yeah that's a true that's a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.669 
that's like yeah that's a true that's a
positive<00:02:02.359> to<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.749> because<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:03.229> actually<00:02:03.350> check

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
positive to do because I actually check

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.730 
positive to do because I actually check
that<00:02:03.859> um<00:02:04.069> I<00:02:04.969> also<00:02:05.209> saw<00:02:05.749> this<00:02:05.899> chest<00:02:06.200> like<00:02:06.380> after

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
that um I also saw this chest like after

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.199 
that um I also saw this chest like after
I<00:02:06.770> finished<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.249> game<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.670> someone<00:02:07.909> got<00:02:08.030> it

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
I finished the game and someone got it

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.449 
I finished the game and someone got it
and<00:02:08.330> got<00:02:08.509> um<00:02:08.810> some<00:02:09.679> food<00:02:09.709> in<00:02:09.979> their<00:02:10.100> hand<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.399> I

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
and got um some food in their hand and I

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.550 
and got um some food in their hand and I
thought<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.840> probably<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.319> churchy

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
thought that that probably is a churchy

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.080 
thought that that probably is a churchy
although<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.100> like<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.970> only

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
although this is like this is the only

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.729 
although this is like this is the only
chest<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:14.510> not<00:02:14.629> sure<00:02:14.870> about<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.319> I'm<00:02:15.500> pretty

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
chest I'm not sure about but I'm pretty

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.920 
chest I'm not sure about but I'm pretty
sure<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.189> is<00:02:16.340> at<00:02:16.549> here<00:02:16.670> too<00:02:16.790> anyway<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.810> let's

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
tree on top of the tree this the tree

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.770 
tree on top of the tree this the tree

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
obviously that chest in the tree is

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.969 
obviously that chest in the tree is
totally<00:06:22.110> optional<00:06:22.260> because<00:06:22.620> you<00:06:22.770> still<00:06:22.949> have

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
bridge over that chest just for one tier

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.450

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
basically basically it you probably

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.140 
basically basically it you probably
wouldn't<00:06:37.919> won't<00:06:38.220> get<00:06:38.370> all<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.729> chest<00:06:38.940> guys

considering that a either like you have
to<00:06:40.830> make<00:06:40.949> a<00:06:40.979> decision<00:06:41.070> like<00:06:41.490> every<00:06:41.940> for

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
to make a decision like every for

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.890 
to make a decision like every for
example<00:06:42.570> um<00:06:42.770> if<00:06:43.770> like<00:06:44.580> not<00:06:45.120> top<00:06:45.300> part<00:06:45.539> on<00:06:45.690> this

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
example um if like not top part on this

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.439 
example um if like not top part on this
time

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
time

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.379 
time
part<00:06:46.659> of<00:06:46.689> the<00:06:46.779> map<00:06:46.870> probably<00:06:47.259> if<00:06:47.409> you<00:06:47.860> go<00:06:48.389> up

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
part of the map probably if you go up

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.570 
part of the map probably if you go up
the<00:06:49.809> stairs<00:06:50.139> unlike<00:06:50.710> up<00:06:50.889> those<00:06:51.099> stairs<00:06:51.370> skip

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
the stairs unlike up those stairs skip

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.610 
the stairs unlike up those stairs skip
those<00:06:51.669> tier<00:06:51.909> to<00:06:52.210> tier<00:06:52.240> 2s<00:06:52.689> someone<00:06:53.379> would

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
those tier to tier 2s someone would

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.320 
those tier to tier 2s someone would
probably<00:06:53.949> go<00:06:54.009> across<00:06:54.219> the<00:06:54.460> bridge<00:06:54.490> vice<00:06:54.969> versa

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
probably go across the bridge vice versa

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.700 
probably go across the bridge vice versa
if<00:06:55.599> you<00:06:55.689> go<00:06:55.809> across<00:06:55.870> the<00:06:56.169> bridge<00:06:56.199> and<00:06:56.559> come

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
if you go across the bridge and come

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.439 
if you go across the bridge and come
back<00:06:56.860> someone<00:06:57.639> probably<00:06:57.819> already<00:06:58.059> got<00:06:58.270> those

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
back someone probably already got those

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.809 
back someone probably already got those
tier<00:06:58.749> two<00:06:58.900> tier<00:06:59.199> 2<00:06:59.559> so<00:06:59.889> yeah<00:07:00.339> that's<00:07:00.669> basically

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819
