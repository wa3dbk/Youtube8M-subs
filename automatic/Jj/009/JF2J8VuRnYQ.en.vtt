00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
your design that's the whole point of

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.900 
your design that's the whole point of
this<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.109> I've<00:00:31.230> got<00:00:31.380> blonde<00:00:31.710> hair<00:00:31.890> I've<00:00:32.520> got

red brunette and I've got black hair
that<00:00:35.340> I've<00:00:35.460> rendered<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.910> I've<00:00:35.969> set<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.239> my

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that I've rendered and I've set up my

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.819 
that I've rendered and I've set up my
markers<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.380> through<00:00:37.620> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
markers so we can get through this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.299 
markers so we can get through this
together

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
together

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
together
and<00:00:38.489> figure<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:38.969> what's<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> simplest

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and figure out what's the simplest

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350 
and figure out what's the simplest
fastest<00:00:40.890> way<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.670> we're<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:41.879> doing<00:00:42.120> fine

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
fastest way because we're not doing fine

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
fastest way because we're not doing fine
art<00:00:42.600> we're<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.260> trying<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.739> into

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.510 
art we're just trying to get into
something<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.149> quick<00:00:45.780> easy<00:00:46.100> fast<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
something that's quick easy fast and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
something that's quick easy fast and
looks<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.120> way<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.300> want<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.289> for

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
before if you want to get a little bit

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
before if you want to get a little bit
more<00:01:41.430> complex<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.299> again<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.960> do

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
more complex I'm again going to do

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
more complex I'm again going to do
strokes<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.100> kind<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
strokes because that's kind of like the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
strokes because that's kind of like the
direction<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> hair<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.170> this

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
direction of the hair and this

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
direction of the hair and this
particular<00:01:47.399> hairstyle<00:01:48.119> which<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.840> simple

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
particular hairstyle which is so simple

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.039 
particular hairstyle which is so simple
and<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.520> gonna<00:01:50.820> add<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.390> bit<00:01:52.020> more

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and here I'm gonna add a little bit more

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.010 
and here I'm gonna add a little bit more
value<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.460> darker<00:01:53.970> value<00:01:54.479> maybe

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
value a little bit darker value maybe

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.080 
value a little bit darker value maybe
getting<00:01:55.350> darker<00:01:55.649> by<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.799> temples<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.000> I

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
getting darker by the temples and if I

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
getting darker by the temples and if I
really<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.930> further<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:58.740> that's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
really take it further that's that's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709 
really take it further that's that's
three<00:01:59.189> layers<00:01:59.460> I'm<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.240> sure<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> really

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719

you've got fabric and textures with
fabric<00:02:35.599> that<00:02:36.170> could<00:02:36.470> be<00:02:36.590> an<00:02:36.680> issue<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.280> maybe

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
fabric that could be an issue so maybe

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.580 
fabric that could be an issue so maybe
it's<00:02:38.030> easiest<00:02:38.420> for<00:02:38.599> us<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.019> work<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:39.349> hair

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
it's easiest for us to work with hair

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.979 
it's easiest for us to work with hair
color<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.160> say<00:02:40.819> just<00:02:41.480> again<00:02:41.750> though<00:02:41.870> it's
