00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.599
 for four billion years 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.599
 our plan is not 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.570
 In this time, nature has countless answers to the challenges of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.810
 Found life 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 because it comes best to food 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.789
 to be educated 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 or in extreme contrast 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.530
 Ben 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 between the highest mountain peaks 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.220
 and the biggest 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.220
 Ethan of the oceans 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.590
 At the beginning, humans were only parts of this biodiversity then 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.120
 our big brain helped us to a special position 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 Vanessa Hudgens PCs we no longer had the nature 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.540
 that depends on our needs 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.070
 the tool for it 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.070
 and that often contradict 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 more 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.830
 the further we alienated ourselves from nature the more successful 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 benefit 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.830
 at the expense of our planet 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.990
 but here, like nature, begin with new eyes 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.330
 At the beginning of the third millennium, we are fighting a revolution 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.190
 is the magic word 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.410
 a way of thinking that brings nature and technology together for the first time 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.150
 out in the wilderness, almost every one of our technical problems is Graz 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.730
 chosen 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.980
 we have to look 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.920
 the Jamie of nature 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 to grasp correctly 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 on 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.689
