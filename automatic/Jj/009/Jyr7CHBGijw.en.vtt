00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.350
 well we come to the end of our 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.210
 program the last block is with us 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.610
 the doctor claudia destination and welcome 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.320
 how are you a conicet researcher? 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.419
 I was talking to her cool way 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.459
 congratulating her especially for that because 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.310
 do research in an institute 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.190
 how is the conicet perfect and good already and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.190
 tell us a little what will be invented 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.070
 adecco recipe and the researcher is that 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.750
 that generates knowledge is to say the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.860
 knowledge then the doctor applies 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.400
 for example to cure a disease 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.090
 and in this case we do 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.220
 fundamentally to the study of 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.690
 alopecia that is not the only disease 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.420
 that we have been studying but also 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.900
 we study cancer disorders 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.490
 immunological but we wanted to put 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.500
 emphasize fundamentally the issue of 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.890
 lope cia because it 's a problem 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.430
 that is very present let's say in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.550
 society for the people who are us 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.020
 seeing us we talk in terms 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.050
 technical alopecias from the fall of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.030
 hair if there was no lopez and is the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.160
 hair fall is actually a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.600
 set of diseases that 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.780
 characterized by a decrease in 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.120
 hair density or directly by the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.180
 absence not of hair 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.840
 and good and this is produced by different 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.550
 causes is to say there are causes the same take 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 of medicines for example can cause 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.680
 the lobesia and lead to what is 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.110
 called a telogen effluvium that is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.300
 when the anagen phase of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.580
 growth and hair falls if the hair 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.230
 has a cycle that starts with a phase 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.120
 anagen which is a proliferation phase 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.830
 and growth goes to a phase of 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.780
 Cartagena and then a telogen phase and 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.660
 then a new hair is born again 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.030
 but when the anagen phase is shortened and 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.030
 the gene phase is exaggerated 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.220
 and that has to do with the shot 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.470
 of medications as I said earlier 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.820
 but with physical stress stress 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.320
 emotional the fact of having had a 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.330
 pathology of having had fever 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.450
 also as we saw it in another program 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.720
 with childbirth is not true and the time of 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.790
 breastfeeding now in the older adult follows 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.700
 what could the person card me 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.740
 has bigger says to me know that two 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 this prayer is also the veil because it 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.750
 you go very well and good in the case of the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.430
 woman fundamentally has to do with 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.230
 the decrease of estrogen a 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.840
 premenopausal stage of menopause 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.400
 menopause and that decrease in 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.020
 estrogen 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.760
 let's say it has a predominance 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.110
 androgenic ie testosterone 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.489
 because the woman also has 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.040
 testosterone is not that we do not 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.380
 we have but that we have it in a minor 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.150
 proportion compared to the obvious and it's 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.830
 testosterone is just this 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.060
 related to alopecia that is 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.870
 call whatever androgenic 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.060
 androgenetic that accelerates the phase 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.209
 heterogeneous is to say what we said of 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.280
 the hair fall and the hair falls and that 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.350
 type of alopecia is what is given 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.040
 fundamentally in man very a 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.350
 from 50 years of age there is almost 50 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.030
 hundred of men who suffer this type 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.620
 of alopecia 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.049
 and from the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.040
 60 to 70 years the percentage is a lot and 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.040
 so can women 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.340
 it's something that comes with age but 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.560
 it also has a hereditary component 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.689
 because it is an autosomal disease 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.000
 dominant is to say that it is taken for more than 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.709
 one of a parent's gene already 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.180
 manifests the disease but then 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.799
 if the dad was stripped 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.750
 is appealing now this we start saying 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.069
 of samples in the conicet in addition to the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.780
 faculty of pharmacy you in addition or 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.650
 biochemistry and pharmaceutical 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.510
 then you started the career of 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.000
 researcher with the conicet that is a 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.709
 It is very prestigious entity care of 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.099
 all in conicet bag wow is 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.349
 endorsed now you discovered something 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.090
 Of course, it's exactly looking at the 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.980
 problematic not true of the fall of 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.669
 hair and watching the treatments that 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.549
 produce with current medications 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.940
 that produce many adverse effects 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.870
 For example , he 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.870
 sexual dysfunction 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.450
 exactly then good seeing that 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.890
 we study this problem and we 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.530
 We are devoted to the study of 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.720
 medicinal plants not only isolate 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.440
 identify active ingredients but 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.420
 also study pharmacological effects 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.130
 minimums like the soft one can help the 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.870
 treatment of a disease such as 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.790
 clear alopecia and we have been studying 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.800
 for a long time a plant that 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.320
 it's called the Iberian network is known 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.970
 as jarilla that is an indigenous plant 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.520
 from South America that gives you a plus 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.530
 let's say and it is very distributed in the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.330
 Argentine Republic and we have been studying 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.390
 also the coffee, even if it seems to them 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.920
 lie the arabica coffea that is not 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.770
 native of South America but of 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.870
 ethiopia but well we all know it 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.270
 because we drink coffee from the 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.950
 grains and good we were seeing effects 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.140
 immunomodulators modulators of the 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.340
 cell proliferation and how the fall 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.410
 of hair has let's say a matter of 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.210
 cause an immune imbalance 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.210
 inflammatory and oxidative stress we said 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.189
 well let's see what happens 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.809
 under these circumstances and under models 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:31.889
 animals and others live in vitro and 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:35.889
 study of these studies 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:40.659
 came up let's say a lotion and a shampoo 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.770
 anti-dandruff and anti- hair loss shampoo and 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.080
 lotion for hair growth 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.479
 because it's because we discovered justly 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.399
 that stimulates hair growth and 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.759
 decreases the limestone by applying it like this 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:54.879
 way as we say topical that exactly 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.949
 is a local route is a topical route by 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.930
 so this considering also 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.809
 the nature of the chemical compounds 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.300
 which are trained ensures that 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.399
 absorb up to the site of action let's say 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.480
 and high concentrations do not occur 

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:12.310
 in blood 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.310
 which good this 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.280
 but I also want to clarify that 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.169
 produces adverse effects because that 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.110
 we also study it does not produce 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.770
 dermal irritation is not 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.909
 photosensitizers say that one can 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.849
 sunbathing are if they are better said if 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.219
 put genetics if they do not induce allergy a 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.949
 person who has an allergy can be 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.479
 treated with this type of products and not 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.310
 we stay in that is to say we 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.810
 we continue studying the toxicity and we 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.340
 we went to acute toxicity does not have 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.379
 acute toxicity 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.870
 claudia and has no chronic toxicity is 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:47.150
 important to clarify that it is a product 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.280
 that is guaranteed by the true anmat is 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.409
 a product guaranteed for by anmat and 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.969
 good is a product very studied is 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.740
 ie not only the effects and 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.060
 answers but part of the mechanism of 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.889
 action and also everything that 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.229
 it has to do with toxicity but 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.870
 then we can say that they are going to 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:06.110
 make us very happy and that's why we do 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.330
 this space let's say so interesting is 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.879
 say we have a product that is 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.439
 discovered in argentina in the connected 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:15.050
 with the faculty of pharmacy by 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.830
 Argentine researchers that turned out 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.720
 what 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.730
 is for the treatment of the for 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.560
 that your hair is falling is effective and not 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.500
 has adverse effects all made in 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.470
 Argentina exactly the product of 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.160
 clear product 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.160
 hair 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.050
 of course the patents belong to 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.570
 know because from this 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.770
 investigation arose patents that 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.630
 belong to the conicet and that were 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.760
 licensed to the guevara laboratory that 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.070
 is the one that currently markets the 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.960
 product under the name of choosing by 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.360
 what respect now yes yes now sure what 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.030
 I will be able to prove good any doubt 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.950
 Have any comments that we 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.810
 want to let us do what we do 

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.800
 the rest of the 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.360
 guests who were in the program 

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.100
 always remember on our page you 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.600
 kiss pointed com.ar 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.280
 we also have facebook where they put us 

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.710
 I like they send us messages 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.260
 we also answer them and well we 

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.750
 we see the next week always by 

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.820
 this same channel at this same time and that 

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:18.040
 the volunteer you want to take to Paula 

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.040
 part of her will love
