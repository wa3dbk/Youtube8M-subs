 channel viewers with you vampire and i 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.150
 continue to pass addition cool lyre 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.950
 3 and today I will pass the contest under 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.710
 name icebreaker 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.010
 which from pass an average of 8 minutes and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 15 seconds and a new technology will open. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.920
 Alliance is a cryo legionnaire 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.430
 let's start and again against us alone 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.329
 enemy base will act on 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 the old tactics that is, let's build a pair 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.489
 barracks we place them as close as possible to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.350
 the enemy and the infantry will carry 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.850
 base and let's read out and start at 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.390
 resulting in a small failure 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.699
 update on our cray systems one of 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 crooked orbital satellites of the alliance was 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.719
 disabled 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.619
 you could blame the commander at 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.830
 this military district but how can 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.330
 guess her such a scenario 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.950
 totally disliked so 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.869
 wait for a full scale attack with 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 using our create technology 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.470
 let's hope so no longer 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.070
 repeat so on let's build not think 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.110
 it's three 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.500
 barracks and tear down this principle can be 4 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.560
 try many consider me quite 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.470
 cold what does the commander get dressed 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.509
 warmer frosts will soon be this me 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.509
 I promise 3g barracks 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.770
 so is there any general oil in 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.650
 embroidery 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.960
 there is always such a wonderful 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.680
 it means we order power plants and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.240
 sell muscles 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.899
 a dresser and they will build not 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.899
