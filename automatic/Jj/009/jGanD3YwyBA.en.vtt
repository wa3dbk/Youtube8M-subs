00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
many so I don't have to load it up as

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.490 
many so I don't have to load it up as
often<00:05:05.440> as<00:05:06.099> where<00:05:06.880> they<00:05:07.000> print<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.870> actual

you're scanning faxing copying whatever
and<00:05:28.050> up<00:05:29.050> here<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:29.409> got<00:05:29.560> your<00:05:29.590> document<00:05:30.099> feeder

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
and up here you got your document feeder

and up here you got your document feeder
you<00:05:32.159> have<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:35.229> actual

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.920 

scanning<00:05:40.490> bet<00:05:40.820> here<00:05:41.110> keep<00:05:42.110> that<00:05:42.140> clean<00:05:43.930> and

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
scanning bet here keep that clean and

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.040 
scanning bet here keep that clean and
let's<00:05:45.230> open<00:05:45.380> this<00:05:45.620> up<00:05:46.390> pretty<00:05:47.390> standard<00:05:47.960> in

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
let's open this up pretty standard in

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.160 
let's open this up pretty standard in
here<00:05:48.440> that's<00:05:48.920> where<00:05:49.070> your<00:05:49.190> ink<00:05:49.370> cartridges<00:05:49.880> go

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
here that's where your ink cartridges go

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.050 
here that's where your ink cartridges go
and<00:05:51.170> like<00:05:51.260> I<00:05:51.350> said<00:05:51.410> before<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.950> ink<00:05:52.130> is<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.790> lot

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
and like I said before the ink is a lot

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.460 
and like I said before the ink is a lot
cheaper<00:05:53.090> that's<00:05:53.570> why<00:05:53.750> I<00:05:53.780> bought<00:05:53.960> this<00:05:54.170> more

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
cheaper that's why I bought this more

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.630 
cheaper that's why I bought this more
the<00:05:54.560> reasons<00:05:54.800> I<00:05:54.860> bought<00:05:55.040> this<00:05:55.190> that<00:05:55.460> in<00:05:55.550> the

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
the reasons I bought this that in the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.350 
the reasons I bought this that in the
Wi-Fi<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:57.640> let<00:05:58.640> me<00:05:58.700> just<00:05:58.730> show<00:05:59.030> you<00:05:59.090> another

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
Wi-Fi and let me just show you another

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.030 
Wi-Fi and let me just show you another
thing<00:05:59.570> on<00:05:59.930> here<00:06:00.170> and<00:06:00.260> that's<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.530> back<00:06:00.710> of<00:06:00.740> the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
thing on here and that's the back of the

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.480 
thing on here and that's the back of the
printer<00:06:01.430> because<00:06:02.420> you<00:06:02.960> can<00:06:03.110> actually<00:06:03.490> print

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
printer because you can actually print

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.820 
printer because you can actually print
both<00:06:04.940> sides<00:06:05.300> on<00:06:05.780> this<00:06:06.380> printer<00:06:06.710> without

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
both sides on this printer without

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.100 
both sides on this printer without
actually<00:06:07.790> having<00:06:07.880> to<00:06:08.090> move<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.450> paper<00:06:08.660> and

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
actually having to move the paper and

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.390 
actually having to move the paper and
that's<00:06:09.500> done<00:06:09.770> from<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:10.130> back<00:06:10.310> here<00:06:12.190> now<00:06:13.190> it's

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
that's done from the back here now it's

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.130 
that's done from the back here now it's
the<00:06:13.520> back<00:06:13.700> of<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:13.940> printer<00:06:14.270> here<00:06:14.510> this<00:06:14.900> little

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
the back of the printer here this little

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.070 
the back of the printer here this little
device<00:06:15.320> here<00:06:15.860> is<00:06:16.180> for<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:17.240> auto<00:06:17.419> two-sided

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
device here is for the auto two-sided

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.900 
device here is for the auto two-sided
printing<00:06:18.230> so<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.040> paper<00:06:19.220> will<00:06:19.400> come<00:06:19.430> through

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
printing so the paper will come through

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.170 
printing so the paper will come through
and<00:06:20.180> flip<00:06:21.050> it<00:06:21.169> over<00:06:21.290> so<00:06:21.650> you<00:06:21.740> can<00:06:21.830> actually

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
and flip it over so you can actually

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.210 
and flip it over so you can actually
like<00:06:23.180> I<00:06:23.240> said<00:06:23.450> without<00:06:23.570> moving<00:06:23.960> the<00:06:24.290> paper

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
like I said without moving the paper

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.760 
like I said without moving the paper
it'll<00:06:25.910> print<00:06:26.390> on<00:06:26.540> both<00:06:26.570> sides<00:06:26.990> on<00:06:27.169> its<00:06:27.320> own<00:06:27.500> and

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
it'll print on both sides on its own and

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.930 
it'll print on both sides on its own and
you<00:06:27.830> can<00:06:27.980> pull<00:06:28.160> it<00:06:28.190> off<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:28.550> I<00:06:28.610> want<00:06:28.730> to<00:06:28.790> do<00:06:28.850> it

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
you can pull it off and I want to do it

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.790 
you can pull it off and I want to do it
right<00:06:29.030> now<00:06:29.180> but<00:06:29.330> you<00:06:29.390> can<00:06:29.480> pull<00:06:29.660> it<00:06:29.750> off<00:06:29.870> in

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
right now but you can pull it off in

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.930 
right now but you can pull it off in
case<00:06:30.950> there's<00:06:31.130> a<00:06:31.160> paper<00:06:31.370> jam<00:06:31.580> or<00:06:31.790> anything
