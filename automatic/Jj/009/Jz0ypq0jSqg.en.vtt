00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
know the important thing is the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.910 
know the important thing is the
structure<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.420> position<00:01:37.900> of<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.530> elbows

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
structure and the position of the elbows

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.490 
structure and the position of the elbows
and<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.610> position<00:01:40.060> of<00:01:40.180> your<00:01:40.330> body<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:41.320> of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
course this position for chisel is not

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.630 
course this position for chisel is not
really<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.720> good<00:01:46.870> way<00:01:47.080> so<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.950> elbow<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.460> too

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
really in a good way so the elbow is too

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.090 
really in a good way so the elbow is too
far<00:01:48.940> from<00:01:49.300> your<00:01:49.450> from<00:01:49.780> your<00:01:49.900> body<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.380> cannot

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
far from your from your body you cannot

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.330 
far from your from your body you cannot
bring<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.420> power<00:01:52.660> from<00:01:53.050> your<00:01:53.170> body<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:54.190> your

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
bring the power from your body to your

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.100 
bring the power from your body to your
opponent<00:01:54.760> so<00:01:54.880> this<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.150> very<00:01:55.450> difficult<00:01:55.660> so

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
opponent so this is very difficult so

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.710 
opponent so this is very difficult so
the<00:01:56.650> idea<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.550> course<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.090> come<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.330> little

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
the idea is of course to come a little

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.900 
the idea is of course to come a little
bit<00:01:58.810> more<00:01:59.020> close<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.680> be<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.310> more<00:02:00.640> close

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
bit more close to be the more close

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.190 
bit more close to be the more close
don't<00:02:01.510> do<00:02:01.720> like<00:02:01.870> this

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
don't do like this

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.700 
don't do like this
yeah<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.400> don't<00:02:03.640> do<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:04.120> also<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:05.020> bad

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
yeah but don't do this also is bad

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.639 
yeah but don't do this also is bad
only<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.490> sitting<00:02:07.120> you<00:02:07.990> know<00:02:08.020> like<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.619> a

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
only you sitting you know like on a

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.490 
only you sitting you know like on a
chair<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.420> then<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> elbow<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
chair so and then you have the elbow a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.310 
chair so and then you have the elbow a
little<00:02:11.650> bit<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.220> but<00:02:12.760> not<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.900> not<00:02:14.110> a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
little bit in but not it's not a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.040 
little bit in but not it's not a
position<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.880> yeah<00:02:16.270> not<00:02:16.900> like

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
position like like this yeah not like

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.890 
position like like this yeah not like
this<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.130> if<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.520> this<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.780> know

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
this so if you do this then you know

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.680 
this so if you do this then you know
your<00:02:20.080> punch<00:02:20.350> goes<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.160> way<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.480> need

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
your punch goes this way so you need

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.280 
your punch goes this way so you need
always<00:02:22.960> a<00:02:23.380> triangle<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.480> position<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
always a triangle like this position and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.010 
always a triangle like this position and
