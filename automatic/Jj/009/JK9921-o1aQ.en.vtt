measuring them and that's what they do
every<00:01:06.900> day<00:01:07.430> today<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> very<00:01:08.820> exciting<00:01:09.270> because

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
every day today is very exciting because

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850 
every day today is very exciting because
these<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.840> turtles<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.530> getting<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
these little turtles are getting the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
these little turtles are getting the
first<00:01:11.100> taste<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> wild<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:12.930> go

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
first taste of the wild and they will go

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
first taste of the wild and they will go
on<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.380> grow<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.490> will

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
on to grow up here and then they will

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.210 
on to grow up here and then they will
contribute<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
contribute to

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.220 
contribute to
we<00:01:16.970> establishing<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.600> population<00:01:18.140> in

well<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:19.880> think<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.270> release<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.870> turtles

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
well I think the release of the turtles

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.310 
well I think the release of the turtles
today<00:01:21.770> really<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.670> symbol<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.270> hope<00:01:23.510> you

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
today really is a symbol of hope you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.830 
today really is a symbol of hope you
know<00:01:24.440> hope<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:25.010> we<00:01:25.250> can<00:01:25.550> correct<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.630> damage

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
know hope that we can correct the damage

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.620 
know hope that we can correct the damage
that<00:01:27.230> we've<00:01:27.440> done<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.830> this<00:01:27.980> species<00:01:28.570> all<00:01:29.570> of

that we've done to this species all of
