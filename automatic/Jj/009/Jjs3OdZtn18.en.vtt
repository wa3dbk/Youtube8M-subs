00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.230 

so<00:00:00.450> we're<00:00:00.570> about<00:00:00.659> to<00:00:00.960> start<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.380> Machine<00:00:01.860> and

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:02.240 
so we're about to start the Machine and

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.289 
so we're about to start the Machine and
see<00:00:03.240> that<00:00:04.220> the<00:00:05.220> pulp<00:00:05.460> does<00:00:05.730> not<00:00:05.910> come<00:00:06.150> out<00:00:06.240> of

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
see that the pulp does not come out of

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:25.600 
see that the pulp does not come out of
the<00:00:06.509> pool<00:00:07.010> bit<00:00:08.090> so<00:00:09.090> now<00:00:09.360> turn<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.660> on

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.590 

so<00:00:26.210> first<00:00:26.660> thing<00:00:26.930> is

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.520 

it's<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.590> renew<00:00:32.810> itself<00:00:33.810> to<00:00:34.260> power

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.979 

that's<00:00:39.100> motivating<00:00:39.760> so<00:00:39.969> now<00:00:40.149> I<00:00:40.180> will<00:00:40.600> push<00:00:40.840> it

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
that's motivating so now I will push it

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:48.900 
that's motivating so now I will push it
through

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.020 

this<00:00:49.510> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
this is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:03.009 
this is
the<00:00:51.600> GPS<00:00:52.530> unit

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:16.010 

oops<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:06.300> it's<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:06.630> blocked

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 

I'm<00:01:16.859> just<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> make<00:01:17.460> changes<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.479> then

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
I'm just going to make changes and then

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.690 
I'm just going to make changes and then
we're<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
we're going to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.260 
we're going to
break<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.539> inside

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.020 

will<00:01:57.680> see<00:01:57.920> here<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.640> all<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.870> the<00:02:00.850> orange<00:02:01.850> is

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
will see here that all of the orange is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.120 
will see here that all of the orange is
just<00:02:02.270> stuck<00:02:02.540> here<00:02:03.170> it's<00:02:03.380> not<00:02:03.560> actually<00:02:03.920> going

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
just stuck here it's not actually going

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.600 
just stuck here it's not actually going
through<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:05.510> system<00:02:05.780> at<00:02:06.620> all<00:02:07.070> which<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.460> what

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
through the system at all which is what

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.500 
through the system at all which is what
it's<00:02:07.760> supposed<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.209> do<00:02:08.420> thank<00:02:09.380> you
