00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
them normally like you would these do

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.780 
them normally like you would these do
take<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> little<00:02:27.440> bit<00:02:27.560> longer<00:02:27.860> they<00:02:28.580> talked

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
take a little bit longer they talked

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.730 
take a little bit longer they talked
about<00:02:29.120> 30<00:02:29.720> minutes<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:30.500> want<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
about 30 minutes so you just want to

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.080 
about 30 minutes so you just want to
keep<00:02:30.860> checking<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.340> them<00:02:31.460> make<00:02:31.670> sure<00:02:31.700> they<00:02:31.970> are

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
keep checking on them make sure they are

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.470 
keep checking on them make sure they are
fully<00:02:32.330> cooked<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> once<00:02:34.520> they<00:02:34.670> come<00:02:34.880> out<00:02:35.060> um

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
fully cooked so once they come out um

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480 
fully cooked so once they come out um
they<00:02:36.110> were<00:02:36.170> actually<00:02:36.620> really<00:02:36.980> really<00:02:37.160> high

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
they were actually really really high

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.970 
they were actually really really high
but<00:02:38.270> since<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.690> wanted<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.020> put<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.200> lid<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.470> top<00:02:39.770> I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
but since I wanted to put a lid on top I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.860 
but since I wanted to put a lid on top I
just<00:02:40.010> cut<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.580> top<00:02:40.760> off<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.480> course<00:02:41.720> you

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
just cut the top off but of course you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.720 
just cut the top off but of course you
can<00:02:42.050> leave<00:02:42.620> them<00:02:42.860> high<00:02:43.070> because<00:02:43.340> they<00:02:43.580> look

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
can leave them high because they look

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.120 
can leave them high because they look
cuter<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.300> I'm<00:02:44.960> just<00:02:45.140> adding<00:02:45.290> some<00:02:45.440> frosting

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
cuter and I'm just adding some frosting

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.460 
cuter and I'm just adding some frosting
now<00:02:49.360> I'm<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:50.540> making<00:02:50.870> sure<00:02:50.900> everything<00:02:51.380> is

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
now I'm just making sure everything is

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.199 
now I'm just making sure everything is
flat<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.130> when<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.490> put<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.820> lid<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.120> it

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
flat so that when I put the lid on it

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.560 
flat so that when I put the lid on it
won't<00:02:53.600> squish<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.209> add<00:02:56.330> some

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
on how to make these so I will link that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:13.160 
on how to make these so I will link that
in

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.449 

so<00:03:14.170> now<00:03:14.290> I'm<00:03:14.379> just<00:03:14.500> taking<00:03:14.680> some<00:03:15.040> Baker's

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
so now I'm just taking some Baker's

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.759 
so now I'm just taking some Baker's
twine<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.150> I'm<00:03:16.720> just<00:03:16.810> gonna<00:03:16.900> cut<00:03:17.200> off<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.319> piece

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
twine and I'm just gonna cut off a piece

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.130 
twine and I'm just gonna cut off a piece
so<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.099> can<00:03:18.220> fit<00:03:18.430> fully<00:03:18.760> around<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.090> jar<00:03:19.330> some

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
so it can fit fully around the jar some

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.570 
so it can fit fully around the jar some
once<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.379> put<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> lid<00:03:20.739> on<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:21.069> can<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.400> tie

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
once you put the lid on you can just tie

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.430 
once you put the lid on you can just tie
a<00:03:21.879> wooden<00:03:22.209> fork<00:03:22.599> or<00:03:22.870> any<00:03:23.050> type<00:03:23.290> before

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
a wooden fork or any type before

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.710 
a wooden fork or any type before
whatever<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.069> have<00:03:24.280> around<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.150> jar<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
whatever you have around the jar and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.289 
whatever you have around the jar and
then<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:27.040> tie<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> little<00:03:27.310> bow<00:03:27.580> around<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:30.299> and

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
then just tie a little bow around it and

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.050 
then just tie a little bow around it and
this<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.599> be<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> little<00:03:32.019> tricky<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:33.069> might

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
this can be a little tricky so you might

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.290 
this can be a little tricky so you might
need<00:03:34.209> somebody<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.720> help<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.019> with<00:03:35.170> it
