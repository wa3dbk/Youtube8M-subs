violence prevention I think that the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.860 
violence prevention I think that the
more<00:02:41.530> than<00:02:41.829> four<00:02:42.700> billion<00:02:42.970> dollars<00:02:43.510> spent

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
more than four billion dollars spent

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.390 
more than four billion dollars spent
since<00:02:44.130> 1978<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.750> death<00:02:47.019> penalty<00:02:47.650> could

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
since 1978 on the death penalty could

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.339 
since 1978 on the death penalty could
have<00:02:48.670> been<00:02:48.819> better<00:02:49.060> spent<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.810> violence

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
have been better spent on violence

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.920 
have been better spent on violence
prevention<00:02:50.410> on<00:02:51.370> helping<00:02:52.030> grieving<00:02:52.450> families
