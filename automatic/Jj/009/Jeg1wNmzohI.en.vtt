00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi youtube people i 'm shakira the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.759
 blogger and today I'm just going to 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.859
 talk about why start from scratch in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.050
 youtube and if it's really worth it 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.660
 make it from backgrounds also a departure 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.269
 very good modern warfare 2 on the map 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.220
 of trailer park and I hope this video 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.410
 serve as an example for all those 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 youtubers that want to boot and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.810
 get into this world of uploading videos 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 to youtube and I also hope that those 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.010
 they feel down and are about 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.279
 to let him completely change his 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.710
 it seems obviously on youtube there are 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.750
 many risks I tell you that my 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.520
 another channel that I have playback live that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.190
 many know and have heard about this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.200
 channel thanks to that I made myself 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 partner of a small business called 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.989
 ultra that offered the benefits of being 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 partner that is to be a partner or obtain 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.789
 money thanks to the videos banners 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.800
 etc. etc. etc. especially 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.230
 What interested me the most is the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.719
 possibility of growth 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.940
 these companies only what they want 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.189
 I realized and I checked with 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.900
 Many people want to fill 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.480
 pockets with your effort 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.550
 that is, they are not interested at all in 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.740
 the content that you do only want 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.080
 promote yourself to you from another 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.600
 way they can climb them and that their 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.280
 company grow and have money to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.690
 keep growing and can compete 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.510
 against big companies like 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.000
 machinima I for now I will not think 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.950
 neither in the partner nor I am interested in having it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.440
 for the moment I'm going to deny all 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.270
 the offers that make me so much on Skype 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.210
 as I have received or by private message 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.490
 I'm going to deny all of them completely is 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.430
 to all or only at the moment 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.500
 is to be able to take to this new channel a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.190
 little more than what I've taken to 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.800
 playback live and my big goal is also 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.560
 I can do two things two things I want to achieve 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.690
 with youtube the first is that the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.610
 Argentine community be a little more 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.460
 valued and recognized since we do not have 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.680
 practically no representative there 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.510
 exceptions obviously but we do not have 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.300
 no representative in this world of 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.759
 youtube my second goal is to get the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.090
 obviously partner but with what company 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.280
 with more cinema because machinima by two 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.100
 grounds 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.940
 the biggest is the biggest there is 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.680
 in this in this world of youtube and the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.470
 number of people that can help you 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.330
 you thanks to machinima there are a lot of 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.550
 large people who have the partner with 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.530
 machine and more I will not give names but 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.250
 surely some of your youtubers 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.709
 preferred has to stop commas yenima and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.200
 above all thanks to this you will be able to 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.180
 to join them and be able to grow even more 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.730
 for this reason I have made this new 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.260
 channel to not waste even my time in that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.600
 disables me in the honeycomb as ultra in 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.610
 another channel and not to waste time 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.070
 from my subscribers that maybe day to 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.800
 day they go through my channel and they shit 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.630
 laugh with some video of mine or interested 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.550
 to see something new from my channel whatever 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.440
 for whatever reason I do not want 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.720
 waste neither my time nor that of 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.400
 you another thing that happens here in 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.560
 youtube there are many people who come to me 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.330
 saying in private message about the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.519
 haters theme I do not want to give much 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.459
 opinion on this I only want them 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.160
 say that every time you see a dislike 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.860
 in your video do not think it's going to be something 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.410
 negative against you for nothing just ignores 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.360
 those people kept making even more videos 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.100
 that that motivates you totally to follow 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.290
 making videos all those people that 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.180
 you really appreciate you follow you going to 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.040

 will totally benefit you to follow 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.079
 growing obviously that has made me 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.360
 cost a lot a year just a 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.810
 little more get what I got 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.239
 with so much effort three thousand subscribers 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.310
 more than a thousand daily visits and so on 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.260
 etcetera are only numbers but that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.440
 It shows the amount of people that 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.890
 still really is not quarrel the word 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.790
 but disappointment that so many people so much 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.430
 people have so much greed and ambition and 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.160
 whatever it is that they make you shit and 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.680

 tool to me does not influence youtube to 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.460
 sometimes betrays and does not inform people 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.960
 that has uploaded a new video or maybe 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.870
