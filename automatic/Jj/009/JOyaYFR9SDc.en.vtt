so I'm just going to keyframe it as 0 se

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.630 
so I'm just going to keyframe it as 0 se
porque<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:24.029> my<00:00:24.390> help<00:00:25.010> okay<00:00:26.010> we've<00:00:26.490> got<00:00:26.609> a

degrees yeah go to frame and five I want

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.299 
degrees yeah go to frame and five I want
it<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.320> minus<00:00:34.710> 10<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> I'm<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> spin

it to be minus 10 so I'm going to spin

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.240 
it to be minus 10 so I'm going to spin
it<00:00:38.340> back<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:40.320> used<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.770> mind<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.070> key

it back but I got used my mind is key
because<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:42.469> recording<00:00:43.469> shop<00:00:43.710> got<00:00:43.920> four

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
because it's my recording shop got four

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.869 
because it's my recording shop got four
paws<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:46.370> okay<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.660> this<00:00:48.660> minus<00:00:48.989> 10<00:00:49.379> there

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
paws and okay so this minus 10 there

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.209 
paws and okay so this minus 10 there
okay<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.180> Saul<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.600> me<00:00:51.660> five<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:53.100> then

okay for this Saul it's me five and then
for<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.649> minus<00:00:55.649> five<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.219> get

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
for this on it to be minus five you get

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.400 
for this on it to be minus five you get
the<00:00:56.430> picture<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.289> must<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.480> three

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.850 

and<00:01:03.530> upper<00:01:04.070> frame<00:01:06.670> minus<00:01:07.670> 3

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
and upper frame minus 3

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:18.900 
and upper frame minus 3
up<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:09.940> friend<00:01:13.230> maybe<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:17.520> open<00:01:18.520> up<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.700> frame

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
up a friend maybe to open up the frame

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.140 
up a friend maybe to open up the frame
minus<00:01:19.510> two<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:19.870> you<00:01:19.930> just<00:01:20.140> consecutive<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
minus two so you just consecutive you

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.260 
minus two so you just consecutive you
know<00:01:22.240> 10-10<00:01:22.990> 5-5<00:01:24.540> 3-3<00:01:25.650> 2x2<00:01:26.650> 1-1<00:01:27.340> depend<00:01:28.000> them<00:01:28.120> i

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.800 

nice<00:01:44.950> form<00:01:45.189> I<00:01:45.509> will<00:01:46.509> give<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.689> zero<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.810> if

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
nice form I will give it a zero so if

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.710 
nice form I will give it a zero so if
you<00:01:49.990> look<00:01:50.200> at<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.439> values<00:01:50.829> now<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:52.390> looking

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
you look at the values now just looking

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.569 
you look at the values now just looking
out<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.899> values<00:01:53.200> or<00:01:53.770> scroll<00:01:54.039> across<00:01:54.130> we've

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
out the values or scroll across we've

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.459 
out the values or scroll across we've
got<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.810> zero<00:01:56.170> until<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.680> hits<00:01:57.270> 10-10<00:01:58.270> 5-5<00:01:59.079> 3

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
got it's zero until it hits 10-10 5-5 3

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.169 
got it's zero until it hits 10-10 5-5 3
minus<00:01:59.710> 3<00:01:59.970> 2<00:02:00.970> minus<00:02:01.539> 2<00:02:01.810> 1<00:02:02.200> minus<00:02:02.770> 1<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.250> 0<00:02:03.610> and

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
minus 3 2 minus 2 1 minus 1 and 0 and

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.870 
minus 3 2 minus 2 1 minus 1 and 0 and
that'll<00:02:04.420> give<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:04.689> effect<00:02:04.899> of<00:02:05.579> bubble<00:02:06.579> pop<00:02:06.729> up

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
that'll give the effect of bubble pop up

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.749 
that'll give the effect of bubble pop up
on<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.270> shake<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> Lincoln

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
on the shake and because the Lincoln

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.520 
on the shake and because the Lincoln
straight<00:02:10.000> sorry<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.509> we've<00:02:11.200> got<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> nice

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
very simple very easy and there's the

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.850 
very simple very easy and there's the
last<00:02:20.560> effect<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:24.040> course<00:02:24.310> all's<00:02:24.519> I<00:02:24.640> did<00:02:24.670> was

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
last effect of course all's I did was

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.559 
last effect of course all's I did was
duplicate<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.069> animation<00:02:27.700> three<00:02:27.970> times<00:02:28.209> just

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
duplicate the animation three times just

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.180 
duplicate the animation three times just
I<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.769> clone<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:31.110> dro<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.769> dummy

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
I just clone in the dro and the dummy

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.400 
I just clone in the dro and the dummy
attached<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.720> tweak<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.230> few

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
attached to just tweak in a few

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.039 
attached to just tweak in a few
constraints<00:02:36.180> added<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.299> small<00:02:37.840> little

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
constraints added a small little

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.539 
constraints added a small little
particle<00:02:38.650> with<00:02:39.430> pike<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:41.200> bit<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.040> reactor

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
particle with pike for a bit of reactor

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.250 
particle with pike for a bit of reactor
now<00:02:43.209> if<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.390> want<00:02:43.569> another<00:02:43.690> reactor<00:02:44.170> then

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
now if you want another reactor then

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.380 
now if you want another reactor then
I'll<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> little<00:02:44.920> tutorial<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.819> have<00:02:46.209> got

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
I'll do a little tutorial but I have got

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.880 
I'll do a little tutorial but I have got
all<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> reactor<00:02:46.930> tutorials<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.709> could

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
all the reactor tutorials and you could

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.990 
all the reactor tutorials and you could
simulate<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.060> yourself<00:02:49.420> it's<00:02:49.890> quite<00:02:50.890> easy<00:02:51.000> so

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
simulate it yourself it's quite easy so

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.780 
simulate it yourself it's quite easy so
