I always when I'm punching with these

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.429 
I always when I'm punching with these
border<00:01:10.490> punches<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:11.000> start<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.600> center<00:01:11.869> if

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
border punches I start in the center if

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.440 
border punches I start in the center if
I'm<00:01:12.950> going<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.159> do<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> whole<00:01:13.640> row<00:01:14.000> which<00:01:14.299> you

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
I'm going to do a whole row which you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.140 
I'm going to do a whole row which you
usually<00:01:14.630> are<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:15.049> you're<00:01:15.350> doing<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:16.090> using<00:01:17.090> a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
usually are when you're doing a using a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.969 
usually are when you're doing a using a
border<00:01:17.420> punch<00:01:17.570> I<00:01:17.810> start<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.320> center<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.740> my

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
border punch I start in the center of my

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.990 
border punch I start in the center of my
card<00:01:19.310> stock<00:01:20.500> because<00:01:21.759> if<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:24.520> start<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.729> one

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
card stock because if you start on one

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.940 
card stock because if you start on one
end<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.659> work<00:01:27.020> your<00:01:27.259> way<00:01:27.320> toward<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.830> other

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
end and work your way toward the other

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.080 
end and work your way toward the other
end<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:29.259> can<00:01:30.259> end<00:01:30.470> up<00:01:30.560> with<00:01:30.770> uneven<00:01:31.280> scallops

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
end you can end up with uneven scallops

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.819 
end you can end up with uneven scallops
on<00:01:32.240> both<00:01:32.420> sides<00:01:32.869> let<00:01:33.320> me<00:01:33.409> show<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.680> what<00:01:33.770> I

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
on both sides let me show you what I

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.640 
on both sides let me show you what I
mean<00:01:33.890> see<00:01:34.729> how<00:01:34.909> I've<00:01:35.060> got<00:01:35.240> just<00:01:35.509> like<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.960> half<00:01:36.500> a

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
mean see how I've got just like a half a

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.440 
mean see how I've got just like a half a
scallop<00:01:37.009> here<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.490> half<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.759> scallop<00:01:38.119> here

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
scallop here and a half a scallop here

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.870 
scallop here and a half a scallop here
well<00:01:39.049> if<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:39.229> had<00:01:39.320> started<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.829> end<00:01:40.009> it

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
well if I had started on the end it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.340 
well if I had started on the end it
might<00:01:41.090> have<00:01:41.240> ended<00:01:41.360> up<00:01:41.570> with<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.229> know

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
might have ended up with you know

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.679 
might have ended up with you know
started<00:01:43.130> with<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> full<00:01:43.610> scallop<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.420> then<00:01:44.540> it

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
started with a full scallop and then it

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.090 
started with a full scallop and then it
would<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:44.900> been<00:01:44.990> off<00:01:45.229> on<00:01:45.290> this<00:01:45.650> side<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.009> it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
would have been off on this side and it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.740 
would have been off on this side and it
might<00:01:46.220> have<00:01:46.369> just<00:01:46.399> been<00:01:46.579> a<00:01:46.700> little<00:01:46.909> snippet<00:01:47.479> or

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
might have just been a little snippet or

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.350 
might have just been a little snippet or
whatever<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.130> find<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:49.880> it's<00:01:50.060> just

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
whatever so I find that it's just

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.069 
whatever so I find that it's just
easiest<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.110> get<00:01:51.290> both<00:01:51.619> sides<00:01:51.979> even<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:53.270> you

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
easiest to get both sides even if you

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.389 
easiest to get both sides even if you
start<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.409> middle<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.770> go<00:01:54.979> one<00:01:55.220> way<00:01:55.369> and

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
start in the middle and go one way and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.240 
start in the middle and go one way and
then<00:01:55.729> head<00:01:55.939> back<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.390> other<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.799> other<00:01:57.950> thing

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
then head back the other the other thing

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.740 
then head back the other the other thing
that<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.430> do<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:58.700> don't<00:01:58.939> know<00:01:59.119> if<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.360> can<00:01:59.509> see

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
that I do I don't know if you can see

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.450 
that I do I don't know if you can see
this<00:01:59.960> or<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:00.259> but<00:02:00.320> there's<00:02:00.649> some<00:02:00.860> little<00:02:01.189> sort

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
this or not but there's some little sort

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.380 
this or not but there's some little sort
of<00:02:02.649> frayed<00:02:03.649> edges<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.549> are<00:02:04.610> usually<00:02:05.149> they're

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
of frayed edges that are usually they're

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.420 
of frayed edges that are usually they're
after<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.049> punch<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.619> some<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.040> these<00:02:07.130> punches

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
after you punch on some of these punches

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.069 
after you punch on some of these punches
it<00:02:07.670> kind<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.909> depends<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.390> punch<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.929> how

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
it kind of depends on the punch and how

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.800 
it kind of depends on the punch and how
old<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.709> how<00:02:10.009> much<00:02:10.180> use<00:02:11.180> it's<00:02:11.450> gotten

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
old it is and how much use it's gotten

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.449 
old it is and how much use it's gotten
but<00:02:12.410> if<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.709> just<00:02:12.860> run<00:02:13.040> your<00:02:13.129> finger<00:02:13.430> over

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
but if you just run your finger over

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.280 
but if you just run your finger over
that<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:14.209> can<00:02:14.330> smooth<00:02:14.629> those<00:02:14.870> little<00:02:15.140> rough

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
that you can smooth those little rough

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.230 
that you can smooth those little rough
edges<00:02:15.500> out<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.069> you're<00:02:16.340> good<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.550> go

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
edges out and you're good to go

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.110 
edges out and you're good to go
