backup<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.560> 600<00:02:27.560> V<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.709> 360<00:02:28.250> watts<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.870> total

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
backup is 600 V a 360 watts and total

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.630 
backup is 600 V a 360 watts and total
output<00:02:30.080> current<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.770> two<00:02:30.920> point<00:02:31.130> six<00:02:31.310> amperes

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
output current is two point six amperes

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.500 
output current is two point six amperes
so<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.180> need<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.630> ensure<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:34.160> your<00:02:34.940> devices

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
so you need to ensure that your devices

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.030 
so you need to ensure that your devices
are<00:02:36.410> within<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:37.040> range<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.620> I'll<00:02:39.620> come<00:02:39.860> back

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
are within that range so I'll come back

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.850 
are within that range so I'll come back
with<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.459> full<00:02:40.610> review<00:02:41.170> okay<00:02:42.170> guys<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:42.680> we've

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
with the full review okay guys so we've

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.750 
with the full review okay guys so we've
used<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.400> back<00:02:43.910> ups<00:02:44.720> rs600<00:02:45.319> for<00:02:45.800> about<00:02:46.130> seven

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
used the back ups rs600 for about seven

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.020 
used the back ups rs600 for about seven
days<00:02:46.880> now<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.530> overall<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.740> seems<00:02:48.950> alright<00:02:49.400> we

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
days now and overall it seems alright we

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.270 
days now and overall it seems alright we

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
was able to give us a battery backup of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.680 
was able to give us a battery backup of
about<00:03:06.890> 10<00:03:07.250> minutes

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
about 10 minutes

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.370 
about 10 minutes
post<00:03:09.070> electrical<00:03:10.070> failure<00:03:10.460> so<00:03:10.790> in<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.870> sense

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
post electrical failure so in that sense

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.980 
post electrical failure so in that sense
we're<00:03:13.070> pretty<00:03:13.220> happy<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:14.000> says<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.630> fairly

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
we're pretty happy it says it's a fairly

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.040 
we're pretty happy it says it's a fairly
cheap<00:03:15.260> UPS<00:03:15.800> compared<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:17.300> one<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.900> we

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
cheap UPS compared to the one that we

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.040 
cheap UPS compared to the one that we
use<00:03:18.230> we<00:03:19.010> use<00:03:19.040> an<00:03:19.280> online<00:03:19.430> UPS<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.390> our<00:03:20.690> office

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
use we use an online UPS in our office

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.890 
use we use an online UPS in our office
and<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.800> one<00:03:21.980> cost<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.490> bomb<00:03:23.000> compared<00:03:23.810> to

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
and that one cost a bomb compared to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.980 
and that one cost a bomb compared to
that<00:03:24.020> this<00:03:24.230> one<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.680> very<00:03:25.250> cheap<00:03:25.520> and<00:03:25.870> when<00:03:26.870> the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
that this one is very cheap and when the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.170 
that this one is very cheap and when the
electricity<00:03:27.230> goes<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.770> don't<00:03:27.950> feel<00:03:28.310> the

jitter<00:03:32.930> got<00:03:33.710> about<00:03:33.890> 10<00:03:34.160> minutes<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:34.940> backup

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
jitter got about 10 minutes of backup

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.480 
jitter got about 10 minutes of backup
and<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:35.900> could<00:03:36.050> easily<00:03:36.230> save<00:03:36.740> our<00:03:36.980> stuff<00:03:37.250> and

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
and we could easily save our stuff and

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.820 
and we could easily save our stuff and
shut<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.090> down<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:38.990> from<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.380> sense<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.710> the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
shut it down so from that sense of the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.230 
shut it down so from that sense of the
view<00:03:39.950> we<00:03:40.070> were<00:03:40.130> pretty<00:03:40.310> impressed<00:03:40.700> with<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
view we were pretty impressed with the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.140 
view we were pretty impressed with the
back<00:03:41.770> ups<00:03:42.770> or<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.130> back<00:03:43.310> ups<00:03:44.500> rs600<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.940> does

so<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.400> can<00:03:53.390> just<00:03:53.600> kind<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:53.990> judge<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.620> it's

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
so you can just kind of judge that it's

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.150 
so you can just kind of judge that it's
going<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:54.980> last<00:03:55.160> for<00:03:55.400> about<00:03:55.490> 10<00:03:56.060> minutes<00:03:56.300> and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
going to last for about 10 minutes and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.100 
going to last for about 10 minutes and
there<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.250> no<00:03:58.460> terminal<00:03:59.240> of<00:03:59.360> sorts<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.900> tell

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
there is no terminal of sorts to tell

you or to connect with your computer to

you or to connect with your computer to

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
tell you how the battery life is or what

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.000 
tell you how the battery life is or what
the<00:04:04.880> condition<00:04:05.270> of<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.450> battery<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.960> so<00:04:06.740> that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
the condition of the battery is so that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.730 
the condition of the battery is so that
is<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.370> only<00:04:07.550> downside<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.300> this<00:04:08.630> budget<00:04:09.200> UPS

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
is the only downside to this budget UPS

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.710 
is the only downside to this budget UPS
but<00:04:10.010> apart<00:04:10.250> from<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.460> it's<00:04:10.760> fairly<00:04:11.060> good<00:04:11.240> you

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
but apart from that it's fairly good you

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.050 
but apart from that it's fairly good you
do<00:04:11.870> get<00:04:12.050> a<00:04:12.080> 2<00:04:12.320> your<00:04:12.560> on-site<00:04:13.190> warranty<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:13.910> if

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
do get a 2 your on-site warranty so if

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.630 
do get a 2 your on-site warranty so if
there<00:04:14.239> is<00:04:14.330> any<00:04:14.510> issue<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:15.440> PC<00:04:16.010> people<00:04:16.190> will<00:04:16.430> come
