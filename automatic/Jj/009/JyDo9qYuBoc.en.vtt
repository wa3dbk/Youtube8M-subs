you<00:01:18.810> gotta<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.500> guess<00:01:19.820> personally<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> don't

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you gotta go I guess personally I don't

think<00:01:21.390> i<00:01:21.479> would<00:01:21.540> chance<00:01:21.960> having<00:01:22.290> an

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
think i would chance having an

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
think i would chance having an
electrical<00:01:23.189> current<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.939> through<00:01:24.540> there

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
electrical current go up through there

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.789 
electrical current go up through there
who<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.890> uh<00:01:26.930> well<00:01:27.930> teach<00:01:28.229> their<00:01:28.500> own<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
who I would uh well teach their own I

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.330 
who I would uh well teach their own I
guess<00:01:30.409> surfing<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> roof<00:01:31.799> sounds<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
guess surfing on the roof sounds like a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.359 
guess surfing on the roof sounds like a
great<00:01:32.670> idea<00:01:32.729> doesn't<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.509> yeah<00:01:33.840> let's<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.369> well

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
great idea doesn't it yeah let's go well

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.980 
great idea doesn't it yeah let's go well
not<00:01:35.520> exactly<00:01:35.579> sure<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.420> he<00:01:36.600> thought<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
not exactly sure what he thought the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.620 
not exactly sure what he thought the
outcome<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.439> would<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.400> hopefully

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
outcome of this would be but hopefully

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.620 
outcome of this would be but hopefully
that<00:01:39.630> knocked<00:01:39.900> some<00:01:40.140> sense<00:01:40.170> into<00:01:40.530> him<00:01:41.479> I'm<00:01:42.479> not

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that knocked some sense into him I'm not

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
that knocked some sense into him I'm not
sure<00:01:42.689> how<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> ended<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> don't<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
sure how this ended but I don't think it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.910 
sure how this ended but I don't think it
was<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.170> boxes<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.680> clearly

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
was good because the boxes are clearly

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
was good because the boxes are clearly
about<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> tip<00:01:47.399> over<00:01:47.610> he<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.390> surrounded<00:01:48.570> by

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
about to tip over he is surrounded by

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
about to tip over he is surrounded by
concrete<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.130> everybody's<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.670> watching

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
concrete and everybody's just watching
