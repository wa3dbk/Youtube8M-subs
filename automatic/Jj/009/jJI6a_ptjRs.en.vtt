 5 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.510
 for Chinese equipment for equipment brands 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.510
 as nokia 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.900
 etc 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.700
 motÃ¶rhead and all that for these teams 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.700
 you will not see them 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.780
 the asterisk numbered good for nobody 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 46 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.050
 despise 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.090
 engineering health syndrome 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.870
 we go to connectivity that was 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.870
 my activity 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.240
 information 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.240
 more radio 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 when we choose on line 1 and the 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 t command 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.659
 let's have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.549
 select 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.549
 line 1 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.210
 this would be the more equal mr axis 17 and the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210
 two 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.860
 between the two masses with the number 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.970
 again 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.970
 35 us 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.430
 with some 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.620
 yes 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.990
 email them then with 15 schools 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.370
 I recommend that they use a phone 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.230
 broken or old you have for not 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.360
 risk us natively or armand 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.619
 of this negative command we do in this 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.619
 same list tracking 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.620
 but 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:31.530
 the command was sent to a team of 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.700
 restart it so that the email is seen like this 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.700
 that now pretty 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.960
 and the phone 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:53.390
 106 because now I have 35 88 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.569
 a few moments ago in the modification 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.090
 You can see it after sending the 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.099
 command and restart the phone 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.590
 this way it works for phones 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.830
 Chinese and usually happens that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.550
 duplicating the e-mails and this is 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.200
 email reaches your father this negative no 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.690
 they will be able to use the telephone then 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.490
 this way change the phone 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.330
 usually 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:30.130
 they really would have to do 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.160
 the unique emails from our 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.190
 sellers from china but many times not 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.690
 happens is more you are a replica of 10 and 5 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.600
 of 10 and 4 and all and several of s 3 in 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.640
 this moment buy well always the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.970
 yoga encourages me to import from early 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.220
 I kept silent in a negative band 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.330
 I hope you will be served please come 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.210
 below I leave a video with 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.070
 I leave a link with more information with 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.890
 a show that can also change in the 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.780
 email is easier because they connect it but 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.290
 they have to have the drive and the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.409
 soft can not root it load 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.659
 the often cover it or any doubt 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.120
 can leave a comment 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.120
