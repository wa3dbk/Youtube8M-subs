little<00:02:49.770> loop<00:02:50.100> there<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:54.170> take<00:02:55.170> this

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
little loop there like so and take this

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.920 
little loop there like so and take this
house<00:02:55.530> would<00:02:55.740> work<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.630> you're<00:02:57.630> going

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
house would work with this you're going

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.300 
house would work with this you're going
to<00:02:58.280> take<00:02:59.280> that<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.350> around<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.980> hinge

there and wrap and twist aha so now you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.740 
there and wrap and twist aha so now you
have<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.100> little<00:03:14.160> edge<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.880> keep<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.540> in

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
have this little edge to keep that in

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.820 
have this little edge to keep that in
there<00:03:16.490> pry<00:03:17.490> that<00:03:17.670> up<00:03:17.900> put<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.020> in<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.650> make
