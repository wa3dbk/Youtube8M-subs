00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
actually used a 32 millimeter 1 i'm

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.610 
actually used a 32 millimeter 1 i'm
looking<00:00:45.420> down<00:00:45.809> at<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.170> i<00:00:46.289> wasn't<00:00:46.469> sure

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
looking down at it because i wasn't sure

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.150 
looking down at it because i wasn't sure
but<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> 32<00:00:47.850> millimeter<00:00:48.559> wand<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
but it's the 32 millimeter wand and this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850 
but it's the 32 millimeter wand and this
is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> Sapphire<00:00:51.410> irresistible<00:00:52.410> mean<00:00:52.590> wand

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
this one comes with eight different ones

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
this one comes with eight different ones
so<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.640> 11<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.449> interchangeable

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
