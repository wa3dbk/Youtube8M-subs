00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.360
 we're going now have lifted the block 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.400
 screen so we will use a sucker 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.930
 we will draw heavily on the sucker and 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.990
 with a small spatula we go all 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.670
 simply go around the iphone 5 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.550
 position the spatula under the knob 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.210
 home have gone around as pictured 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.560
 to disengage 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.940
 the screen block so we do not go until 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.550
 strait side simply and we use as 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.110
 a book 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.970
 we will now remove the cash 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.070
 metal that protects the tablecloths 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.090
 So the screen is maintained by the hide 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.340
 the vices numbered b1 b2 b3 just done 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.780
 watch out for the screw b3 she is not 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.900
 metallic so with the screwdriver 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.130
 she'll stay on the chassis 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.130
 so we simply remove with a 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.230
 Brussels has only a few tweezers 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.660
 nothing really specific 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.780

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.730
 we will remove the small metal cover 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.260
 now we have access to the tablecloths 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.180
 of the screen so we simply go 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.709
 disconnect them there are three layers of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.109
 tablecloths for the screen a tactile proof 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.359

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:09.170
 tablecloth that serves especially for the camera 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:12.140
 facetime and the brightness sensor 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.000
 here we are disconnecting or simply 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.030
 three tablecloths and your blog block screen 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.569
 is ready to leave now we want the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.370
 home button 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.409
 then the home button and the tablecloth 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.920
 same home button are maintained by 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:28.250
 note noted d1 and d2 by a small 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.209
 wafer actually is blurry the wafer 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.250
 you have the dap 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.669
 so we remove the defects d1 and d2 and 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.340
 with a cutter or a brussels we go 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:42.409
 slightly will take off at the level of 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.209
 take off the tablecloth from the chassis the screen 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.669
 then you gently pull on it 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.879
 clamped on a cutter a tool a tool 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.799
 for his purposes to be able to decode these two 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.470
 elements in this case we will use 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.129
 a cutter we pass the cutter under the 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.030

 with this support 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.340
 now we have the home button 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.260
 gold the button but it is very slightly 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.410
