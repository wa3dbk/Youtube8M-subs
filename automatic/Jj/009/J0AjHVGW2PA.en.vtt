00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
crazy and actually they even blur I'm

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.340 
crazy and actually they even blur I'm

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
think they blur the background a little

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.270 
think they blur the background a little
bit<00:04:48.170> or<00:04:49.170> maybe<00:04:49.200> it's<00:04:49.470> just<00:04:49.530> my<00:04:49.740> eyes<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:49.950> blur

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
bit or maybe it's just my eyes a blur

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.060 
bit or maybe it's just my eyes a blur
but<00:04:52.700> this<00:04:53.700> this<00:04:54.120> this<00:04:54.480> game<00:04:54.750> has<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:55.200> lot<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.500> 3d

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
but this this this game has a lot of 3d

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.510 
but this this this game has a lot of 3d
effect<00:04:56.640> going<00:04:57.000> for<00:04:57.300> it

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.850 

but<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.240> might<00:05:00.389> I<00:05:00.810> don't<00:05:00.960> know<00:05:01.020> some<00:05:01.590> people

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
but it might I don't know some people

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.409 
but it might I don't know some people
might<00:05:01.979> want<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.610> turn<00:05:02.729> off<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.090> 3d<00:05:03.360> effect

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
might want to turn off the 3d effect

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.600 
might want to turn off the 3d effect
sometimes<00:05:03.889> it<00:05:04.889> really<00:05:04.979> depends<00:05:05.370> what<00:05:05.490> you

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
sometimes it really depends what you
