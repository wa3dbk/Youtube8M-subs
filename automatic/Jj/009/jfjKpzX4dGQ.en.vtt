00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.480
 and then we have a new video of 22 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.779
 how to do and then as there 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.820
 many types of cats because I do not know what 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 we will do in a separate god no no in this 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 same but in different parts since 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.640
 we are in the game the cat then let's go 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.449
 to do everything that goes with the cat 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.810
 good so first the cat is going 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.390
 To be 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.320
 and there is a normal cat what 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 you would be 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 and then what would be me 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.570
 I would recommend no wall as low as it happens 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.570
 fences but a rough one more or less 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.540
 one leg and one leg then at 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.240
 doing it cat is different from the past and 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.300
 You see that hands can begin 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.720
 putting us here in the middle but I already 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.200
 support here 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.020
 and the cat is very simple because when you catch 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.470
 with the impulse of the wheelbarrow because 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.890
 tireÃ©is parantes and we passed the legs 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.890
 through the middle 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.860
 the greatest force that has to be done 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.120
 it is in the hands 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.120
 and the two for you 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.260
 and you have already seen the demonstration 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.500
 of the cat and now we are going to show you the 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.400
 cat but the legs are in the middle 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.860
 it's the cat that is not like that if it's not 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.070
 well and the only thing you have to do is 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.410
 as a step go but more stretch a 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.460
 little more to the side would throw a little 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.520
 plus 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.260
 and then you do not want what to do is support 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.550
 hands this is how he supported us and then 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.060
 stretched and jump is now a 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.060
 demonstration 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.260
 Well, now I'm not practicing 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.969
 cat estrada is a normal cat and mouth 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.829
 being more reducing hands for 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.659
 be able to make more strength and stretch 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.819
 thematics the first thing to do 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:30.230
 is to put the body all stretched 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:36.640
 you can in the air obviously and then fall 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:40.569
 on the surface that for others always 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.569
 lasarte with one leg 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.830
 and well now I 'm going to explain the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.760
 cat is also the precision for 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.190
 get to cat gives one to one then when 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.280
 there are obstacles in video power 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.560
 at a distance that soon proposes 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:21.680
 First, do not always think 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:21.680
 at this point so you can get along 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.110
 normal 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:39.740
 here what you have to do is put on like this 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.740
 and here study with your hands 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.959
 yes 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 of cat 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:10.680
 is open to support you in us 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.510
 in another are the tablets reacts 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.690
 without thinking that you do not work that I wanted 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.670
 throw you forever and when here 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.470
 when they have say that they have our 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.470
 rope to pass this distance 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.060
 let's do it 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.530
 and well up to here the tutorial of the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.990
 cats and hope you liked it and 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.560
 that the practice is that some learn 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.560
 one day
