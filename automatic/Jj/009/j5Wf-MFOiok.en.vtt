hello friends this video on kingdom

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.720 
hello friends this video on kingdom
Animalia<00:00:03.720> part<00:00:04.049> 22<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.859> brought<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.700> by

Animalia part 22 is brought to you by

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.290 
Animalia part 22 is brought to you by
exam<00:00:06.330> feel<00:00:06.600> calm<00:00:07.170> no<00:00:07.649> more<00:00:07.890> view<00:00:08.160> from<00:00:08.429> exam

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.509 

let<00:00:12.300> us<00:00:12.480> now<00:00:12.690> talk<00:00:12.750> about<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.860> third<00:00:14.160> category

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
let us now talk about the third category

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.320 
let us now talk about the third category
that<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.240> vertebrate<00:00:16.199> ax<00:00:16.310> so<00:00:17.310> where<00:00:17.670> else<00:00:18.060> we

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that is vertebrate ax so where else we

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.450 
that is vertebrate ax so where else we
start<00:00:18.390> talking<00:00:19.109> about<00:00:19.380> vertebrate<00:00:19.920> uh<00:00:20.100> first

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
start talking about vertebrate uh first

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.150 
start talking about vertebrate uh first
of<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.789> let<00:00:21.029> us<00:00:21.150> try<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.439> our

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
of all let us try to see what our

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.849 
of all let us try to see what our
vertebrate<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> common<00:00:24.859> characteristics

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
vertebrate of the common characteristics

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.790 
vertebrate of the common characteristics
they<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.550> classified<00:00:26.939> under<00:00:27.330> chords<00:00:28.080> now

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
they are classified under chords now

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.370 
they are classified under chords now
many<00:00:29.099> people<00:00:29.550> often<00:00:29.699> confuse<00:00:30.140> vertebrates<00:00:31.140> as

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
many people often confuse vertebrates as

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.319 
many people often confuse vertebrates as
cordons<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.099> think<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.640> vertebrate<00:00:33.300> eye

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
cordons they think that vertebrate eye

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.170 
cordons they think that vertebrate eye
is<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:34.020> another<00:00:34.350> name<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.739> chordates<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
is just another name of chordates but it

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.100 
is just another name of chordates but it
is<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
is not like that

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.040 
is not like that
all<00:00:37.940> vertebrates<00:00:38.940> vertebrates<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
all vertebrates vertebrates is a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.740 
all vertebrates vertebrates is a
category<00:00:40.620> under<00:00:40.950> codex<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.000> means<00:00:42.390> all

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
category under codex that means all

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
category under codex that means all
vertebrates<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.950> coordinates<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:44.820> all

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
vertebrates are coordinates because all

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.000 
vertebrates are coordinates because all
vertebrates<00:00:45.690> will<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> basic

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
vertebrates will have all the basic

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.850 
vertebrates will have all the basic
features<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> aquatics<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.860> coordinates

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
features of aquatics but all coordinates

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
features of aquatics but all coordinates
are<00:00:50.070> non<00:00:50.309> verticals<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> talk<00:00:51.539> about

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
are non verticals when you talk about

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.990 
are non verticals when you talk about
coordinates<00:00:52.440> gyro<00:00:53.190> chordates

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
coordinates gyro chordates

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.689 
coordinates gyro chordates
cephalo<00:00:54.750> coordinates<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:56.219> chords

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
cephalo coordinates they also are chords

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.209 
cephalo coordinates they also are chords
but<00:00:56.879> they<00:00:57.059> are<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:57.629> great<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.770> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
but they are not very great right so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
but they are not very great right so
basically<00:00:59.430> if<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.239> talk<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:01.050> terms<00:01:01.320> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
basically if I talk in terms of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.660 
basically if I talk in terms of
mathematics<00:01:02.750> vertebra<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.019> subset<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.799> core

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
mathematics vertebra is a subset of core

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.030 
mathematics vertebra is a subset of core
data<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:07.020> vertebrates<00:01:07.799> are

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
data that is all vertebrates are

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.740 
data that is all vertebrates are
coordinates<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.909> guards<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.720> not

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
coordinates but all guards are not

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
coordinates but all guards are not
verticals<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> complex<00:01:14.520> body

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
verticals so they have a complex body

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
verticals so they have a complex body
differentiation<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.110> body<00:01:16.380> is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
differentiation that as body is

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.330 
differentiation that as body is
bilaterally<00:01:17.430> symmetrical<00:01:18.090> triploblastic

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
bilaterally symmetrical triploblastic

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.910 
bilaterally symmetrical triploblastic
see<00:01:20.340> domains<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> silom<00:01:21.920> notochord

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
see domains they have a silom notochord

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.609 
see domains they have a silom notochord
is<00:01:23.280> present<00:01:23.790> during<00:01:24.119> embryonic<00:01:24.780> period<00:01:25.229> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
is present during embryonic period so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.469 
is present during embryonic period so
here<00:01:25.830> no<00:01:26.280> two<00:01:26.340> koi<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.000> present

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
here no two koi it is not present

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.840 
here no two koi it is not present
throughout<00:01:27.780> life<00:01:28.100> instead<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.520> notochord

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
throughout life instead the notochord

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.569 
throughout life instead the notochord
gets<00:01:30.299> replaced<00:01:30.720> by<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.290> vertical<00:01:31.500> column<00:01:32.340> so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
gets replaced by a vertical column so

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.789 
gets replaced by a vertical column so
the<00:01:32.880> presence<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.750> vertebral<00:01:34.350> column

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the presence of this vertebral column

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.490 
the presence of this vertebral column
gives<00:01:35.400> name<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> name<00:01:36.119> vertebrate<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.320> here

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
gives name the name vertebrate so here

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
gives name the name vertebrate so here
you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.189> human<00:01:38.549> beings<00:01:38.700> also<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.299> have

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you can see in human beings also we have

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
you can see in human beings also we have
this<00:01:39.720> vertebral<00:01:40.229> column<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.250> vertebral

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
this vertebral column and this vertebral

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.190 
this vertebral column and this vertebral
column<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.360> very<00:01:42.570> important<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.079> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
column is very very important this is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.170 
column is very very important this is
because<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.979> column<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.060> able

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
because of this column that we are able

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
because of this column that we are able
to<00:01:45.360> stand<00:01:45.630> erect

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to stand erect

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
to stand erect
we<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.590> sit<00:01:46.860> erect<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.790> actually<00:01:48.420> gives

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
we can sit erect so it actually gives

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.719 
we can sit erect so it actually gives
the<00:01:49.100> basic<00:01:50.100> support<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> skeletal<00:01:51.600> system

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
the basic support to the skeletal system

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
the basic support to the skeletal system
so<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:54.119> again<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.720> vertebra<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.590> will<00:01:55.829> see

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so here again in vertebra we will see

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
so here again in vertebra we will see
that<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.490> are<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.290> different<00:01:58.290> types

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that there are a lot of different types

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.230 
that there are a lot of different types
of<00:01:58.740> animals<00:01:59.219> which<00:01:59.430> which<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.939> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
of animals which which have this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
of animals which which have this
vertical<00:02:00.479> particular<00:02:01.439> column<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.979> their

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
vertical particular column in their

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.090 
vertical particular column in their
adults<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.240> again<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.799> sub

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
adults so again we will have a sub

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.479 
adults so again we will have a sub
classification<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:07.459> subphylum

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
classification of this subphylum

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.340 
classification of this subphylum
vertebrate<00:02:11.150> dorsal<00:02:12.150> nerve<00:02:12.330> cord<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.959> present

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
vertebrate dorsal nerve cord is present

is<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.199> purpose<00:06:12.380> of<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.830> backbone<00:06:13.219> in<00:06:13.340> a

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
is the purpose of the backbone in a

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.580 
is the purpose of the backbone in a
vertebrate<00:06:13.880> it<00:06:14.210> does<00:06:14.719> nothing<00:06:14.900> but<00:06:15.289> it

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
vertebrate it does nothing but it

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.980 
vertebrate it does nothing but it
protects<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.370> nerve<00:06:16.580> cord<00:06:17.000> it<00:06:17.449> also<00:06:17.659> serves

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
protects the nerve cord it also serves

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.680 
protects the nerve cord it also serves
as<00:06:18.169> an<00:06:18.320> axis<00:06:18.740> of<00:06:18.919> the<00:06:19.370> internal<00:06:20.120> skeleton

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
as an axis of the internal skeleton

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.959 
as an axis of the internal skeleton
again<00:06:21.380> similarly<00:06:22.070> when<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.219> talk<00:06:22.490> about<00:06:22.669> the

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
again similarly when I talk about the

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:24.399 
again similarly when I talk about the
spinal<00:06:23.389> cord<00:06:23.630> it<00:06:23.780> helps<00:06:24.139> in

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
spinal cord it helps in

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.489 
spinal cord it helps in
acting<00:06:24.830> impulses<00:06:25.489> to<00:06:26.029> and<00:06:26.239> from<00:06:26.509> the<00:06:26.779> brain<00:06:26.959> it

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:27.499 
acting impulses to and from the brain it

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.669 
acting impulses to and from the brain it
it<00:06:28.069> is<00:06:28.309> basically<00:06:28.789> an<00:06:28.999> extension<00:06:29.269> of<00:06:30.110> a<00:06:30.409> part

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:30.679 
it is basically an extension of a part

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:33.279 
it is basically an extension of a part
of<00:06:30.830> the<00:06:31.339> hind<00:06:31.879> brain<00:06:32.119> so<00:06:32.539> these<00:06:32.659> are<00:06:32.959> some<00:06:33.169> of

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289 
of the hind brain so these are some of

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:34.869 
of the hind brain so these are some of
the<00:06:33.349> steps<00:06:33.769> which<00:06:34.039> are<00:06:34.129> present<00:06:34.519> only<00:06:34.759> in

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
the steps which are present only in

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.899 
the steps which are present only in
vertebrates<00:06:35.509> but<00:06:36.050> not<00:06:36.349> in<00:06:36.649> oil<00:06:37.099> quadrants<00:06:37.879> I

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
vertebrates but not in oil quadrants I

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.969 
vertebrates but not in oil quadrants I
mean<00:06:38.149> look<00:06:38.389> but<00:06:38.509> not<00:06:38.719> in<00:06:38.929> the<00:06:39.080> non<00:06:39.349> vertebrate

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
mean look but not in the non vertebrate

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.040 
mean look but not in the non vertebrate
quadrants<00:06:40.429> so<00:06:41.149> what<00:06:41.389> what<00:06:41.719> are<00:06:41.749> non

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
quadrants so what what are non

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.989 
quadrants so what what are non
vertebrate<00:06:42.589> models<00:06:43.039> non-water<00:06:43.729> brain

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:43.999 
vertebrate models non-water brain

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:45.969 
vertebrate models non-water brain
quadrants<00:06:44.449> are<00:06:44.569> nothing<00:06:44.809> by<00:06:44.959> the<00:06:45.019> europa<00:06:45.649> data

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
quadrants are nothing by the europa data

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:51.790 
quadrants are nothing by the europa data
