00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
there wasn't a video yesterday was

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.500 
there wasn't a video yesterday was
because<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.460> were<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:47.820> no<00:00:48.000> mods<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> i

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
because there were really no mods and i

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
because there were really no mods and i
don't<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> bad<00:00:49.350> mod<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.129> i'd<00:00:50.190> rather

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
don't want to do a bad mod so i'd rather

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.639 
don't want to do a bad mod so i'd rather
have<00:00:50.460> no<00:00:50.789> content<00:00:51.270> than<00:00:51.510> bad<00:00:51.780> content<00:00:52.289> i<00:00:52.469> guess

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
have no content than bad content i guess

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
have no content than bad content i guess
you<00:00:52.770> could<00:00:52.920> say<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:53.940> kind

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
you could say it like that so I'm kind

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.279

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
XP container but yeah I think that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.110 
XP container but yeah I think that
pretty<00:03:29.070> much<00:03:29.130> does<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.459> for<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.640> mod<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.820> think

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
pretty much does it for the mod I think

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.370 
pretty much does it for the mod I think
it<00:03:30.209> could<00:03:30.390> come<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.630> handy<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:31.049> some<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.290> you

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.600 
guys who don't want to risk all of your
XP<00:03:33.930> going<00:03:34.230> into<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.890> know<00:03:34.920> dangerous<00:03:35.370> cave
