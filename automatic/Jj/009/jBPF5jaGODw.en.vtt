large medium and small also you do not

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.520 
large medium and small also you do not
see<00:02:54.860> much<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.520> difference<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.600> large<00:02:56.840> one<00:02:57.260> is

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
see much the difference the large one is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.380 
see much the difference the large one is
one<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:59.620> half<00:03:00.850> one<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.300> quarter<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:04.390> inch

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
one and half one and a quarter of a inch

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.130 
one and half one and a quarter of a inch
so<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:08.120> combination<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.020> this<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.500> a<00:03:09.620> large

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
so the combination of this is a large

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.760 
so the combination of this is a large
medium<00:03:12.140> against<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.890> medium<00:03:13.780> more<00:03:14.780> against<00:03:15.620> a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
medium against the medium more against a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.910 
medium against the medium more against a
small<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.980> white<00:03:19.310> here<00:03:20.060> gold<00:03:20.570> here<00:03:21.140> gold

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
small so the white here gold here gold

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.680 
small so the white here gold here gold
here<00:03:22.430> brush<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.780> more<00:03:24.230> fluffy<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:26.270> bit

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
here brush it is more fluffy and a bit

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.590 
here brush it is more fluffy and a bit
softer<00:03:27.290> still<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.890> has<00:03:28.130> its<00:03:28.460> strengths<00:03:29.030> it's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
softer still it has its strengths it's

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.170 
softer still it has its strengths it's
good<00:03:29.960> for<00:03:30.290> outline<00:03:30.920> it's<00:03:31.370> good<00:03:31.700> for<00:03:32.000> applying

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
good for outline it's good for applying

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.060 
good for outline it's good for applying
color<00:03:33.140> putting<00:03:33.830> in<00:03:34.100> color<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.620> also<00:03:36.620> good<00:03:36.860> for
