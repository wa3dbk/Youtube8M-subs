00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.070 
draw the end of the yarn through that
loop

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.030

and<00:02:04.410> there<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:05.010> so<00:02:06.440> now<00:02:07.440> you're<00:02:07.620> ready<00:02:07.650> to

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
and there you go so now you're ready to

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.060 
and there you go so now you're ready to
make<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.550> chain<00:02:08.970> stitch<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:16.950> I'm

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
make a chain stitch but because I'm

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.560 
make a chain stitch but because I'm
making<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.460> for<00:02:17.670> beginners<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.330> want<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
making this for beginners I just want to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.390 
making this for beginners I just want to
show<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.650> slow<00:02:19.860> motion

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
show this to you again in slow motion

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.050 
show this to you again in slow motion
so<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.090> make<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.770> loop<00:02:22.850> working<00:02:23.850> from

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
so you just make a loop working from

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
so you just make a loop working from
behind<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:25.080> bring<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> end<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> yarn

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
behind you bring the end of the yarn

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.870 
behind you bring the end of the yarn
through<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.580> loop<00:02:28.490> then<00:02:29.490> you're<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.820> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
through the loop then you're going to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.540 
through the loop then you're going to
pull<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.270> tight<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:31.560> not<00:02:31.590> too<00:02:31.770> tight<00:02:31.950> because

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
pull it tight but not too tight because

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.010 
pull it tight but not too tight because
we're<00:02:32.850> going<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.060> put<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.510> crochet<00:02:33.990> hook

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
we're going to put the crochet hook

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.130 
we're going to put the crochet hook
through<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> loop<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.570> get<00:02:36.780> your<00:02:36.900> crochet

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
through the loop so you get your crochet

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.970 
through the loop so you get your crochet
hook<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:39.270> stick<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.600> through<00:02:39.720> your<00:02:40.110> loop

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
hook and you stick it through your loop

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.620 
hook and you stick it through your loop
there

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.500 

and<00:02:47.630> then<00:02:47.780> you're<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.020> pull<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.260> tight

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
and then you're going to pull it tight

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.479 

and<00:02:51.019> then<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.650> wrap<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.129> yarn<00:02:52.159> around

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and then I like to wrap the yarn around

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.240 
and then I like to wrap the yarn around
my<00:02:52.760> pinky<00:02:52.909> finger<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:56.299> then<00:02:57.170> around<00:02:57.620> my<00:02:57.860> index

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
my pinky finger and then around my index

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.640 
my pinky finger and then around my index
finger

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.440 

but<00:03:01.650> I've<00:03:01.830> noticed<00:03:02.130> with<00:03:02.640> other<00:03:02.820> crochet<00:03:03.240> errs

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
but I've noticed with other crochet errs

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.420 
but I've noticed with other crochet errs
like<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.020> all<00:03:04.140> hold<00:03:04.410> our<00:03:04.590> yarn<00:03:04.860> differently

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
like we all hold our yarn differently

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.760 
like we all hold our yarn differently
and<00:03:05.700> keep<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.330> out<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.720> our<00:03:06.810> way<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.440> different

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
and keep it out of our way in different

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.860 
and keep it out of our way in different
ways<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.310> whatever<00:03:08.730> works<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:09.690> is

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
ways so whatever works for you this is

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.059 
ways so whatever works for you this is
just<00:03:09.990> how<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.440> taught

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.309 

then<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.819> can<00:03:13.999> just<00:03:14.209> adjust<00:03:14.450> how<00:03:14.840> tight<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.230> is

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
then you can just adjust how tight it is

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.430 
then you can just adjust how tight it is
by<00:03:15.590> pulling<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.069> yarn

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
by pulling the yarn

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.480 
by pulling the yarn
then<00:03:18.010> you're<00:03:18.160> ready<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.640> make<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:19.360> chain<00:03:19.600> stitch

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.390 

so<00:03:23.180> for<00:03:23.420> chain<00:03:23.630> stitches<00:03:24.190> you're<00:03:25.190> going<00:03:25.220> to

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
so for chain stitches you're going to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.490 
so for chain stitches you're going to
yarn<00:03:25.700> over<00:03:25.910> which<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:27.020> wrapping<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.410> yarn

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
yarn over which is wrapping the yarn

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.110 
yarn over which is wrapping the yarn
around<00:03:27.770> hook<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.640> pull<00:03:29.000> it

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
around hook like that and pull it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.200 
around hook like that and pull it
through<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.360> loop<00:03:29.680> yarn<00:03:30.680> over<00:03:31.180> pull<00:03:32.180> it

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
through the loop yarn over pull it

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.930 
through the loop yarn over pull it
through<00:03:33.460> yarn<00:03:34.460> over<00:03:35.140> pull<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.170> through

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
through yarn over pull it through

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.990 
through yarn over pull it through
yarn<00:03:38.840> over<00:03:39.290> pull<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.010> through<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.400> loop

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
yarn over pull it through the loop

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.330 
yarn over pull it through the loop
yarn<00:03:43.000> over<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.510> pull<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.920> through<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.160> loop

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
yarn over and pull it through the loop

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.700 
yarn over and pull it through the loop
you<00:03:46.110> just<00:03:47.110> keep<00:03:47.290> doing<00:03:47.410> that

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
you just keep doing that

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.950 
you just keep doing that
so<00:03:48.640> just<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.150> make<00:03:49.270> sure<00:03:49.300> you've<00:03:49.540> got<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.810> down

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
so just to make sure you've got it down

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.510 
so just to make sure you've got it down
I'm<00:03:50.230> going<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.560> show<00:03:50.740> you<00:03:50.800> some<00:03:51.070> more<00:03:51.100> stills

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
I'm going to show you some more stills

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.430 
I'm going to show you some more stills
so<00:03:52.150> you're<00:03:52.300> going<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.450> yarn<00:03:52.720> over<00:03:52.900> that's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
so you're going to yarn over that's

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.050 
so you're going to yarn over that's
basically<00:03:53.860> grabbing<00:03:54.280> some<00:03:54.580> yarn<00:03:54.820> with<00:03:55.030> your

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
basically grabbing some yarn with your

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.540 
basically grabbing some yarn with your
crochet<00:03:55.960> hook<00:03:56.140> wrapping<00:03:57.070> it<00:03:57.160> around<00:03:57.220> your

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
crochet hook wrapping it around your

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.000 
crochet hook wrapping it around your
hook<00:03:58.080> then<00:03:59.080> you're<00:03:59.260> going<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.440> pull<00:03:59.830> it

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
hook then you're going to pull it

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.660 
hook then you're going to pull it
through<00:04:00.220> your<00:04:00.550> current<00:04:00.970> loop<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.600> have

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.700 

just<00:04:06.670> like<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:10.230> when<00:04:11.230> you've<00:04:11.380> pulled<00:04:11.590> it

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
just like that and when you've pulled it

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.740 
just like that and when you've pulled it
through<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.950> loop<00:04:12.190> you've<00:04:12.910> made<00:04:13.270> a<00:04:13.480> chain

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
through the loop you've made a chain

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.790 
through the loop you've made a chain
stitch<00:04:13.990> so<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.650> can<00:04:14.860> see<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.160> right<00:04:15.280> there<00:04:16.800> and

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
stitch so you can see it right there and

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.870 
stitch so you can see it right there and
you<00:04:19.290> just<00:04:20.290> repeat<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.920> we<00:04:21.310> keep<00:04:21.520> doing<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
you just repeat that we keep doing it

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.420 
you just repeat that we keep doing it
and<00:04:22.060> soon<00:04:22.810> enough<00:04:23.110> you'll<00:04:23.500> have<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.770> nice<00:04:24.040> chain

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
and soon enough you'll have a nice chain

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:34.710 
and soon enough you'll have a nice chain
going<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.630> easy<00:04:28.870> so<00:04:29.620> much<00:04:29.800> fun<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:34.420> let's<00:04:34.600> see

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
going so easy so much fun so let's see

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.590 
going so easy so much fun so let's see
this<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:35.050> slow<00:04:35.260> motion<00:04:35.760> yarn<00:04:36.760> over<00:04:37.060> pull

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
this in slow motion yarn over pull

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.810 
this in slow motion yarn over pull
through<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.900> loop<00:04:39.300> yarn<00:04:40.300> over<00:04:41.790> pull<00:04:42.790> it

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
through the loop yarn over pull it

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.600 
through the loop yarn over pull it
through<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.210> loop

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
through the loop

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.689 
through the loop
like<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:47.569> yarn<00:04:48.569> over<00:04:49.280> pull<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.310> through<00:04:50.460> the

like that yarn over pull it through the

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.399 
like that yarn over pull it through the
loop

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
loop

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.540 
loop
just<00:04:53.249> keep<00:04:53.429> doing<00:04:53.699> that<00:04:55.009> now<00:04:56.009> depending<00:04:56.459> on

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
just keep doing that now depending on

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.949 
just keep doing that now depending on
what<00:04:56.699> you're<00:04:56.849> doing<00:04:56.879> you<00:04:57.419> will<00:04:58.379> make<00:04:58.649> chains

00:04:59.949 --> 00:04:59.959 
what you're doing you will make chains

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.199 
what you're doing you will make chains
like<00:05:01.309> according<00:05:02.309> to<00:05:02.459> whatever<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:02.999> pattern

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:03.209 
like according to whatever the pattern

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:05.689 
like according to whatever the pattern
you're<00:05:03.719> working<00:05:04.139> on<00:05:04.199> asks<00:05:04.769> for<00:05:05.009> or<00:05:05.339> however

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
is or to practice you know just make as

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.979 
is or to practice you know just make as
long<00:05:11.099> a<00:05:11.129> chain<00:05:11.429> as<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.639> like<00:05:11.849> for<00:05:12.719> as<00:05:12.809> long<00:05:12.929> as

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:12.989 
long a chain as you like for as long as

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:18.519 
long a chain as you like for as long as
you<00:05:13.199> like<00:05:15.769> so<00:05:16.769> here<00:05:16.949> are<00:05:17.039> some<00:05:17.219> chains<00:05:17.610> here<00:05:18.089> a
