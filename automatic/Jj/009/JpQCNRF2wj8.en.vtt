00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.810
 adult after his successful participation in 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.440
 the juvenile date that was made in 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.440
 our country 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.779
 not many years ago Juan did not know what 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.599
 were the air travel I did not know either 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.309
 of table tennis but hill navia a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.100
 coach saw his talent and invited him to 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.800
 the practices in the communal workshop there 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.960
 Juan started to move from football to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.210
 paddle sport 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.329
 the school with a professor manuel lira 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.640
 that he is an important part of my career 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.800
 even he took me from my house to 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.629
 play tournaments and that I was more 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.000
 distracted with football and that and the league 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.970
 search and thanks to him like this is already 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.220
 here from there to the national team was 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.019
 only one step in the team met 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.960
 who has observed closely his 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.659
 development the joseph jose luis urrutia one 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.490
 of the first ones who gave his conditions 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.350
 and he came to train a school the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.420
 training schools that had in the 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.939
 national stadium of downloads of 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.829
 international if I'm there he started to see 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.799
 we begin to see what 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.359
 responsible for the part of small and 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.039
 from quite small you could tell he had 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.539
 certain conditions conditions 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.030
 mainly that he liked a lot 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.130
 they want to play was technically not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.869
 very gifted when he was a boy but he 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.810
 I really wanted the turning point 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.509
 of his international career came 2011 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.130
 when he becomes champion 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.920
 Ibero-American child after a difficult 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.700
 final l change to it I look at the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.310
 final and said I was this can this be 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.530
 plays well is different is different from the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.929
 others because they were when happy and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.250
 that very famous in Argentina the final and 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.709
 the Chinese writer in favor of 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.560
 planet was like you expect playing in the 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.299
 patio their houses then I said here 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.979
 It can be very important, I think 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.890
 thanks to my triumph and I still play 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.520
 because I am a little desirable very fruit 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.710
 Quick 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.480
 when I lose I get very sad and that 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.130
 but I think that was one of the tournament 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.420
 important or was it one of the things 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.840
 most important for me to follow 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.840
 Playing 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.780
 there he had to beat his other rival one 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.710
 that carries within it its strong 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.230
 character was a dwarf I did not know that or 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.870
 We did not know how to give it or I think he lost 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.150
 less goes with everything with everyone 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.310
 I thought I was on the court and I was 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.690
 any madness and that I think I say 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.210
 improving thanks to what always 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.070
 I was giving good advice and that and 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.140
 I think that now is a little bit 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.720
 little bit better but missing a lot 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.880
 more mature size and about to abandon 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.860
 Juvenile category in the environment of Juan 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 to recognize that table tennis will 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.870
 changed and gave a new direction to his life the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 quite difficult environment
