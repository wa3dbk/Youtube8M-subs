00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.670 
I guess about McNichol I don't know
about<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.760> fans<00:02:16.450> over<00:02:16.720> on<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.200> right<00:02:17.650> side

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
about the fans over on the right side

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.559 
about the fans over on the right side
maybe<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.670> come<00:02:18.879> from<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> Royals<00:02:19.420> dugout

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
maybe we come from the Royals dugout

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.780 
maybe we come from the Royals dugout
thinking<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.319> was<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.830> fork<00:02:21.190> move<00:02:21.489> over

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
thinking if that was a fork move over

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.600 
thinking if that was a fork move over
towards<00:02:22.000> Percy<00:02:22.599> pool<00:02:22.930> Olivo<00:02:23.530> why<00:02:24.280> never

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
towards Percy pool Olivo why never

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.809 
towards Percy pool Olivo why never
that's<00:02:24.970> 25<00:02:25.510> degree<00:02:25.840> angle<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.379> if<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.670> can

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
that's 25 degree angle in it if you can

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.430 
that's 25 degree angle in it if you can
really<00:02:28.000> defeat<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.599> running<00:02:28.930> with<00:02:29.049> this<00:02:29.200> move

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
really defeat the running with this move

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.470 
really defeat the running with this move
here<00:02:29.799> if<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.459> watch<00:02:30.640> his<00:02:30.819> right<00:02:31.030> hip<00:02:31.329> the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
here if you watch his right hip the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.390 
here if you watch his right hip the
right<00:02:31.660> hip<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.079> of<00:02:32.230> goes<00:02:32.379> to<00:02:32.560> home<00:02:32.769> plate<00:02:33.099> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
right hip kind of goes to home plate and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.550 
right hip kind of goes to home plate and
then<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> then<00:02:34.420> he<00:02:34.540> goes<00:02:34.750> back<00:02:35.019> over<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.530> that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
then a then he goes back over so that

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.710 
then a then he goes back over so that
that's<00:02:36.340> definitely<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.849> ball

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.490 

so<00:02:44.320> two<00:02:44.590> down<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:45.100> now<00:02:45.190> KOCO<00:02:45.640> Chris<00:02:46.500> who's

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
so two down and now KOCO Chris who's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.620 
so two down and now KOCO Chris who's
over<00:02:47.950> three<00:02:50.160> key<00:02:51.160> balls<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.640> no<00:02:51.730> strikes<00:02:52.060> it's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
over three key balls and no strikes it's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.970 
over three key balls and no strikes it's
kind<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.900> hard<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.140> tell<00:02:53.380> right<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.830> that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
kind of hard to tell right in that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860 
kind of hard to tell right in that
situation<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.670> was<00:02:54.850> going<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.180> leaving<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.540> got

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
situation it was going to leaving it got

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.330 
situation it was going to leaving it got
picked<00:02:56.140> off<00:02:56.290> while<00:02:56.590> he<00:02:56.680> was<00:02:56.860> running<00:02:57.010> on<00:02:57.220> his

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
picked off while he was running on his

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.370 
picked off while he was running on his
own<00:02:57.580> or<00:02:57.850> whether<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.150> was<00:02:58.270> hit<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.750> run<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:58.960> and

he left too soon

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.960 
he left too soon
it's<00:03:00.670> kind<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:00.910> hard<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.120> tell<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:03.370> we<00:03:03.490> also<00:03:03.640> try
