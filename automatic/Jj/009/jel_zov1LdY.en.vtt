a<00:01:34.979> quick<00:01:35.159> example<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.930> here<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
a quick example of that here it is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
a quick example of that here it is
played<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.010> might<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.370> small<00:01:38.670> group

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
played like I might with a small group

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:51.680 
played like I might with a small group
on<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.210> very<00:01:39.720> soft<00:01:39.960> song

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.590 

it's<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.380> warm<00:01:52.680> very<00:01:53.130> mellow<00:01:53.370> but<00:01:54.240> listen<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's very warm very mellow but listen to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's very warm very mellow but listen to
what<00:01:54.720> happens<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> put<00:01:55.530> more<00:01:55.650> air<00:01:55.830> through

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
what happens when I put more air through

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380 
what happens when I put more air through
now<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.280> course<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.940> get<00:01:57.060> louder

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
now of course it's going to get louder

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
but listen to the tone change it gets

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.000 
but listen to the tone change it gets
very<00:02:11.670> very<00:02:11.790> bright<00:02:12.450> very<00:02:12.750> brassy<00:02:13.680> which<00:02:13.890> of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
very very bright very brassy which of

very very bright very brassy which of
course<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.580> want<00:02:14.820> playing<00:02:15.600> with<00:02:15.810> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
course is what you want playing with a

course is what you want playing with a
big<00:02:16.020> band<00:02:16.310> another<00:02:17.310> characteristic<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
big band another characteristic of the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.840 
big band another characteristic of the
jm1<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.140> how<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.410> locks<00:02:19.709> into<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.220> pitch<00:02:20.550> and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
jm1 is how it locks into the pitch and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.150 
jm1 is how it locks into the pitch and
by<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.050> mean<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> listen<00:02:22.890> when<00:02:23.040> you're

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
by that I mean have a listen when you're

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.130 
by that I mean have a listen when you're
playing<00:02:23.400> one<00:02:23.730> pitch<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.600> go<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> next

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
playing one pitch and you go to the next

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.670 
playing one pitch and you go to the next
harmonic<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:30.180> instrument<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.750> very<00:02:30.780> easy<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
harmonic this instrument is very easy to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.190 
harmonic this instrument is very easy to
move<00:02:32.160> from<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.730> harmonic<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.390> next<00:02:33.690> also

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
move from one harmonic to the next also

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.040 
move from one harmonic to the next also
to<00:02:34.260> bend<00:02:34.560> notes<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.970> does<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.480> very<00:02:39.750> easily

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
to bend notes it does that very easily

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.199 
to bend notes it does that very easily
this<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.709> great<00:02:41.100> for<00:02:41.280> jazz<00:02:41.520> work<00:02:41.790> because<00:02:42.120> you

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
this is great for jazz work because you

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.090 
this is great for jazz work because you
can<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.540> all<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.989> those<00:02:43.320> effects<00:02:43.770> like<00:02:43.950> this

can do all of those effects like this

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.860 
can do all of those effects like this
and<00:02:49.340> things<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.030> sounds<00:02:51.570> you
