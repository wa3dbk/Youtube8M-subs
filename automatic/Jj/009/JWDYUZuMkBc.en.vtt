use like an enameled pan like a look

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.440 
use like an enameled pan like a look
Crozet<00:00:51.310> or<00:00:51.460> something<00:00:51.820> like<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.120> that<00:00:52.270> would

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
Crozet or something like that that would

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.900 
Crozet or something like that that would
be<00:00:52.600> fine<00:00:52.899> too<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:54.250> original<00:00:54.610> video<00:00:54.850> I

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
be fine too and the original video I

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.910 
be fine too and the original video I
used<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.420> nonstick<00:00:56.050> pan<00:00:56.110> because<00:00:56.590> usually<00:00:56.739> I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
used a nonstick pan because usually I

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.010 
used a nonstick pan because usually I
use<00:00:56.950> nonstick<00:00:57.220> pans<00:00:57.670> with<00:00:57.850> fish<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.780> was

use nonstick pans with fish it was
pretty<00:00:59.350> heavy-duty<00:00:59.739> but<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:00.850> get<00:01:01.030> these

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
pretty heavy-duty but you can get these

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.060 
pretty heavy-duty but you can get these
much<00:01:01.720> hotter<00:01:01.960> than<00:01:02.079> you<00:01:02.320> can<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.530> nonstick<00:01:03.010> pan

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
much hotter than you can a nonstick pan
