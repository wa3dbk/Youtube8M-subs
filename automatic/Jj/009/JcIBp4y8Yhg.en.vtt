better<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.300> gives<00:02:48.390> them<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:48.720> kind

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
better because it gives them some kind

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.630 
better because it gives them some kind
of<00:02:49.020> uniqueness<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.310> okay<00:02:50.610> all<00:02:51.150> right<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.870> um

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
of uniqueness to it okay all right so um

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.110 
of uniqueness to it okay all right so um
good<00:02:55.790> yeah<00:02:56.790> let's<00:02:57.480> see<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.380> D<00:02:58.710> pattern

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
good yeah let's see so we have D pattern

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.370 
good yeah let's see so we have D pattern
when<00:03:00.120> we're<00:03:00.240> doing<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> E<00:03:00.510> minor<00:03:00.840> pattern

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
when we're doing the E minor pattern

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.350 
when we're doing the E minor pattern
also<00:03:01.560> uh<00:03:01.950> it's<00:03:03.080> six<00:03:04.080> four<00:03:04.830> two<00:03:05.280> three<00:03:06.240> four

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
