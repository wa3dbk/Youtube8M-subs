watch screens the TFT screen you can see
the<00:00:49.350> difference<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:50.239> but<00:00:53.660> let's<00:00:54.660> quickly

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
the difference there but let's quickly

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:05.350 
the difference there but let's quickly
try<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.980> speed<00:00:59.250> test<00:00:59.550> here

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.820 

pour<00:01:06.140> off<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.410> device<00:01:06.830> at<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.070> same<00:01:07.310> time

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.980 

so<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.580> was<00:01:12.850> quicker<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:14.680> try<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.130> try<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.490> on

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
so I was quicker let's try to try it on

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:35.800 
so I was quicker let's try to try it on
two<00:01:16.990> three<00:01:17.350> go

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.030 

almost<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.229> time

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.610 

whoa<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:45.040> Snapdragon<00:01:45.550> 410<00:01:45.840> 64-bit<00:01:46.840> win<00:01:47.410> the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
whoa so Snapdragon 410 64-bit win the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.670 
whoa so Snapdragon 410 64-bit win the
race

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
race

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.500 
race
as<00:01:50.680> compared<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.340> octa-core<00:01:52.530> Galaxy<00:01:53.530> s5

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
as compared to the octa-core Galaxy s5

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.040 
as compared to the octa-core Galaxy s5
not<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:55.540> big<00:01:55.840> difference<00:01:56.350> for<00:01:56.590> still<00:01:57.780> great<00:01:58.780> job

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050
