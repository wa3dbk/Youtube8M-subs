00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 at 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.170
 one euro is one more euro or one euro 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.289
 between 1 euro in all the rent of black 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.119
 if cuts for an hour then no 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.490
 for 24 hours yes there are some 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.869
 small constraints plays the rope it's 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.199
 not like a rental completely 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.759
 classic 1 euros 24 1 euros to the 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.830
 car she is normal at the 4th to her 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.180
 is normal to the 4 'she can even she 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.030
 can it even be a high car 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.430
 of range 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.410
 auj then I explain the renters 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.119
 of cars must transfer often 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.739
 by truck from one city to another 

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:44.570
 cars for example they have a lot of 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.739
 cars in marseille there is a request to 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.019
 lyon by truck they transfer unveil 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.909
 cars from one agency to another to 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.739
 balance their car fleet and two 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.140
 young people had the idea alexander and 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.850
 geoffroy lambert to import a concept 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.449
 which has existed for several years 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.710
 on australia and places and propose 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.939
 to the renters instead of doing these 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.189
 truck transfers to say well 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.869
 listen to me I propose you them 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.650
 put on a site and for one euro the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.900
 people can wind up the cars yes 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.250
 but this between the cars you in 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.930
 need or not how that in euros 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.670
 so that was a gentleman in marseille 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.580
 you want to do you have to do a 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.940
 marseille or lyon yes you look at a 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.620
 little bit train prices etc and you 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.360
 you say no I do not have a date 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.360
 precise you will see it in the subject 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.890
 but in any case I have to perform 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.330
 marseille lyon whether with a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.220
 car or utility it can be 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.080
 to put furniture back together you 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.909
 register on the site you look there 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.590
 there are not necessarily any offers you put 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.190
 what is called a hall is a 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.979
 alert 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.600
 and as soon as there is a trip available 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.460
 finally a car available to make 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.120
 marcel lyon well you can do 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.450
 this renault for a euro we look at 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.450
 look 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.280
 you come on the style and you do 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.320
 looking for the route you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.940
 want to realize from there you 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.540
 access the different offers and for 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.490
 each offer 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.160
 in fact it corresponds to lived the move 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.900
 from a villa to a gilbert and for a 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.320
 euro so you have the rental of the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.390
 vehicle 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.650
 twenty four hours rental and one 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.650
 insurance included 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.400
 I made this bet so just for the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.200
 rental price plus the essence of this 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.430
 country on your knees we do not choose the path 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.110
 for two months I have already planned to 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.000
 to make this trip there so it's a 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.470
 alternative solution another a refuge and 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.090
 then make a carpool from me 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.610
 even and bring people with me because 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.380
 that allowed to reduce costs down the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.840
 labor costs that you have to know that 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.830
 all the paths proposition of an enemy 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.340
 match the transfer needs 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.020
 rental companies 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.070
 so in fact according to their 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.970
 needs the offers will be available 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.920
 on the site 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.780
 if you do not find your offer you 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.490
 can you put on alert on the site 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.709
 and this alert will be directly 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.150
 transmitted to the relevant agency and you 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.070
 will receive an email as soon as the trip 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.660
 available the person will perform the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.550
 journey that we have proposed on the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.019
 web platform knowing that we 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.820
 let's make thousands and thousands 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.160
 transfer every week and every month 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.980
 to bring cars from a park back to 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.900
 another so that's the offers we 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.390
 let's go on the internet 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.140
 and the customer will choose the route that 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.140
 could suit him 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.280
 interest in our society than 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.719
 propose renting to one euro is 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.180
 double first there is an interest 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.620
 economic and the second interest it's 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.719
 simple is that it allows us to 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.219
 hit a target who did not want 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.879
 or who did not know the rental 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.230
 short duration 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.209
 so these are people who will try 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.560
 car rental and who we 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.299
 hopefully will come back to our 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.709
 company to perform other 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.280
 personal rentals or 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.930
 professional 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.040
 this was the first time to test 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.709
 but I think that suddenly 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.609
 well I repeat she was leaving 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.590
 when it will be possible 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.959
 one euro that's what accessible access 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.519
 for big cities the driver has 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.280
 the choice to put your vehicle back into 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.019
 several points especially in Paris where he 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.180
 will have the choice to leave him his 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.189
 vehicle either in Paris station are in 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.620
 airport on the website it 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.150
 explained between keller and keller the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.859
 vehicle must be taken and what is 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.650
 their limit of restitution in the 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.000
 arrival station and this allows him 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.130
 still to take breaks 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.620
 sometimes needed furniture to stop 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.970
 in an intermediate city but well 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.320
 obviously the goal is not to 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.090
 propose short-term rental 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.509
 for a few days to do the 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.509
 tour of France 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.380
 basically this customer there we take you back 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.370
 customer from marseille who went to iran 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.440
 rental services 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.870
 he's doing service on the real ones being done 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.050
 pay you have a car to go up to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.460
 lyon me I certainly make you yes but there 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.139
 so a little difference and makes 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.580
 service over actually made the 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.139
 Car makes that so kilometers 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.590
 on truck does not make it so in 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.440
 the other 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.150
 ok thank you we 'll say we'll say that 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.320
 meierhans anyway it's a good 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.389
 system 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.530
 if we are not demanding on on the date 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.699
 the buses anyway it's going to get 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.310
 develop because for the moment there 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.320
 there is a major lessor 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.240
 I'm coming back the others will follow 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.730
 what does it mean that there will be more 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.730
 more trips available on time
