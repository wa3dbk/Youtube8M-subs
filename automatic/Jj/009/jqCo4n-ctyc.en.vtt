00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.670
 game mec wants to help you not get lost 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.670
 in the world in the case that it is immense, right? 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.500
 well then it will come in this kind of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 folder that I have in this file type in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.040
 U format so we will have mistakes 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.360
 he extracts you extract he will open 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.229
 these two folders here then in these two 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.689
 pastes 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.259
 one of them will be written so dumb 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.150
 from creative to survival good there that one 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.560
 It's just a complement that I put there. 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.400

 template that it changes the mode minecraft 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.090
 creative for survival mode 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.509
 forward when you already know how to move 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.200
