and it's not that heavy so made out of
carbon<00:00:48.600> fiber<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.700> this<00:00:50.700> are<00:00:50.940> actually<00:00:51.420> metal

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
carbon fiber and this are actually metal

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.040 
carbon fiber and this are actually metal
I<00:00:52.010> believe<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> aluminum<00:00:53.660> don't<00:00:54.660> quote<00:00:54.840> me

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I believe this aluminum don't quote me

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.880 
I believe this aluminum don't quote me
on<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:55.949> metal<00:00:56.899> okay<00:00:57.899> that's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
on it but it's metal okay that's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.709 
on it but it's metal okay that's
actually<00:00:59.340> no<00:00:59.670> glitches<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> there's<00:01:00.570> no

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
actually no glitches with it there's no

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
actually no glitches with it there's no
problems<00:01:01.199> except<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.489> thing<00:01:02.760> comes

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
problems except that this thing comes

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.399 
problems except that this thing comes
off<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.260> some

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
off here because there's like some

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.090 
off here because there's like some
grease<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.510> might<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> put

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
grease in it so you might want to put

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
grease in it so you might want to put
some<00:01:08.570> crazy<00:01:09.570> glue<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.229> whatever<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:12.420> rig<00:01:12.750> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
some crazy glue or whatever this rig is

focus is actually white and blue and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
focus is actually white and blue and
black<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.380> guys<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.860> yellow<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
black and you guys see some yellow the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.520 
black and you guys see some yellow the
reason<00:01:30.240> why<00:01:30.390> you're<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:30.990> yellow<00:01:31.350> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
reason why you're going to see yellow is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.149 
reason why you're going to see yellow is
because<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:32.939> first<00:01:33.299> bought<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:34.470> follow

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
because when i first bought this follow

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
because when i first bought this follow
focus<00:01:35.400> i<00:01:35.790> notice<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.930> every<00:01:37.259> time<00:01:37.439> i<00:01:37.470> will

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
focus i notice it every time i will

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.039 
focus i notice it every time i will
focus<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:40.619> knob<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.640> comes<00:01:41.850> off

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
focus on it the knob actually comes off

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.700 
focus on it the knob actually comes off
so<00:01:43.430> what<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> did<00:01:44.549> was<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> zip

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
so what I did was that I put the zip

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.399 
so what I did was that I put the zip
ties<00:01:46.950> which<00:01:47.939> are<00:01:48.119> eight<00:01:48.360> inches<00:01:48.750> anything

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
ties which are eight inches anything

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.039 
ties which are eight inches anything
thicker<00:01:49.649> than<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.070> might<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.670> work<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.299> have

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
thicker than that might not work I have

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
thicker than that might not work I have
try<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.110> keep<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.409> consistent<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> same

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
try to keep it consistent with the same

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
try to keep it consistent with the same
color<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.420> actually<00:01:57.540> too<00:01:58.140> wide<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> too

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
color but it's actually too wide and too

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.060 
color but it's actually too wide and too
thick<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.700> stick<00:01:59.969> um<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.860> went

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
thick it will not stick um so I went

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.500 
thick it will not stick um so I went
with<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.369> ah

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
with this one ah

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.340 
with this one ah
the<00:02:05.170> follow<00:02:05.350> focus<00:02:05.440> has<00:02:05.890> some<00:02:06.070> slack<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:06.700> it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the follow focus has some slack in it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.750 
the follow focus has some slack in it
you<00:02:08.350> don't<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.830> now<00:02:09.010> but<00:02:09.070> once<00:02:09.430> you<00:02:09.550> put

I had previously bought the redrock
micro<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.600> returned<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.110> because<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:21.100> is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
micro and I returned it because this is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.540 
micro and I returned it because this is
actually<00:02:22.740> four<00:02:23.740> hundred<00:02:24.070> dollars<00:02:24.100> cheaper

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
actually four hundred dollars cheaper

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.810 
actually four hundred dollars cheaper
after<00:02:25.240> taxes<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:27.070> has<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.310> same<00:02:27.520> slack

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
after taxes and it has the same slack

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.940 
after taxes and it has the same slack
and<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.960> can<00:02:29.140> deal<00:02:29.380> with<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.710> putting

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and if you can deal with just putting

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.870 
and if you can deal with just putting
this<00:02:30.160> on<00:02:30.340> here<00:02:31.590> it'll<00:02:32.590> do<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.800> work<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.730> like

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
this on here it'll do the work just like

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.300 
this on here it'll do the work just like
the<00:02:34.000> red<00:02:34.180> rock<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:35.380> also<00:02:35.760> wanted<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.820> try<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the red rock I also wanted to try the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.650 
the red rock I also wanted to try the
friction<00:02:39.310> follow<00:02:39.610> focus<00:02:39.910> but<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> problem

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
friction follow focus but the problem

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.630 
friction follow focus but the problem
with<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:41.920> moves<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.370> camera

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
with that is is that it moves the camera

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300 
with that is is that it moves the camera
as<00:02:43.270> you're<00:02:43.540> pulling<00:02:43.750> focus<00:02:44.220> therefore<00:02:45.220> you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
as you're pulling focus therefore you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.660 
as you're pulling focus therefore you
need<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.580> keep<00:02:45.730> adjusting<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:48.190> not

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
need to keep adjusting it and it's not

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.640 
need to keep adjusting it and it's not
doesn't<00:02:49.030> work<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.300> great<00:02:49.510> for<00:02:49.930> me<00:02:50.110> again

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
doesn't work that great for me again

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.200 
doesn't work that great for me again
