00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 as we have already talked a lot about Egypt of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.160
 europe let's go again now america 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.689
 to Ecuador specifically and in my case 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 I already had the opportunity 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:33.770
 example of visiting different works 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.890
 pre-Hispanic that speak of beings 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.910
 that are handling a kind of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.829
 machine and it has even fire in the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 part of below have a kind of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.690
 scuba and have stressors like 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.640
 machinery that are there driving is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.900
 incredible the image even the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.790
 I have known anthropologists are 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.640
 they questioned many things obviously of 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.380
 the record does not speak it openly 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.439
 many of them are already beginning to do 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.540
 conferences will be released information from 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.579
 possible theories that they believe are 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.490
 quite interesting and they are even 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.229
 more outlandish than the most theories 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 crazy people who have heard here 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.130
 on the internet and we 'll be talking 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.060
 that is not but right now let's 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 Ecuador 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.570
 and we're going to a small arms comparison 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.740
 of apollo suit our pipeline 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.310
 apolo with the figure of ecuador not the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.780
 figure that we have chosen and what good 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.640
 circulate in fact they have already interned in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.530
 quite some sites are figures so that we 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.890
 they talk about a kind of scuba 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.250
 helmet and aside we see the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.619
 typical helmets that use these 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 cultures and on the other hand then this that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.869
 It strikes us that it is like a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.380
 kind of helmet shape and that good 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.560
 Well maybe that's just how it was 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.939
 mask not his suit not and with the context 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.030
 from now as I tell you what we compare 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.119
 but the attention has called the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.250
 attention to other bloggers and well then 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.630
 and I wanted to share with you 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.880
 but 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.640
 this is also the work is not 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.940
 compare in nothing in what they will see 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.160
 then in notes of videos that we talked about 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.230
 of that subject specifically of what 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.510
 happens in Mexico and what happens in 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.490
 other countries that nothing else is the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.160
 Scuba nothing but the suit if it's not the 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.430
 structure what is around what 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.460
 there are in all these figures and the way 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.290
 of the suit even more detailed 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.260
 that this is what we are seeing now 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.460
 same thanks for your suggestions and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.130
 thank you for everything you have given us 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.050
 commented right now we are working 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.240
 already in another series of videos we 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.190
 they have said ok and this when you are going to leave 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.350
 to also talk about the past and you're going to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.240
 concentrate on what is happening now of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.930
 done we are already starting a small 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.180
 series of myths we have talked a lot 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.300
 previously myths that happen in 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.370
 America and especially in Latin America and 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.550
 now to write a little further north you 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.910
 knows little because suddenly in the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.590
 North sometimes much talk about 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.480
 the airs and then but there is no talk of 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.390
 the legends of what has been yielded 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.950
 during different times legends like 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.960
 big foot for example not that never 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.960
 we have spoken and now on youtube 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.080
 they circulate enough videos that do of 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.480
 done past until the investigations 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.640
 harder not of itself pixel by pixel if 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.190
 really this was integrated after or 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.720
 really the recording happened and it's 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.930
 until now at least the 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.390
 tests are not known to be but in Asia 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.180
 in the usa in alaska in different points 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.090
 of the planet this species has been found 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.630
 like apes like bears but shape 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:59.190
 more human very large 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:02.010
 that resemble on foot this kind of 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.890
 breath and just like this there are many 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.620
 legends some already with some material 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:12.360
 photographic or evidence that has emerged 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.210
 and that almost has not been talked much in 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.520
 youtube and good general in documentaries 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.110
 today I want to share with you 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.180
 that soon we will be creating this 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.040
 series at least let's continue 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.570
 now up to number 28 with this that 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.250
 we are doing right now of the past 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.940
 and afterwards we continue with what follows 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.840
 good we see intuir in the green route and 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.840
 practicing until then
