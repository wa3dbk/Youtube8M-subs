00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.020
 we all know d link for its routers 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
 wifi ethernet etc 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.469
 the shots cpl one wonders what is this 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.830
 what does link to mobile world congress 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.690
 is well d link attack in force the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.270
 connected home market with any 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.199
 a series of products that should who 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.580
 leave nothing to chance 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.039
 so how does it work here we have a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 the central a central automation that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.480
 allows to communicate to group the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 information from all these sensors then 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 there are any kind we know the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.489
 smoke detector we know they will 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.410
 be compulsory from the month of 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.540
 march in France then this one he is a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 little particular he and communicates so 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.050
 wirelessly with the central and you have 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 so directly on your smartphone 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.480
 as soon as there is a smell to detect we have 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 also presence detectors that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
 know that you can install 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.270
 one all your parts detectors 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 opening of the detector windows 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.079
 movements also detectors in all 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.410
 kind and that too is an alarm 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.489
 then also benefit from its products 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 it's running on battery 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.600
 no need to put them on a plug so 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.250
 you can install them absolutely 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.060
 anywhere it's really a sacred 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.920
 advantage over others 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.299
 solutions that requires you to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.900
 connect to power outlets 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.070
 other novelty as slow hen we know 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 that there is a big boom of bulbs 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.360
 connected this one same can 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.100
 to drive from a smartphone one can 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.189
 also imagine also you go in 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.840
 holidays to make people believe that 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.220
 there is a presence at home for 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.380
 simulate a presence at home can 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.920
 tell him to turn on at certain times 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.680
 of the day 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.750
 rather convenient d link also comes from 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.460
 unveil a new thermostat connect 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.659
 a little in the same vein as born 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.530
 had a lot of words you've already heard 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 spoken and finally even the kids are 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.659
 not spared by the connected home 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 with this baby monitor which is a 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.200
 real toolkit of the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.990
 child supervision 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.369
 we can play him continents you 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.610
 can you talk to him you can 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.579
 save take pictures and movies 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.049
 of all on a micro SD card you 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.729
 can absolutely do everything to 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.920
 remotely monitor your baby 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.729
 obviously it's still better to be 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.500
 next 1 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.480
 we agree last point this is it 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.790
 is not a novelty but it is a 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.459
 product that had rained that we 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.959
 was presented at the ifa not long ago 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.599
 it's a little smart plug that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.190
 lets you stream your music in 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.650
 any room then no need 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.090
 to buy systems at 5,600 euros which 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.830
 are is overpriced very difficult 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.660
 installed there you install this on a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.670
 taken to ghardaÃ¯a a small jack output 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.099
 that you connected to the auxiliary jack 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.780
 of your hi-fi system and therefore since 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.829
 your smartphone sent music 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.940
 on this on this block on this audio block and 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.440
 who will differ the music on your 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.690
 speaker on your audio equipment that 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.130
 you already have and it only costs 44 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.700
 euros which is quite a price 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.700
 interesting
