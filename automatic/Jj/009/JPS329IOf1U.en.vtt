00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660 
everything that you need to do the job
when<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.630> comes<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.530> amp<00:02:01.770> wiring<00:02:02.070> so

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
when it comes to your amp wiring so

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.980 
when it comes to your amp wiring so
definitely<00:02:03.210> look<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
definitely look at it that's not the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
definitely look at it that's not the
only<00:02:04.020> brand<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.740> good<00:02:04.920> out<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:05.070> but

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
only brand that's good out there but

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550 
only brand that's good out there but
that's<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.270> use<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.079> our<00:02:07.200> install

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that's what we use here in our install

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.869 
that's what we use here in our install
Bay<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.340> definitely<00:02:08.459> suggest

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
Bay so I would definitely suggest

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.029 
Bay so I would definitely suggest
checking<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.830> both<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.979> those

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
checking that out both of those

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.860 
checking that out both of those
amplifiers<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.879> believe<00:02:12.150> off<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> top<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.750> my

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
amplifiers I believe off the top of my

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.430 
amplifiers I believe off the top of my
head<00:02:13.140> how

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
head how

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.130 
head how
four<00:02:14.010> gauge<00:02:14.310> inputs<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.330> definitely<00:02:15.840> look<00:02:16.050> at

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
four gauge inputs so definitely look at

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.340 
four gauge inputs so definitely look at
the<00:02:16.290> X<00:02:16.530> kit<00:02:17.010> 44<00:02:17.730> by<00:02:17.910> n<00:02:18.090> VX<00:02:18.390> they'll<00:02:18.870> pretty<00:02:19.140> much

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
the X kit 44 by n VX they'll pretty much

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.170 
the X kit 44 by n VX they'll pretty much
cover<00:02:19.590> everything<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.190> need<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.910> only<00:02:21.060> thing

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
cover everything you need the only thing

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.700 
cover everything you need the only thing
you'll<00:02:21.330> need<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.570> purchase<00:02:21.990> additionally

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
you'll need to purchase additionally

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.810 
you'll need to purchase additionally
would<00:02:23.220> be<00:02:23.370> an<00:02:23.580> extra<00:02:24.000> RCA<00:02:24.390> cable<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.490> little

would be an extra RCA cable and a little

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.640 
would be an extra RCA cable and a little

bit of 12 gauge speaker wire for your

bit of 12 gauge speaker wire for your

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.650 
sub as far as the gauge of the speaker
cable<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.230> concerned<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.800> good<00:02:32.730> quality<00:02:33.120> 16

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
cable is concerned a good quality 16

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.360 
cable is concerned a good quality 16
gauge<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.080> typically<00:02:34.530> going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.740> be<00:02:34.800> fine<00:02:35.100> but

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
gauge is typically going to be fine but

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.820 
gauge is typically going to be fine but
it<00:02:35.460> really<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.910> relative<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> how<00:02:37.290> long<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it really is relative to how long the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.520 
it really is relative to how long the
run<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> cable<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.790> -<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.380> if

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
run of the cable is - so you know if

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.860 
run of the cable is - so you know if
you're<00:02:40.680> running<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.220> hundred<00:02:41.520> foot<00:02:41.910> cable<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.420> 16

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
you're running a hundred foot cable a 16

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.270 
you're running a hundred foot cable a 16
gauge<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:43.500> pumping<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.890> much<00:02:44.070> power

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
gauge and you're pumping that much power

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460 
gauge and you're pumping that much power
through<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.850> would<00:02:45.420> suggest<00:02:45.600> going<00:02:46.080> bigger

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
through it I would suggest going bigger

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.560 
through it I would suggest going bigger
but<00:02:47.070> depends<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.520> where<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:47.790> amps<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.270> and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
but depends on where your amps going and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.870 
but depends on where your amps going and
how<00:02:48.660> far<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.200> run<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.560> -<00:02:49.710> each<00:02:49.890> speaker<00:02:50.340> etc

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
how far the run is - each speaker etc

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.720 
how far the run is - each speaker etc
but<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:51.810> anywhere<00:02:52.320> between<00:02:52.380> 16<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.520> 12

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
but you know anywhere between 16 and 12

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.050 
but you know anywhere between 16 and 12
gauge<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.180> more<00:02:54.570> than<00:02:54.750> sufficient<00:02:55.910> 400<00:02:56.910> watts

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
gauge is more than sufficient 400 watts

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.750

or<00:02:57.390> more<00:02:57.930> depending<00:02:58.320> on<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> run<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:58.980> for

mean<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.220> got<00:03:05.340> guys<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.730> are<00:03:05.790> doing<00:03:05.910> eight

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
mean you got guys that are doing eight

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.300 
mean you got guys that are doing eight
gauge<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:07.080> honestly<00:03:07.440> that's<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.830> overkill

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
gauge but honestly that's way overkill

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.880 
gauge but honestly that's way overkill
in<00:03:08.460> most<00:03:08.700> cases<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:10.050> appreciate<00:03:10.740> your

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
in most cases so appreciate your

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.560 
in most cases so appreciate your
question<00:03:11.280> hopefully<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.120> helps<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.480> out

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
question hopefully that helps you out

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.000 
question hopefully that helps you out
but<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.870> also<00:03:13.050> want<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.320> share<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.770> more<00:03:13.950> thing

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
but I also want to share one more thing
