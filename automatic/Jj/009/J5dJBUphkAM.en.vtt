00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
do my best to keep my fingers out of the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
do my best to keep my fingers out of the
paint<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> quick<00:01:43.350> tag<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:48.470> alright

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.999 
paint and do a quick tag for you alright
so<00:01:50.570> if<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.659> squeeze<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.619> coming<00:01:52.860> out

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
so if I squeeze it it's just coming out

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.800 
so if I squeeze it it's just coming out
the<00:01:53.159> side<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.060> switch<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the side so I'm going to switch to a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.069 
the side so I'm going to switch to a
different<00:01:55.020> mop<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:57.210> doesn't<00:01:57.570> get<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
different mop as a it doesn't get the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
different mop as a it doesn't get the
best<00:01:58.469> coverage<00:01:58.829> i'm<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.430> sure<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.969> type<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
best coverage i'm not sure what type of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.280 
best coverage i'm not sure what type of
mops<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.070> i<00:02:02.399> guess<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.070> slow

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
mops is but it's i guess if you go slow

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.100 
mops is but it's i guess if you go slow
it<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.469> work<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:09.330> doesn't<00:02:09.720> give<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> best

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it can work but it doesn't give the best

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.270 
it can work but it doesn't give the best
coverage<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> pretty<00:02:11.550> big<00:02:11.790> mop<00:02:12.390> head

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
coverage it's a pretty big mop head

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.620 
coverage it's a pretty big mop head
yeah<00:02:13.730> i'll<00:02:13.850> switch<00:02:14.060> out<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.390> traditional

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
yeah i'll switch out to a traditional

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.330 
yeah i'll switch out to a traditional
mop<00:02:15.080> all<00:02:15.290> right<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.590> got<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:15.800> filled<00:02:16.069> up<00:02:16.190> in

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
mop all right so I got this filled up in

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.880 
mop all right so I got this filled up in
a<00:02:16.490> more<00:02:17.209> traditional<00:02:17.390> mop<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.410> uh<00:02:18.470> is

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
a more traditional mop that uh is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.059 
a more traditional mop that uh is
working<00:02:19.459> well<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:20.420> ink<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.810> pretty<00:02:21.319> pretty

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
working well this ink is pretty pretty

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.410 
working well this ink is pretty pretty
flowy<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:23.500> doesn't<00:02:24.500> drip<00:02:24.819> unless<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:26.060> really

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
flowy it doesn't drip unless you really

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.780 
flowy it doesn't drip unless you really
squeeze<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:27.950> probably<00:02:28.190> more<00:02:28.670> of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
squeeze it out so it's probably more of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.199 
squeeze it out so it's probably more of
a<00:02:28.940> Jeannot<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.770> is<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> bit<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.610> wouldn't<00:02:32.120> say

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
a Jeannot but it is a bit I wouldn't say

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.210 
a Jeannot but it is a bit I wouldn't say
watery<00:02:32.600> watered<00:02:33.170> down<00:02:33.350> as<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.830> coverage<00:02:34.130> is

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
watery watered down as the coverage is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.540 
watery watered down as the coverage is
still<00:02:34.459> there<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:34.880> um<00:02:35.420> yeah<00:02:36.410> it's<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.860> pretty

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
still there but um yeah it's a pretty

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.620 
still there but um yeah it's a pretty
good<00:02:37.760> coverage<00:02:38.180> as<00:02:38.420> well<00:02:38.450> as<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.910> guess<00:02:40.910> nice

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
good coverage as well as I guess nice

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.940 
good coverage as well as I guess nice
flow<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:44.180> don't<00:02:44.959> have<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.140> ton<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.830> this

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950
