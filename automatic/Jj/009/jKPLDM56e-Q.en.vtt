00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
science but it's that connection that

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.980 
science but it's that connection that
you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.609> your<00:01:39.149> patients<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.779> what

to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.590> take<00:01:43.590> science<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> different<00:01:44.520> level

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:44.669 
to do take science to a different level

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:47.330
