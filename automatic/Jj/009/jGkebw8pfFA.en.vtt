00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.609
 gameplay now we look at the shooter 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.230
 neon shadow 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.510
 and what this shooter is notable for 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.420
 notable for its multiplayer 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.910
 Perhaps multiplayer envies every 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 gram but before considering this 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.230
 Wonderful multiplayer I offer 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.789
 you watch single player mode then 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.800
 there is a single player 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.960
 what is it possible to include in it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 play and how strong he is to me 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.210
 liked compared to multiplayer 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.960
 which developers have offered us in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.380
 this shooter 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.899
 and so we feel the effect on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.899
 some kind of space ship on some 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.210
 space base and some kind of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.390
 Is it possible that all machines make a mistake 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 or rather robots rebelled on this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.579
 ship and you need them all 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.980
 destroy here you are now now from and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.899
 see I run around the ship and us 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.829
 it is necessary to destroy all kinds of defensive 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.780
 installation guns and also such 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.120
 aircraft and self-propelled devices 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.630
 who will try to kill you 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.570
 Already 3 or 4 mission here already all much 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.150
 harder than it was first natural and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.130
 much more fun I specifically so much 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 passed to show you 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.470
 real fun and real from which 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.750
 going on in this game opponents in 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.229
 kind of other people or robots in this 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 there is no game or rather robots 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.040
 there are only human-like here 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.759
 such are various incomprehensible 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.070
 devices for some reason 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 rebelled and try to kill you 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.930
 you have an arrow navigation which 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.340
 tell you where you need to go and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.680
 reaching the end of the level you will find 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.330
 so kind and on 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.670
 mystic cube that you have to 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.310
 destroy after you have him 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.570
 destroy and tell you the type of mission 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.360
 complete and you will need 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.729
 go back to top left where you're from 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.220
 come now there are 5 left and how 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.440
 I would not be killed in the general sense of the game 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.840
 such on every floor on every level 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:09.140
 you need to mop up accordingly 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.880
 this floor and return later to the base 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.190
 but the main thing is still the goal and you 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.560
 energy cube which is probably 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.350
 is the brain center of all these 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.070
 robots and control this one 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.870
 the destruction of a person aboard this 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.230
 spaceship in general plot here 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.330
 boring no but have fun 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.850
 in single-player principle you can 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.530
 and single player I told you now 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.040
 I propose to go to the main menu and 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.570
 look at that wonderful 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.209
 multiplayer that I probably already have 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.670
 tired of repeating his burrow same it repeated 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.420
 growth and I repeat, probably for sure 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.700
 as many 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.739
 So go to the multiplayer section and that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.549
 we see here there are three modes 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.130
 games are split-screen online and their lan 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.230
 let's start with the most interesting and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.910
 unusual multiplayer mode and which 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.910
 called split screen 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.160
 let's pick it and what is it 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.730
 we will need to fight more precisely 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.890
 there are also two game modes here 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.230
 cooperative game and defmatch and and 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.110
 if you choose a cooperative game then 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.940
 you together with your friend and comrade 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.340
 will be held together by the company if you 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.730
 choose defmatch then you along with your 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.350
 friend will fight against each other 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.540
 friend, respectively, let's click 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.690
 start and now you will see what happens 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.600
 don't be scared now that I am targeting 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.640
 screen has reversed 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.350
 side it is so i must first 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.540
 also did not understand what the joke 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.600
 but now you see I just don't want you 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.209
 say this not so we see our 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.280
 the screen is divided into two parts and we can 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.470
 play on the same device together 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.420
 that is, here and so we will run 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.530
 shoot 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.250
 but naturally what is the chip chip is necessary 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.900
 the trick is what we need 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.170
 large screen should preferably be 7th 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.280
 inch tablet is not very honest I 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.680
 comfortable to play the game for two here on 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.470
 one screen if it was a 10 inch 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.419
 the screen and I think it would be much 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.530
 cooler and much more interesting so i 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.139
 for some reason lost myself 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.870
 and here he is here we will run 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.750
 fight and on one device at once 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.750
 play on a grid against each other 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.210
 I think it's just a marvelous idea, I do not 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.150
 I know how the developers thought of up to 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.610
 such an idea but let's still go out in 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.370
 main menu and look at other 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.500
 multiplayer mode this multiplayer 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.169
 i was just inspired i was shocked by 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.470
 developers what they cranked 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.310
 such a crazy thing like a network game 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.919
 On one device of such shooters 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.039
 I have probably not seen since time 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.560
 playstation 1 well, even on a computer was like 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.140
 I do not remember Sirius Sam whether that is where the 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.930
 it was possible to play on one computer 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.630
 against each other but that it was on 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.880
 android device such I have not seen 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.070
 and see it for the first time but naturally I 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.740
 I mean such large scale ones 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.660
 the game is not some simple arcade 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.970
 next we have two game modes the 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:23.680
 online and lan lan respectively you 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.120
 create a game and play with someone 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.400
 my friend or anyone there 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.680
 who connect to you by wifi 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.680
 or bluetooth and you're over 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.050
 actually against each other 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.270
 online mode, respectively, this match 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.580
 through the Internet 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.550
 between completely random players 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.980
 or even with your friends who 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.050
 just far away from you they 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.690
 somewhere near by let's begin of the 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.870
 match we will now connect to google 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.600
 play u cobain service their mind and us 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.570
 I have to wait for the car choice, I 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.850
 I hope it will pass quickly if not then I 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.350
 I will cut 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.780
 Apparently I have to bring you my own 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.450
 apologies but why are you players during 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.130
 Shooting reviews, I did not wait until 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.050
 this is absolutely no problem 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.510
 connected and played with real 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.430
 rivals are not from which countries they are 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.530
 were but it was fun enough 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.260
 In general, the atmosphere of the game me a little 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.930
 reminded for some reason quake 3 of course 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.150
 you can not compare but probably this weapon 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.090
 or something like that in design 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.920
 not very much reminded this game here 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.230
 you really can't just jump 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.690
 run but basically in terms of 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.030
 multiplayer toy is just gorgeous 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.000
 I advise everyone to download her play with 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.910
 play online with your friends 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.340
 on one device together in general in 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.660
 Multiplayer plan is probably the best 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.660
 shooter that I saw
