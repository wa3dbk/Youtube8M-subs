past but um I know it's been a while
since<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.720> played<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.110> figured<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.650> played<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
since I played and I figured I played a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
since I played and I figured I played a
little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:11.759> it's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.210> pretty<00:01:12.750> fun

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960

game<00:01:12.990> windows<00:01:13.560> stolen<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.420> beta<00:01:16.819> and<00:01:17.819> I<00:01:18.689> think

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
game windows stolen and beta and I think

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.569

I might have some spare beta keys
actually<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.299> uh<00:01:21.329> make<00:01:22.109> sure<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.439> leave<00:01:22.619> a

they're gonna improve the graphics all
but<00:03:31.950> will<00:03:32.099> not<00:03:32.249> improve<00:03:32.459> just<00:03:32.819> some<00:03:33.659> textures

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
but will not improve just some textures

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.679 
but will not improve just some textures
are<00:03:34.469> a<00:03:34.499> bit<00:03:34.680> fishy<00:03:35.519> under<00:03:35.999> construction<00:03:36.569> you

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
are a bit fishy under construction you

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.440 
are a bit fishy under construction you
know<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.400> but<00:03:38.400> i'm<00:03:38.849> pretty<00:03:39.090> sure<00:03:39.209> they're

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
know so but i'm pretty sure they're

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.750 
know so but i'm pretty sure they're
going<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.659> fix<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:40.189> once<00:03:41.189> we're<00:03:41.370> closer<00:03:41.609> to

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
going to fix that once we're closer to

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.759 
going to fix that once we're closer to
release<00:03:44.959> i'm<00:03:45.959> actually<00:03:46.169> not<00:03:46.349> playing<00:03:46.590> with

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
release i'm actually not playing with

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.770 
release i'm actually not playing with
maximum<00:03:47.159> graphics<00:03:47.549> right<00:03:47.669> now<00:03:47.849> since<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.629> don't

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
maximum graphics right now since I don't

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.929 
maximum graphics right now since I don't
want<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:48.989> lag<00:03:49.169> you<00:03:49.349> guys<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.769> but<00:03:50.700> I'm
