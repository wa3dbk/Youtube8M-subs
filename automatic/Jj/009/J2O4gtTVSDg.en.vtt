00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
hi my name's elissa I did my project on

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.660 
hi my name's elissa I did my project on
the<00:00:15.599> animal<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:17.539> will<00:00:18.539> be<00:00:18.660> presenting<00:00:19.670> my

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the animal so I will be presenting my

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.769 
the animal so I will be presenting my
project<00:00:22.430> first<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.760> want<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> tell<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.539> guys

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.130 
project first I want to tell you guys
that<00:00:25.970> this<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.779> ribosomes<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.929> this<00:00:30.929> is

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that this is the ribosomes and this is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.260 
that this is the ribosomes and this is
the<00:00:31.289> nucleus<00:00:31.830> nucleus<00:00:33.079> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> nucleus

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
the nucleus nucleus this is the nucleus

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.229 
the nucleus nucleus this is the nucleus
this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> vacuole

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
this is the vacuole

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.010 
this is the vacuole
this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.890> lysosomes<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this is the lysosomes and this is the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.119 
this is the lysosomes and this is the
mitochondria<00:00:43.910> which<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> red<00:00:45.390> things

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
mitochondria which is the red things

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
mitochondria which is the red things
this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.969> Golgi<00:00:48.480> body<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
this is the Golgi body and this is the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
this is the Golgi body and this is the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
rough endoplasmic reticulum the blue

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.090 
rough endoplasmic reticulum the blue
thing<00:01:00.750> back<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> smooth

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
thing back here is the smooth

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.189 
thing back here is the smooth
endoplasmic

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.440 
plasmic reticulum this is the vacuoles
like<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.659> said<00:01:12.900> before<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:16.280> inside<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
like I said before and inside is the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.940 
like I said before and inside is the
style<00:01:18.750> membrane<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.990> outside<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
style membrane and the outside is the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.210 
style membrane and the outside is the
cell<00:01:23.490> wall<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.299> got<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> question<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.979> how

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
cell wall I got a question for you how

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
cell wall I got a question for you how
long<00:01:26.460> did<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.700> take<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.869> took<00:01:28.259> me

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
long did it take you to make it took me

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.830 
long did it take you to make it took me
like<00:01:28.890> an<00:01:29.159> hour<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:32.430> my<00:01:32.990> tools<00:01:33.990> all<00:01:34.680> today

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
like an hour I got my my tools all today

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.590 
like an hour I got my my tools all today
my<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.290> way<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> made<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.570> put<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
my the way I made it was to put a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
my the way I made it was to put a
Styrofoam<00:01:40.200> ball<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.009> got<00:01:41.340> clay<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.299> got

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
Styrofoam ball and got clay and I got

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
Styrofoam ball and got clay and I got
toothpicks<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
toothpicks and I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.370 
toothpicks and I
no<00:01:44.430> tablets<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:46.049> put<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.590> together<00:01:46.830> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
no tablets to put it all together and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
no tablets to put it all together and
when<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.650> finished<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.189> painted<00:01:50.580> everything

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
when I was finished I painted everything

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.149 
when I was finished I painted everything
and<00:01:51.509> then<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.750> put<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.590> order

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and then I put it all in order

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.580 
and then I put it all in order
my<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.750> put<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> play

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
my first I was like to put the play

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.950 
my first I was like to put the play
inside<00:01:56.479> fill<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.899> poll<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.130> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
inside fill out the poll and then I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.529 
inside fill out the poll and then I
started<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.649> my<00:02:02.060> nucleolus<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.450> my

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
started to make my nucleolus in my

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.570 
started to make my nucleolus in my
nucleus<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.950> put<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.429> other

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
nucleus and and then I put all the other

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.390 
nucleus and and then I put all the other
things<00:02:08.910> inside<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> painted

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
things inside of it and then I painted

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.860 
things inside of it and then I painted
my<00:02:11.520> last<00:02:11.760> part<00:02:12.030> was<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.300> paint<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.319> cell<00:02:13.680> wall

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
my last part was to paint the cell wall

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.820 
my last part was to paint the cell wall
and<00:02:15.920> then<00:02:17.600> I'm<00:02:18.600> going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.989> describe<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.769> you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and then I'm going to describe to you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.580 
and then I'm going to describe to you
what<00:02:20.430> each<00:02:20.640> one<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:22.280> okay<00:02:24.650> No<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.580> wanna<00:02:26.790> see

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
what each one is okay No you wanna see

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.590 
what each one is okay No you wanna see
why
