for<00:04:53.759> your<00:04:53.819> pellets<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:56.009> don't

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
for your pellets and for this you don't

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.339 
for your pellets and for this you don't
actually<00:04:56.580> need<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:57.180> bowl<00:04:57.569> for<00:04:57.810> your<00:04:57.930> pellets

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
actually need a bowl for your pellets

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.830 
actually need a bowl for your pellets
it's<00:04:59.099> more<00:04:59.370> natural<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.940> just<00:05:00.330> point<00:05:00.690> your

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
it's more natural to just point your

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.650 
it's more natural to just point your
palates<00:05:01.259> on<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.470> ground<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:01.949> let<00:05:02.069> them<00:05:02.220> graze

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
palates on the ground and let them graze

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.640 
palates on the ground and let them graze
because<00:05:03.660> that's<00:05:03.900> what<00:05:04.050> they<00:05:04.169> do<00:05:04.229> in<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.530> wild

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
because that's what they do in the wild

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.580 
because that's what they do in the wild
so<00:05:05.159> my<00:05:06.030> rabbits<00:05:06.569> end<00:05:06.720> up<00:05:06.840> tipping<00:05:07.229> over<00:05:07.319> their

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
so my rabbits end up tipping over their

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.320 
so my rabbits end up tipping over their
dish<00:05:07.770> anyway<00:05:08.220> I<00:05:08.250> need<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.699> get<00:05:08.819> off<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.180> ground

clip<00:05:22.169> it<00:05:22.289> on<00:05:22.409> like<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.800> i<00:05:22.979> just<00:05:23.009> set<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:23.520> down

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
clip it on like that i just set it down

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.820 
clip it on like that i just set it down
and<00:05:24.060> then<00:05:24.120> they<00:05:24.270> tip<00:05:24.479> it<00:05:24.569> over<00:05:24.659> and<00:05:25.319> eat<00:05:25.590> it<00:05:25.710> off

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
and then they tip it over and eat it off

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.300 
and then they tip it over and eat it off
the<00:05:25.889> ground<00:05:26.159> so<00:05:26.580> i<00:05:26.819> don't<00:05:27.000> really<00:05:27.090> care<00:05:28.310> so

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
the ground so i don't really care so

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.520 
the ground so i don't really care so
there's<00:05:29.610> no<00:05:29.699> need<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:29.970> grab<00:05:30.300> like<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.750> dish<00:05:31.500> like

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
there's no need to grab like a dish like

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.680 
there's no need to grab like a dish like
this<00:05:31.830> for<00:05:32.340> your<00:05:32.430> palates<00:05:32.789> because<00:05:33.090> they're

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
this for your palates because they're

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.830 
this for your palates because they're
going<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:33.900> tip<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.080> over<00:05:34.229> anyway<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.840> they're

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
going to tip it over anyway and they're

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.570 
going to tip it over anyway and they're
going<00:05:36.990> to<00:05:37.050> chew<00:05:37.349> it<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:37.860> it's<00:05:38.070> easier<00:05:38.370> just<00:05:38.400> to

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
going to chew it so it's easier just to

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.969 
going to chew it so it's easier just to
get<00:05:38.759> this<00:05:38.940> free<00:05:39.479> dish<00:05:39.750> that<00:05:40.139> you<00:05:40.380> can<00:05:40.560> replace

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
yeah um water bottles my rabbits don't

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.409 
yeah um water bottles my rabbits don't
drink<00:05:51.719> of<00:05:51.870> water<00:05:52.050> bottles<00:05:52.469> but<00:05:52.620> some<00:05:52.830> do<00:05:53.419> there

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
drink of water bottles but some do there

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.029 
drink of water bottles but some do there
isn't<00:05:54.750> really<00:05:54.840> a<00:05:54.990> cheap<00:05:55.289> option<00:05:55.500> for<00:05:56.009> water

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
isn't really a cheap option for water

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.060 
isn't really a cheap option for water
bottles<00:05:56.690> if<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:57.900> want<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.169> nice<00:05:58.320> one<00:05:58.620> because

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
bottles if you want a nice one because

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.659 
bottles if you want a nice one because
um<00:05:59.940> because<00:06:02.750> water<00:06:03.750> bottles<00:06:04.460> you<00:06:05.460> can't

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
um because water bottles you can't

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.520 
um because water bottles you can't
really<00:06:05.819> like<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.569> make<00:06:06.900> them<00:06:07.110> or<00:06:07.319> anything

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
really like and make them or anything

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.330 
really like and make them or anything
like<00:06:07.740> that<00:06:08.210> if<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.750> do<00:06:10.259> hand<00:06:10.560> makeup<00:06:10.949> they<00:06:11.190> end

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
like that if you do hand makeup they end

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.100 
like that if you do hand makeup they end
up<00:06:11.550> not<00:06:11.789> working<00:06:11.969> and<00:06:12.389> that's<00:06:12.509> not<00:06:12.810> good

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
up not working and that's not good

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.680 
up not working and that's not good
because<00:06:13.729> then<00:06:14.729> they<00:06:14.909> can't<00:06:15.150> get<00:06:15.330> any<00:06:15.479> water

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
because then they can't get any water

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.490 
because then they can't get any water
out<00:06:15.979> so<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:18.060> best<00:06:18.210> option<00:06:18.810> is<00:06:18.960> just<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.259> get<00:06:19.469> a

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
out so the best option is just to get a

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.969 
out so the best option is just to get a
nice<00:06:19.860> water<00:06:20.430> bottle<00:06:20.520> that<00:06:20.909> works<00:06:21.270> I'd<00:06:22.229> get<00:06:22.590> a

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
nice water bottle that works I'd get a

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.610 
nice water bottle that works I'd get a
glass<00:06:23.400> one<00:06:23.729> which<00:06:24.000> is<00:06:24.150> nice<00:06:24.449> and<00:06:24.900> thick<00:06:25.349> all

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
glass one which is nice and thick all

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.439 
glass one which is nice and thick all
water<00:06:26.130> bottles<00:06:26.550> are<00:06:26.669> probably<00:06:27.000> going<00:06:27.150> to<00:06:27.270> leak

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
water bottles are probably going to leak

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.719 
water bottles are probably going to leak
but<00:06:27.780> this<00:06:28.110> one's<00:06:28.319> just<00:06:28.440> nice<00:06:28.919> heavy<00:06:29.219> duty<00:06:29.580> it's

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
but this one's just nice heavy duty it's

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.360 
but this one's just nice heavy duty it's
like<00:06:29.819> glass<00:06:30.330> and<00:06:30.750> then<00:06:31.500> there's<00:06:31.740> other<00:06:32.039> kinds

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
like glass and then there's other kinds

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.159 
like glass and then there's other kinds
that<00:06:32.819> have<00:06:33.120> a<00:06:33.150> flip<00:06:33.479> top<00:06:33.719> so<00:06:33.930> you<00:06:33.990> can<00:06:34.080> just

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
that have a flip top so you can just

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.730 
that have a flip top so you can just
pour<00:06:34.560> water<00:06:34.770> in<00:06:35.960> but<00:06:36.960> they<00:06:37.050> did<00:06:37.229> like<00:06:37.530> the

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
pour water in but they did like the

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.469 
pour water in but they did like the
cheap<00:06:37.949> ones<00:06:38.159> that<00:06:38.400> are<00:06:38.520> at<00:06:38.610> like<00:06:38.789> Walmart<00:06:39.300> and
