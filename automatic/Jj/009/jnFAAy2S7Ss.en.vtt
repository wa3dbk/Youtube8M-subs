00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
barrel waving iron and I have it on so

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.750 
barrel waving iron and I have it on so
I'm<00:00:36.110> not<00:00:36.260> gonna<00:00:36.410> really<00:00:36.800> touch<00:00:37.100> it<00:00:37.310> that<00:00:37.490> much

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
I'm not gonna really touch it that much

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.060 
I'm not gonna really touch it that much
but<00:00:38.060> looks<00:00:38.780> like<00:00:38.900> this<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.530> comes<00:00:39.739> with

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
but looks like this that comes with

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.060 
but looks like this that comes with
three<00:00:40.430> barrels<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.150> has<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.329> stand<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.410> it<00:00:42.860> has

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
three barrels and has a stand and it has

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.160 
three barrels and has a stand and it has
the<00:00:43.280> swivel<00:00:43.700> Court<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.360> won't<00:00:44.570> get<00:00:44.720> tangled

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
the swivel Court so it won't get tangled

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.410 
the swivel Court so it won't get tangled
up<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:46.219> temperature<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:47.329> goes<00:00:47.539> up<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:47.989> 350

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
up the temperature it goes up to is 350

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.110 
up the temperature it goes up to is 350
so<00:00:50.559> it's<00:00:51.559> pretty<00:00:51.980> heavy<00:00:52.340> because<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:52.910> does

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
so it's pretty heavy because it does

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.279 
so it's pretty heavy because it does
have<00:00:53.420> three<00:00:53.809> barrels<00:00:54.230> is<00:00:54.350> not<00:00:54.789> your<00:00:55.789> average

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
have three barrels is not your average

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.319 
have three barrels is not your average
like<00:00:57.289> curling<00:00:57.920> iron<00:00:58.160> weight<00:00:58.519> you<00:00:59.059> got<00:00:59.210> to

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
like curling iron weight you got to

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.279 
like curling iron weight you got to
think<00:00:59.480> it's<00:00:59.690> about<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:02.030> weight<00:01:02.269> of<00:01:02.570> maybe

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
think it's about the the weight of maybe

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.760 
think it's about the the weight of maybe
three<00:01:04.040> curling<00:01:04.460> irons<00:01:04.790> together<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:05.390> would<00:01:05.690> say

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
three curling irons together I would say

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.470 
three curling irons together I would say
so<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:06.950> do<00:01:07.130> have<00:01:07.310> long<00:01:07.580> hair<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.120> lot<00:01:08.300> of

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
so if you do have long hair and a lot of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.420 
so if you do have long hair and a lot of
hair<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.110> might<00:01:09.320> find<00:01:09.620> your<00:01:09.890> wrist<00:01:10.100> getting

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
hair you might find your wrist getting

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.890 
hair you might find your wrist getting
cramped<00:01:10.820> or<00:01:10.940> whatever<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:11.330> let's<00:01:11.360> take<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.810> few

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
cramped or whatever so let's take a few

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.020 
cramped or whatever so let's take a few
breaks<00:01:12.290> or<00:01:12.530> whatever<00:01:12.830> but<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.550> really<00:01:13.820> likes

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
breaks or whatever but I really likes

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.720 
breaks or whatever but I really likes
because<00:01:14.920> instead<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:15.980> my<00:01:16.160> haired<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.490> being

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
because instead of my haired is being

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.510 
because instead of my haired is being
straight<00:01:17.360> straight<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.200> has<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.680> waves<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.280> it

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
straight straight it has the waves in it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.179 
straight straight it has the waves in it
and<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:20.450> makes<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.930> look<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.409> lot<00:01:21.590> lot<00:01:21.890> thicker

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
and it makes it look a lot lot thicker

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.730 
and it makes it look a lot lot thicker
so<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.150> course<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.570> already<00:01:23.720> did<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.409> whole

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
so of course I already did this whole

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.969 
so of course I already did this whole
side<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:26.420> did<00:01:26.659> this<00:01:26.930> I<00:01:27.229> had<00:01:27.259> I<00:01:27.590> left<00:01:27.860> a

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
side and I did this I had I left a

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.609 
side and I did this I had I left a
little<00:01:28.130> piece<00:01:28.430> because<00:01:29.020> basically<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.470> do

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
little piece because basically you do

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.230 
little piece because basically you do
the<00:01:30.740> same<00:01:30.920> thing<00:01:31.159> over<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.490> over<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.090> wasn't

for<00:02:26.770> about<00:02:26.860> 15<00:02:27.820> seconds<00:02:28.480> because<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.620> wave

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
for about 15 seconds because that wave

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.140 
for about 15 seconds because that wave
has<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.280> look<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.910> best<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.360> think<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.640> about<00:02:33.640> 15

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
has to look the best I think so about 15

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.020 
has to look the best I think so about 15
seconds<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> top<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.200> all<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.320> are<00:02:35.620> is

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030

three

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.180 
three
well<00:06:41.880> actually<00:06:42.180> it's<00:06:42.540> two<00:06:42.660> bears<00:06:43.190> separate

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190

that's<00:06:48.660> it<00:06:49.110> and<00:06:49.650> it<00:06:49.890> does<00:06:50.100> the<00:06:50.280> job<00:06:50.690> so<00:06:51.690> you<00:06:51.750> can

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
that's it and it does the job so you can

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.900
