00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.610 

so<00:04:17.239> what<00:04:17.419> I'm<00:04:17.510> going<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.660> do<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.959> like<00:04:18.079> an<00:04:18.169> angle

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
so what I'm going to do is like an angle

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:51.580 
so what I'm going to do is like an angle
grind<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.010> off<00:04:20.859> just<00:04:21.859> get<00:04:22.310> under

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.480 

now<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.650> can<00:04:52.830> see<00:04:53.240> bit<00:04:54.240> drastic

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
now you can see bit drastic

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.290 
now you can see bit drastic
better<00:04:56.720> got<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.810> bolt<00:04:58.020> off<00:04:58.880> it's<00:04:59.880> pretty<00:04:59.910> worn

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
better got the bolt off it's pretty worn

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.659 
better got the bolt off it's pretty worn
anyway<00:05:00.720> so<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:01.770> better<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.100> replace<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.580> with

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
anyway so it's better to replace it with

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.590 
anyway so it's better to replace it with
a<00:05:02.729> new<00:05:02.880> one<00:05:02.910> while<00:05:03.180> I'm<00:05:03.300> at<00:05:03.449> it

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
should be a split pin there really but

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.060 
should be a split pin there really but
there<00:05:31.200> isn't<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.729> no<00:05:32.910> way<00:05:33.090> that's<00:05:33.300> gone<00:05:37.070> you

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
can just see the split pin hole there

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.040 
can just see the split pin hole there
where<00:05:41.070> that<00:05:41.430> should<00:05:42.330> go<00:05:42.479> through<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:42.840> stop

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
where that should go through to stop

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.030 
where that should go through to stop
this<00:05:43.200> coming<00:05:43.500> off<00:05:43.760> there<00:05:44.760> we<00:05:44.880> go
