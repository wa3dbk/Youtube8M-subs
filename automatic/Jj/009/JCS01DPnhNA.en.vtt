00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
really important for everyone to try a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220 
really important for everyone to try a
liquid<00:00:34.739> cleanse<00:00:35.070> at<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.460> point<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.140> used<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
do the Master Cleanse before I learned a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.619 
do the Master Cleanse before I learned a
lot<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.780> nutrition<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.420> those

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
lot about nutrition and you know those

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.580

were<00:00:42.780> always<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.989> fun<00:00:43.440> challenge<00:00:44.100> fun<00:00:45.440> being<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
were always a fun challenge fun being a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.970 
were always a fun challenge fun being a
little<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.809> strange<00:00:49.140> word<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.410> use<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
little of a strange word to use for that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.560

blueprint juice and blueprint cleansing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
blueprint juice and blueprint cleansing
which<00:01:33.540> I've<00:01:33.689> talked<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:33.990> before<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:35.250> would

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
which I've talked about before I would

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
which I've talked about before I would
say<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.450> goes<00:01:36.689> hand-in-hand

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
say actually that goes hand-in-hand

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.370 
say actually that goes hand-in-hand
through<00:01:38.040> both<00:01:38.220> organic<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.119> one's<00:01:39.380> non-gmo

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
through both organic this one's non-gmo

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.359 
through both organic this one's non-gmo
certified<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:42.810> raw<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.590> cold-pressed

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
certified and it's raw and cold-pressed

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.310 
certified and it's raw and cold-pressed
so<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.329> means<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> there's<00:01:45.960> really

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so that means that there's really

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
so that means that there's really
nothing<00:01:47.250> bad<00:01:47.790> happening<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.509> it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
nothing bad happening in here it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
nothing bad happening in here it's
really<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.960> fruits<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> vegetables<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
really just fruits and vegetables of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.490 
really just fruits and vegetables of
course<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.180> downside<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> plastic

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
course the downside is all the plastic

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.760 
course the downside is all the plastic
use<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.369> um<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.149> guess<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.259> all<00:01:55.560> about<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
use but um I guess it's all about a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.120 
use but um I guess it's all about a
convenience<00:01:56.399> factor<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> time<00:01:57.299> factor<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
convenience factor and a time factor I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
convenience factor and a time factor I
personally<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.460> probably<00:01:59.790> rather<00:01:59.909> juice

my own just to be more eco-friendly but

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660 
my own just to be more eco-friendly but
it's<00:02:03.810> definitely<00:02:04.259> really<00:02:05.250> convenient

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it's definitely really convenient

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700

in terms of that this is definitely
going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.890> be<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> lot<00:03:09.459> pricier<00:03:09.790> for<00:03:10.330> a

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
going to be a lot pricier for a

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.199 
going to be a lot pricier for a
three-day<00:03:10.720> period<00:03:11.069> but<00:03:12.069> if<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.820> buy<00:03:12.970> your<00:03:13.120> own

save<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.459> lot<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.700> money<00:03:15.850> in<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.180> sense<00:03:16.540> I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
save a lot of money in that sense I

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.509 
save a lot of money in that sense I
think<00:03:16.690> actually<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.950> know<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.190> funny<00:03:18.430> I

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
think actually you know it's funny I

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.220 
think actually you know it's funny I
would<00:03:18.760> love<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.120> hear<00:03:19.239> from<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.690> because<00:03:20.079> I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
would love to hear from you because I

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.640 
would love to hear from you because I
don't<00:03:20.829> actually<00:03:21.010> know<00:03:21.489> for<00:03:21.790> sure<00:03:21.850> if<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:23.320> save

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
don't actually know for sure if you save

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.259 
don't actually know for sure if you save
money<00:03:23.890> by<00:03:24.160> buying<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.609> veg<00:03:24.790> truths<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
money by buying it veg truths and

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.300 
money by buying it veg truths and
vegetables<00:03:25.750> because<00:03:26.200> organic<00:03:26.769> fruits<00:03:27.130> and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
vegetables because organic fruits and

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.920 
vegetables because organic fruits and
vegetables<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.940> be<00:03:28.060> really<00:03:28.299> expensive<00:03:28.480> too

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
vegetables can be really expensive too

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.590 
vegetables can be really expensive too
so<00:03:29.620> I'd<00:03:29.739> love<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:29.980> see<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> math<00:03:30.730> done<00:03:31.120> somehow

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
so I'd love to see the math done somehow

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.259 
so I'd love to see the math done somehow
but<00:03:32.380> again<00:03:32.560> you're<00:03:32.709> saving<00:03:33.070> time<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:34.120> only

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
but again you're saving time the only

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.880 
but again you're saving time the only
thing<00:03:34.450> is<00:03:34.720> though<00:03:35.019> if<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.350> do<00:03:35.650> your<00:03:35.799> own

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
thing is though if you do your own

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.210 
thing is though if you do your own
vegetables<00:03:36.370> you're<00:03:38.010> taking<00:03:39.010> all<00:03:39.100> this

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
vegetables you're taking all this

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.949 
vegetables you're taking all this
