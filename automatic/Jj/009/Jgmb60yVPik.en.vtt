00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
 hello friends of tibÃº had today I will teach you how to format your pc 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.210
 before form you will do experiments with the pc 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.409
 so it will be more fun 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.509
 let's start 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.509
 basically consists of the following steps 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.069
 oo configure lips so that it does not boot windows if not the program 

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:20.550
 installation 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.749
 format the disks and create partitions 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.210
 disc divisions 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.899
 3 install windows 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.839
 configure the windows xp again and install the device drivers 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 instructions 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.510
 do not be scared by the amount of steps is that they are very detailed to not 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.659
 to make mistakes 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.030
 First turn on your PC and put the CD of Windows XP 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.890
 restart your pc 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.900
 do not configure lips 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.110
 enter the set speak the bios 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.290
 we must press the button that tells us the black screen and well begins our 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.470
 pc 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.970
 it is usually lete but it can be f2 f10 among others 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.710
 It depends on the motherboard 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.710
 we realize because it commonly says 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.840
 in the third press 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.620
 key mushroom puti lithium similar 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.910
 we will see the utility to configure the bios 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.930
 there we must go to find the order of drip order in which the pc 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.480
 look for the operating system 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.780
 generally says bode viceprimer and tiago torero 1st bode vice 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.520
 2nd bode vice or similar 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.850
 there we must configure the order so that the cd dvd drive is first and 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.790
 second hard drive hdd 4 now we must leave saving the changes 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 success sabin changes or knows and similar success 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.660
 It is very likely that we will be reinstated to PC 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
 format the disks and create partitions 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.830
 not if everything is ok a sign will appear that says press a key 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.650
 to start from the cd 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.870
 pressing a key will now start the installation program and load 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.840
 files for a moment 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 it may take a few minutes we should not touch anything 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.250
 3 will now ask us if we want to repair or install 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.660
 we press center 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.210
 important in the bottom of our screen will tell us the 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.609
 instructions and legends 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.309
 oo we must accept the license agreement 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:21.489
 we press f8 5 now it will give us to choose which installation to repair 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.670
 we press esq 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.670
 because we want to make a new installation not to repair 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.959
 6 now we will see the partitions of the discs that we have 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.899
 we must eliminate all 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.199
 select one and press the letter b 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:39.859
 7 if the partition we selected had windows installed we should 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:40.940
 press enter 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.770
 8 now we confirm the deletion by pressing the letter l 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.519
 e delete all the missing partitions 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.799
 if they did not have windows installed 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.870
 we just have to press the letter l 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.019
 11 once we only have non-partitioned space we have to create 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.189
 partitions by pressing the c key 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.819
 12 now we must choose the size of our partition 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.589
 you can create the amount you want 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:11.549
 examples 2048 megabits equal two revived ex four thousand 96 megawatts follow or 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.019
 four gigabytes 10 thousand 240 megawatts follow 10 gigabits 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.939
 20 thousand 480 megabits equal 20 gigabits forty thousand 960 megabits equal 40 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.059
 gigabits important the minimum recommended is 2 gigabits 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:31.859
 we will always have 8 megabits of non-partitioned space in each disk 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.259
 does not influence anything 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:37.609
 13 once we create all the partitions we want to select the 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.809
 partition where we want to install windows xp and then press enter 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:47.179
 14 now we must choose ntfs fast which is the file system in which 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.519
 windows xp and better performs 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.930
 15 now the installation program will begin to format our disk 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.260
 install windows 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.500
 1 after formatting the installation program will begin to copy 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.559
 files to our disk 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.389
 when it finishes we will restart the pc 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:06.759
 do not touch anything 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:11.089
 the installation program will appear but with a more didactic interface 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.180
 3 after a moment there will not be a poster 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.129
 click on next 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.129
 oo now we must enter our name and then click on next 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.110
 5 enter the serial and then click on next 6 now we must enter the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.849
 name of our pc and then click on next 7 now we owe our area 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.430
 time according to our location and then click on next 8 the program 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.979
 installation will continue 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.479
 9 after a moment it will end 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.100
 configure ulin dous 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.350
 1 the first thing that will appear after finishing the installation is a poster 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.309
 that tells us that windows will configure the screen 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.809
 to accept 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:53.599
 if we can see a poster click on accept 3 now it will execute a 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.469
 configuration utility 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.079
 click on next 4 choose if we want to activate the cup chalice actions 

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:01.520
 automatic or not 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.240
 then click on next 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.440
 5 choose our username and then click on next 6 now 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.289
 Finalize 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.770
 7 we already have our world uses xp like new running 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.830
 8 Now we must install the drivers of the devices 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.460
 our pc enter the properties of my pc right button on my pc and then 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.919
 properties 9 in the jaguar tab enter device manager 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.840
 10 there will appear with a yellow exclamation point the devices 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.930
 you need us to install you we have the drivers 11 we have two options 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.389
 insert the cd that came with that device to install the recommended 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.219
 d the right on the exclamation point then on updating 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.870
 controller and then connect to windows update so windows 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.039
 I searched automatically 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.039
 we must make sure there are no exclamation marks 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:56.669
 in this way 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.669
 all the components of our pc work correctly 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:05.039
 12 if we create more than one partition we must format the 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.879
 enter my pc and right click on the desired disk and choose 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.900
 format 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.839
 then click on start then wait 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.469
