Miss<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.469> the<00:04:21.650> short-term<00:04:21.979> I<00:04:22.340> did<00:04:22.610> increase<00:04:22.880> it

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
Miss in the short-term I did increase it

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.550 
Miss in the short-term I did increase it
from<00:04:23.180> 60<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.570> 70<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.289> I<00:04:24.320> think

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
from 60 to 70 and I think

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.500 
from 60 to 70 and I think
was<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.740> thousand<00:04:25.370> gold<00:04:25.580> which<00:04:25.880> is<00:04:26.000> quite<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.240> lot

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
was a thousand gold which is quite a lot

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.110 
was a thousand gold which is quite a lot
but<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.500> what<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.520> can<00:04:28.700> see<00:04:28.850> how<00:04:29.000> much

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
but you know what you can see how much

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.400 
but you know what you can see how much
stuff<00:04:29.389> I've<00:04:29.600> collected<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:31.040> am<00:04:31.370> only<00:04:31.880> level

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
12 coming up to now so that's a bit

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.500 
12 coming up to now so that's a bit
insane<00:04:37.130> how<00:04:37.520> much<00:04:37.700> stuff<00:04:37.970> I've<00:04:38.150> already<00:04:38.240> got<00:04:38.480> I

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
insane how much stuff I've already got I

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.000 
insane how much stuff I've already got I
mean<00:04:38.600> look<00:04:38.780> how<00:04:38.870> many<00:04:39.020> blooming<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.889> need

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
mean look how many blooming I just need

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.650 
mean look how many blooming I just need
to<00:04:40.130> only<00:04:40.820> to<00:04:41.030> get<00:04:41.150> drinking<00:04:41.710> anyway<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.660> use

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
to only to get drinking anyway so use

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.300 
to only to get drinking anyway so use
your<00:04:44.810> bank<00:04:45.050> there's<00:04:45.350> also<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.770> Guild's<00:04:46.100> bank

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
your bank there's also the Guild's bank

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.570 
your bank there's also the Guild's bank
so<00:04:46.610> it's<00:04:46.850> definitely<00:04:47.480> worth<00:04:47.690> joining<00:04:48.139> a<00:04:48.200> guild

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
so it's definitely worth joining a guild

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.060 
so it's definitely worth joining a guild
for<00:04:49.580> multiple<00:04:50.090> reasons<00:04:50.260> but<00:04:51.260> they<00:04:51.650> do<00:04:51.710> have<00:04:52.040> a

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
for multiple reasons but they do have a

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.810 
for multiple reasons but they do have a
shared<00:04:52.580> storage<00:04:53.000> area<00:04:53.540> as<00:04:53.690> well<00:04:54.669> quinta<00:04:55.669> note

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
shared storage area as well quinta note

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.640 
shared storage area as well quinta note
that<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.150> shared<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:56.630> people<00:04:57.020> can<00:04:57.260> take<00:04:57.470> your
