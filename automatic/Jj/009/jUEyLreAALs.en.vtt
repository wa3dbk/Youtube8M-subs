 First, let's check from the data of the past 10 years 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:24.970
 Beware of Fuxing Horses If you look at the results by popularity for 10 years in the past 10 years 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 It is distinctive that a horse with 11 to 14 wins has left a record of 3 wins and 2 wins 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:40.180
 On the other hand, it is only the deep impact of 2006 that won in response to the most popular support 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:44.850
 Even in a single win, it was 4.0 to 6.9 times for videos alone that won by 3.9 times or less 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 Horse has left the top results

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.860
 Basically, the 3 races mentioned above can be said to be a royal road 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:30.870
 Next Nikkei Prize Hanshin Grand Prize 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:35.330
 When I checked the orderly performance at the race of the horse that had entered the Sankei Osaka Cup, it was the first place there 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.330

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:20.409
 Attention to the starting history of the dedicated Raki 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:25.550

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:32.360
