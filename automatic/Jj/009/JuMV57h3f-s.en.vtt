00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to own this one so you see how it draws

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.710 
to own this one so you see how it draws
back<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:04.980> it<00:01:05.070> fires<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.540> should

fixed<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.109> i'm<00:03:46.200> assuming<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.609> can't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
fixed it so i'm assuming that you can't

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.909 
fixed it so i'm assuming that you can't
duplicate<00:03:48.359> any<00:03:48.930> items<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.620> don't<00:03:49.769> need

to we have creative mode so rather they
fixed<00:03:52.200> or<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.380> doesn't<00:03:52.739> matter<00:03:52.889> because<00:03:53.280> it's

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
fixed or not doesn't matter because it's

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.050 
fixed or not doesn't matter because it's
pretty<00:03:54.150> much<00:03:54.329> irrelevant<00:03:54.720> now<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.769> oxia<00:03:56.220> they

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
pretty much irrelevant now the oxia they

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.900
