00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.599
 this new video then you have me 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.900
 asked to bring it to move to this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.340
 one from the first all 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.500
 sorry the second half of the first channel 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 so that in any case it was even more 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 visible and I absolutely accept them 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230
 this proposal 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 we will move around on the first channel vi 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.369
 I say the first episode is on the second 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.200
 channel and it was going pretty well 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.200
 also like like we started very well 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.450
 let's get a physical form then vi 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.610
 I'll talk a little about how I want to do it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.340
 I have already explained that I am swampy broken 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.739
 less like in the others will not betray me a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 6 original because I was young and was 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.510
 especially requested by members 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.969
 so it is only a serious proposal by 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.379
 But you raised a number a bit longer 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.690
 so that I could load more 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.520
 video on the channel I officially did it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 I have no problems as we have it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.939
 we will find two games or you do not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.270
