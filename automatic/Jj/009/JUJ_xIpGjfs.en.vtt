00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
engine been really successful for Suzuki

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.260 
engine been really successful for Suzuki
but<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.460> one's<00:01:24.610> got<00:01:24.730> a<00:01:24.790> number<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.120> changes

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
but this one's got a number of changes

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.020 
but this one's got a number of changes
it<00:01:26.110> does<00:01:26.410> we've<00:01:26.680> increased<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.310> displacement

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
it does we've increased the displacement

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.860 
it does we've increased the displacement
it's<00:01:28.360> gone<00:01:28.570> up<00:01:28.720> from<00:01:29.020> now<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.240> 1037<00:01:31.240> CCS<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.780> we

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
it's gone up from now to 1037 CCS and we

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's gone up from now to 1037 CCS and we
did<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.260> by<00:01:32.380> increasing<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.830> bore<00:01:33.070> by<00:01:33.220> two

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
did that by increasing the bore by two

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.180 
did that by increasing the bore by two
millimeters<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.960> knew<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.290> our<00:01:35.350> riders<00:01:35.920> are

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
thousand CC v-twin character but we

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.970 
thousand CC v-twin character but we
needed<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.510> improve<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.840> mid-range<00:01:41.140> power<00:01:41.440> we

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
needed to improve the mid-range power we

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.920 
needed to improve the mid-range power we
achieve<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.550> by<00:01:42.790> increasing<00:01:43.180> displacement

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
achieve that by increasing displacement

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.390 
achieve that by increasing displacement
to<00:01:44.050> millimeters<00:01:44.500> bringing<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.010> torque<00:01:45.250> curve

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
to millimeters bringing the torque curve

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.250 
to millimeters bringing the torque curve
on<00:01:45.550> much<00:01:45.940> much<00:01:46.180> earlier<00:01:46.360> than<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.050> prior

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
on much much earlier than the prior

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.230 
on much much earlier than the prior
model<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:48.100> we're<00:01:48.430> pleased<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.730> have<00:01:48.910> that

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
model so we're pleased to have that

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.180 
model so we're pleased to have that
power<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.630> performance<00:01:49.780> down<00:01:50.260> low<00:01:50.500> now<00:01:50.800> that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
power and performance down low now that

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.010 
power and performance down low now that
should<00:01:51.460> really<00:01:51.670> work<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.300> know<00:01:52.390> all<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
should really work and you know all the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.620 
should really work and you know all the
adb<00:01:53.380> places<00:01:53.860> off-road<00:01:54.400> on<00:01:54.640> road<00:01:55.060> touring<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
adb places off-road on road touring the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.330 
adb places off-road on road touring the
whole<00:01:55.780> bit<00:01:55.990> but<00:01:56.590> it's<00:01:56.710> not<00:01:56.830> just<00:01:56.980> an<00:01:57.100> engine

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
whole bit but it's not just an engine

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.650 
whole bit but it's not just an engine
update<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.730> actually<00:01:58.030> wrapped<00:01:58.240> an<00:01:58.360> entirely

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
update you actually wrapped an entirely

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.150 
update you actually wrapped an entirely
new<00:01:58.900> chassis<00:01:59.140> around<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.680> yeah<00:02:00.100> absolutely

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
new chassis around it yeah absolutely

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.980 
new chassis around it yeah absolutely
when<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.760> upgraded<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.270> engine<00:02:01.540> we<00:02:01.690> knew<00:02:01.810> that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
when we upgraded the engine we knew that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.240 
when we upgraded the engine we knew that
the<00:02:02.110> power<00:02:02.260> and<00:02:02.350> performance<00:02:02.500> needed<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.130> come

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
the power and performance needed to come

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.070 
the power and performance needed to come
up<00:02:03.280> not<00:02:03.550> only<00:02:03.610> in<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.120> displacement<00:02:04.510> but<00:02:04.930> we

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
up not only in the displacement but we

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.660 
up not only in the displacement but we
also<00:02:05.230> needed<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.590> improve<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.920> handling<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
also needed to improve the handling and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.430 
also needed to improve the handling and
we<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.330> way<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.570> we<00:02:07.630> did<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.140> we

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
we the way that we did that is we

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.830 
we the way that we did that is we
increase<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.890> rigidity<00:02:09.129> of<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.399> chassis

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
increase the rigidity of the chassis

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.030 
increase the rigidity of the chassis
completing<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.899> completely<00:02:11.260> new<00:02:11.379> chassis<00:02:11.409> and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
completing a completely new chassis and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.590 
completing a completely new chassis and
reducing<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.909> weight<00:02:13.030> by<00:02:13.180> 13%<00:02:13.750> Oh

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
reducing the weight by 13% Oh

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.970 
reducing the weight by 13% Oh
for<00:02:14.690> all<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.050> bike<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.410> about<00:02:15.560> eighteen

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
for all the bike is about eighteen

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.920 
for all the bike is about eighteen
pounds<00:02:16.160> lighter<00:02:16.520> than<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.850> prior<00:02:17.030> model<00:02:17.270> so

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
pounds lighter than the prior model so

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.630 
pounds lighter than the prior model so
with<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.140> increase<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.530> displacement<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:19.370> new

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
with the increase in displacement a new

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.100 
with the increase in displacement a new
chassis<00:02:19.880> design<00:02:20.390> along<00:02:20.720> with<00:02:20.870> our<00:02:20.990> new

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
chassis design along with our new

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.050 
chassis design along with our new
suspension<00:02:21.500> there's<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.250> completely<00:02:22.910> new

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
suspension there's a completely new

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.910 
suspension there's a completely new
