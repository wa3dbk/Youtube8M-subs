00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840 
any paint on the horns and some with a
lot<00:01:45.720> i<00:01:46.020> liked<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.369> paint<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
lot i liked the lot of paint on the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.280 
lot i liked the lot of paint on the
horns<00:01:48.180> i<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.689> they<00:01:48.810> look<00:01:48.990> better<00:01:49.140> like

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
horns i think that they look better like

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.170 
horns i think that they look better like
that<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:49.979> why<00:01:50.189> i<00:01:50.220> got<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.000> but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
that so that's why i got this one but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450 
that so that's why i got this one but
there<00:01:51.899> were<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.290> work<00:01:52.560> barely<00:01:52.920> any<00:01:53.070> paint<00:01:53.369> on

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
there were some work barely any paint on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.030 
there were some work barely any paint on
the<00:01:53.579> ones<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.170> i<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:55.829> think

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the ones so it's really i don't think

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
the ones so it's really i don't think
that<00:01:56.100> there's<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.700> uh<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.600> right

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that there's one that's uh that's right

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.740 
that there's one that's uh that's right
over<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> others<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.790> just<00:02:00.030> mostly

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
over the others but it's just mostly

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
over the others but it's just mostly
personal<00:02:00.960> choice<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.070> i'd<00:02:02.549> recommend<00:02:02.579> that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
the scope to let me just let's just do a

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.100 
the scope to let me just let's just do a
little<00:03:13.680> comparison<00:03:13.860> with<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.180> destroyer<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
little comparison with the destroyer the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.539 
little comparison with the destroyer the
reason<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.440> said<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.860> think<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> legs

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
reason I said that I think that the legs

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.849 
reason I said that I think that the legs
are<00:03:17.760> really<00:03:18.000> close<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.569> just<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.170> design<00:03:19.530> I

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
are really close is just the design I

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.500 
are really close is just the design I
know<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.519> destroyer<00:03:20.880> has<00:03:21.090> spikes<00:03:21.359> and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
know that the destroyer has spikes and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.150 
know that the destroyer has spikes and
stuff<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.170> design<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.920> lines

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
stuff but just the design with the lines

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.340 
stuff but just the design with the lines
through<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.700> legs<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.120> everything<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.660> very

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
through the legs and everything is very

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.009 
through the legs and everything is very
similar<00:03:25.859> so<00:03:26.639> it<00:03:27.000> just<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.569> just<00:03:27.600> kind<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.959> looks

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
similar so it just it just kind of looks

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.420 
similar so it just it just kind of looks
like<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.680> then<00:03:28.769> you've<00:03:28.950> got<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.220> feet

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
like that and then you've got the feet

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.460 
like that and then you've got the feet
that<00:03:29.609> look<00:03:29.790> very<00:03:30.120> much<00:03:30.239> similar<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.900> i<00:03:31.079> have<00:03:31.410> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
that look very much similar so i have a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.009 
that look very much similar so i have a
feeling<00:03:31.650> hasbro<00:03:32.310> i<00:03:32.340> definitely<00:03:32.880> am<00:03:32.940> looked<00:03:33.840> at

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
feeling hasbro i definitely am looked at

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.960 
feeling hasbro i definitely am looked at
their<00:03:34.200> old<00:03:34.380> destroyer<00:03:35.310> figure<00:03:35.730> when

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
their old destroyer figure when

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.210 
their old destroyer figure when
designing<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.720> curse<00:03:37.019> there<00:03:37.650> close<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
designing this curse there close to the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.949 
designing this curse there close to the
same<00:03:38.280> height<00:03:38.639> destroyers<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.540> bit<00:03:39.720> taller

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
same height destroyers just a bit taller

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.840 
same height destroyers just a bit taller
and<00:03:40.290> from<00:03:40.709> what<00:03:40.859> I've<00:03:40.980> seen<00:03:41.010> with<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.459> trailer

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
and from what I've seen with the trailer

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.379 
and from what I've seen with the trailer
of<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:43.200> dark<00:03:43.440> world<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.950> think<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
of the the dark world I think that I the

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.879 
of the the dark world I think that I the
destroyer<00:03:45.780> definitely<00:03:46.230> should<00:03:46.350> be<00:03:46.440> taller<00:03:46.680> of

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
destroyer definitely should be taller of

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.270 
destroyer definitely should be taller of
course<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.220> one<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.579> not<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.940> scale<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:48.630> hey

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
course this one is not in scale but hey

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.860 
course this one is not in scale but hey
the<00:03:50.280> curse<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.880> does<00:03:51.060> show<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.299> curse<00:03:51.660> is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the curse that does show that curse is

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.390 
the curse that does show that curse is
taller<00:03:52.170> than<00:03:52.319> most<00:03:52.560> because<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:53.100> know<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
taller than most because you know the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.970 
taller than most because you know the
destroyer<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.180> quite<00:03:54.569> dull<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.380> 3d<00:03:55.680> car<00:03:55.859> and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
destroyer is quite dull for 3d car and

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.460 
destroyer is quite dull for 3d car and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
but that just pops right back on like

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.600 
but that just pops right back on like
this<00:04:30.450> so<00:04:30.720> originally<00:04:31.590> this<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.890> as<00:04:32.040> far<00:04:32.220> up<00:04:32.460> as

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
this so originally this is as far up as

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.790 
this so originally this is as far up as
you<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:32.940> go<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.750> very<00:04:33.930> nice<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:34.230> Baldwin<00:04:34.560> ahead

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you can go so very nice so Baldwin ahead

you can go so very nice so Baldwin ahead
which<00:04:34.980> works<00:04:35.250> pretty<00:04:35.400> nice<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.850> has<00:04:35.970> that

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
which works pretty nice and has that

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.580 
which works pretty nice and has that
little<00:04:36.240> trick<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.750> make<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.020> go<00:04:37.140> even<00:04:37.320> further

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
little trick to make it go even further

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.560 
little trick to make it go even further
you've<00:04:38.220> got<00:04:38.400> ball<00:04:38.580> head<00:04:38.760> shoulders<00:04:39.240> hinge

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
you've got ball head shoulders hinge

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.260 
you've got ball head shoulders hinge
swivel<00:04:39.960> elbows<00:04:40.320> no<00:04:40.830> risk<00:04:41.100> no<00:04:41.280> waste<00:04:41.700> he's<00:04:42.090> got

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
swivel elbows no risk no waste he's got

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.390 
swivel elbows no risk no waste he's got
ball<00:04:42.510> hinge<00:04:42.780> thighs<00:04:43.440> with<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.860> thighs<00:04:44.040> wobble

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
ball hinge thighs with the thighs wobble

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.880 
ball hinge thighs with the thighs wobble
but<00:04:44.820> it's<00:04:45.240> very<00:04:45.570> hindered<00:04:46.050> by<00:04:46.170> this<00:04:46.380> Garmin

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
but it's very hindered by this Garmin

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.160 
but it's very hindered by this Garmin
here<00:04:47.160> on<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.270> leg<00:04:48.510> moves<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.870> little<00:04:48.930> bit

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
here on this this leg moves a little bit

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.900 
here on this this leg moves a little bit
more<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.530> not<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.830> button<00:04:50.250> but<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.700> by<00:04:50.880> that

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
more but not that button but not by that

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.630 
more but not that button but not by that
much<00:04:51.090> he's<00:04:51.840> got<00:04:52.020> hinge<00:04:52.260> swivel<00:04:52.620> knees<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.490> no

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.570 
much he's got hinge swivel knees and no
ankle<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:54.510> overall<00:04:54.840> he<00:04:55.110> has<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.410> vendor<00:04:56.160> style

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.810 
reason that they gave him that had put
type<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:01.800> articulation<00:05:02.370> because<00:05:02.550> some<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:02.730> the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
type of articulation because some of the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.310 
type of articulation because some of the
other<00:05:02.970> figures<00:05:03.330> from<00:05:03.450> this<00:05:03.660> wave<00:05:03.840> have<00:05:04.080> better

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
other figures from this wave have better

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.560 
other figures from this wave have better
articulation<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:05.340> because<00:05:05.730> he<00:05:05.850> is<00:05:05.880> he's<00:05:06.300> quite

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
articulation is because he is he's quite

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.690 
articulation is because he is he's quite
large<00:05:06.840> I'm<00:05:07.170> like<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.860> know<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.430> other<00:05:08.550> two

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
large I'm like you know the other two

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.430 
large I'm like you know the other two
figures<00:05:09.120> i<00:05:09.270> have<00:05:09.450> from<00:05:09.600> this<00:05:09.780> series<00:05:10.110> are<00:05:10.290> the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
figures i have from this series are the

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.010 
figures i have from this series are the
dark<00:05:10.620> elf<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.100> thor<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.700> they<00:05:12.120> have<00:05:12.360> both

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
dark elf and thor and they have both

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.140 
dark elf and thor and they have both
more<00:05:13.500> considerably<00:05:14.160> more<00:05:14.400> articulation<00:05:14.880> than

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
more considerably more articulation than

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.350 
more considerably more articulation than
this<00:05:15.270> guy<00:05:15.450> so<00:05:15.780> it's<00:05:16.350> mostly<00:05:16.560> just<00:05:16.950> his<00:05:17.160> size<00:05:17.460> i

series I have as you can see he seems to

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.260 
series I have as you can see he seems to
be<00:05:34.980> in<00:05:35.130> pretty<00:05:35.160> good<00:05:35.370> scale<00:05:35.700> he<00:05:35.850> might<00:05:36.000> need<00:05:36.120> to

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
be in pretty good scale he might need to

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.260 
be in pretty good scale he might need to
