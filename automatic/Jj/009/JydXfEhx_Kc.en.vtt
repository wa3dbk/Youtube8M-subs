00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
quite a lot of bubbles without much

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
quite a lot of bubbles without much
effort<00:01:28.080> versus<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:29.009> traditional

back<00:01:34.409> first<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.400> should

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
back first so if your little one should

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.910 
back first so if your little one should
tilt<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.119> their<00:01:36.360> head<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.409> they

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
tilt up their head all right they

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.910 
tilt up their head all right they
shouldn't<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.369> solution<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.970> their<00:01:39.119> mouth

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
shouldn't get in solution in their mouth

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.230 
shouldn't get in solution in their mouth
now<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> more<00:01:41.340> up-close<00:01:41.850> look<00:01:41.880> at<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
now for a more up-close look at the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
now for a more up-close look at the
bubbles<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.780> found<00:01:42.990> these<00:01:43.079> doubles<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.619> really

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
bubbles we found these doubles a really

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
bubbles we found these doubles a really
long<00:01:44.130> lasting<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.880> you'll<00:01:45.360> tend<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> find

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
long lasting so you'll tend to find

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.639 
long lasting so you'll tend to find
quite<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> few

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
quite a few

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
unpop bubbles for quite some time and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.090 
unpop bubbles for quite some time and
we've<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:49.380> blown<00:01:49.770> them

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
we've actually blown them

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.240 
we've actually blown them
now<00:01:50.939> once<00:01:51.210> you've<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.600> them<00:01:52.020> blind<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.890> time

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
now once you've got them blind it's time

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
now once you've got them blind it's time
