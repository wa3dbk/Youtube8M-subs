00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
new laptop I purchased just a couple of

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.030 
new laptop I purchased just a couple of
weeks<00:00:05.970> ago<00:00:06.180> tell<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.080> all<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.379> components

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
weeks ago tell you all the components

new<00:00:12.480> RAM<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:13.950> I've

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
new RAM to it you see here I've

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.670 
new RAM to it you see here I've
purchased<00:00:14.309> two<00:00:14.700> sticks<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.240> P&amp;Y<00:00:15.809> Ram<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.440> is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
purchased two sticks of P&amp;Y Ram it is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.120 
purchased two sticks of P&amp;Y Ram it is
four<00:00:17.670> gigabytes<00:00:18.210> at<00:00:19.520> ddr2<00:00:21.230> 380<00:00:22.230> 500<00:00:22.890> sorry

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
four gigabytes at ddr2 380 500 sorry

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
four gigabytes at ddr2 380 500 sorry
it's<00:00:23.279> been<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> long<00:00:23.550> time<00:00:23.699> since<00:00:23.910> I've<00:00:24.060> done

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
it's been a long time since I've done

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.420 
it's been a long time since I've done
Hardware<00:00:24.510> stuff<00:00:24.859> but<00:00:25.859> yeah<00:00:26.010> basically<00:00:26.130> this

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
Hardware stuff but yeah basically this

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.450 
Hardware stuff but yeah basically this
is<00:00:26.580> 1066<00:00:27.269> Ram<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.590> laptop<00:00:29.010> came<00:00:29.279> with

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
is 1066 Ram because the laptop came with

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
is 1066 Ram because the laptop came with
DDR<00:00:30.019> 1333<00:00:31.019> DDR<00:00:32.780> 10600<00:00:33.780> something<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
DDR 1333 DDR 10600 something like that

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
DDR 1333 DDR 10600 something like that
and<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.460> processor<00:00:36.000> does<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.420> support<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.930> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and the processor does not support it so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.139 
and the processor does not support it so
basically<00:00:37.350> I've<00:00:37.739> got<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.100> higher<00:00:38.430> latency<00:00:38.670> Ram

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
basically I've got a higher latency Ram

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.920 
basically I've got a higher latency Ram
a<00:00:39.450> lower<00:00:39.719> amount<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.440> RAM<00:00:40.760> with<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:42.840> know

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
a lower amount of RAM with you know

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
a lower amount of RAM with you know
that's<00:00:43.110> not<00:00:43.170> actually<00:00:43.350> using<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> speed<00:00:44.219> at

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that's not actually using the speed at

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.950 
that's not actually using the speed at
the<00:00:44.520> frontside<00:00:44.850> bus<00:00:44.910> speed<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:45.750> come

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the frontside bus speed that would come

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.740 
the frontside bus speed that would come
with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> RAM<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> basically

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
with the RAM that it's got so basically

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
with the RAM that it's got so basically
what<00:00:48.899> we've<00:00:49.020> got<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.440> we've<00:00:50.160> got<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> deli

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
what we've got here we've got the deli

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.750 
what we've got here we've got the deli
Ostrow<00:00:51.510> 3400<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> 14<00:00:53.190> inch<00:00:53.399> screen

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
Ostrow 3400 this is a 14 inch screen

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
Ostrow 3400 this is a 14 inch screen
laptop<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.110> maybe<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.160> let's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
laptop as you can maybe see there let's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.790 
laptop as you can maybe see there let's
lean<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.030> bit<00:00:57.410> yeah<00:00:58.500> 14

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
lean it back just a little bit yeah 14

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.540 
lean it back just a little bit yeah 14
inch<00:00:58.980> screen<00:00:59.280> it's<00:01:00.289> 1366<00:01:01.289> by<00:01:01.410> 768<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
inch screen it's 1366 by 768 if I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.149 
inch screen it's 1366 by 768 if I
remember<00:01:02.789> correctly<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:04.260> got<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.920> full

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
remember correctly it's got the full

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520 
remember correctly it's got the full
keyboard<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.390> would<00:01:06.479> expect<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.320> not

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
keyboard as you would expect it's not

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.300 
keyboard as you would expect it's not
the<00:01:07.740> 17-inch<00:01:08.220> model<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> doesn't<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
the 17-inch model so it doesn't have the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.359 
the 17-inch model so it doesn't have the
number<00:01:11.310> pad<00:01:11.460> over<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> side<00:01:12.799> trackpad<00:01:13.799> as

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
number pad over on the side trackpad as

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.280 
number pad over on the side trackpad as
you<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:14.729> expect<00:01:14.869> media<00:01:15.869> buttons<00:01:16.140> across

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you would expect media buttons across

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.289 
you would expect media buttons across
the<00:01:16.409> top<00:01:16.590> came<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.729> Windows<00:01:17.939> 7

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the top came with Windows 7

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.350 
the top came with Windows 7
pre-installed<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.920> did<00:01:20.250> come<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.939> core

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
pre-installed this did come with a core

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.410 
pre-installed this did come with a core
i5<00:01:21.890> 560<00:01:22.890> M<00:01:23.100> processor<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.030> believe

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
i5 560 M processor which I don't believe

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600 
i5 560 M processor which I don't believe
you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.720> get<00:01:24.900> anymore<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.530> Dell<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.460> also

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you can get anymore from Dell it also

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
you can get anymore from Dell it also
came<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.060> four<00:01:27.390> gigabytes<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.200> said<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
came with four gigabytes like I said of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
came with four gigabytes like I said of
ddr3<00:01:29.570> 1333<00:01:30.570> Rams<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.710> 1333<00:01:32.520> megahertz<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
ddr3 1333 Rams so 1333 megahertz but the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.460 
ddr3 1333 Rams so 1333 megahertz but the
core<00:01:34.200> i5<00:01:34.350> 560<00:01:35.189> does<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.640> support<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.900> ddr3

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
core i5 560 does not support the ddr3

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.120 
core i5 560 does not support the ddr3
1333<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.610> we're<00:01:39.090> gonna<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.360> replacing<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:40.130> in

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
1333 so we're gonna be replacing that in

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
1333 so we're gonna be replacing that in
addition<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.549> has<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> 500<00:01:42.360> gig<00:01:42.479> hard<00:01:42.509> drive<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
addition that has a 500 gig hard drive a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.800 
addition that has a 500 gig hard drive a
built-in<00:01:43.950> nvidia<00:01:44.700> graphics<00:01:44.939> card<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
built-in nvidia graphics card that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
built-in nvidia graphics card that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
within linux does not work we'll talk

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.789 
within linux does not work we'll talk
about<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.210> another<00:01:48.329> video<00:01:48.659> though<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
about that in another video though and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.020 
about that in another video though and
the<00:01:50.040> processor<00:01:50.460> itself<00:01:50.579> does<00:01:51.000> have

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the processor itself does have

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.840 
the processor itself does have

up there's one stick out you can see

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.619 
up there's one stick out you can see
here<00:03:41.870> probably<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> says<00:03:42.859> dim<00:03:43.609> one<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:44.419> has<00:03:44.599> a

little bit of info on it under that
sticker<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.370> does<00:03:46.549> say<00:03:46.729> two<00:03:46.989> two<00:03:47.989> gigs<00:03:52.000> there

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
sticker it does say two two gigs there

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.430 
sticker it does say two two gigs there
we<00:03:53.150> go<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.479> second<00:03:53.840> stick<00:03:53.989> has<00:03:54.109> been<00:03:54.260> popped

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
we go the second stick has been popped

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.990 
we go the second stick has been popped
out<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.859> you<00:03:55.310> can<00:03:55.430> actually<00:03:55.699> read<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.849> little

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
out and you can actually read a little

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.330 
out and you can actually read a little
bit<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.299> this<00:03:56.479> one<00:03:56.690> if<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.169> can<00:03:57.349> see<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.829> two

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
bit on this one if you can see that two

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
gigabytes PC 3 1 0 6 0 0 so it's 1333

at<00:04:03.409> this<00:04:04.040> point<00:04:04.220> we<00:04:04.370> pop<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.699> two<00:04:04.879> sticks<00:04:05.239> of

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
at this point we pop the two sticks of

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:13.610 
at this point we pop the two sticks of
PNY<00:04:06.019> RAM<00:04:06.290> into<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:07.040> motherboard

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.460 

and<00:04:14.620> basically<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:16.000> should<00:04:16.180> be<00:04:16.299> about<00:04:16.479> it<00:04:16.780> we

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
and basically that should be about it we

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.229 
and basically that should be about it we
should<00:04:17.739> now<00:04:17.919> be<00:04:18.130> able<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.340> put<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.729> bottom

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
should now be able to put the bottom

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.409 
should now be able to put the bottom
back<00:04:19.509> onto<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.019> case<00:04:20.940> just<00:04:21.940> got<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.090> pop<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
back onto the case just got a pop it

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.540 
back onto the case just got a pop it
back<00:04:22.449> into<00:04:22.720> place<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.530> couple<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:24.130> spots<00:04:25.440> go

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
back into place and a couple of spots go

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.129 
back into place and a couple of spots go
one<00:04:27.550> spot<00:04:27.850> doesn't<00:04:28.060> want<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.389> go<00:04:28.780> back<00:04:28.930> in

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
one spot doesn't want to go back in

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.219 
one spot doesn't want to go back in
usually<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:29.889> give<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.639> a<00:04:30.669> little<00:04:30.789> coaxing<00:04:31.300> I'm

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
usually so give it a little coaxing I'm

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.140 
usually so give it a little coaxing I'm
not<00:04:32.380> gonna<00:04:32.530> screw<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:32.889> in<00:04:32.979> yet<00:04:33.160> because<00:04:33.520> if

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
not gonna screw it in yet because if

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.340 
not gonna screw it in yet because if
you've<00:04:34.360> ever<00:04:34.539> worked<00:04:34.720> with<00:04:34.870> hardware<00:04:35.229> before

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
you've ever worked with hardware before

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.870 
you've ever worked with hardware before
you<00:04:35.680> know<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.889> don't<00:04:36.220> screw<00:04:36.490> anything

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
you know you don't screw anything

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.279 
you know you don't screw anything
together<00:04:37.060> until<00:04:37.479> you're<00:04:37.750> certain<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.139> it's

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
together until you're certain that it's

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.689 
together until you're certain that it's
working<00:04:38.560> otherwise<00:04:39.130> you're<00:04:39.310> just<00:04:39.340> gonna<00:04:39.520> have

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
working otherwise you're just gonna have

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.999 
working otherwise you're just gonna have
to<00:04:39.789> unscrew<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.150> again<00:04:40.530> well<00:04:41.530> go<00:04:41.800> ahead<00:04:41.919> and

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
to unscrew it again well go ahead and

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.279 
to unscrew it again well go ahead and
hit<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.250> power<00:04:42.580> button<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.300> keep<00:04:44.050> an<00:04:44.199> eye<00:04:44.259> on

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
hit the power button and keep an eye on

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.810 
hit the power button and keep an eye on
the<00:04:44.470> screen<00:04:44.740> let's<00:04:44.979> see<00:04:45.100> what<00:04:45.250> happens

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
the screen let's see what happens

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.640 
the screen let's see what happens
it<00:04:46.720> says<00:04:46.900> del<00:04:47.199> go<00:04:47.830> into<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.190> setup<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:49.840> says<00:04:50.260> we

ahead and escape out of this we'll just

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.879 
ahead and escape out of this we'll just
let<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.699> boot<00:05:00.880> up<00:05:01.180> should<00:05:01.840> go<00:05:02.020> into<00:05:02.169> Linux<00:05:02.500> Mint

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
let it boot up should go into Linux Mint

correct amount of memory or at least

correct amount of memory or at least
close<00:05:44.060> enough<00:05:44.509> because<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.259> has<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.860> built<00:05:46.160> in

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
close enough because it has the built in

close enough because it has the built in
integrated<00:05:46.910> graphics<00:05:47.120> I'm<00:05:47.539> sure<00:05:47.750> it<00:05:47.870> is

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
integrated graphics I'm sure it is

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.990 
integrated graphics I'm sure it is
taking<00:05:48.380> advantage<00:05:48.740> of<00:05:48.860> some<00:05:49.160> of<00:05:49.280> that<00:05:49.430> for<00:05:49.880> the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
taking advantage of some of that for the

taking advantage of some of that for the
integrated<00:05:50.330> graphics<00:05:50.620> but<00:05:51.620> that's<00:05:51.830> about<00:05:52.039> all

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
integrated graphics but that's about all

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.010 
integrated graphics but that's about all
for<00:05:52.550> today<00:05:53.090> if<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.479> have<00:05:53.750> any<00:05:53.930> experience

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919

worked<00:05:58.220> out<00:05:58.370> for<00:05:58.430> you<00:05:58.699> a<00:05:59.120> topic<00:05:59.900> I<00:05:59.990> really

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
worked out for you a topic I really

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.570 
worked out for you a topic I really
didn't<00:06:00.500> want<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.680> address<00:06:00.979> in<00:06:01.099> this<00:06:01.160> video<00:06:01.430> but

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
didn't want to address in this video but

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.740 
didn't want to address in this video but
I<00:06:01.639> thought<00:06:01.729> I'd<00:06:02.000> go<00:06:02.120> ahead<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.300> bring<00:06:02.479> it<00:06:02.630> up

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
I thought I'd go ahead and bring it up

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.420 
I thought I'd go ahead and bring it up
like<00:06:02.900> I<00:06:03.139> said<00:06:03.169> this<00:06:03.500> has<00:06:03.650> an<00:06:03.800> Nvidia<00:06:04.250> graphics

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430
