why<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.500> think<00:00:10.710> free-to-play<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.849> ruining<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
why I think free-to-play is ruining the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.289 
why I think free-to-play is ruining the
quality<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.469> our<00:00:13.710> games<00:00:14.009> today<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.700> while<00:00:15.179> the

quality of our games today and while the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.599 
quality of our games today and while the
last<00:00:15.509> episode<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:16.049> geared<00:00:16.379> kind<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.070> toward

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
last episode was geared kind of toward

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.939 
last episode was geared kind of toward
this<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.750> topic<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.619> geared

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
this this topic it was geared

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.380 
this this topic it was geared
specifically<00:00:20.430> towards<00:00:20.789> unlocks<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
specifically towards unlocks and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.870 
specifically towards unlocks and
achievements<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.680> don't<00:00:23.340> feel<00:00:23.550> like<00:00:23.760> I

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
achievements but I don't feel like I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.609 
achievements but I don't feel like I
expressed<00:00:24.359> things<00:00:24.600> as<00:00:24.779> well<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.230> could<00:00:25.439> have

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
expressed things as well as I could have

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
expressed things as well as I could have
so<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.130> essentially<00:00:26.460> my<00:00:26.699> second<00:00:27.060> shot<00:00:27.240> at

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so this is essentially my second shot at

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.810 
so this is essentially my second shot at
it<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:28.170> there<00:00:28.500> are<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> good<00:00:29.699> things

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it now there are a lot of good things

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
it now there are a lot of good things
that<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.179> come<00:00:30.330> from<00:00:30.359> games<00:00:31.199> being<00:00:31.470> free<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
that can come from games being free to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.950 
that can come from games being free to
play<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.309> mean<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> lowers<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> barrier<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
play I mean it lowers the barrier of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.870 
play I mean it lowers the barrier of
entry<00:00:34.079> meaning<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.040> more<00:00:35.100> people<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.610> play

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
entry meaning that more people can play

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040 
entry meaning that more people can play
the<00:00:36.090> game<00:00:36.239> regardless<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.899> their<00:00:36.989> financial

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the game regardless of their financial

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040 
the game regardless of their financial
situation<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.730> lets<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> try<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> game

let's<00:03:35.849> say<00:03:36.000> you're<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> subscription-based

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
let's say you're a subscription-based

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.069 
let's say you're a subscription-based
game<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.680> only<00:03:37.880> 20,000<00:03:38.880> players<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.750> your

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
game with only 20,000 players so your

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.229 
game with only 20,000 players so your
player<00:03:40.349> base<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.829> going<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.700> be<00:03:41.819> for<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
player base is going to be for the

player base is going to be for the
purposes<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:42.900> demonstration<00:03:43.109> twenty

player<00:03:46.079> base<00:03:46.290> would<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.500> now<00:03:47.280> let's<00:03:47.489> say<00:03:47.639> that

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
player base would be now let's say that

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.159 
player base would be now let's say that
one<00:03:48.180> hundred<00:03:48.329> percent<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.720> those<00:03:48.810> people<00:03:49.109> are

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
one hundred percent of those people are

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.960 
one hundred percent of those people are
paying<00:03:49.319> ten<00:03:49.650> bucks<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:50.010> month<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.760> hundred

paying ten bucks a month and one hundred

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.250 
paying ten bucks a month and one hundred
percent<00:03:51.000> obviously<00:03:51.569> because<00:03:51.870> if<00:03:52.019> it's<00:03:52.169> a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
percent obviously because if it's a

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.500 
percent obviously because if it's a
subscription-based<00:03:52.980> game<00:03:53.459> they<00:03:54.150> are<00:03:54.180> all

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
subscription-based game they are all

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.270 
subscription-based game they are all
going<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.810> be<00:03:54.870> paying<00:03:55.109> for<00:03:55.169> it<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:55.980> let's<00:03:56.250> say

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
going to be paying for it so let's say

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.009 
going to be paying for it so let's say
that<00:03:56.370> they're<00:03:56.579> paying<00:03:56.760> ten<00:03:56.970> bucks<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.239> month<00:03:57.359> so

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
that they're paying ten bucks a month so

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.729 
that they're paying ten bucks a month so
20,000<00:03:58.799> times<00:03:59.150> 120<00:04:00.150> bucks<00:04:00.419> because<00:04:01.049> 10<00:04:01.530> bucks

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
20,000 times 120 bucks because 10 bucks

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.140 
20,000 times 120 bucks because 10 bucks
a<00:04:01.829> month<00:04:01.980> 12<00:04:02.760> months<00:04:03.030> out<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.239> year<00:04:03.450> is

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
a month 12 months out of the year is

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.059 
a month 12 months out of the year is
2,400,000<00:04:06.379> so<00:04:07.379> even<00:04:07.680> though<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.829> have<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
2,400,000 so even though you have a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.099 
2,400,000 so even though you have a
smaller<00:04:08.669> community<00:04:09.000> you're<00:04:09.629> still<00:04:09.900> making

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
smaller community you're still making

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.020 
smaller community you're still making
more<00:04:10.590> money<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.040> these<00:04:11.370> are<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:11.940> know

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
more money and these are just you know

more money and these are just you know
made<00:04:12.209> up<00:04:12.329> numbers<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.019> but<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
made up numbers and but that's the the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.890 
made up numbers and but that's the the
general<00:04:14.790> scheme<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.209> things<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.599> that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
general scheme of things is that

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.199

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
more quickly or instead of spending

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.740 
more quickly or instead of spending
money<00:06:25.990> you<00:06:26.320> spend<00:06:26.800> more<00:06:27.070> time<00:06:27.339> and<00:06:27.729> the<00:06:28.630> last

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
money you spend more time and the last

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.980 
money you spend more time and the last
option<00:06:29.080> is<00:06:29.500> that<00:06:29.800> you<00:06:30.190> are<00:06:30.639> really<00:06:31.479> casual<00:06:31.870> and

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
option is that you are really casual and

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.879 
option is that you are really casual and
you<00:06:32.110> just<00:06:32.260> don't<00:06:32.440> care<00:06:32.560> about

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
you just don't care about

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.459 
you just don't care about
the<00:06:33.189> game<00:06:33.340> either<00:06:33.580> way<00:06:33.819> so<00:06:34.719> really<00:06:35.110> think

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469 
the game either way so really think

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:37.800 
the game either way so really think
about<00:06:35.620> that<00:06:35.770> for<00:06:36.099> a<00:06:36.159> second<00:06:36.490> you<00:06:37.270> have<00:06:37.539> players

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
about that for a second you have players

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.420 
about that for a second you have players
who<00:06:38.050> are<00:06:38.169> trying<00:06:38.409> to<00:06:38.530> get<00:06:38.620> a<00:06:38.680> leg<00:06:38.919> up<00:06:38.949> on<00:06:39.189> other

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
who are trying to get a leg up on other

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.450 
who are trying to get a leg up on other
players<00:06:39.669> by<00:06:39.969> paying<00:06:40.360> cash<00:06:40.960> or<00:06:41.349> players<00:06:42.249> who

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
players by paying cash or players who

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.309 
players by paying cash or players who
care<00:06:42.939> about<00:06:43.240> and<00:06:43.569> enjoy<00:06:43.719> the<00:06:43.990> game<00:06:44.139> but

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
care about and enjoy the game but

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.379 
care about and enjoy the game but
they're<00:06:44.469> not<00:06:44.680> paying<00:06:45.039> and<00:06:45.279> then<00:06:45.849> players<00:06:46.150> you

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
they're not paying and then players you

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.330 
they're not paying and then players you
don't<00:06:46.599> really<00:06:46.719> care<00:06:46.960> either<00:06:46.990> way<00:06:47.169> so<00:06:48.009> who<00:06:48.279> do

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
don't really care either way so who do

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.649 
don't really care either way so who do
you<00:06:48.430> think<00:06:48.639> that<00:06:48.789> the<00:06:48.969> devs<00:06:49.210> are<00:06:49.389> going<00:06:49.599> to

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:49.659 
you think that the devs are going to

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.480 
you think that the devs are going to
listen<00:06:49.810> to<00:06:49.930> when<00:06:50.169> it<00:06:50.259> comes<00:06:50.409> to<00:06:50.560> feedback<00:06:50.860> who

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
listen to when it comes to feedback who

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.619 
listen to when it comes to feedback who
do<00:06:51.550> you<00:06:51.610> think<00:06:51.789> they're<00:06:51.909> going<00:06:52.090> to<00:06:52.330> try<00:06:52.569> to

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:52.629 
do you think they're going to try to
