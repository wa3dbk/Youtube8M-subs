00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.410 
pleasant to eat but then how do you know
you<00:02:02.230> know<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:02.800> heard<00:02:03.190> once<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:04.150> just

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
you know so I heard once that you just

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.070 
you know so I heard once that you just
take<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.870> and<00:02:05.020> where<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.530> naturally<00:02:05.800> snaps<00:02:07.080> is

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
take it and where it naturally snaps is

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.530 
take it and where it naturally snaps is
where<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.649> actual<00:02:09.040> string<00:02:09.460> eNOS<00:02:09.760> starts<00:02:10.210> so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
where the actual string eNOS starts so

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.650 
where the actual string eNOS starts so
that's<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.990> really<00:02:11.020> long<00:02:11.470> journey<00:02:12.370> Sam<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.510> then

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that's a really long journey Sam so then

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.530 
that's a really long journey Sam so then
you<00:02:13.810> would<00:02:13.960> just<00:02:14.170> put<00:02:14.680> all<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.270> level<00:02:16.270> out<00:02:16.390> all

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
you would just put all the level out all

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.810 
you would just put all the level out all
the<00:02:16.690> tips<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.110> cut<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.100> rest<00:02:18.310> right<00:02:18.550> there

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the tips and cut the rest right there

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.210 
the tips and cut the rest right there
let's<00:02:19.660> see<00:02:19.870> if<00:02:19.990> that's<00:02:20.200> accurate<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:21.010> actually

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
let's see if that's accurate it actually

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.680 
let's see if that's accurate it actually
is<00:02:21.660> okay<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.010> makes<00:02:24.730> them<00:02:24.940> pretty<00:02:25.300> short

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
is okay so that makes them pretty short

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.160 
is okay so that makes them pretty short
in<00:02:25.960> comparison<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.650> how<00:02:26.740> they<00:02:26.890> looked<00:02:27.130> before

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
in comparison to how they looked before

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.570 
in comparison to how they looked before
what<00:02:29.170> that's<00:02:29.410> all<00:02:29.590> right<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:30.280> don't<00:02:30.430> want

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
what that's all right you don't want

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.140 
what that's all right you don't want
stringing<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:33.070> I'm<00:02:33.459> just<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.940> cut

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
stringing it and I'm just going to cut

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.380 
stringing it and I'm just going to cut
these<00:02:34.330> one<00:02:34.720> time<00:02:34.990> in<00:02:35.170> half<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.709> they'll<00:02:35.890> be

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
these one time in half so they'll be

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.750 
these one time in half so they'll be
like<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:38.170> long<00:02:38.470> throughout<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.070> pasta<00:02:39.520> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
like this long throughout the pasta and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:49.380 
like this long throughout the pasta and
that's<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.170> little<00:02:41.590> bit

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.690 

I'm<00:03:14.660> lowering<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.260> heat<00:03:15.470> some<00:03:15.800> so<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.340> they
