Robin<00:05:56.030> you<00:05:56.270> agree

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.430 

what<00:05:59.670> also<00:05:59.850> happens<00:06:00.390> is<00:06:00.540> when<00:06:00.780> everybody<00:06:01.230> has

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
what also happens is when everybody has

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.780 
what also happens is when everybody has
slow<00:06:01.680> music<00:06:01.890> I<00:06:02.070> think<00:06:02.280> or<00:06:02.370> they've<00:06:02.490> got<00:06:02.610> so

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
slow music I think or they've got so

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.730 
slow music I think or they've got so
much<00:06:02.910> more<00:06:03.120> time<00:06:03.390> it's<00:06:03.600> so<00:06:03.690> easy<00:06:03.870> you<00:06:04.110> are<00:06:04.440> so

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
much more time it's so easy you are so

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.010 
much more time it's so easy you are so
exposed<00:06:05.390> technically<00:06:06.390> because<00:06:06.570> everything

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
exposed technically because everything

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.570 
exposed technically because everything
has<00:06:07.170> to<00:06:07.260> take<00:06:07.470> longer<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.950> edges<00:06:08.250> have<00:06:08.400> to<00:06:08.490> be

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
has to take longer the edges have to be

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.640 
has to take longer the edges have to be
longer<00:06:08.790> so<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.240> started<00:06:09.870> out<00:06:10.020> at<00:06:10.200> a<00:06:10.290> four<00:06:10.530> and

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
longer so I started out at a four and

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.720 
longer so I started out at a four and
then<00:06:10.800> there<00:06:10.920> are<00:06:10.950> a<00:06:11.010> few<00:06:11.130> little<00:06:11.400> moments

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
then there are a few little moments

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.950 
then there are a few little moments
where<00:06:11.760> it<00:06:11.880> just<00:06:12.030> got<00:06:12.180> a<00:06:12.210> little<00:06:12.420> tense<00:06:12.660> a<00:06:12.810> bit

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
where it just got a little tense a bit

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.320 
where it just got a little tense a bit
tight<00:06:13.200> but<00:06:13.440> I<00:06:13.830> think<00:06:14.100> you<00:06:14.190> know<00:06:14.330> everybody

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330
