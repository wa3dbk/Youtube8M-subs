00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
now before putting the copper plate in

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.630 
now before putting the copper plate in
place<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:56.049> take<00:01:57.049> my<00:01:57.470> x-acto<00:01:57.830> knife<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.490> make

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
place I take my x-acto knife and make

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.969 
place I take my x-acto knife and make
sure<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.000> remove<00:01:59.330> any<00:01:59.540> excess<00:02:00.050> glue<00:02:00.619> and

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
sure and remove any excess glue and

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.230

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
paint that was in place because it could

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.859 
paint that was in place because it could
easily<00:02:05.479> create<00:02:05.900> a<00:02:05.990> little<00:02:06.259> bump<00:02:07.420> or<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.450> place

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
easily create a little bump or a place

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.229 
easily create a little bump or a place
where<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.170> doesn't<00:02:09.200> join<00:02:09.739> up<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.239> perfectly

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
where it doesn't join up to perfectly

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.570 
where it doesn't join up to perfectly
with<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.170> edge<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.770> other<00:02:12.890> copper<00:02:13.340> plates

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
with the edge of the other copper plates

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.570 
with the edge of the other copper plates
and<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:14.750> edge<00:02:14.930> here<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.890> scrape<00:02:16.280> away<00:02:16.550> a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
and this edge here so I scrape away a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.890 
and this edge here so I scrape away a
little<00:02:16.790> bit<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.150> paint<00:02:17.450> glue<00:02:17.720> before

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
little bit of a paint glue before

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.949 
little bit of a paint glue before
putting<00:02:18.319> in<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.580> next<00:02:19.580> plate<00:02:19.819> now<00:02:20.660> what<00:02:20.870> I'm

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
putting in the next plate now what I'm

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.650 
putting in the next plate now what I'm
doing<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.380> using<00:02:21.440> an<00:02:21.830> exacto<00:02:22.430> knife<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.480> real

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
doing is using an exacto knife the real

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.300 
doing is using an exacto knife the real
fine<00:02:23.930> tip<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.830> can<00:02:25.010> get<00:02:25.160> that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
fine tip of it so that I can get that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.490 
fine tip of it so that I can get that
copper<00:02:25.760> plate<00:02:25.970> right<00:02:26.360> smack<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:26.989> against<00:02:27.320> the

that<00:02:45.420> touches<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.079> copper<00:02:46.469> plate<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
that touches that copper plate on the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.199 
that touches that copper plate on the
wood<00:02:47.099> it's<00:02:47.250> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.579> glued<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.969> place

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
wood it's going to be glued in place

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.199 
wood it's going to be glued in place
there<00:02:48.599> it<00:02:48.689> is<00:02:48.859> then<00:02:49.859> I'm<00:02:50.010> using<00:02:50.219> a<00:02:50.519> flat<00:02:50.879> edge

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
there it is then I'm using a flat edge

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.050 
there it is then I'm using a flat edge
dental<00:02:51.689> tool<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.980> squish<00:02:53.340> out<00:02:53.579> any<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
dental tool to squish out any of the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.149 
dental tool to squish out any of the
glue<00:02:54.299> that's<00:02:54.450> underneath<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.470> copper<00:02:55.890> plate

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
glue that's underneath this copper plate

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.729 
glue that's underneath this copper plate
and<00:02:59.329> I'll<00:03:00.329> take<00:03:00.629> important<00:03:01.109> one<00:03:01.260> tiny<00:03:01.530> other

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
and I'll take important one tiny other

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.089 
and I'll take important one tiny other
dab<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.639> glue<00:03:02.760> between<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.739> last

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
dab of glue between it and the last

copper plated capillary action if

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.250 
copper plated capillary action if
there's<00:03:08.250> any<00:03:08.400> gap<00:03:08.700> will<00:03:09.060> simply<00:03:09.480> suck<00:03:09.780> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
there's any gap will simply suck that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.710 
there's any gap will simply suck that
glue<00:03:10.530> just<00:03:10.859> like<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.220> right<00:03:11.430> there<00:03:11.720> in

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
glue just like that right there in

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.929 
glue just like that right there in
between<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.669> two<00:03:14.669> carbon<00:03:15.090> plate<00:03:16.700> now<00:03:17.700> if<00:03:17.819> you

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
between the two carbon plate now if you

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.309 
between the two carbon plate now if you
notice<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:18.629> going<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:18.900> an<00:03:18.989> accumulation

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
notice it's going to be an accumulation

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.890 
notice it's going to be an accumulation
of<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.459> little<00:03:20.730> bit<00:03:20.849> of<00:03:20.939> excess<00:03:21.359> glue<00:03:21.659> and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
of a little bit of excess glue and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.349 
of a little bit of excess glue and
fingerprints<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.519> once<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.180> hull

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
fingerprints on this and once the hull

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.390 
fingerprints on this and once the hull
is<00:03:24.540> completely<00:03:25.019> copper<00:03:25.290> plated<00:03:25.799> I'll<00:03:26.099> take<00:03:26.370> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
is completely copper plated I'll take a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.879 
is completely copper plated I'll take a
dremel<00:03:26.939> tool<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.599> wire<00:03:27.810> brush<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.470> go

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
dremel tool and a wire brush and go

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.039 
dremel tool and a wire brush and go
along<00:03:29.159> and<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.519> lightly<00:03:29.790> rub<00:03:30.150> across<00:03:30.299> these

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
along and just lightly rub across these

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.780 
along and just lightly rub across these
copper<00:03:31.349> plates<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.859> I'll<00:03:31.919> instantly<00:03:32.459> remove

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
copper plates and I'll instantly remove

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.990 
copper plates and I'll instantly remove
any<00:03:33.389> of<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.720> dirty<00:03:34.650> filth<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.579> it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
any of that dirty filth and so on it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.210 
any of that dirty filth and so on it
actually<00:03:36.389> removes<00:03:36.989> all<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.560> oxidization

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
actually removes all of the oxidization

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.009 
actually removes all of the oxidization
that<00:03:38.549> occurs<00:03:38.879> on<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.090> conflicts<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.870> were

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
that occurs on the conflicts that were

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.080 
that occurs on the conflicts that were
installed<00:03:40.440> well<00:03:41.159> maybe<00:03:41.489> two<00:03:41.790> or<00:03:41.909> three<00:03:41.940> weeks

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
installed well maybe two or three weeks

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.670 
installed well maybe two or three weeks
ago<00:03:42.419> you<00:03:42.569> can<00:03:42.780> already<00:03:42.930> see<00:03:43.139> that<00:03:43.169> they<00:03:43.409> start

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
ago you can already see that they start

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.880 
ago you can already see that they start
to<00:03:43.709> change

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.179 

so<00:03:46.890> there's<00:03:47.489> about<00:03:48.650> 1400<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.680> these<00:03:49.829> copper

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
so there's about 1400 of these copper

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.770 
so there's about 1400 of these copper
plates<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.730> seems<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.180> didn't<00:03:51.540> think<00:03:51.599> that

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
plates it seems like I didn't think that

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.449 
plates it seems like I didn't think that
we're<00:03:51.930> gonna<00:03:52.019> be<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.319> many<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:53.099> this<00:03:53.220> hall

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
we're gonna be that many for this hall

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.009 
we're gonna be that many for this hall
of<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.670> Flying<00:03:54.629> Cloud<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.409> 196<00:03:56.099> scale

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
of the Flying Cloud this is a 196 scale

00:03:57.019 --> 00:05:47.290 
of the Flying Cloud this is a 196 scale
ship<00:03:58.019> all<00:03:58.290> about<00:03:58.530> three<00:03:58.799> foot<00:03:59.010> long<00:04:00.110> so

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.680 

all<00:05:47.960> right<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:48.440> that's<00:05:48.590> how<00:05:48.830> I<00:05:48.860> do<00:05:49.370> the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
all right so that's how I do the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.510 
all right so that's how I do the
close-up<00:05:50.740> that's<00:05:51.740> how<00:05:51.830> I<00:05:51.890> attach<00:05:52.280> to<00:05:52.430> the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
close-up that's how I attach to the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.980 
close-up that's how I attach to the
copper<00:05:52.760> plates<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.390> whole<00:05:53.540> of<00:05:53.690> Flying

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
copper plates to the whole of Flying

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.770 
copper plates to the whole of Flying
Cloud<00:05:54.430> as<00:05:55.430> I<00:05:55.580> mentioned<00:05:55.910> it<00:05:55.970> was<00:05:56.030> about<00:05:56.240> 1200

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
Cloud as I mentioned it was about 1200

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.060 
Cloud as I mentioned it was about 1200
copper<00:05:57.050> plates<00:05:57.290> of<00:05:57.440> total<00:05:57.710> that<00:05:57.770> are<00:05:57.890> going<00:05:58.010> to

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
copper plates of total that are going to

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.400 
copper plates of total that are going to
be<00:05:58.160> installed<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.420> I'm<00:05:59.810> a<00:05:59.840> little<00:06:00.140> past

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
be installed and I'm a little past

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.160 
be installed and I'm a little past
halfway<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.010> there's<00:06:01.460> probably<00:06:01.610> another<00:06:02.170> 350

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
halfway so there's probably another 350

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.390 
halfway so there's probably another 350
400<00:06:03.590> to<00:06:03.650> go

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
400 to go

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.920 
400 to go
just<00:06:04.880> start<00:06:05.060> up<00:06:05.150> another<00:06:05.300> line<00:06:05.600> there<00:06:05.870> and

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
just start up another line there and

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.240 
just start up another line there and
when<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:08.960> finish<00:06:09.350> this<00:06:09.500> I'll<00:06:09.650> post<00:06:09.860> one<00:06:10.100> more

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
when I finish this I'll post one more

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.760 
when I finish this I'll post one more
video<00:06:10.490> of<00:06:10.930> copper<00:06:11.930> plating<00:06:12.320> called<00:06:12.590> once

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
video of copper plating called once

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.680 
video of copper plating called once
she's<00:06:12.980> complete<00:06:13.490> in<00:06:13.880> about<00:06:13.970> another<00:06:14.180> week<00:06:14.360> or

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
she's complete in about another week or

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.870 
she's complete in about another week or
so<00:06:14.870> and<00:06:15.650> I'll<00:06:15.860> shine<00:06:16.160> it<00:06:16.370> up

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
so and I'll shine it up

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.580 
so and I'll shine it up
I'll<00:06:17.300> show<00:06:17.510> you<00:06:17.720> show<00:06:17.870> you<00:06:17.930> how<00:06:18.110> I<00:06:18.140> do<00:06:18.290> this

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
I'll show you show you how I do this

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.680 
I'll show you show you how I do this
with<00:06:19.160> the<00:06:19.280> dremel<00:06:19.610> tool<00:06:19.820> and<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.180> wire<00:06:20.360> brush

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
with the dremel tool and the wire brush

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.470 
with the dremel tool and the wire brush
and<00:06:20.930> the<00:06:21.620> whole<00:06:21.980> look<00:06:22.190> really<00:06:22.550> shiny<00:06:22.820> but

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
and the whole look really shiny but

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.760 
and the whole look really shiny but
actually<00:06:23.780> that'll<00:06:23.990> be<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.170> last<00:06:24.320> time<00:06:24.620> you

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
actually that'll be the last time you
