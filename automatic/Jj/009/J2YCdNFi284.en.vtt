the situation going on

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.680 
the situation going on
it<00:00:37.320> looks<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.700> Hades<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.059> some<00:00:39.210> kind<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> like

it looks like Hades is some kind of like
castle<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.260> guess<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> center<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> cube

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
castle I guess in the center of the cube

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.760 
castle I guess in the center of the cube
and<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.540> an<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.780> shot<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> demon

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and then we get an out shot at the demon

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
and then we get an out shot at the demon
cube<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.280> looks<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.000> destroying

Magnolia you see it destroy at the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.130 
Magnolia you see it destroy at the
Cathedral<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.780> goes<00:00:48.960> on

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
looks like Lucy can hear that so I'm not
sure<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.949> her<00:00:56.070> position<00:00:56.219> in

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
sure if it's because of her position in

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.349 
sure if it's because of her position in
Hades<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.260> why<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> also<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.940> cube<00:01:00.210> is

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
this because I saw all the water and I

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.180 
this because I saw all the water and I
think<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.260> lot<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.410> people<00:05:32.590> did<00:05:32.710> this<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.980> their

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
think a lot of people did this to their

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.930 
think a lot of people did this to their
like<00:05:33.310> their<00:05:33.490> first<00:05:33.730> thought<00:05:33.940> was<00:05:34.320> water

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
like their first thought was water

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.090 
like their first thought was water

hope that someone gets Lucy out of the

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.150 
hope that someone gets Lucy out of the
water<00:06:37.419> though<00:06:37.680> because<00:06:38.680> right<00:06:38.890> now<00:06:39.010> I<00:06:39.040> think

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
water though because right now I think

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.990 
water though because right now I think
she's<00:06:39.400> still<00:06:39.640> in

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
she's still in

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.690 
she's still in
the<00:06:40.090> water<00:06:40.270> and<00:06:40.620> if<00:06:41.620> Aquarius<00:06:42.070> uses<00:06:42.580> that

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
the water and if Aquarius uses that

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.880 
the water and if Aquarius uses that
water<00:06:42.940> and<00:06:43.150> fights<00:06:43.450> not<00:06:44.110> only<00:06:44.380> is<00:06:44.470> it<00:06:44.500> going<00:06:44.740> to

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
water and fights not only is it going to

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.560 
water and fights not only is it going to
be<00:06:45.010> stressful<00:06:45.280> for<00:06:45.550> Lucy<00:06:45.850> who's<00:06:46.060> like<00:06:46.270> pretty

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
be stressful for Lucy who's like pretty

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.060 
be stressful for Lucy who's like pretty
much<00:06:46.630> passed<00:06:46.960> out<00:06:47.110> but<00:06:47.350> Lucy<00:06:47.650> could<00:06:47.770> possibly

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
much passed out but Lucy could possibly

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.100 
much passed out but Lucy could possibly
drown<00:06:48.400> so<00:06:48.610> somebody<00:06:48.970> needs<00:06:49.330> to<00:06:49.480> get<00:06:49.720> her<00:06:49.870> out

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
killed her the strain isn't going to

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.110 
killed her the strain isn't going to
kill<00:07:00.460> her<00:07:00.640> but<00:07:01.000> she<00:07:01.870> is<00:07:02.200> probably<00:07:03.160> going<00:07:03.670> to<00:07:03.910> be

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
kill her but she is probably going to be

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.170 
kill her but she is probably going to be
like<00:07:04.420> very<00:07:04.690> very<00:07:05.470> useless<00:07:06.250> after<00:07:06.730> this<00:07:06.940> fight

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
like very very useless after this fight

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.270 
like very very useless after this fight
which<00:07:07.510> is<00:07:07.540> again<00:07:07.960> why<00:07:08.260> I<00:07:08.290> think<00:07:08.710> other<00:07:08.920> people

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
which is again why I think other people

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.760 
which is again why I think other people
are<00:07:09.400> going<00:07:09.520> to<00:07:09.730> have<00:07:09.910> to<00:07:10.090> come<00:07:10.270> and<00:07:10.600> that<00:07:11.500> are

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
are going to have to come and that are

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.380 
are going to have to come and that are
this<00:07:11.890> fight<00:07:12.160> alone<00:07:12.520> will<00:07:12.910> be<00:07:13.030> what<00:07:13.180> frees

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
this fight alone will be what frees

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.520 
this fight alone will be what frees
Fairy<00:07:13.660> Tail<00:07:14.520> but<00:07:15.520> I<00:07:15.820> am<00:07:16.210> super<00:07:16.870> super<00:07:17.080> super

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
Fairy Tail but I am super super super

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.740 
Fairy Tail but I am super super super
super<00:07:17.560> excited<00:07:18.160> to<00:07:18.280> see<00:07:18.430> Aquarius<00:07:18.880> fight<00:07:19.150> at

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750 
super excited to see Aquarius fight at

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.540 
super excited to see Aquarius fight at
full<00:07:20.020> strength<00:07:20.290> and<00:07:20.530> I'm<00:07:20.620> just<00:07:21.010> glad<00:07:21.190> that<00:07:21.250> she

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
full strength and I'm just glad that she

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.800 
full strength and I'm just glad that she
didn't<00:07:21.760> come<00:07:21.910> in<00:07:21.940> at<00:07:22.150> the<00:07:22.240> very<00:07:22.360> beginning

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
didn't come in at the very beginning

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.540 
didn't come in at the very beginning
because<00:07:22.900> also<00:07:23.560> that<00:07:23.830> makes<00:07:23.980> sense<00:07:24.220> because

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
because also that makes sense because

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.860 
because also that makes sense because
she<00:07:24.669> never<00:07:24.790> knows<00:07:25.030> what<00:07:25.180> Aquarius<00:07:25.540> is<00:07:25.630> going

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
she never knows what Aquarius is going

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.570 
she never knows what Aquarius is going
to<00:07:25.960> do<00:07:26.110> she<00:07:26.590> has<00:07:26.680> to<00:07:26.770> conserve<00:07:27.070> as<00:07:27.190> much<00:07:27.400> magic

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.580 
to do she has to conserve as much magic

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.730 
to do she has to conserve as much magic
as<00:07:27.820> she<00:07:28.000> can<00:07:28.180> and<00:07:28.330> Aquarius<00:07:28.720> uses<00:07:29.050> a<00:07:29.200> lot<00:07:29.560> of

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
as she can and Aquarius uses a lot of

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.650 
as she can and Aquarius uses a lot of
magic<00:07:30.160> and<00:07:30.400> if<00:07:30.910> she<00:07:31.030> doesn't<00:07:31.300> know<00:07:31.450> that

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
magic and if she doesn't know that

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.790 
magic and if she doesn't know that
aquaria<00:07:32.020> whether<00:07:32.200> or<00:07:32.290> not<00:07:32.350> Aquarius<00:07:32.710> is

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
aquaria whether or not Aquarius is

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.140 
aquaria whether or not Aquarius is
actually<00:07:33.130> going<00:07:33.250> to<00:07:33.430> fight<00:07:33.610> for<00:07:33.820> her<00:07:33.880> one<00:07:34.030> way

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 
actually going to fight for her one way

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.730 
actually going to fight for her one way
or<00:07:34.270> the<00:07:34.330> other<00:07:34.360> why<00:07:34.600> would<00:07:34.780> she<00:07:34.870> summon<00:07:35.140> it<00:07:35.230> but

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:35.740 
or the other why would she summon it but

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.230 
or the other why would she summon it but
this<00:07:35.890> is<00:07:36.070> a<00:07:36.100> last-ditch<00:07:36.460> effort<00:07:36.730> and<00:07:37.060> she

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
this is a last-ditch effort and she

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.760 
this is a last-ditch effort and she
needs<00:07:37.419> Aquarius<00:07:37.780> to<00:07:37.870> fight<00:07:38.050> for<00:07:38.230> and<00:07:38.500> it<00:07:38.620> looks

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
needs Aquarius to fight for and it looks

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.620 
needs Aquarius to fight for and it looks
like<00:07:38.830> Aquarius<00:07:39.280> days<00:07:39.400> and<00:07:39.669> I'm<00:07:39.730> so<00:07:40.090> so<00:07:40.600> excited

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:40.630 
like Aquarius days and I'm so so excited

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.380 
like Aquarius days and I'm so so excited
because<00:07:41.500> we<00:07:41.710> have<00:07:41.760> Loki<00:07:42.760> out<00:07:42.910> there<00:07:43.090> fighting

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970 
excited about it because I think a lot

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.250 
excited about it because I think a lot
of<00:07:52.270> people<00:07:52.450> have<00:07:52.540> been<00:07:52.630> waiting<00:07:52.750> to<00:07:52.990> see<00:07:53.110> what

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:55.570 
Aquarius can really do because I think

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.940 
Aquarius can really do because I think
the<00:07:55.720> most<00:07:55.930> we've<00:07:56.050> ever<00:07:56.110> seen<00:07:56.590> her<00:07:56.770> like

the most we've ever seen her like
