pronunciation quick bass in my using the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.720 
pronunciation quick bass in my using the
polygon<00:00:10.050> primatives<00:00:10.559> ok<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.340> made<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.550> basic

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
polygon primatives ok we made a basic

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.049 
polygon primatives ok we made a basic
cylinder<00:00:12.179> just<00:00:13.170> use<00:00:13.290> basic<00:00:13.740> basic<00:00:14.460> extrusion

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
cylinder just use basic basic extrusion

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.990 
cylinder just use basic basic extrusion
scale<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> move<00:00:16.289> tools<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.699> make<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
scale and move tools just to make the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.970 
scale and move tools just to make the
outline<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.480> shape<00:00:18.510> okay<00:00:18.900> now<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:19.920> time

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
outline of the shape okay now this time

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.470 
outline of the shape okay now this time
we're<00:00:20.400> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> try<00:00:20.699> some<00:00:20.880> definite<00:00:21.390> we're

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
we're going to try some definite we're

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.269 
we're going to try some definite we're
going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.660> use<00:00:21.779> what's<00:00:22.320> called<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> CV<00:00:23.039> curve

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
going to use what's called the CV curve

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.599 
going to use what's called the CV curve
tool<00:00:23.869> okay<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.199> now<00:00:25.650> we're<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> use<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
tool okay and now we're going to use a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
tool okay and now we're going to use a
surface<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:30.000> take<00:00:30.269> our<00:00:30.390> curve<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> rotate<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
surface to take our curve and rotate it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.130 
surface to take our curve and rotate it
around<00:00:32.250> make<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> surface<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.660> curve<00:00:34.040> now

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
around make a surface of that curve now

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.340 
around make a surface of that curve now
in<00:00:37.140> Maya<00:00:38.420> most<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.570> time<00:00:39.690> we'll<00:00:39.840> start<00:00:40.079> open

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
in Maya most of time we'll start open

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.330 
in Maya most of time we'll start open

point okay so we will do that for the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.540 
point okay so we will do that for the
first<00:02:11.320> point<00:02:13.080> okay<00:02:14.190> they're<00:02:15.190> all<00:02:15.250> we're<00:02:15.460> going

to do is every time we click it puts a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.330 
to do is every time we click it puts a
point<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:18.970> place<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.650> you'll<00:02:20.920> notice<00:02:21.130> when

you have two or three points together

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.960 
you have two or three points together
you'll<00:02:23.410> notice<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.800> white<00:02:24.010> line<00:02:24.250> starts<00:02:24.670> appear

you'll notice a white line starts appear
and<00:02:25.150> that's<00:02:25.330> your<00:02:25.480> actual<00:02:25.720> curve<00:02:26.430> okay<00:02:27.430> so

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
and that's your actual curve okay so

points the same as before we're going to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.340 
points the same as before we're going to
do<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> little<00:02:33.880> small<00:02:34.210> curve<00:02:34.510> here<00:02:34.780> come<00:02:35.110> up<00:02:35.230> to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
do a little small curve here come up to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.330

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
we're going to have slightly more points

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
we're going to have slightly more points
same<00:02:49.300> way<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.480> had<00:02:49.660> slightly<00:02:49.959> more<00:02:50.200> polygons<00:02:50.680> in

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
same way I had slightly more polygons in

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.920 
same way I had slightly more polygons in
the<00:02:51.400> last<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.880> at<00:02:52.060> certain<00:02:52.360> sections

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
the last one at certain sections

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.229 
the last one at certain sections
we're<00:02:53.620> slightly<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.340> points<00:02:54.670> there<00:02:55.860> okay

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.300 

now<00:03:01.239> we're<00:03:01.390> going<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:02.640> cut<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> points<00:03:05.310> for

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
now we're going to cut on the points for

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.800 
now we're going to cut on the points for
the<00:03:06.640> inside<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:09.550> same<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.150> before<00:03:10.300> I'm<00:03:10.660> not

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
the inside the same as before I'm not

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.360 
the inside the same as before I'm not
actually<00:03:10.989> going<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.319> be<00:03:11.380> as<00:03:11.500> accurate<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:12.040> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
actually going to be as accurate on the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.770 
actually going to be as accurate on the
inside<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:15.430> then<00:03:15.610> our<00:03:15.820> last<00:03:16.030> points<00:03:16.540> same

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
inside and then our last points same

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.220 
inside and then our last points same
again<00:03:17.080> hold<00:03:17.560> down<00:03:17.739> X<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:19.120> your<00:03:19.239> keyboard<00:03:19.300> click

so if we go back make sure you're an
object<00:03:30.420> mode<00:03:31.069> we<00:03:32.069> come<00:03:32.250> back<00:03:32.610> tomorrow<00:03:32.790> this

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
object mode we come back tomorrow this

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.500 
object mode we come back tomorrow this

perspective view all we've done there is

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:46.880 
perspective view all we've done there is
just<00:03:39.000> drawed<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:41.810> curve<00:03:43.220> okay<00:03:45.709> now<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> want<00:03:46.860> to

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
just drawed a curve okay now I want to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.899 
just drawed a curve okay now I want to
move<00:03:47.099> this<00:03:47.220> up<00:03:47.400> just<00:03:47.909> so<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:48.180> above<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.629> grid

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
move this up just so it's above the grid

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.039 
move this up just so it's above the grid
you'll<00:03:50.909> also<00:03:51.150> turn<00:03:51.360> off<00:03:51.390> your<00:03:51.659> grid<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:51.959> you

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
you'll also turn off your grid if you

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.949 
you'll also turn off your grid if you
want<00:03:52.260> but<00:03:52.409> we'll<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:53.280> move<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.640> up<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.870> what

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.150 
go this light green color we just want
to<00:04:26.190> click<00:04:26.310> surfaces<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:28.039> revolve<00:04:29.039> okay<00:04:31.160> what

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
to click surfaces and revolve okay what

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.190 
to click surfaces and revolve okay what
that<00:04:32.340> does<00:04:32.550> is<00:04:32.729> just<00:04:33.300> takes<00:04:33.539> it<00:04:33.720> as<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.870> said

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
that does is just takes it as I said

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.370 
that does is just takes it as I said
revolves<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.950> run<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:36.570> top<00:04:36.810> five<00:04:37.110> on<00:04:37.349> your

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
revolves it run the top five on your

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.440 
revolves it run the top five on your
keyboard

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
keyboard

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.860 
keyboard
bring<00:04:39.450> your<00:04:39.630> shaded<00:04:40.200> view<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:41.599> see<00:04:42.599> all<00:04:42.720> it's

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
bring your shaded view I see all it's

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.210 
bring your shaded view I see all it's
done<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.020> it's<00:04:43.289> taking<00:04:43.590> our<00:04:43.680> curve<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.190> just

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
done is it's taking our curve and just

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.700 
done is it's taking our curve and just
revolved<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.030> right<00:04:49.310> okay

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
revolved it right okay

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.970 
revolved it right okay
savers<00:04:52.430> everything<00:04:52.730> you've<00:04:52.880> got<00:04:53.500> set<00:04:54.500> options

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
savers everything you've got set options

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.090 
savers everything you've got set options
say<00:04:55.970> when<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.210> do<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.389> babble<00:04:57.260> or<00:04:57.560> an<00:04:57.770> extrusion

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
say when you do a babble or an extrusion

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.770 
say when you do a babble or an extrusion
get<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.700> set<00:04:58.970> options<00:04:59.389> a<00:04:59.510> coma<00:04:59.750> with<00:04:59.930> us<00:05:00.050> revolve

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
get a set options a coma with us revolve

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.420 
get a set options a coma with us revolve
we<00:05:02.780> could<00:05:02.990> master<00:05:03.350> by<00:05:03.500> without<00:05:03.770> we<00:05:03.950> get<00:05:04.100> the

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
we could master by without we get the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.050 
we could master by without we get the
and<00:05:04.610> sweep<00:05:06.070> it's<00:05:07.070> basically<00:05:07.490> how<00:05:07.730> father

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
and sweep it's basically how father

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.720 
and sweep it's basically how father
evolved<00:05:08.630> works<00:05:08.980> okay<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.040> if<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.280> only<00:05:10.460> wanted

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
evolved works okay so if you only wanted

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.980 
evolved works okay so if you only wanted
to<00:05:10.880> do<00:05:11.090> half<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:12.200> would<00:05:12.260> set<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:13.750> 180<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:16.990> that

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
to do half you would set a 180 and that

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.290 
to do half you would set a 180 and that
is<00:05:18.110> when<00:05:18.230> revolved<00:05:18.680> around<00:05:18.770> 180<00:05:19.370> degrees<00:05:19.760> but

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
is when revolved around 180 degrees but

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.850 
is when revolved around 180 degrees but
we<00:05:20.419> want<00:05:20.600> it<00:05:20.660> for<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.840> full<00:05:20.960> thing<00:05:21.200> school<00:05:21.680> set

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
we want it for the full thing school set

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.060 
we want it for the full thing school set
at<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.040> 360<00:05:23.530> then<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:24.620> got<00:05:24.710> your<00:05:24.800> sections

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
at the 360 then you got your sections

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.790 
at the 360 then you got your sections
okay<00:05:28.060> obviously<00:05:29.060> same<00:05:29.690> as<00:05:29.810> before<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.380> higher

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
okay obviously same as before the higher

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.080 
okay obviously same as before the higher
the<00:05:30.979> sections<00:05:33.250> when<00:05:34.250> your<00:05:34.370> model<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:34.850> think

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
the sections when your model and I think

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.310 
the sections when your model and I think
the<00:05:37.150> smoother<00:05:38.150> this<00:05:38.660> mover<00:05:38.990> is<00:05:39.050> going<00:05:39.169> to<00:05:39.260> be

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
the smoother this mover is going to be

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.840 
the smoother this mover is going to be
so<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.530> more<00:05:39.680> polygons<00:05:40.160> you<00:05:40.250> have<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.639> smooth

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
so the more polygons you have the smooth

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.629 
so the more polygons you have the smooth
the<00:05:41.330> smooth<00:05:41.600> or<00:05:41.720> an<00:05:41.870> object<00:05:42.020> is<00:05:42.350> but<00:05:43.190> remember

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
the smooth or an object is but remember

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.460 
the smooth or an object is but remember
you<00:05:43.760> got<00:05:43.880> polygons<00:05:44.300> cones<00:05:44.540> they<00:05:45.080> take<00:05:45.320> into

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
you got polygons cones they take into

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.850 
you got polygons cones they take into
consideration<00:05:46.100> as<00:05:46.400> well<00:05:48.940> okay<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:49.970> if<00:05:50.389> we<00:05:50.830> do<00:05:51.830> a

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
consideration as well okay so if we do a

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.159 
consideration as well okay so if we do a
quick<00:05:51.919> round<00:05:52.250> or<00:05:52.460> review<00:05:52.669> of<00:05:52.700> that<00:05:52.930> you'll<00:05:53.930> see

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
quick round or review of that you'll see

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.810 
quick round or review of that you'll see
it's<00:05:54.620> nice<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.070> smooth<00:05:55.280> it's<00:05:55.550> just<00:05:55.700> a

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
it's nice and smooth it's just a

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.700 
it's nice and smooth it's just a
slightly<00:05:56.150> different<00:05:56.539> technique<00:05:56.720> that<00:05:57.500> we<00:05:57.590> use

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
slightly different technique that we use

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.490 
slightly different technique that we use
before<00:05:57.860> I<00:05:58.280> was<00:05:59.240> just<00:05:59.479> drawn<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.810> curve<00:06:00.050> using

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
before I was just drawn a curve using

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.370 
before I was just drawn a curve using
the<00:06:00.710> CV<00:06:01.039> curve<00:06:01.250> tool<00:06:01.570> and<00:06:02.570> then<00:06:02.810> created<00:06:03.350> a

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
the CV curve tool and then created a

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
the CV curve tool and then created a
surface<00:06:03.770> using<00:06:04.490> a<00:06:04.700> revolve
