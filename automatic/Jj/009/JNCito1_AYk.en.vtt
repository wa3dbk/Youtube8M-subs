00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
OS this is running on an Asus Tripoli I

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.799

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
think it's the 701 something like that a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.740 
think it's the 701 something like that a
netbook<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:14.009> -<00:00:14.370> it's<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.880> real<00:00:15.150> old<00:00:15.389> sort<00:00:15.690> of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750

first generation one of these things

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.929 
first generation one of these things
it's<00:00:18.000> an<00:00:18.119> 8<00:00:18.270> gig<00:00:18.480> nipple<00:00:19.520> you'll<00:00:20.520> see<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
network maybe here that's because the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.740 
network maybe here that's because the
wireless<00:00:26.670> doesn't<00:00:26.939> seem<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.269> currently<00:00:27.539> work

username<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.159> actually<00:01:32.340> sticks<00:01:32.729> at

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
username and it actually sticks at

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640 
username and it actually sticks at
gmail.com<00:01:33.270> only<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.320> an<00:01:34.409> email

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
gmail.com only and if it's not an email

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.830 
gmail.com only and if it's not an email
address<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.450> hint

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.950 

that<00:01:46.560> screen<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.250> also<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that screen is also it's the the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
that screen is also it's the the
username<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:49.409> password<00:01:49.469> piece<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.280> set<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
username and password piece is set to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.550 
username and password piece is set to
the<00:01:50.759> bottom<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.179> of<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:51.539> screen<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the bottom right of the screen this is a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.770 
the bottom right of the screen this is a
very<00:01:52.799> very<00:01:53.549> small<00:01:53.850> display<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.569> doesn't

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
very very small display so it doesn't

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.450 
very very small display so it doesn't
quite<00:01:54.929> fit<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.829> actually<00:01:56.069> pretty<00:01:56.219> close

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
quite fit but it's actually pretty close

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
quite fit but it's actually pretty close
I<00:01:56.789> think<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.359> should<00:01:57.539> probably<00:01:57.810> set<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.319> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I think they should probably set it to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.919 
I think they should probably set it to
the<00:01:58.590> top<00:01:58.859> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> left<00:01:59.789> right<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.600> nicer

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
the top of the left right right be nicer

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.840 
the top of the left right right be nicer
if<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.289> want<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> censor<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.999 

okay<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:05.909> press<00:02:06.270> ENTER<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.899> goes<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
okay so press ENTER and then it goes and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.430 
okay so press ENTER and then it goes and
then<00:02:08.129> bang<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.349> you're

is<00:03:10.290> probably<00:03:10.440> very<00:03:10.920> preliminary<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:12.329> fact<00:03:12.540> it

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
is probably very preliminary in fact it

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.000 
is probably very preliminary in fact it

says in the writing that you probably

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.599
