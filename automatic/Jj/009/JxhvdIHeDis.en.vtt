00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.710
 another one of the doubts we have is how 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.990
 We were going to do if we wanted a neckline 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.869
 but that this one was asymmetric this is 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.930
 means for example I want that 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.910
 fall for each month that I stay very 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.430
 symmetrical this is an asymmetrical neckline 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.650
 we are going to do it also in miniature 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.650
 how are we going to make an asymmetrical neckline 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.650
 this is the same I already have me 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.680
 and basic sleeve blouse 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.170
 Japanese in this case I'm going to do it 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.180
 and we are going to do it but in doubles of 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.240
 I only want to trace the paper 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.240
 here so that they see right now as bases 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.590
 here I have a neckline 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.879
 drawn 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.719
 a bitter 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.250
 this paper that is using the series 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.280
 he also tells us that it is micro-role that 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.930
 they sell it in colors and she uses it 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.130
 for when there are transformations because 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.030
 if they have their notebook 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.250
 different colors true 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.530
 you distinguish the basic of the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.970
 transformation is super good that's 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.970
 father I have in green blue in yellow 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.260
 and in pink 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.260
 it is thousands of years old 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.810
 but as not bad use when I do 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 little things of transformation as for 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.580
 remember exactly what the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 attention there remember to always lower 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.560
 this centimeter that has here then 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.970
 If I already have one, I'll pick it up and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.210
 I'm going to do it in double paper 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.700
 I leave it on double paper then 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.720
 when I already have the fold of paper what 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.440
 I trace again here exactly the same 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.440
 what is my neckline 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.740
 or the whole garment if you want someone 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.860
 I said or I have to do two is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.489
 basically it 's doing it and then I already 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.459
 I have a full blouse and if I say 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.239
 example is that I want a 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.480
 peak towards here then I'm going to draw 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.480
 the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.490
 this is always about some design and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.560
 you say for example you took care to give here 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.570
 more breadth to my neckline than not 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.370
 I want so stuck and I want me 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.670
 hang a little stick that comes up here 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.880
 then we are going to do here what 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.900
 we have this with this one 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.370
 this with this other than for the necklines 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.980
 generally uses a bit of the curve 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.840
 the rule because our bodies are not 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.290
 Straight straight 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.760
 and then already at the time of cutting it 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.760
 I'm going to cut myself here 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.220
 and this would be 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.220
 again now my neckline 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.890
 and everything draws me I'm going to cut it like this 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.890
 full 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.510
 ok and so we will be left with what is the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.510
 blouse with asymmetric neck you can 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.049
 give it the shape you want as the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.470
 let's cut this fabric will be 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:36.769
 Now what is your cloth thread are you going to 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.230
 cut in simple and put here and their 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.230
 seams like you know since we can 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.079
 give 12 for example in the bass we can 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.359
 leave 3 centimeters and the neckline we're going 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.579
 to leave an inch because it is 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.099
 asymmetric and we can make you for example 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.630
 a sight 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.180
 and then at the time we're going to 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.260
 cut on the cloth for example let's 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.750
 put the fabric so we learn by measuring 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.150
 perfectly fine our fabric thread 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.050
 let's stay right here we mark 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.050
 seams 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.900
 and we're going to cut everything around in 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.140
 simple and we pass if you want a 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.239
 baste instead of loose threads you pass all 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.700
 a basting where the part where 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.300
 you have to sew or raisins and loose 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.740
 but so in simple 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.870
 that's all I hope you've been left 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.760
 very clear the person that you are interested 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.040
 the asymmetric cuts and if there are more 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.500
 people who want to make necklines 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.320
 asymmetric according to the design of their 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.390
 clothes and everything and they will be very 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.490
 nice yes because he also gave us now 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.430
 options for different types of neck 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.080
 that out there I go to cleavage sorry if 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.150
 I put the link in the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.060
 definition is very nice to have 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.550
 different square dvd or that I made you of 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.020
 buttonhole round and now comes one 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.420
 asymmetric but this has to be cut 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.090
 so it 's simple I hope it serves them 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.450
 a lot here we are still waiting for you and until 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.450
 the next
