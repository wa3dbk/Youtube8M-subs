00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
all but yeah I mean think about how I

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.310 
all but yeah I mean think about how I
started<00:02:42.180> right<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.480> was<00:02:42.600> 16<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.140> think

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
started right when I was 16 and think

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.360 
started right when I was 16 and think
I've<00:02:43.410> different<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.830> thought<00:02:44.070> when<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.250> were

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
I've different you thought when you were

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.800 
I've different you thought when you were
16<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.000> know<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.120> mean<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.420> that's<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
16 you know I mean I think that's the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.870 
16 you know I mean I think that's the
biggest<00:02:46.019> four-year<00:02:46.530> jump<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.370> life<00:02:47.550> I'm

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
biggest four-year jump in your life I'm

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.420 
biggest four-year jump in your life I'm
like<00:02:48.000> 16<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.480> 20<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.680> know<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.010> think<00:02:50.370> my

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
like 16 to 20 you know I think my

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
like 16 to 20 you know I think my
writing<00:02:50.790> evolved

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
writing evolved

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.530 
writing evolved
to<00:02:53.050> fold<00:02:53.319> like<00:02:53.560> one<00:02:53.800> because<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.430> was<00:02:54.580> becoming

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
to fold like one because I was becoming

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.420 
to fold like one because I was becoming
a<00:02:55.720> better<00:02:55.840> comedian<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.040> was<00:02:57.129> probably

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
a better comedian and I was probably

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.160 
a better comedian and I was probably
more<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.819> once<00:02:58.030> because<00:02:58.300> i<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.540> literally

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
more and once because i was literally

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.100 
more and once because i was literally
growing<00:02:59.440> up<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.390> would<00:03:01.840> see<00:03:01.959> how<00:03:02.019> I'm

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110
