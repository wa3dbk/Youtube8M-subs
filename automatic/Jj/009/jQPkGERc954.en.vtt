00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.759 

I'm<00:03:48.350> doing<00:03:48.650> usually<00:03:49.070> 25<00:03:49.579> to<00:03:49.730> 30<00:03:49.940> shows<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.390> year

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
I'm doing usually 25 to 30 shows a year

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.520 
I'm doing usually 25 to 30 shows a year
so<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:51.950> is<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.310> first<00:03:52.660> years<00:03:53.660> for<00:03:54.049> this<00:03:54.230> show

so this is the first years for this show

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.130 
so this is the first years for this show
but<00:03:55.489> actually<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.209> was<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.420> very<00:03:56.690> successful

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
but actually it was a very successful

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.850 
but actually it was a very successful
show<00:03:57.860> for<00:03:58.160> me<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.280> sold<00:03:58.610> 10<00:03:58.820> pieces<00:03:59.090> already<00:03:59.860> I'm

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
show for me I sold 10 pieces already I'm

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.970 
show for me I sold 10 pieces already I'm
originally<00:04:01.340> from<00:04:01.340> Israel<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:03.200> one-of-a-kind

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
originally from Israel the one-of-a-kind

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.180 
originally from Israel the one-of-a-kind
piece<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.850> original<00:04:05.450> all<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.650> pieces<00:04:06.829> there

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
piece the original all the pieces there

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.670 
piece the original all the pieces there
is<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.370> symbol<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.420> Chilcote<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.260> circle

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
is a symbol the Chilcote the circle

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.430 
is a symbol the Chilcote the circle
actually<00:04:10.070> it's<00:04:10.220> Fibonacci<00:04:10.760> its<00:04:11.630> creation<00:04:12.320> of

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
actually it's Fibonacci its creation of

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.390 
actually it's Fibonacci its creation of
number<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.070> God<00:04:13.510> 1.16<00:04:14.510> 18<00:04:15.019> so<00:04:15.890> all<00:04:16.100> of<00:04:16.130> them

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
number of God 1.16 18 so all of them

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.069 
number of God 1.16 18 so all of them
there<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.700> meaning<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.450> it's<00:04:17.690> not<00:04:17.840> just

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
there is meaning to that it's not just

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.170 
there is meaning to that it's not just
the<00:04:18.200> painting<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.370> everything<00:04:19.880> comes<00:04:20.090> from

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
the painting and everything comes from

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.240 
the painting and everything comes from
my<00:04:20.359> soul<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.660> makes

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
my soul and makes

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.120 
my soul and makes
so<00:04:22.120> whatever<00:04:22.420> I'm<00:04:22.780> feeling<00:04:22.810> I'm<00:04:23.500> an<00:04:23.710> abstract

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
so whatever I'm feeling I'm an abstract

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.120 
so whatever I'm feeling I'm an abstract
expressionist<00:04:24.760> comes<00:04:25.390> out<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:25.900> buy<00:04:26.230> art<00:04:26.470> each

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
expressionist comes out and buy art each

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.610 
expressionist comes out and buy art each
piece<00:04:27.550> has<00:04:27.610> its<00:04:27.910> own<00:04:28.240> story<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.930> its<00:04:29.320> own

up<00:05:27.010> conversation<00:05:27.640> I<00:05:27.729> kind<00:05:27.910> of<00:05:27.970> expand<00:05:28.419> my<00:05:28.630> fan

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.250 
up conversation I kind of expand my fan
base<00:05:29.260> as<00:05:29.650> well<00:05:29.770> I<00:05:29.830> think<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:30.460> I<00:05:31.240> guess<00:05:31.600> I've<00:05:31.900> I've

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
base as well I think I I guess I've I've

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.440 
base as well I think I I guess I've I've
always<00:05:32.500> kind<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:32.919> equated<00:05:33.330> painting<00:05:34.330> with

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
always kind of equated painting with

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.930 
always kind of equated painting with
drawings<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.200> think<00:05:36.100> it's<00:05:36.250> probably<00:05:36.400> got<00:05:36.700> a

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
drawings I think it's probably got a

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.380 
drawings I think it's probably got a
little<00:05:37.810> bit<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.020> an<00:05:38.200> edge<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:39.729> tend<00:05:40.330> to

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
little bit of an edge and I tend to

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.960 
little bit of an edge and I tend to
paint<00:05:40.660> kind<00:05:41.169> of<00:05:41.229> like<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.530> draw<00:05:41.800> last<00:05:42.370> night<00:05:42.640> on

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970
