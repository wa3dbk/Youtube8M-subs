00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
newer boats but those are really

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.340 
newer boats but those are really
expensive<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:44.030> guess<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.020> will<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
expensive so I guess this will have to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.550 
expensive so I guess this will have to
do<00:02:45.560> for<00:02:45.740> now<00:02:45.970> all<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.300> needed<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.630> do<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.900> finish

insulation<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.739> put<00:03:51.980> up<00:03:52.100> while<00:03:52.340> they're<00:03:52.670> doing

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
insulation I put up while they're doing

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.780 
insulation I put up while they're doing
the<00:03:53.150> refit<00:03:53.570> oh<00:03:53.980> by<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.010> way<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.250> have<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.580> lot<00:03:55.760> of

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the refit oh by the way I have a lot of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.270 
the refit oh by the way I have a lot of
photos<00:03:56.690> from<00:03:57.140> when<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.410> did<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.739> refit<00:03:58.100> and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
photos from when I did the refit and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.250 
photos from when I did the refit and
I'll<00:03:59.000> throw<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.269> link<00:03:59.450> in<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.690> description<00:03:59.780> to

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
I'll throw a link in the description to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.620 
I'll throw a link in the description to
those<00:04:00.440> if<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.739> guys<00:04:00.890> want<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.190> see<00:04:01.340> them<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.600> I

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
those if you guys want to see them so I

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.080 
those if you guys want to see them so I
knew<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.050> want<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.530> insulate<00:04:04.040> most<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.910> hull

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
knew I want to insulate most of the hull

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.390 
knew I want to insulate most of the hull
but<00:04:05.120> before<00:04:05.900> putting<00:04:06.170> all<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.769> interior

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
but before putting all of the interior

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.520 
but before putting all of the interior
back<00:04:07.640> together<00:04:08.000> as<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.959> would<00:04:09.140> be<00:04:09.290> much<00:04:09.500> easier

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
back together as it would be much easier

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.949 
back together as it would be much easier
to<00:04:09.980> access<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.940> hull<00:04:11.120> without<00:04:11.420> all<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:11.660> the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
to access the hull without all of the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.900 
to access the hull without all of the
plywood<00:04:12.380> in<00:04:12.620> place

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
plywood in place

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.560 
plywood in place
I<00:04:13.940> glued<00:04:14.660> one<00:04:15.470> layer<00:04:15.710> of<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.610> 12<00:04:17.330> millimeter

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
I glued one layer of the 12 millimeter

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.840 
I glued one layer of the 12 millimeter
closed<00:04:18.050> cell<00:04:18.320> phone<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.190> inside<00:04:19.610> of<00:04:19.640> the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
closed cell phone to the inside of the

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.270 
closed cell phone to the inside of the
hole<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:21.470> actually<00:04:21.740> turned<00:04:21.920> out<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.160> be

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
hole and that actually turned out to be

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.980 
hole and that actually turned out to be
quite<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.580> messy<00:04:22.820> job<00:04:23.120> because<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:23.660> hadn't<00:04:23.900> tried

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
quite a messy job because I hadn't tried

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.100 
quite a messy job because I hadn't tried
using<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:25.160> kind<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.460> blue<00:04:25.640> glue<00:04:26.000> before<00:04:26.390> so<00:04:26.780> I

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
using that kind of blue glue before so I

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.800 
using that kind of blue glue before so I
actually<00:04:27.410> wound<00:04:27.740> up<00:04:27.860> having<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.540> take<00:04:29.540> all<00:04:29.780> of

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
actually wound up having to take all of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.200 
actually wound up having to take all of
the<00:04:29.990> insulation<00:04:30.200> back<00:04:30.650> down<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.100> put<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.030> back

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
the insulation back down and put it back

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.290 
the insulation back down and put it back
up<00:04:32.360> again<00:04:32.480> just<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:33.260> get<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> good<00:04:33.620> result<00:04:34.300> but

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
up again just to get a good result but

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.780 
up again just to get a good result but
then<00:04:35.540> this<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:35.960> some<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.530> 12<00:04:37.310> millimeters

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
then this is some of the 12 millimeters

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.380 
then this is some of the 12 millimeters
of<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.050> closed<00:04:39.440> cell<00:04:39.650> phone<00:04:40.120> now<00:04:41.120> as<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.270> can

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
of the closed cell phone now as you can

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.780 
of the closed cell phone now as you can
tell<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:42.170> surface<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:42.890> isn't<00:04:43.190> very

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
tell the surface of this isn't very

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.150 
tell the surface of this isn't very
durable<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.600> it's<00:04:45.200> not<00:04:45.410> very<00:04:45.620> easy<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.980> keep

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
durable and it's not very easy to keep

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.060 
durable and it's not very easy to keep
clean<00:04:46.220> either<00:04:47.260> on<00:04:48.260> top<00:04:48.470> of<00:04:48.650> this

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
clean either on top of this

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.150 
clean either on top of this
I<00:04:49.100> glued<00:04:49.610> three<00:04:50.240> millimeters<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.900> foam<00:04:51.860> packed

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
I glued three millimeters of foam packed

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.960 
I glued three millimeters of foam packed
vinyl<00:04:52.850> headliner<00:04:53.560> as<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.680> can<00:04:54.830> tell<00:04:55.040> this<00:04:55.760> is

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
vinyl headliner as you can tell this is

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.660 
vinyl headliner as you can tell this is
this<00:04:56.660> surface<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:57.170> much<00:04:57.440> more<00:04:57.830> durable<00:04:58.400> and

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
this surface is much more durable and

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.730 
this surface is much more durable and
easier<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.540> keep<00:04:59.810> clean<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.410> course<00:05:00.620> it

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
easier to keep clean and of course it

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.110 
easier to keep clean and of course it
looks<00:05:00.770> much<00:05:01.250> nicer<00:05:01.580> too<00:05:03.370> there<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.580> couple

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
looks much nicer too there is a couple

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.750 
looks much nicer too there is a couple
of<00:05:05.180> places<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.750> haven't<00:05:05.990> yet<00:05:06.170> insulated<00:05:06.800> B<00:05:07.460> Hall

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
of places I haven't yet insulated B Hall

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.390 
of places I haven't yet insulated B Hall
behind<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.510> head<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.620> inside<00:05:10.070> of<00:05:10.100> the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
previous owner had put up three

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.630 
previous owner had put up three
millimeters<00:05:18.140> of<00:05:18.320> insulation<00:05:18.890> which<00:05:19.370> still

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
millimeters of insulation which still

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.640 
millimeters of insulation which still
seemed<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.060> be<00:05:20.180> in<00:05:20.270> excellent<00:05:20.810> condition<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:21.620> I

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
seemed to be in excellent condition so I

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.700 
seemed to be in excellent condition so I
didn't<00:05:22.040> replace<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:23.260> so<00:05:24.260> far

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
didn't replace that so far

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.800 
didn't replace that so far
condensation<00:05:25.220> only<00:05:25.700> really<00:05:26.210> seems<00:05:26.450> to<00:05:26.540> be<00:05:26.720> an

condensation only really seems to be an

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.740 
condensation only really seems to be an
issue<00:05:26.960> below<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.950> waterline<00:05:28.270> in<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.420> areas

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
issue below the waterline in the areas

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.800 
issue below the waterline in the areas
of<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.080> hall<00:05:30.290> that<00:05:30.530> are<00:05:30.710> above<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.310> waterline

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.970 
of the hall that are above the waterline
even<00:05:32.810> though<00:05:32.900> it's<00:05:33.050> just<00:05:33.200> three<00:05:33.530> millimeters

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
even though it's just three millimeters

even though it's just three millimeters
of<00:05:34.100> insulation<00:05:34.490> I've<00:05:34.760> seen<00:05:35.030> no<00:05:35.330> signs<00:05:35.690> of

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
of insulation I've seen no signs of

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.400 
of insulation I've seen no signs of
condensation<00:05:36.500> yet<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:37.870> guess<00:05:38.870> we'll<00:05:39.050> see<00:05:39.260> what

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
condensation yet I guess we'll see what

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.260 
condensation yet I guess we'll see what
happens<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.890> February<00:05:40.430> but<00:05:40.640> when<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:41.180> gets

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
happens in February but when it gets

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.570 
happens in February but when it gets
really<00:05:41.510> cold<00:05:41.810> but<00:05:42.140> for<00:05:42.860> now<00:05:42.980> I<00:05:43.040> want<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.370> start

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
really cold but for now I want to start

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.720 
really cold but for now I want to start
taking<00:05:43.790> some<00:05:44.180> measurements<00:05:44.660> and<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:46.310> want<00:05:46.640> to

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
taking some measurements and I want to

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.310 
taking some measurements and I want to
see<00:05:46.790> if<00:05:46.910> I<00:05:46.970> can<00:05:47.150> figure<00:05:47.360> out<00:05:47.480> how<00:05:47.840> much<00:05:48.020> of<00:05:48.080> a

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
see if I can figure out how much of a

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.100 
see if I can figure out how much of a
difference<00:05:48.800> having<00:05:49.070> a<00:05:49.360> 15<00:05:50.360> millimeters<00:05:50.900> of

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
difference having a 15 millimeters of

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.590 
difference having a 15 millimeters of
insulation<00:05:51.560> offers<00:05:52.160> over<00:05:52.430> having<00:05:53.000> just<00:05:53.240> three

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
insulation offers over having just three

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.650 
insulation offers over having just three
millimeters<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.230> insulation<00:05:55.540> sadly<00:05:56.540> I've

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
millimeters of insulation sadly I've

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.020 
millimeters of insulation sadly I've
left<00:05:56.900> my<00:05:57.170> infrared<00:05:57.980> thermometer<00:05:58.550> back<00:05:58.760> at<00:05:58.910> my

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
left my infrared thermometer back at my

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.700 
left my infrared thermometer back at my
house<00:05:59.240> but<00:05:59.600> they're<00:05:59.930> all<00:06:00.080> swing<00:06:00.380> by<00:06:00.530> and<00:06:00.650> pick

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
house but they're all swing by and pick

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.110 
house but they're all swing by and pick
that<00:06:00.980> up<00:06:01.040> sometime<00:06:01.520> next<00:06:01.760> week

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120

that up sometime next week
I<00:06:03.100> hope<00:06:04.100> those<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.580> measurements<00:06:05.060> will<00:06:05.180> help

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
I hope those the measurements will help

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.170 
I hope those the measurements will help
me<00:06:05.630> figure<00:06:05.900> out<00:06:06.400> how<00:06:07.400> much<00:06:07.550> insulation<00:06:07.910> I

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
me figure out how much insulation I

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.540 
me figure out how much insulation I
should<00:06:08.480> put<00:06:08.780> up<00:06:08.900> behind<00:06:09.200> the<00:06:09.380> head<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:09.770> if<00:06:10.400> I

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
should put up behind the head and if I

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.670 
should put up behind the head and if I
should<00:06:10.610> replace<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.450> three<00:06:12.050> millimeters<00:06:12.530> of

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
should replace the three millimeters of

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.070 
should replace the three millimeters of
insulation<00:06:13.160> and<00:06:13.490> Labib<00:06:13.970> earth<00:06:14.180> with<00:06:14.480> 15
