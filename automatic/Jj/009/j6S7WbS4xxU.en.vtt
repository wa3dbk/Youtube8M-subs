do you think men or women have a larger

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.850 
do you think men or women have a larger
brain<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:09.240> think<00:00:09.809> we're<00:00:10.170> not<00:00:10.440> allowed<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.889> break

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
brain I think we're not allowed to break

women<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.009> course<00:00:14.299> man<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.450> course<00:00:15.770> I'm<00:00:16.770> just

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
women of course man of course I'm just

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
women of course man of course I'm just
gonna<00:00:17.190> go<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.490> woman<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.810> have

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
gonna go with the woman what we have

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.390 
gonna go with the woman what we have
found<00:00:19.260> regarding<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> brain<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
found regarding the brain and the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.679 
found regarding the brain and the
difference<00:00:20.640> between<00:00:20.730> men<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.000> women<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
difference between men and women is that

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.279 
difference between men and women is that
men's<00:00:21.900> brains<00:00:22.170> are<00:00:22.619> bigger<00:00:23.869> 10%<00:00:24.869> bigger<00:00:25.080> on

in the brain so despite the fact that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.240 
in the brain so despite the fact that

the men's brains are bigger they're less

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.389 
the men's brains are bigger they're less

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
if you had to say one thing that a man

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.840 
if you had to say one thing that a man
was<00:00:54.650> better<00:00:54.890> at<00:00:55.070> than<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.280> woman

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
was better at than a woman

was better at than a woman
what<00:00:56.210> would<00:00:56.330> you<00:00:56.450> say<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.780> would<00:00:56.900> be

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
what would you say that would be

with in cooking I think in collecting

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.749 
with in cooking I think in collecting
money<00:01:05.449> they<00:01:06.020> are<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.470> great<00:01:06.740> they're<00:01:07.580> not

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
money they are the great they're not

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.890 
money they are the great they're not
better<00:01:08.530> maybe<00:01:09.530> not<00:01:10.460> quite<00:01:10.700> as<00:01:11.000> good<00:01:11.210> as<00:01:11.450> women

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
better maybe not quite as good as women

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.570 
better maybe not quite as good as women
women<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:12.590> I'm<00:01:13.930> talking<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:15.320> lot<00:01:15.530> women<00:01:16.460> are

women that I'm talking a lot women are

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.240 
women that I'm talking a lot women are
smarter<00:01:17.000> just<00:01:17.240> kidding<00:01:17.619> if<00:01:18.619> you're<00:01:18.770> imagining

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
smarter just kidding if you're imagining

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.180 
smarter just kidding if you're imagining
a<00:01:19.369> 3d<00:01:19.729> image<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.440> want<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.649> rotate<00:01:21.860> that

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
a 3d image and you want to rotate that

a 3d image and you want to rotate that
image<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.610> your<00:01:22.640> head<00:01:22.790> just<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:23.690> you<00:01:23.780> could<00:01:23.899> see

all<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.590> various<00:01:25.070> facets<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:25.640> flip<00:01:26.060> it

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
all the various facets of it flip it

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.280 
all the various facets of it flip it
around<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.450> way<00:01:26.509> flip<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.869> around<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.140> way

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
around this way flip it around that way

around this way flip it around that way
around<00:01:27.590> men<00:01:28.159> are<00:01:28.310> better<00:01:28.430> at<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.759> as<00:01:29.330> a

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
around men are better at that as a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.359 
around men are better at that as a
general<00:01:30.140> obviously<00:01:30.409> not<00:01:30.710> across<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.039> board

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
general obviously not across the board

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.190 
general obviously not across the board
but<00:01:31.490> men<00:01:31.610> are<00:01:31.729> better<00:01:32.119> at<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.479> women<00:01:33.110> are

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
but men are better at that women are

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.710 
but men are better at that women are
much<00:01:33.380> better<00:01:33.590> at<00:01:33.920> taking<00:01:34.700> lots<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.300> different

Lord knows a man woman's brain I think

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.410 
Lord knows a man woman's brain I think
we're<00:02:00.380> completely<00:02:00.890> different<00:02:01.190> men<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.090> women

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
we're completely different men and women

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.990 
we're completely different men and women
think<00:02:02.810> differently<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.500> there's<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.039> lot<00:02:04.429> of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
think differently and there's a lot of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.600 
think differently and there's a lot of
miscommunication<00:02:05.860> well<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.890> think<00:02:07.099> we're<00:02:07.429> all

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
miscommunication well I think we're all

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.460 
miscommunication well I think we're all
aware<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:08.119> there<00:02:08.360> are<00:02:08.390> sex<00:02:08.899> differences<00:02:09.410> in

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
we encounter that every day the way we

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.500 
we encounter that every day the way we
speak<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.230> way<00:02:15.349> we<00:02:15.530> conceptualize<00:02:16.209> how<00:02:17.209> we<00:02:17.270> go

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
speak the way we conceptualize how we go

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.690 
speak the way we conceptualize how we go
about<00:02:17.540> our<00:02:17.900> everyday<00:02:18.170> tasks<00:02:18.890> whether<00:02:19.340> we<00:02:19.550> ask

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
about our everyday tasks whether we ask

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.880 
about our everyday tasks whether we ask
for<00:02:19.879> directions<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.560> we<00:02:21.680> laugh

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
for directions on that and we laugh

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.920 
for directions on that and we laugh
about<00:02:21.920> these<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.390> they<00:02:23.569> seem<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.810> be

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
about these and we and they seem to be

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.380 
about these and we and they seem to be
trivial<00:02:24.530> but<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.890> fact<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.180> these

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
trivial but the fact is is that these

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.570 
trivial but the fact is is that these
differences<00:02:26.930> are<00:02:27.319> hardwired<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.310> brain

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
differences are hardwired in the brain

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.850 
differences are hardwired in the brain
and<00:02:28.910> they<00:02:29.360> have<00:02:29.569> serious<00:02:29.840> implications<00:02:30.200> for

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
and they have serious implications for

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.250 
and they have serious implications for
your<00:02:31.010> health
