00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.689
 eg I heard the death orphan existed for only five years 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.789
 I actually thought it would be a lot longer to wait what about that we have to adhere to 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.449
 yes five years ago its owners started indeed the two one see the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.829
 children's choirs and five NATO in Afghanistan 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.770
 it is actually done out of a kind of hobby 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.450
 years have been reported 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.780
 interesting are owners where the one owner tiotÃ© sizes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.400
 he himself was already active in the modeling trade and almost counted the counters 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.240
 they work 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.360
 and meijer france who worked for a mammoth 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.060
 kramer out 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.350
 and breda already a lot in my sense when she is among other scale models 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.670
 who gives the idea to be able to say the site better, but then the were 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.180
 market at that time 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.480
 and started like this 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.830
 Martijn and immediately became very dirty and scanned and gathered 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.659
 and in that way he would be from growth to that in five years 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.550
 we are weezy's new headquarters 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.830
 woudenberg but the production is in holly collection is one in china 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.590
 where exactly received 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.750
 in that sense the city 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.910
 then north of the hong kong especially in the south of china 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.360
 and therefore sad and 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.100
 now in their own hands for a year and a half 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.050
 that's right we'll see 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.820
 and there is also development 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.370
 no development takes place at the head office 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.380
 pekela department and a product development there is no train 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.979
 and from that the drawing becomes possible if you then 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.420
 the generator that make sense 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.950
 You can of course have said that we cannot live in the drawing room 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.380
 see why not 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.550
 But currently wants for the upcoming scholarships to have their new ones played 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.930
 mountain pivot after which they 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.400
 and then in April 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.560
 we introduce for licensees and number of new models 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.730
 to remain broken 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.240
 I stop speaking 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.860
 in multiscope the model introduces a policy plans and incidents with 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.939
 that is the starting point when creating new models 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.119
 and on the one hand we produce models 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.209
 for those six years a new model could come out 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.219
 and therefore we produce one-on-one on a number of models 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.129
 produce 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.460
 about what kind of licensees a lot then 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.950
 river man lives duno to come 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.459
 that kind of also a day full of scania 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.459
 spacious and in addition 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.889
 Many lorries as sporting companies that would like to have it made by hand 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.449
 produce where the models 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.579
 and what the emmenaar would do and are classics and 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.209
 so classic tracks are a whole day series with the old model 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.359
 super cool to no longer drive sustainable trucks but he could say that 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.939
 were and the real classics of that time 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.060
 and we turn it into training and anticipation and the chartreuse 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:06.279
 produce between 12 and 11 15 models per year 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.279
 of the guests are being recognized in europe 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.719
 but the very latest news 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.010
 all the latest news 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.069
 the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.429
 she does think the phasing 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.289
 the car let alone that was very cool about them that is our first 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.489
 truck mounted crane 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.059
 we are very happy that we are possible
