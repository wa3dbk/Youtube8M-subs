much get the gist of that so let's go

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.369 
much get the gist of that so let's go
ahead<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.849> break<00:02:09.060> through<00:02:09.239> again<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.869> fly<00:02:10.170> up

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
just as cool

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.880 
just as cool
I<00:03:12.330> really<00:03:12.870> wish<00:03:13.020> they<00:03:13.170> had<00:03:13.320> like<00:03:13.350> buried

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
I really wish they had like buried

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.890 
I really wish they had like buried
treasure<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.700> different<00:03:15.360> other<00:03:15.480> things<00:03:15.720> and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
treasure and different other things and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.480 
treasure and different other things and
maybe<00:03:16.050> an<00:03:16.260> adventure<00:03:16.740> version<00:03:17.070> of<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> map

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
maybe an adventure version of the map

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.680 
maybe an adventure version of the map
where<00:03:17.970> there's<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.209> little<00:03:18.480> bit<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.600> a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
where there's a little bit of a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.180 
where there's a little bit of a
storyline<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.530> think<00:03:19.769> that'd<00:03:19.890> be<00:03:20.070> really

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
storyline and I think that'd be really

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.410 
storyline and I think that'd be really
cool<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.700> map<00:03:20.850> maker<00:03:21.060> wants<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.330> do

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
cool so if the map maker wants to do

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.310 
cool so if the map maker wants to do
that

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
that

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.790 
that
that'd<00:03:22.680> be<00:03:22.860> sweet<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.600> over<00:03:24.600> here<00:03:24.840> we<00:03:25.620> have

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
that'd be sweet but over here we have

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800 
that'd be sweet but over here we have
this<00:03:25.980> nice<00:03:26.310> little<00:03:26.670> pathway<00:03:27.150> off<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.690> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
this nice little pathway off to the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.650 
this nice little pathway off to the
other<00:03:28.080> Island<00:03:28.769> which<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.100> more<00:03:29.820> cliffy<00:03:30.630> I

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
other Island which is more cliffy I

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.820 
other Island which is more cliffy I
guess<00:03:30.989> in<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.230> other<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> other<00:03:31.680> one

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
guess in the other one the other one

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.380 
guess in the other one the other one
it's<00:03:32.250> pretty<00:03:32.400> hard<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.700> get<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:32.910> on<00:03:33.060> but<00:03:33.209> this

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
it's pretty hard to get up on but this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.759 
it's pretty hard to get up on but this
one's<00:03:33.600> got<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.110> hard<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.380> get<00:03:34.470> up<00:03:34.530> on

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
one's got to be really hard to get up on

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.440 
one's got to be really hard to get up on
I<00:03:34.980> imagine<00:03:35.670> it'd<00:03:35.760> be<00:03:35.850> cool<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.090> make<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:36.390> a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
I imagine it'd be cool to make like a

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.670 
I imagine it'd be cool to make like a
house<00:03:36.630> over<00:03:36.930> here<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.110> don't<00:03:37.260> know<00:03:37.440> whatever

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
house over here I don't know whatever

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.500 
house over here I don't know whatever
you<00:03:37.980> know<00:03:38.160> what<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.519> unfortunately<00:03:39.450> I

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
you know what it is unfortunately I

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.360 
you know what it is unfortunately I
don't<00:03:39.570> think<00:03:39.870> there<00:03:39.989> are<00:03:40.080> caves<00:03:40.380> but<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.130> can

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
don't think there are caves but we can

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.270 
don't think there are caves but we can
check<00:03:41.670> we<00:03:41.850> can<00:03:41.880> check<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:42.600> um<00:03:42.870> what<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:43.890> this

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
check we can check so um what is this

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.640 
check we can check so um what is this
this<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.910> little<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:46.019> guess<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.380> just<00:03:46.470> a

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
this is a little I guess it's just a

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.350 
this is a little I guess it's just a
little<00:03:46.920> sailboat<00:03:47.160> here<00:03:47.580> nothing<00:03:47.910> too<00:03:47.940> special

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
little sailboat here nothing too special

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.830 
little sailboat here nothing too special

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
but it is cool so I do want to check I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
but it is cool so I do want to check I
want<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.140> check<00:03:52.320> if<00:03:52.440> there's<00:03:52.620> any<00:03:52.709> caves<00:03:53.130> there

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
