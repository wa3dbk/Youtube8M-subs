00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.420 
realize this the toll later on and a few
minutes<00:02:44.060> I'll<00:02:44.209> start<00:02:44.569> exposing<00:02:44.900> themselves

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
minutes I'll start exposing themselves

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.220 
minutes I'll start exposing themselves
but<00:02:46.430> down<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.150> entire<00:02:47.300> Lena<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:48.730> tires<00:02:50.230> you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
but down that entire Lena of tires you

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.619 
but down that entire Lena of tires you
got<00:02:51.349> a<00:02:51.379> couple<00:02:51.590> guys<00:02:51.970> spaced<00:02:52.970> out<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:53.390> there's

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
got a couple guys spaced out but there's

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.339 
got a couple guys spaced out but there's
literally<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.379> six<00:02:55.040> or<00:02:55.160> seven<00:02:55.519> people<00:02:55.549> on

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
the other side of that fence and the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.990 
the other side of that fence and the
whole<00:03:02.750> reason<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.170> putting<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.069> video<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.670> is

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
whole reason I putting this video up is

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.830 
whole reason I putting this video up is
the<00:03:05.239> kind<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.510> show<00:03:07.239> what<00:03:08.239> it's<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.720> be

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the kind of show what it's like to be

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.750 
the kind of show what it's like to be
pinned<00:03:09.140> down<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:10.069> know<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.370> seems<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.730> be

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
pinned down and I know that seems to be

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.900 
pinned down and I know that seems to be
a<00:03:10.819> common<00:03:11.090> thing<00:03:11.620> with<00:03:12.620> my<00:03:12.860> videos<00:03:13.280> because<00:03:13.549> it

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
a common thing with my videos because it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.069 
a common thing with my videos because it
seems<00:03:14.180> I'm<00:03:15.079> always<00:03:15.319> in<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> position<00:03:16.250> where<00:03:16.280> I

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
seems I'm always in the position where I

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.339 
seems I'm always in the position where I
don't<00:03:18.079> have<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.530> do<00:03:18.739> have<00:03:19.069> people<00:03:19.280> around<00:03:19.489> me
