00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.559
 very good others here said we present 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 here I bring you a new one not expected is 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.920
 a trick that in the end would be an example 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.550
 if it is an extreme waiver to defend 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.580
 which is the remove tsunami and the typical 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 karting abans warfare and is a waiver is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 very simple once you do know 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 do it cost me the first one comes the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.790
 Out here my niece came 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.559
 look at this a trick that I can not do 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
 and spend it there and out of pure luck 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.960
 he got into this rock we're going to jump 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 later on I will show you here serious 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.989
 just to comment the beginning 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.149
 but an important thing that when the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.820
 water is like now the trick does not work 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.840
 so they have to be the trick the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.050
 glitch before the tsunami hits 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.210
 the trick the same cliché is in this 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.829
 part of the east coast 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 it is in this clothes that we wear we are going to cry 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.800
 I'm showing different angles 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 as you can see is a simple rock there 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.790
 a person or two pieces serves in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.420
 any console of any 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.410
 generation and how they are seeing is how it is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.090
 get attached to the rock walking seã alã 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.280
 pushing in and changing 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.619
 backwards forward and have to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.460
 start at the beginning of the rock that 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.860
 is the lowest part that is where in the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.190
 floor you see a line that does not fit with the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.840
 another texture today as from there from that 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.030
 part have to start crawling 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.190
 forward and backward and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.350
 back and also pushing for 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.590
 in a rock there are times that blue 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.899
 it goes up in it but after it stops 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.820
 make them easier for you 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.030
 he said to me nor to the first time my head 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.130
 I did it water because insulin did it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.869
 of pure luck and then I say it and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
 it also came out of pure luck until 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.430
 that you ask for tricks and how you see here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.070
 inside they will be able to shoot all those who 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.250
 go behind the outside and the forms that 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.990
 use the trick and it's your thing 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.090
 may I do not know maybe hide for 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.280
 infected but remember that when 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.860
 the tsunami arrives there as well as 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.690
 can put and here I put some 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.430
 how many images because some friends 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.200
 you will understand why you are here, you are not 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.970
 I think but maybe those things we do not 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.440
 we make the buses and well I hope that 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.250
 you liked the trick the cliché 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.830
 wahlberg 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.989
 iverson wahlberg that is to get into 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.090
 inside the object and to finish the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.560
 video I would like to say that I was 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.020
 thinking about asking a question and answer 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.170
 and you and they do leave me their 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.120
 questions in this in this video and 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.250
 then nothing got the best if it's the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.709
 video and good if you liked the video this

 goodbye 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.420
