00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.359
 Hello everyone , I have rain outside the window 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.269
 slush 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.790
 and I have a lucky mood soul and 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.980
 give it to you i will share a new one 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.150
 Origami lesson will do with 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.150
 here you are such flowers 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.259
 one of my five petals is another 6 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.660
 they are made exactly the same 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.219
 only the amount of material changes 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.339
 by the way about the material 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:36.949
 you will need a square and love any 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:40.989
 width and length as well as a long tire 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.329
 square equally blessed paper and 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.479
 need any glue 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.780
 but than he is stronger to glue the same course 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.830
 so that our beauty does not fall apart so that 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.830
 it was not a pity later 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.260
 one square is one petal as i have 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.160
 said you need at least 5 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160
 square 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.890
 first we twisted it in half so that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.280
 turned triangle on now the case 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 player 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.250
 behind it is the throat university complex 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.460
 now we fold each wing so 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.460
 as if doing for a currency 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.470
 It turned out so I do not know what I 'm listening 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.470
 whether 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.230
 now we make a hole for straightens 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.650
 first straighten and now bend 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.910
 from a different angle 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.220
 do it yourself 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.210
 this triangle that sticks out on his 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.970
 on the other side 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.970
 as well as bending by the sides 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:49.930
 it will be the middle 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.930
 personal bistro 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.980
 here I show how it happened 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.390
 this is not a new chassis with an empty 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.390
 and now we do again 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.360
 and spin on live like a shiver 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.610
 so that he should be kept neatly 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:36.720
 say then glue watch so 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.360
 make you just that place for sticking 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.459
 only where the fingers lived 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.459
 the outer side remains round 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.080
 good luck and a beautiful flower will turn head 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.310
 I have the rest of me 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.310
 petals 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.079
 in this case 5 pieces it will be holy 6 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.620
 petals and glue them neatly between 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.620
 the garden 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.200
 alternates svetlana 0 will give rise 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:00.560
 while glueing all this harmonica 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.960
 I hold my fingers tight because I know 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.530
 what 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.530
 not immediately glued 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.990
 need to wait a little bit 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.020
 we press so 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.490
 now ready to burn all the spoon you need 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.170
 be sure to wait a little longer 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.170
 so that the glue can dry up 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.910
 before you glue 1 petal out 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.910
 the last 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:57.020
 and how can be neatly out of 1 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:07:00.169
 in the wrong at the place we connect 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.169
 first with last 

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.860
 such a flower can make a whole bunch 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.220
 put even in a vase instead of natural 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.470
 flowers to give mom on March 8 you can 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.780
 just use the scenery where this 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.950
 profit even if you just leave for 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:50.080
 the table will already be a beautiful decoration 

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:53.620
