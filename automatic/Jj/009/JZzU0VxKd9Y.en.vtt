and stream that game Wi-Fi over the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.980 
and stream that game Wi-Fi over the
shield<00:00:55.220> device<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.670> fantastic<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:56.780> how<00:00:56.930> does

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
shield device is fantastic so how does

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.790 
shield device is fantastic so how does
that<00:00:57.260> work<00:00:57.550> well<00:00:58.550> we<00:00:58.700> throw<00:00:58.880> that<00:00:59.030> really<00:00:59.510> fast

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
that work well we throw that really fast

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.650 
that work well we throw that really fast
h.264<00:01:00.800> encoder<00:01:01.130> into<00:01:01.790> our<00:01:01.880> Kepler<00:01:02.239> chip<00:01:02.510> so

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
h.264 encoder into our Kepler chip so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.359 
h.264 encoder into our Kepler chip so
what<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.870> means<00:01:03.079> is<00:01:03.350> when<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:03.890> when<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.189> game

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
what it means is when you when the game

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.060 
what it means is when you when the game
is<00:01:04.519> launched<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.930> can<00:01:06.170> get<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:06.439> video<00:01:06.649> gets

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
is launched that can get that video gets

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.160 
is launched that can get that video gets
compressed<00:01:07.399> with<00:01:08.000> very<00:01:08.210> very<00:01:08.240> little<00:01:08.450> latency

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
compressed with very very little latency

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.130 
compressed with very very little latency
and<00:01:09.320> sent<00:01:09.920> by<00:01:10.130> Wi-Fi<00:01:10.700> into<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.570> device<00:01:11.899> and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
and sent by Wi-Fi into this device and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.569 
and sent by Wi-Fi into this device and
all<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:12.680> thing<00:01:12.920> has<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.189> do<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.430> use<00:01:13.549> the

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
all this thing has to do is use the

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.030 
all this thing has to do is use the
Tegra<00:01:13.939> 4<00:01:14.090> processor<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:15.079> decode<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:15.920> yeah

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
Tegra 4 processor to decode that so yeah

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.279 
Tegra 4 processor to decode that so yeah
very<00:01:16.189> low<00:01:16.430> latency<00:01:16.939> gameplay<00:01:17.359> in<00:01:17.990> your<00:01:18.139> own

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
very low latency gameplay in your own

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.410 
very low latency gameplay in your own
home<00:01:18.499> through<00:01:18.889> through<00:01:19.100> your<00:01:19.219> PC<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> shield

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
home through through your PC to a shield

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.510 
home through through your PC to a shield
so<00:01:21.139> it's<00:01:21.289> like<00:01:21.380> an<00:01:21.619> accelerated<00:01:22.280> remote

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
so it's like an accelerated remote

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.480 
so it's like an accelerated remote
desktop<00:01:23.030> from<00:01:23.749> your<00:01:23.929> PC<00:01:24.229> exactly<00:01:25.039> very<00:01:25.280> very

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
desktop from your PC exactly very very

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.399 
desktop from your PC exactly very very
low<00:01:25.639> latency<00:01:26.090> accelerate<00:01:26.509> desktop<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.109> it

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
low latency accelerate desktop and it

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.870 
low latency accelerate desktop and it
works<00:01:27.590> for<00:01:27.710> your<00:01:27.829> games<00:01:28.009> because<00:01:28.340> all<00:01:28.670> the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
works for your games because all the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.480 
works for your games because all the
controls<00:01:29.240> are<00:01:29.389> built<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.749> already<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.859> in

little bit about the battery life on the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.949 
little bit about the battery life on the
screen<00:01:46.639> so<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.119> built<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.539> very<00:01:47.659> substantial

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959

basically<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:17.380> know<00:03:17.500> what<00:03:17.739> gamers<00:03:18.130> will<00:03:18.250> get

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
basically you know what gamers will get

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.310 
basically you know what gamers will get
to<00:03:18.579> control<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.180> will<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:20.049> know<00:03:20.140> we're<00:03:20.290> very

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
to control this will you know we're very

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.930 
to control this will you know we're very
serious<00:03:20.769> about<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.130> controls<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.700> we<00:03:21.820> know

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
serious about the controls is we know

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.880 
serious about the controls is we know
people<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.420> enjoyed<00:03:22.750> playing<00:03:22.930> games<00:03:23.200> there<00:03:23.470> are

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
people I enjoyed playing games there are

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.110 
people I enjoyed playing games there are
pretty<00:03:24.130> frustrated<00:03:24.670> that's<00:03:24.820> why<00:03:24.940> they're

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
pretty frustrated that's why they're

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.930 
pretty frustrated that's why they're
connecting<00:03:25.870> deep<00:03:26.019> as<00:03:26.200> into<00:03:26.680> their<00:03:26.859> display<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
connecting deep as into their display to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.430 
connecting deep as into their display to
get<00:03:28.090> more<00:03:28.239> physical<00:03:28.600> controls<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.140> we've<00:03:29.290> done

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
get more physical controls so we've done

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.660 
get more physical controls so we've done
a<00:03:29.470> lot<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.709> work<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.130> looked<00:03:30.310> at<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.579> the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
a lot of work and looked at all the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.520 
a lot of work and looked at all the
gamepad's<00:03:31.030> out<00:03:31.239> there<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.810> build<00:03:32.200> out<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.350> very

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
gamepad's out there and build out a very

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.960 
gamepad's out there and build out a very
ergonomic<00:03:33.100> control<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.640> see<00:03:33.820> we<00:03:33.940> have

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
ergonomic control you can see we have

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.970 
ergonomic control you can see we have
two<00:03:34.150> analog<00:03:34.450> joysticks<00:03:34.930> d-pad<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.799> four

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
two analog joysticks d-pad the four

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.979 
two analog joysticks d-pad the four
buttons<00:03:36.280> as<00:03:36.609> well<00:03:36.850> on<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.030> rear<00:03:37.269> we<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:37.660> the

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
buttons as well on the rear we have the

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.720 
buttons as well on the rear we have the
shoulder<00:03:38.260> buttons<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.709> trigger<00:03:38.920> as<00:03:39.040> well<00:03:39.220> so

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
shoulder buttons and trigger as well so

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.569 
shoulder buttons and trigger as well so
it's<00:03:39.850> pretty<00:03:40.060> much<00:03:40.269> full<00:03:40.690> controls<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.859> think

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
it's pretty much full controls I think

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.979 
it's pretty much full controls I think
you<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:42.820> people<00:03:42.850> playing<00:03:43.390> this<00:03:43.570> versus

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
you know people playing this versus

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.630 
you know people playing this versus
someone<00:03:44.170> who's<00:03:44.440> on<00:03:44.590> touchscreen<00:03:45.100> it's<00:03:45.489> going

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
someone who's on touchscreen it's going

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.370 
someone who's on touchscreen it's going
to<00:03:45.670> be<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> world<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.150> difference<00:03:46.239> well<00:03:47.230> this

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
to be a world of difference well this
