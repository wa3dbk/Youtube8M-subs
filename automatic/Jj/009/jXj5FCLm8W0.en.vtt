that with now take your second piece of
ribbon<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:25.160> make<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> loop<00:00:27.109> put<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> second

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
ribbon and make a loop put the second

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.630 
ribbon and make a loop put the second
loop<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.939> first<00:00:30.150> loop<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.949> then<00:00:31.949> pull<00:00:32.399> on

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
loop in the first loop and then pull on

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.979 
loop in the first loop and then pull on
your<00:00:32.910> slip<00:00:33.180> knot<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:35.010> tighten<00:00:35.719> that<00:00:36.719> first

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
your slip knot to tighten that first

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
your slip knot to tighten that first
ribbon<00:00:37.290> down<00:00:37.590> around<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> second<00:00:38.520> ribbon

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
ribbon down around the second ribbon

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610 
ribbon down around the second ribbon
that's<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.590> just

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
that's all there is to it you just

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.970 
that's all there is to it you just
started<00:00:41.250> making<00:00:41.670> your<00:00:42.059> lay<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.290> your

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
started making your lay now on your

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.049 
started making your lay now on your
first<00:00:44.309> ribbon<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.149> my<00:00:45.390> red<00:00:46.370> come<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> long

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
first ribbon so my red come to the long

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.830 
first ribbon so my red come to the long
end<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.860> loop<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.969> doesn't<00:00:51.719> really

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
end and make a loop it doesn't really

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.080 
end and make a loop it doesn't really
matter<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.620> fold<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.039> front<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.520> back<00:00:53.730> just

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
matter if you fold it front or back just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
matter if you fold it front or back just
be<00:00:54.239> consistent<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.500> fold<00:00:55.649> front<00:00:55.949> so

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
be consistent I like to fold front so

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.639 
be consistent I like to fold front so
make<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> loop<00:00:57.180> pull<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.140> through<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.090> then

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
make a loop pull it through and then

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.260 
make a loop pull it through and then
snug<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:03.199> just<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.500> that

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
snug it down just like that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.210 
snug it down just like that
come<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> long<00:01:06.810> end<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.710> second

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
come to the long end of your second

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
come to the long end of your second
ribbon<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.850> white<00:01:09.350> make<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> loop<00:01:12.110> pull<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
ribbon so my white make a loop pull it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.609 
ribbon so my white make a loop pull it
through<00:01:14.570> up<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.020> got<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.500> bit

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
through up that one got a little bit

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.520 
through up that one got a little bit
long<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:17.070> no<00:01:17.340> problem<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.259> if<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.380> ribbon

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
long there no problem and if your ribbon

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.679 
long there no problem and if your ribbon
does<00:01:19.860> try<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> fold<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
does try to fold make sure to get it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.200 
does try to fold make sure to get it
nice<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.290> flat<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.490> any<00:01:23.640> folds

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
nice and flat you don't want any folds

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.310 
nice and flat you don't want any folds
in<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:25.170> loop<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> twist<00:01:26.729> my

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
in your loop so I need to twist my

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.880 
in your loop so I need to twist my
ribbon<00:01:28.320> around<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.640> fix<00:01:30.229> that<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.470> kink

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
ribbon around to fix that little kink

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.080 
ribbon around to fix that little kink
okay<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:34.710> gets<00:01:34.829> way<00:01:35.100> easier<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> hold<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.939> all

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
okay it gets way easier to hold this all

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
okay it gets way easier to hold this all
together<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:38.520> more

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
together as you get going and get more

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.480 
together as you get going and get more
loops<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.150> hold<00:01:39.299> everything<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.810> place<00:01:40.490> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
loops to hold everything in place so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.670 
loops to hold everything in place so
come<00:01:42.030> back<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.659> long<00:01:42.930> end<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.380> first

that<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.680> literally

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that is all you do to that's literally

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.690 
that is all you do to that's literally
it<00:01:59.250> to<00:02:00.000> make<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.360> simple<00:02:00.869> two<00:02:01.500> ribbon<00:02:01.890> lay<00:02:02.100> just

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
it to make a simple two ribbon lay just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910 
it to make a simple two ribbon lay just
keep<00:02:02.880> repeating<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.420> process<00:02:03.570> over<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
keep repeating that process over and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
keep repeating that process over and
over<00:02:04.979> again<00:02:05.490> until<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.600> make<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> lay<00:02:07.020> as

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
over again until you make the lay as

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290 
over again until you make the lay as
long<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> want<00:02:07.950> which<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> usually<00:02:09.119> about

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
long as you want which is usually about

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.020 
long as you want which is usually about
a<00:02:09.539> yard<00:02:10.020> 36<00:02:10.679> inches<00:02:11.009> or<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.370> maybe<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.970> little

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
a yard 36 inches or so maybe a little

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.070 
a yard 36 inches or so maybe a little
bit<00:02:12.270> longer

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
bit longer

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.330 
bit longer
depends<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.560> who<00:02:13.710> you're<00:02:13.830> going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> give<00:02:14.220> it
