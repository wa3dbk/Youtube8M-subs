so as you can see right now just playing
a<00:00:10.530> little<00:00:10.740> I'll<00:00:10.800> explain<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.340> method<00:00:11.660> in<00:00:12.660> just

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
a little I'll explain the method in just

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.490 
a little I'll explain the method in just
a<00:00:12.960> moment

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
a moment

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.220 
a moment
but<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.160> see<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> most<00:00:15.630> part<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
but here you can see for the most part I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680 
but here you can see for the most part I
stay<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.160> one<00:00:17.400> corner<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.600> do

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
stay in this one corner and you can do

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.529 
stay in this one corner and you can do
that<00:00:18.810> until<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.560> 300<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.880> then<00:00:21.420> you

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that until you get to 300 and then you

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.750 
that until you get to 300 and then you
have<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.750> move<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.740> very<00:00:22.830> simple<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
have to move but it's very simple you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.210 
have to move but it's very simple you
can<00:00:23.939> gain<00:00:24.689> more<00:00:24.720> than<00:00:25.080> 500<00:00:25.529> points<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.010> just

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
can gain more than 500 points it's just

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.700 
can gain more than 500 points it's just
this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> pretty<00:00:27.810> easy<00:00:28.019> way<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.380> gain

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
this is a pretty easy way to just gain

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.790 
this is a pretty easy way to just gain
500<00:00:29.039> points<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.720> continue<00:00:31.650> on

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
500 points and they can continue on

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
500 points and they can continue on
after<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.340> once<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.700> 300<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.270> move

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
after that so once you get 300 you move

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.590 
after that so once you get 300 you move
to<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.540> corner<00:00:33.930> until<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> 350<00:00:35.600> then

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to that corner until you get to 350 then

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
to that corner until you get to 350 then
you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.930> move<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> basically<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you can move up and basically have to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.580 
you can move up and basically have to
ride<00:00:38.850> along<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.239> wall<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.750> dodging

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
ride along this wall just dodging

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.450 
ride along this wall just dodging
everything<00:00:41.570> trying<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.379> far<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
everything trying to get as far as you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:54.139 
everything trying to get as far as you
can<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.090> get<00:00:51.329> exactly<00:00:51.690> 500<00:00:52.410> yet<00:00:53.149> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
can and I think I get exactly 500 yet so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.610 
can and I think I get exactly 500 yet so
basically<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.020> first<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.469> up

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
basically what you do first is go up

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.410 
basically what you do first is go up
then<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> top<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:57.030> corner

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
then you go into the top right corner

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.560 
then you go into the top right corner
and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.309> once<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> square<00:00:59.850> comes<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and then once this square comes you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.750 
and then once this square comes you
circle<00:01:01.079> around<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:02.280> you're<00:01:02.579> free<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
circle around it and then you're free to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.219 
circle around it and then you're free to
go<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> bottom<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.510> corner<00:01:03.570> until<00:01:04.140> you

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
go to the bottom right corner until you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
go to the bottom right corner until you
get<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> 300<00:01:04.739> points<00:01:07.729> then<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.060> wait

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
get to 300 points then you can just wait

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.890 
get to 300 points then you can just wait
there<00:01:15.350> these<00:01:16.350> blocks<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:17.070> hit<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.600> they<00:01:18.600> go

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
there these blocks don't hit you they go

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.660 
there these blocks don't hit you they go
the<00:01:19.049> same<00:01:19.229> direction<00:01:19.530> every<00:01:19.770> single<00:01:20.159> game<00:01:20.310> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the same direction every single game so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
the same direction every single game so
you'll<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.439> know<00:01:22.560> there's<00:01:22.740> no

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you'll know you know there's no

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.990 
you'll know you know there's no
difference<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.700> always<00:01:23.820> do

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
difference you know you can always do

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.810 
difference you know you can always do
this<00:01:24.090> method<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:25.590> once<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:25.950> 300<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.580> one

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this method now once you're 300 that one

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
this method now once you're 300 that one
the<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.390> large<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the one large one is really the one you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.890 
the one large one is really the one you
can<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.340> comes<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:30.240> 350

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
can look out for that one comes then 350

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.319 
can look out for that one comes then 350
it's<00:01:31.049> gonna<00:01:31.170> come<00:01:31.409> into<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.619> corner<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> now

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
it's gonna come into your corner and now

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's gonna come into your corner and now
you<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.570> ride<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.869> edge<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:35.119> you'll<00:01:36.119> be

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you just ride this edge and you'll be

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
you just ride this edge and you'll be
pretty<00:01:36.509> much<00:01:36.600> safe<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.079> long<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> keep<00:01:37.710> an

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
pretty much safe as long as you keep an

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.219 
pretty much safe as long as you keep an
eye<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.070> everything<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:39.020> don't<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
eye out for everything I don't think I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
eye out for everything I don't think I
make<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> no<00:01:40.850> 453<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.299> still<00:01:42.540> pretty

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
make it no 453 but that's still pretty

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.200 
make it no 453 but that's still pretty
good<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.229> think<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> score<00:01:44.610> 500

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
good I think with the score 500

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.609 
good I think with the score 500
something<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.750> rank<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:48.200> 260,000<00:01:49.200> people<00:01:49.470> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
something I rank out of 260,000 people I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.210 
something I rank out of 260,000 people I
think<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.920> 3000<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> top<00:01:51.479> 10%

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
think it's 3000 so you're in the top 10%

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.359 
think it's 3000 so you're in the top 10%
you're<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> basically<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> top<00:01:54.420> 1%<00:01:55.369> so

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you're in the basically the top 1% so

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're in the basically the top 1% so
that's<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:56.729> good<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.079> basically
