00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.149
 for this month of March 2014 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.470
 the figaroscope embarked on the 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.770
 list of the best lemon cake 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.080
 of Paris in the presence of our expert the 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.609
 pastry chef christophe felder 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.410
 when we eat the case we need 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.590
 really lemon taste first and 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.360
 a rather soft texture anyway 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.250
 to make a lemon cake at home 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.600
 games already must must there the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.860
 good recipe in general it's a 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.020
 recipe where you will find the 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.640
 liquid cream sometimes coming from the cream 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.469
 thick cream for a little bit 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.539
 acidity 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:38.840
 it's often melted butter always 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:42.200
 zest of grated lemon 1 euro 1 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.610
 lemon lemon rapon but also a little bit of 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.610
 sometimes not always 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.000
 never a lime for cakes 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.500
 because there the taste of lime has 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.770
 tendency to distort a bit at the 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.770
 baking 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.170
 what is important is not to put 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.280
 too much dough in a mold that 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.380
 excite it may be a little more 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.700
 small so we already have a better 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.700
 texture cooking is easier 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 what is good is to 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.550
 take out the ingredients the day before to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.290
 be tempered what success 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.340
 of a cake also depends on the texture of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.780
 the dough and thigh started a little 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.870
 warmer and then you go down to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 20 minutes from 10 to 20 degrees 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.540
 always in oven bake vented you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.420
 in fact two you can in frozen 1 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.100
 and in this case where you take it out the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.930
 eve wanted it's really good 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.990
 get back to temperature you will do the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.500
 finish just I'm not an hour before 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.500
 enjoy it 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.820
 if you want the glass and therefore sugar 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.460
 ice and water half man half 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 lemon juice one mixes makes a small 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.550
 icing a little pasty and we pass it 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.840
 baked humilite to 160 of wine which 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.100
 lemon everyone loves as much we have 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.020
 reluctance with candied fruits 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.310
 in fruit chess as much as the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.880
 lemon it's really universal 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.590
 it's a bit like the member after 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.520
 having tasted blindly a small 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.470
 twenty cake 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.720
 we awarded the place of winner 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.500
 with closed stone who gets the note of 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.500
 these 20 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.330
 ours comes second with 15 out of 20 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.000
 heeled by carl marletti with 14 and 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.100
 half of 20 very different visually 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 these three cases that we have seduced by 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.540
 their freshness their texture and their 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.430
 delicious lemon taste like every 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.620
 times the quality of products and the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.770
 mastery of the pastry chef did the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.770
 difference
