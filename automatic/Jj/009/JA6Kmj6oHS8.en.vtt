00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:09.770
 the poems wines and the novels photos 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.770
 planets that rain that move 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.109
 and that, as they are, I hope they are 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.539
 very well welcome a secret of 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.820
 jeta 5 super bastards one of the most 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.099
 I liked it is called the pyramid 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.989
 illuminati we're literally going to see the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.899
 illuminated pyramid a representation 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.849
 we have to go to the galileo observatory 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.559
 to the galileo observatory is 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.539
 here ignore the map that is not 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.910
 unlocked because I'm passing another 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.559
 once elgeta 5 in another console so for 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.110
 that I have nothing unlocked today 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.550
 Click egg stole the video is not 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.650
 do not steal it from me, I 'm just 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.450
 recording it from another console I do not know if 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.850
 out there you agree on the map that 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.680
 comes the limited edition of the gta where 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.170
 they mark all the mysteries all the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.050
 things related to aliens mark them 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.690
 in phosphorescent blue this is a 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.940
 of the locations and says shoot the 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
 stars shoot the stars I was made 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.050
 strange especially because they see here there 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.969
 a sniper there's a sniper 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.130
 then the phrase is indicated in this 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.659
 place and says shoot the stars not 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.280
 you think that's all today just 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.380
 You found a sniper and already here 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.600
 I show the image this is the whole map 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.190
 then we put zuma this place where 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.100
 says for the stars 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.980
 for the stars we zoom in and 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.350
 we see an eye with stars nothing out of 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.660
 the common good is an eye we can say 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.520
 is the Illuminati eye but until then there 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.890
 there is nothing clear there is no like that still 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.140
 is essalud and beyond the skewer roe 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.400
 Liar here is when he gets bastard 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.980
 you have to approach with a helicopter 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.350
 and you have to find a way to line up 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.690
 the tower with the eye to find the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.610
 silhouette of the illuminati pyramid are 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.220
 watching my stripes on the screen 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.350
 with 20 the raffle is very loaded 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.150
 because I had a hard time point it was 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.400
 difficult to handle the helicopter so that 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.040
 will be aligned and so it looks straight ahead and 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.140
 so you see from afar see here next to them 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.690
 I put the image of the illuminati symbol 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.450
 of the logo that is the best known this 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.729
 is super chingÃ³n let's say that the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.229
 little red dot on top many say that 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.149
 it's an antenna but if you approach it it's not 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.310
 an antenna is like a red ball 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.540
 floating like they did not put the antenna and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.830
 it's a bug like that 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.510
 then try to shoot at the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.730
 stars to see if something happened because 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.950
 the note of it shoots towards the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.900
 stars what I did was shoot at 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.670
 the stars that were in the eye without 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.620
 Any doubt this is one of the secrets 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.720
 impressed you can not see it in a way 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.569
 simple you have to find the way to 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.000
 align the remaining tower with the eye and 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.290
 is the perfect silhouette very logical that 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.510
 you have marked it in the observatory 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.730
 galileo then meta assumes this the eye 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.370
 go aligns whether this form of leaves 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.110
 pyramid down the green if I believe 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.000
 that can be like the lighting that goes 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.130
 coming out of the photo I do a 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.110
 incredible secret he wanted them 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.480
 share not so that when you're there 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.180
 conversing with the friends of gta les 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.340
 talk is this secret is very very 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.519
 nobody had found it and here 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.010
 there is the illuminati pyramid in jeta 5 and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.140
 no it's not a bastard picture is aligned 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.880
 everything is perfect to mishima so the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.340
 that are behind rockstar the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.110
 managers are iluminatis are iluminatis 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.790
 that's my bastard theory up here I'm going to 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.410
