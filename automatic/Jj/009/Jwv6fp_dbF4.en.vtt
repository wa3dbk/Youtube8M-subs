 students being in the elections is 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 a pride and having been summoned with 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.559
 the selection is a prize for a good year 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.969
 individual but also in collective already 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.670
 that we have played a good season 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.800
 this year if always the like each 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.089
 selection is a prize for work 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.369
 for everything you've done 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.380
 and it not always is good you can improve 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.450
 the selection means you the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.429
 deserved and that you've been ahead of 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.159
 other tura kids and I think it's 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.770
 an individual prize that I could have 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.380
 could have opted even in the preselection 16 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.929
 and good next year I will try to be 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.439
 in the next of the selection come to 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.750
 campus mostly brings me to win 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.219
 fitness because we train with 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.469
 guys who are taller and stronger 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.929
 that we can compete with them 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.429
 it makes us arrive with more 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.890
 superiority and that gives them their 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.630
 individual training come to campus if 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.459
 coming directly brings me to be able to improve 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.009
 the aspects that maybe I could not 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.390
 develop both in the preselection 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.489
 improvements a lot because players come 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.929
 very good technically and you get details 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:51.280
 of them the coaches correct you 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.080
 much more thoroughly to be a group 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.300
 limited special and 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.740
 and I do not know how to live with your players what 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.090
 that brings me come and the campus is power 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.470
 train with guys that's always 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.290
 well because you have more physical you have to 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.720
 draw more resources think more do 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.880
 dishes faster and it 's much better 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.970
 Well, here we work a lot of 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.930
 individual aspects of shooting jackpot and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.940
 things like that and also pass aspects 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.140
 collective the burials of this 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.970
 special group with international 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.470
 they are different from the rest of the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.440
 participants on campus the top the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.400
 more specialized basketball 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.140
 training is much more specific 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.720
 because it focuses more player per player 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.730
 and as they know us they make us improve 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 things that we fail the most 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.180
 day to day is hard because there are many 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.360
 hours training physically and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.510
 technically and it is very tired there is 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.840
 rest and that's fine because the day to day 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.150
 is we got up we had breakfast 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.480
 we train technician then physical we eat 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.950
 physical technical nap and to sleep but 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.510
 simply on campus specifically 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.520
 by knowing us know what we have to 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.990
 and help us improve 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.760
 to be able to develop all our 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.650
 potential as the day to day we have 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.420
 is we woke up with everyone and 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.800
 we have breakfast we go to train and then 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.810
 we make weights come back and sleep a 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.940
 and we do the same thing again 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.320
 we have almost free time the high center 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.760
 sports performance of sierra nevada 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.320
 it is the place of preparation of many 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.670
 first level athletes the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.290
 international students have 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.550
 coincided for example many 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.650
 sportsmen who prepare the games 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.270
 Paralympics of London Cyber ​​Athletes 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.640
 that this year they will also play the 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.390
 Olympics motivates us a lot besides 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.120
 they work very serious 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.590
 I do not know how there is another different environment 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.430
 to see people who are preparing with 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.290
 the games is this is fine because 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.690
 you do not think is that everyone can 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.010
 arrive and they are here working and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.780
 wait for the paralympics the truth that 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.140
 it is very good to train with people 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.240
 for olympic in kart as motivates 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.150
 a lot because you see how he concentrates on 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.770
 how they work according to their limitations and 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.140
 they prepare for a competition and 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.700
 that gives you motivation if you want 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.410
 get here in the kart with athletes 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.360
 paralympics that are an example of 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.680
 overcoming and do not show us how 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.989
 we have to work to improve 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.489
 yes especially to see it motivates you to see 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.650
 the athletes who are preparing for 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.739
 the paralympics because it's like that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.930
 they make an extra effort to be here not 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.060
 they surrender they have the problem they have 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.070
 go ahead and see them go for it 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.239
 is a motivation and who has tried the 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.680
 experience of being summoned by the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.910
 Spanish team has clear that 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.940
 wants to repeat and be again 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.500
 international 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.530
 is again in selections and that 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.720
 would be a goal because if they throw you 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.070
 you always want to go back and I think that 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.230
 I have a gap that I can have if 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.970
 work because it is difficult to be in 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.740
 the final list of the friendship tournament 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.630
 because there are very good people in my position 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.060
 but good to see what can be done and my 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.240
 objective and one of them is that but 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.920
 we have mainly the team the 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.740
 the selection to stay would be a 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.800
 very important goal but it is not the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.660
 I do not play a good year either, it's me 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.130
 but the most important thing well I'll go another 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.720
 once called with the selection would be a 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.790
 prize for me I think I'm 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.320
 working well to go then if there 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.100
 people ahead who deserves it 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.100
 They will go
