he's more than ever motivate he believes

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.849 
he's more than ever motivate he believes
and<00:03:01.690> his<00:03:01.780> team<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.959> horses<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.500> he<00:03:02.590> wants<00:03:02.799> to

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
and his team of horses that he wants to

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.200 
and his team of horses that he wants to
do<00:03:02.980> well<00:03:03.130> for<00:03:03.310> his<00:03:03.430> owners

do well for his owners
yeah<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.900> suppose<00:03:05.560> that's<00:03:05.980> one<00:03:06.130> of<00:03:06.190> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
yeah and I suppose that's one of the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.680 
yeah and I suppose that's one of the
reasons<00:03:06.520> why<00:03:06.580> he's<00:03:06.730> lasted<00:03:07.060> as<00:03:07.180> long<00:03:07.210> as<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.570> is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
reasons why he's lasted as long as it is

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.080 
reasons why he's lasted as long as it is
I<00:03:07.930> guess<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.980> owners<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.520> important<00:03:10.000> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
I guess the owners are so important and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.050 
I guess the owners are so important and
