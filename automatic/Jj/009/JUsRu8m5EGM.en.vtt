00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.720
 Bakiev refugee at djalal-abad marina for three years 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.870
 above the rdr so I explain you are I will try to you 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.220
 explain the outlines 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.400
 from the rare breed to the mountain 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 so first in the spring every owner on his cows 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.400
 in front of his stable to walk his flock 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.790
 he had to after the flock will determine luthor recognize m those 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.499
 who are gaining all the verbena areas of his flock 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:36.730
 then every owner about 17 18 and then if the attorney hassan hemmar 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 it even buy them the mountain for the first week of the day 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.870
 that day it's a big feast day for the owner is a big day 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.610
 fighting for cows 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.720
 so all the flock chickens of all the clubs owning and 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.640
 shuffle them day 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.510
 to determine a queen 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.880
 the queen and the cow that does not operate any other way h of the whole flock 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.760
 and to become queen reindeer it is imperative that the cow last night 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.980
 returning the cows to the stables on the last evening of meadow do not lose any 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 other cow 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 this year for example as of rage that lose that of a cow 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.850
 that is to say, we stop dreaming at a cross of cows grazing a 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.350
 cow 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.350
 so there is no real 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.470
 then in principle remains if this week in the mountains down to this 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.620
 which lies between 1700 meters of altitude 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.490
 the 2100 meters 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.780
 we have stables for 120 animals 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.280
 then so much in fact the small transhumance for the stables of the high 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.370
 which city between the pasture is between 2100 meters and 2350 meters 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 we stay for about six weeks 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.049
 then we go down for three weeks to the stables from below 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.720
 to eat the recovery 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.350
 and then the owners in principle around 20 to 27 September 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.230
 come back euros they take back their beasts embarrassed to let him eat 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.230
 around the stables being very versatile 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.740
 we have 120 beasts here I have to make a classification that is to say that I can 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.920
 to make a classification I must note a classification which is established in herd 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.359
 that is to say 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.089
 who which cows struggle with breeding to determine the queen 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:16.119
 the second the third so on as well as the ranking for the 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.239
 heifers 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.239
 who are already sinking that does not bother them 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:24.249
 p of the leading roles so the first words are cows that come who have 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.289
 saw a solo 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:31.119
 the bulk of the work here is of course but the rats changsha and do the 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.899
 parks because all the doors or windows we are in are 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.899
 cows are parked in parks with picks and wires 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.169
 I want to clarify that the breed of herens the goal naturally 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.099
 we must not believe that she interferes with let's push one against 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.449
 the other or whatever 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.449
 we are delighted only to see the limits 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.269
 herds but in no case do we push only the mage against another for 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.799
 make it tsl 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.419
 only natural 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.579
 a cow who does not want to fight with another 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.859
 we will naturally go away and bow down before her 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.229
 like cows since it's already quite small the first year that a 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.429
 little put them together they're already starting to fight a little bit 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.419
 and after 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.809
 a queen can weigh up to 800 kilos 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.590
 it's still pretty impressive a struggle can last from 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.849
 do not believe it half an hour 40 minutes 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.909
 it depends on any slippage 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.219
 sometimes it's really very very intense when it hurts but 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.509
 it still happens 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.159
 so what I have to do as a shepherd master has the choice between 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.549
 cows stable 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.200
 I do not understand I know it's ugly but it's disinfection 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.119
 evening 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.979
 if necessary this program is called veterinarian or the owner 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.319
 efforts to connect 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.389
 but it is rare that he has very serious accidents 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.769
 with the struggles 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.760
 at the end of the page all the cows are recovered by their owner 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.199
 and going down to her house with a big smile 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.829
 and the lungs filled with fresh air
