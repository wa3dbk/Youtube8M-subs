00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.599
 good hello to all dear friends 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.440
 welcome back in the company of the boss wurtz 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.870
 86 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.199
 today we are going to see two covers and for the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.520
 our htc one m82 cover and I have to say 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.710
 which are very different from each other but the 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.390
 I prefer and together so I don't know 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 really which one to choose between the two 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.849
 I'm on the left we have from clearco 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.160
 because it's a cover that we say to most 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.469
 thrifty in taking into account in ours 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.899
 at home 50 m 8 while on the right 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.680
 we have a slightly finer cover 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.820
 paintings 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 in fact I would say very fine 0.3 mm thick 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.620
 and it is a cover and with a worse grip 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.500
 compared to the creative cover but certainly 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.020
 it already has a lot of design and color 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.940
 strengths his favor we go immediately 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.640
 to insert the clear cover 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.190
 meanwhile I tell you that within the 0 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.409
 3 mm also find a film for the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.080
 boxwood display what you do not find 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.500
 inside the clark over to the hacker 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 cover is that we are going to insert it in the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 our htc one m ott giving off the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.790
 display because you know that the gesture 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
 within our bread m 8 are 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.680
 always with us 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.439
 then it fits first into the part 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
 lower 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.600
 you see it too 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.600
 here it is 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.380
 here is the acli arcore but how 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.630
 you can see we have a back that yes 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.880
 he sees quietly well since there is 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.520
 a transparent plastic inside 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.659
 app the cover areas we have free 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.369
 access to dual flash led camera at 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.159
 second microphone for suppression 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.770
 of environmental noise to the clear 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.000
 second camera free access too 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.049
 to the headphone jack and to the input for 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 the micro usb 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.380
 we also have the power on fire off button 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.209
 and the volume key you press 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.989
 really good 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.079
 a hacker cover that offers a grip 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.840
 exceptional just does not slip 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.970
 this htc juan n 8 and I must say that it is 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.970
 a cover recourse that I recommend to everyone 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.799
 those who want precisely 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.329
 safeguard this device one 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.120
 cover and that in my opinion if it will go to 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.130
 scratching quinnell a part back is 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.130
 normal that at least the others are like that 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.380
 is who hardcover had this defect e 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.000
 I believe that even if I would like to bring them 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.359
 behind, however, the cover that if 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.680
 we want to bring our htc one m8 in 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.220
 this way we can do it here 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.470
 quietly without fear that the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.819
 our device is damaged 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.370
 the frame instead of the 03 mm uncover 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.799
 I would say slightly different from the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.549
 from the true arc meanwhile we go to 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.440
 as always insert it always starting 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.500
 from below 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.750
 we have to go and enlarge the two 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.870
 end 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.030
 here then a va beh except for the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.090
 my coloring of my 8's that gold 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.130
 so with this phosphorescent yellow 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.650
 maybe it's not the combination 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.590
 however, look how you know 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.490
 the finest and almost I trust the display 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.620
 compared to arcore then free access 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.100
 also here on the dual camera at 2 flashes 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.140
 lED 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.980
 to the microphone according to the suppression 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.260
 ambient noise micro usb jack jack 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.380
 Sorry headphone jack and input 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.410
 Micro USB keys that are free are not 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.500
 free nano micro sim inputs 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.120
 sim and micro sd and live infrared that 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.880
 the rate also works well free 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.760
 power of allah fuss if you don't have 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.760
 we need to say to protect in 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.640
 absolute way your htc one m8 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.230
 then at 10 July open mm according to me is a 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.010
 promised place between having a protection 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.020
 but don't feel the weight while at that a 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.360
 cover and I absolutely recommend it to whom 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.610
 he is a thrifty person of his 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.920
 device a person who cares for us 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.440
 really the aesthetic that does not interest 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.440
 going to ruin maybe the back of the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.140
 cover but interested in using the best 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.710
 his htc one m82 products completely 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.690
 different offered by ass www.pooh.it for 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.160
 go see the two covers and vi 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.740
 I will clearly leave all the links in 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.140
 description we feel like we always do 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.700
 in the next videorecensione a greeting 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.700
 from the boss quest 86
