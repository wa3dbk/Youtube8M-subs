00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.219
 Mount St. Helens is located in 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.670
 the American west in the state of 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.309
 Washington 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.849
 and it's been more than a century and more 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.620
 eruptions 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.500
 it really surprised us that they 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.880
 wake up it began March 20, 1980 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.180
 when had small earthquakes under the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.369
 volcano 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.470
 then around March 27 and explosions 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.730
 of steam at the top and then so on 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.740
 while the northern flank of the volcano is 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.240
 inflated he swelled more and more 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.510
 they second made one meter fifty by 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.519
 day 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.710
 so that's kind of a huge 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.629
 intimidates nice sense + 2 of blisters 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.280
 gigantic on the north flank that was 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.390
 due to the pressure of the magma that rose 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 who were ascending who were climbing 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.080
 wanted to go out and after a month and 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.299
 half this is this this kind of 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.659
 blisters had 150 meters of 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:49.610
 height is then May 18, 1980 ago 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.799
 had a strong earthquake of magnitude 5 1 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.690
 which has shaken the volcano and therefore 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.110
 it's for sure breath slid on the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.600
 north flank 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.129
 it gave a huge avalanche 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.019
 three cubic kilometers of products are 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.210
 descended this the northern flank of the volcano have 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.189
 devastated and therefore the volcano 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.530
 was beheaded so all of a sudden the 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.299
 gas pressure fell and the whole 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.950
 magma pressure was able to release it 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.780
 gives a huge vertical explosion 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.260
 so a plume of ash that is mounted 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.840
 at 25 km height and especially at the same 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.090
 time a horizontal breath that went 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.070
 northward fan-shaped and this 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.200
 breath fillet at 1000 kilometers hours to 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.120
 a temperature of 300 degrees it has everything 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.350
 the vast and up to 30 km north of the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.350
 volcano in less than two minutes 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.550
 and finally the mudslides are 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.050
 descended the flanks of the volcano and these 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.630
 mudslides have devastated everything in 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.360
 valleys up to 60 km from the satellite 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.190
 it was actually a huge eruption and 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.020
 we can say that it is actually the most 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.090
 big explosion of the century since 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.640
 the explosion of saint-helens May 18, 81 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.100
 that's equivalent to 27 miles bomb 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.140
 atomic like to say to me also ben me who 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.520
 knew the saint-helens before I 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.500
 can you tell that I did not know 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.240
 frankly more where I was since the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.380
 the valets been completely filled with 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.340
 mud of the hills had been completely 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.440
 shaved all over their surface 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 the spirit lake that was north of the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.090
 volcano had gone up about sixty 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.869
 meters because of this avalanche of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.580
 blocks that had fallen in 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.350
 all the trees were lying these 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.630
 tall douglas pines they were all 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.740
 lying in the direction of the breath he 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.470
 no longer had side branches 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.150
 it was completely and full-bodied by the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.570
 breath because the breath he acted like 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.310
 a gigantic sandy species that has 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.900
 felled the trees and who has them 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.850
 completely polished on the surface 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.470
 in the case of Saint Helens we had 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.970
 evacuated and for a month he does not know 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.320
 nothing else pass the volcano was calm 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.090
 so to popular pressure 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.410
 fantastic and even political so that 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.459
 people can come back and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.780
 luckily kept them at 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.970
 outside because if we did not have 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.410
 done there would have been 35 thousand dead and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.150
 luckily the explosion came 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.390
 find that finally we had 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.390
 reason 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.670
 in this rash unfortunately 57 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.930
 people were killed of volcanologists 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.330
 two colleagues 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.239
 and then 55 people who were curious 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.170
 who are infiltrated into the area 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.209
 while we were there there was 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.310
 several explosions of the big plume of 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.769
 ashes rising to 18 km in height 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.359
 and especially their tablecloths it's 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.019
 a very exciting phenomenon for 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.790
 the volcanologist 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.030
 because it goes down the flanks of the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.319
 High Speed ​​Volcano 300,400 km to 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.840
 time and temperatures of 500 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.340
 degrees and it happened to us from the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.180
 drop on a slick of think they 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.670
 were coming into place 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.560
 so that was fabulous because 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.669
 that the helicopter of the senses and when they 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.989
 arrive at the level of the tablecloth 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.299
 there are all these bridges which starts to 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.319
 steal it's an amazing cloud and 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.700
 it's very bad for the turbines 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.010
 helicopters by the way he fled then 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.930
 classified several but when we land 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.269
 that we start walking on this type o 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.430
 it's a big moment because this deposit 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.260
 it is fluidized circulating saturated with gas 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.219
 and when we start putting our foot on 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.989
 this deposit is sinking right away and at 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.510
 15 cm deep there are still 100 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.159
 degrees and we measured with a term at 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.900
 couples so a thermometer the 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.599
 temperature under our feet to one meter 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.669
 fifty know 750 degrees and the degree 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.810
 rent creation will be an ash age 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.620
 who were getting up who took a form of 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.239
 atomic mushroom 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.769
 we rush into the car 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.680
 arrives at the airport more helicopters 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.259
 all parties I find a plane a little 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.430
 cease and Thursday pilots to the holy 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.989
 Helen and he did not want it at all 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.949
 go that way so that was the downright 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.419
 a plane hijacking 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.889
 we boarded him here you 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.959
 leave saint-helens direction saint 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.400
 Helen and we go to Saint Helens 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.080
 sent that plume that was weakening that 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 weakened who was also weakening 18 years 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.669
 will miss it we come to the level of 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.139
 saint-helens more activity will you say 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.479
 again we missed it we really did 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.530
 I would have preferred the plane to fall there 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.820
 crushes so much it was appalling 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.400
 for me anyway 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.080
 and then happily a huge one 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.669
 explosion occurred at that time 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.380
 more beautiful than the first highest 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.940
 she climbed to so 30 km from 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.830
 height it's a kind of column of 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.159
 huge ash that is mounted in the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.139
 sky 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:51.930
 it was absolutely fabulous we shot 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.400
 around for 2h30 until the night 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.449
 this is one of my greatest moments 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.370
 existence we had the impression 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.659
 to attend 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.789
 the apocalypse is and at the same time the 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.469
 light and is fantastic then quoted the 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.060
 sunset has become everything 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.680
 red wine red wine because of the 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.979
 diffraction of light on 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.979
 ash particles it was a beauty 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.979
 hell
