00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.610
 Hello everyone, I'm also with one day I want to see something 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.920
 I don't know if the word for word is quite unique 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:11.919
 this is a bunch of magic 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.750
 in the cornea natural in new york city 1996 1996 giorgio baxter 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.519
 why this 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.900
 my story a little sloppy 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.949
 that 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.949
 from the brother year 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.929
 camastra events 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.970
 miniclip 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 here is the signature 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.070
 This 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.320
 March effects 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.820
 and of the arcades the golden edges 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 yes certified 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.990
 the authenticity of this deck that 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.400
 if I'm not mistaken it's not usable 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.370
 defenseless on a tournament let's forget we say that it is only a collection of works we say 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.640
 play with friends 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.260
 these are echo instead 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.570
 cards are used to make 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.960
 and prostheses 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 photos of in English 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 original cards 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.040
 torte baxter reteeeeee I think it came in fourth 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.880
 in the new york tournament 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 however the cards 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.900
 they are in perfect condition 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.030
 with this one really holds 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 multum a mortgage document 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.620
 let's say that at that time there weren't many card combinations 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.920
 they could do 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 however this is a competitive deck 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.880
 let's say for that era 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.299
 today it could very well be 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.299
 contrast let's say 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.539
 free in short now in third time 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.539
 athens in case of all the cards 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.519
 in short, there is no need 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.419
 see package details I don't know if it is 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.829
 in sees well 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.829
 let's say shabby by time 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.739
