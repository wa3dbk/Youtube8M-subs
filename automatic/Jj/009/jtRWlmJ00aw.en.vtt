pouch now the recommended rpm for this

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.190 
pouch now the recommended rpm for this
application<00:03:19.450> it's<00:03:20.450> gonna<00:03:20.570> be<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> lot<00:03:20.930> higher

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
application it's gonna be a lot higher

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.970 
application it's gonna be a lot higher
than<00:03:21.440> usual

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
than usual

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.170 
than usual
most<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.430> time<00:03:22.580> in<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.790> high<00:03:22.940> speed

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
most of the time in the high speed

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.140 
most of the time in the high speed
application<00:03:23.900> we<00:03:24.680> use<00:03:24.709> anywhere<00:03:25.250> from<00:03:25.670> twelve

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
application we use anywhere from twelve

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.560 
application we use anywhere from twelve
to<00:03:26.480> sixteen<00:03:26.900> hundred<00:03:27.050> rpms<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.970> make<00:03:29.330> this

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
to sixteen hundred rpms but to make this

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.020 
to sixteen hundred rpms but to make this
technique<00:03:30.140> successful<00:03:31.100> we've<00:03:31.610> learned<00:03:31.880> that

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
technique successful we've learned that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.650 
technique successful we've learned that
we<00:03:32.120> need<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:32.360> start<00:03:32.510> at<00:03:32.630> about<00:03:32.690> 2,000<00:03:33.320> rpms<00:03:33.709> so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
we need to start at about 2,000 rpms so

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.270 
we need to start at about 2,000 rpms so
I'm<00:03:35.660> going<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.870> adjust<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.290> toggle<00:03:36.890> switch<00:03:37.100> to

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
I'm going to adjust the toggle switch to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.820 
I'm going to adjust the toggle switch to
about<00:03:37.459> two<00:03:37.640> thousand<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.500> let<00:03:39.500> me<00:03:39.590> go<00:03:39.709> ahead

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
about two thousand and let me go ahead

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.650 
about two thousand and let me go ahead
and<00:03:39.980> get<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.610> product<00:03:41.030> worked<00:03:41.209> in<00:03:41.390> so<00:03:41.630> I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
and get this product worked in so I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.479 
and get this product worked in so I
don't<00:03:41.810> sling<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.040> what<00:03:43.130> I'm<00:03:43.190> going<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.340> do

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
don't sling it so what I'm going to do

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.309 
don't sling it so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:43.700> I'm<00:03:43.820> going<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.000> focus

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:58.309 

in<00:03:49.319> one<00:03:49.560> small<00:03:49.860> area

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.830 

well<00:03:59.219> one<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.549> things<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.909> we<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.269> in<00:04:00.629> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
well one of the things that we do in the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.209 
well one of the things that we do in the
process<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.439> we<00:04:01.530> use<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> little<00:04:01.950> bit<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.099> our

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.219 
process is we use a little bit of our

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.069 
process is we use a little bit of our
gloss<00:04:02.430> enhancer<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.569> help<00:04:03.719> spread<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
gloss enhancer to help spread the

evolution prime is used to lubricate the
pad<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.329> those<00:04:09.450> we're<00:04:09.629> building<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.019> heat

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
pad so those we're building the heat

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.690 
pad so those we're building the heat
we're<00:04:10.379> not<00:04:10.530> causing<00:04:10.950> further<00:04:11.159> marring<00:04:11.640> or

little bit of more EVP because I'm have

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.920 
little bit of more EVP because I'm have
to<00:04:36.250> build<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.580> lot<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.820> friction<00:04:37.300> here<00:04:37.330> removing

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.880 

today<00:04:44.970> I'm<00:04:45.180> working<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.660> bucker<00:04:46.080> through

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
today I'm working the bucker through

00:04:46.890 --> 00:05:02.560 
today I'm working the bucker through
loose<00:04:47.070> well

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.870 

now<00:05:02.900> one<00:05:03.200> of<00:05:03.230> the<00:05:03.320> important<00:05:03.620> things<00:05:03.860> is<00:05:04.040> I'm

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
now one of the important things is I'm

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.030 
now one of the important things is I'm
working<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.360> bunker<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.840> heart<00:05:06.050> higher<00:05:06.470> rpm

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
working the bunker to heart higher rpm

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.320 
working the bunker to heart higher rpm
right<00:05:07.250> now<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.430> cut<00:05:07.790> out<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.060> deeper

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
right now to cut out the deeper

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.200 
right now to cut out the deeper
scratches<00:05:08.480> once<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.110> remove<00:05:09.470> those<00:05:09.680> scratches

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
scratches once I remove those scratches

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.070 
scratches once I remove those scratches
then<00:05:11.210> I'm<00:05:11.330> going<00:05:11.480> to<00:05:11.510> actually<00:05:11.870> start

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
then I'm going to actually start

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.340 
then I'm going to actually start
lowering<00:05:12.440> my<00:05:12.590> RPM<00:05:13.070> down<00:05:13.280> from<00:05:13.490> 2,000<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.360> 1,800

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
lowering my RPM down from 2,000 to 1,800

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.760 
lowering my RPM down from 2,000 to 1,800
to<00:05:15.890> 1,600<00:05:16.760> and<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.420> on<00:05:17.660> but<00:05:18.050> we<00:05:18.200> first<00:05:18.440> want<00:05:18.740> to

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
to 1,600 and so on but we first want to

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.380 
to 1,600 and so on but we first want to
accomplish<00:05:19.070> removing<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.610> heavier<00:05:19.910> defects

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
accomplish removing the heavier defects

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.840 
accomplish removing the heavier defects
before<00:05:20.570> we<00:05:20.870> start<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.200> work<00:05:21.740> down<00:05:22.130> in<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.340> rpm

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
before we start to work down in the rpm

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.870 
before we start to work down in the rpm
range<00:05:23.180> we've<00:05:23.660> worked<00:05:23.900> out<00:05:24.050> about<00:05:24.320> 98%<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:25.730> the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
range we've worked out about 98% of the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.420 
range we've worked out about 98% of the
heavy<00:05:26.090> scratches<00:05:26.570> there<00:05:27.440> are<00:05:27.650> swirls<00:05:28.190> in<00:05:28.370> the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
heavy scratches there are swirls in the
