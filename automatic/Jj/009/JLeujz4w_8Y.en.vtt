00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
growth of the muscle can only happen

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.149

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
goal is to get big and muscular it is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.140 
goal is to get big and muscular it is
very<00:01:16.200> important<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> start<00:01:17.640> lifting

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
have to keep in mind is that we need to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560 
have to keep in mind is that we need to
eat<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.680> food<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.729> big<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
eat a lot of food to get big and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.109 
eat a lot of food to get big and
muscular<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> cannot<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.700> big<00:01:29.939> if

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
muscular now you cannot get big if

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
muscular now you cannot get big if
you're<00:01:30.329> following<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> negative<00:01:31.259> calorie

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you're following a negative calorie

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.590 
you're following a negative calorie
balanced<00:01:31.920> diet<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.759> example<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.390> your

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
balanced diet for example if your

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
balanced diet for example if your
calorie<00:01:33.869> requirements<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.500> close<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.829> me

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
calorie requirements are close to me

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
calorie requirements are close to me
about<00:01:35.159> 2,000<00:01:35.909> calories<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.840> even<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> end

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
about 2,000 calories so even if you end

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260 
about 2,000 calories so even if you end
up<00:01:37.560> lifting<00:01:37.950> heavy<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.909> eat<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> same

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
up lifting heavy and you eat the same

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.359 
up lifting heavy and you eat the same
amount<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.540> calories<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:41.040> big

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
amount of calories you will not get big

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
amount of calories you will not get big
and<00:01:41.579> muscular<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.689> your<00:01:42.810> idea<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> get

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and muscular so if your idea is to get

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
and muscular so if your idea is to get
big<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.009> probably<00:01:44.460> need<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> consume<00:01:45.119> me

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
big you probably need to consume me

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.080 
big you probably need to consume me
about<00:01:45.479> 3<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.140> 4,000<00:01:46.799> calories<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:47.909> by

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
about 3 to 4,000 calories there by

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.179 
about 3 to 4,000 calories there by
putting<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.020> body<00:01:49.229> into<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> positive

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
putting your body into a positive

putting your body into a positive
calorie<00:01:50.520> balance<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.540> help<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
calorie balance that can help you to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.830 
calorie balance that can help you to
grow<00:01:52.200> muscle<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.130> fat<00:01:53.840> simultaneously

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
grow muscle and fat simultaneously

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
grow muscle and fat simultaneously
number<00:01:55.590> 3<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> keep<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.909> mind

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
number 3 what you have to keep in mind

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.060 
number 3 what you have to keep in mind
is<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.659> your<00:01:57.869> goal<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:58.560> big<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
is that if your goal is to get big and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.819 
is that if your goal is to get big and
bulky<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.119> need<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.689> consume<00:02:01.110> large

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
bulky you also need to consume large

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.490 
bulky you also need to consume large
amount<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.490> protein<00:02:03.000> content<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.170> remember

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
amount of protein content now remember

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.319 
amount of protein content now remember
that<00:02:04.530> protein<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> building<00:02:05.850> blocks<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> your

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that protein is building blocks of your

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.389 
that protein is building blocks of your
muscle<00:02:06.630> tissue<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.799> consuming

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
muscle tissue and for not consuming

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.400 
muscle tissue and for not consuming
protein<00:02:08.580> your<00:02:09.270> muscles<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:09.989> grow<00:02:10.319> out

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
protein your muscles will not grow out

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
protein your muscles will not grow out
of<00:02:10.500> thin<00:02:10.649> air<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.700> very<00:02:11.910> important<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
of thin air so it is very important that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.850 
of thin air so it is very important that
you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.740 
you
to<00:02:12.980> consume<00:02:13.340> adequate<00:02:14.150> amount<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.450> protein

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
to consume adequate amount of protein

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.650 
to consume adequate amount of protein
intake<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.230> anybody<00:02:15.830> who<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.280> trying<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.510> get

big and bulky he needs to consume at

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.500 
big and bulky he needs to consume at
least<00:02:20.030> 2<00:02:20.570> grams<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.380> protein<00:02:21.830> per<00:02:22.100> pound<00:02:22.910> of

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
least 2 grams of protein per pound of

least 2 grams of protein per pound of
the<00:02:23.750> body<00:02:23.930> weight<00:02:24.200> now<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:24.710> serious<00:02:25.040> about

the body weight now I'm serious about

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.440 
the body weight now I'm serious about
that<00:02:25.280> because<00:02:25.580> that's<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> kind<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.120> protein

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
that because that's the kind of protein

is<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:28.880> big<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.690> muscular<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.220> these<00:02:31.340> were

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
is to get big and muscular so these were

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.890 
is to get big and muscular so these were
three<00:02:31.760> points<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.360> need<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.540> keep<00:02:32.750> in

naturally but remember that this can

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.180 
naturally but remember that this can
never<00:03:08.180> ever<00:03:08.570> make<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.110> look<00:03:09.260> like<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.800> or

like any other competitive bodybuilder
that's<00:03:12.860> purely<00:03:13.130> because<00:03:13.340> these<00:03:14.090> guys<00:03:14.360> at<00:03:14.600> this

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
that's purely because these guys at this

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.259 
that's purely because these guys at this
level<00:03:15.140> use<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.860> lot<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.160> synthetic<00:03:16.430> steroids<00:03:16.970> to
