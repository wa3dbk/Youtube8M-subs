00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
yesterday I got to I think the day

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.790

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.560 
before I got three and this is gonna be
great<00:03:59.950> because<00:04:00.220> my<00:04:00.489> rendering<00:04:01.000> speed<00:04:01.269> is

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
great because my rendering speed is

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.420 
great because my rendering speed is
already<00:04:02.080> really<00:04:02.500> really<00:04:02.920> good<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.370> can

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
already really really good so I can

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.330 
already really really good so I can
stack<00:04:03.940> up<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.269> videos<00:04:04.690> if<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.980> just<00:04:06.220> like

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
stack up on videos if I just like

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.670 
stack up on videos if I just like
freaking<00:04:06.730> go<00:04:07.420> ham<00:04:07.660> one<00:04:07.930> day<00:04:08.050> make<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> bunch<00:04:08.560> of

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
freaking go ham one day make a bunch of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.020 
freaking go ham one day make a bunch of
videos<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.100> for<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.310> next<00:04:09.519> like<00:04:09.610> three<00:04:09.880> days

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
videos and for the next like three days

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.490 
videos and for the next like three days
so<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.269> gave<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.600> five<00:04:10.810> mins<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.260> day<00:04:11.290> or

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.140 
so I gave like five mins a day or
something<00:04:11.800> crazy<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.489> can<00:04:12.970> do<00:04:13.030> my

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
something crazy like that I can do my

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.810 
something crazy like that I can do my
scheduled<00:04:13.810> uploader<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.860> everything<00:04:15.580> will<00:04:15.670> be

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
scheduled uploader so everything will be

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.190 
scheduled uploader so everything will be
awesome<00:04:16.269> well<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.510> won't<00:04:16.690> do<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.840> scheduled

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
awesome well I won't do a scheduled

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.870 
awesome well I won't do a scheduled
upload<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:18.040> kind<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.459> defeats<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.729> purpose

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
upload that kind of defeats the purpose

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.870 
upload that kind of defeats the purpose
but<00:04:19.330> I've<00:04:20.049> never<00:04:20.260> used<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.620> scheduled<00:04:21.039> the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
but I've never used a scheduled the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.420 
but I've never used a scheduled the
scheduled<00:04:22.270> uploader<00:04:22.630> but<00:04:23.500> not<00:04:23.680> this<00:04:23.740> way

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
scheduled uploader but not this way

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.400 
scheduled uploader but not this way
I've<00:04:24.580> had<00:04:24.850> like<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.479> don't<00:04:26.080> know<00:04:26.169> if<00:04:26.259> you<00:04:26.320> guys

don't<00:04:29.289> know<00:04:29.350> if<00:04:29.440> that's<00:04:29.590> right<00:04:29.740> word<00:04:29.919> but<00:04:30.039> I've

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
don't know if that's right word but I've

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.700 
don't know if that's right word but I've
had<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.820> always<00:04:31.030> compress<00:04:31.600> my<00:04:31.780> videos<00:04:32.169> because

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
had to always compress my videos because

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.550 
had to always compress my videos because
of<00:04:33.039> my<00:04:33.190> terrible<00:04:33.699> upload<00:04:34.030> speed<00:04:34.360> if<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:35.169> didn't

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
of my terrible upload speed if I didn't

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560 
of my terrible upload speed if I didn't
compress<00:04:35.889> my<00:04:36.130> videos<00:04:36.520> for<00:04:36.820> like<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:36.940> 10<00:04:37.270> minute

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
compress my videos for like a 10 minute

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.260 
compress my videos for like a 10 minute
video<00:04:37.720> if<00:04:38.259> we'd<00:04:38.770> probably<00:04:39.400> take<00:04:39.940> an<00:04:40.120> hour

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
video if we'd probably take an hour

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.050 
video if we'd probably take an hour
something<00:04:40.870> odd<00:04:41.020> minutes<00:04:41.320> but<00:04:42.250> I've<00:04:42.880> always

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
something odd minutes but I've always

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.760
