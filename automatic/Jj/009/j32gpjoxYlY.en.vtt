what happens in an urban environment I

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.390 
what happens in an urban environment I
guess<00:01:57.040> that's<00:01:57.310> what<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:59.410> women's<00:01:59.770> section<00:02:00.010> is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400

times and you know it's a cleansing

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.270 
times and you know it's a cleansing
experience<00:02:07.150> we<00:02:07.750> live<00:02:07.930> in<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> smog<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.920> with

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
experience we live in the smog and with

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.400 
experience we live in the smog and with
people<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.209> won't<00:02:10.660> even<00:02:10.899> look<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
people that won't even look you in the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.970 
people that won't even look you in the

eye and you go up there and you just you
can<00:02:15.370> breathe<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.750> think<00:02:17.350> that's<00:02:17.740> why<00:02:18.310> it

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
can breathe and I think that's why it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.280 
can breathe and I think that's why it
brings<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.300> stories<00:02:19.720> i<00:02:19.840> thinkwell
