00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello good maybe I have the lantern ready 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.260
 armed now I'm going to explain it well 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.990
 how was the circuit at the beginning I 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.040
 I would be ready I did not want to forget one of 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.430
 the comments that a friend made 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.650
 fernando that is very true that for a 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.600
 prolonged use should have a 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.400
 much larger sink the 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.170
 his recommendation was to cut the part 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.930
 back to the lantern and put some with 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.370
 fins to improve the surfaces but 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.160
 as I will use it only as 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.110
 position with very low current and as 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.300
 'is very eventually, or is it just 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.079
 as a wink I consider that with this it is going to 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.670
 sufficient time will see if 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.550
 It works well 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.020
 and if it really lasts what you have to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.690
 to last 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.360
 as I already told you the original lighthouse that 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.640
 bring the bike is this 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.860
 and how do you usually change the mask now 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.200
 I have to use this other one that we 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.900
 It brings the possibility of using the high 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.750
 nor the position light because 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.970
 originally this lighthouse comes with a 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 h4 lamp 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.110
 who has these 3 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.140
 these three legs 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 that from what I could see is this is the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.330
 common 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 let say 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.550
 the common one in my case luckily is mass 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 then we have low and high 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.340
 and good in this case was inserted in the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.480
 Then the position light piojito 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 all this really position and high what 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.210
 I will use like a bluff and the rest 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.940
 I'm going to use halogen because it's still 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.000
 being more powerful I think that this 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.540
 15 leds 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.150
 so I'm going to try to explain the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.990
 circuit that I will finally use 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.990
 is this 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.530
 then as they said to lamp h4 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.580
 originally another then a common 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.700
 low and high 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.790
 so what I did was with a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.250
 old lamp that had been burned 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.470
 take off the shorts and let go of the cables 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.890
 corresponding to connect my lantern 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.210
 and the lantern this one 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.210
 the lantern 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.170
 the circuit you use for the lantern 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.170
 led is the following 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.460
 the high connected to a diode and without 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.950
 adding diodes probably is not 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.730
 necessary but better than about and not that 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.880
 missing to not have that problem that 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.140
 had with the stop with the stop led as 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.700
 also fulfills the function of this 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.820
 composition in this case is going to be 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.459
 position and high then added the two 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.050
 things either of the two that is 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.320
 On, it brings current to me 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.690
 circuit one brings a greater current 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.550
 that the other is not having a 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.340
 resistance by a greater current 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.790
 then the high I put a diode 1 n 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.909
 5402 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.240
 and with this I will have the flow for 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.100
 the three led 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.710
 and when the light was on 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.240
 I'm simply going to have a 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.400
 diode can be the same or it can be much 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.210
 lower because it is less current 4007 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.490
 for example a resistance of 25 watts 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.320
 this is totally empirical I was testing 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.580
 more or less the values ​​I had and 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 when he gave me a current more or less 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.460
 equal to what I would have if I had a 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.850
 lamp in the position light that I 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.860
 it seems that they were 300,000 apart good 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.870
 results in a resistance of 20 or more me 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.630
 gives that current in 300,000 jumpers in 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.910
 total will be divided I calculate in 100 thousand 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.080
 jumper portals each led has a 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:05.290
 8.2 or more resistance and 5 watts 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.940
 in this way so it actually stayed 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.930
 A) Yes 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.930
 then we have 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.329
 our connector 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.979
 and also that of the position light does not 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.350
 I wanted to modify anything on the bike so 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.780
 use a burned-out sunlamp 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.360
 as you can see in the other videos this 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.520
 the sun of nothing but the positive there 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.100
 inside I have the diode this is the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.650
 20 or more resistance I told you 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.680
 and it feeds me the leds 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.139
 and on the other hand the high that would be 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.240
 Exactly this one comes around here I have my 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.510
 diodes and also food 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.190
 the other is common goes to more 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.710
 so 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.710
 the idea is to tell this 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.360
 for me 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:11.099
 we will see in what function it suits 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.099
 and then 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.889
 behind that these two for the lamp 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.000
 I will present these resistances 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.980
 somewhere 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 and connectors here 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.740
 and this to the position of my motorcycle 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.190
 let's see how it turns out and how 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.190
 works
