 aircraft on the sides of the radio 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.550
 left part of the menu I can use 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.500

 is showing the propeller because it passes 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.939

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.200
 I sent a little ahead let it rise a 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.200

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:59.770
 Ok we 're here with a distance of 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.680
 57 meters here on average height of 20 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.830

 50 to 60 kilometers per hour 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.260
 Let's see if it was caused in 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.970
 up the radio region that I'm going to 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.530

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.040
 complete configuration , remembering that 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.990
 At the time we practice doing the 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.900
 goal of the procedure it home aircraft 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.990
 points the nose to her opponent where 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.230
 was previously recorded the train is low 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.030
 landing plays with the aircraft with a train 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.800
 landing on the ground turns off the engines everything 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.640

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.070
 two meters away is totally 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:51.080
