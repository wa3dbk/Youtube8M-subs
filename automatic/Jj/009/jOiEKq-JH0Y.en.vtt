00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hey so tracks a logic stream here and I

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.299 
hey so tracks a logic stream here and I
figured<00:00:05.100> why<00:00:05.520> don't<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:05.910> just<00:00:06.120> give<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.420> guys<00:00:06.569> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
castle programming card so here's my

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.359 
castle programming card so here's my
1/16<00:00:14.490> slash<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> sidewinder<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
1/16 slash of the sidewinder so what you

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.019 
1/16 slash of the sidewinder so what you
got<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.320> pull<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:20.029> your

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
got to do is you have to pull out your

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.470 
got to do is you have to pull out your
EFC<00:00:21.390> cord<00:00:22.020> right<00:00:22.680> there<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.789> goes<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
EFC cord right there and that goes to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.849 
EFC cord right there and that goes to
the<00:00:25.199> signwinder<00:00:26.210> esc<00:00:27.210> same<00:00:28.050> thing<00:00:28.289> applies<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the signwinder esc same thing applies to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.580 
the signwinder esc same thing applies to
a<00:00:28.890> Mamba<00:00:29.310> monster<00:00:29.760> okay<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.599> once<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> get

to connect it in there you can see you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.090 
to connect it in there you can see you
power<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.329> through<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.559> any<00:00:59.280> port<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.899> let<00:01:01.890> me

at<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> linked<00:01:20.960> then<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> works<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.759> have

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
at the linked then it works and I have

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.359 
at the linked then it works and I have
the<00:01:24.420> drivers<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> guide<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:26.130> with

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the drivers that guide that I got with

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.499 
the drivers that guide that I got with
the<00:01:26.960> Sidewinder<00:01:28.280> right<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.970> half<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the Sidewinder right here like half the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.649 
the Sidewinder right here like half the
booklet<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.900> filled<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:33.360> every

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
booklet is filled up with a what every

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 
booklet is filled up with a what every
single<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.500> there's<00:01:34.799> brake<00:01:35.100> amount

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
single thing is so there's brake amount

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.740 
single thing is so there's brake amount
tells<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.570> default<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.579> then

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
tells you what your default is and then

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.600 
tells you what your default is and then
okay<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.810> say<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.409> want<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.159> hundred<00:01:41.520> percent

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
okay so say I want a hundred percent

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.660 
okay so say I want a hundred percent
power<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.990> allows<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:43.680> available<00:01:43.979> braking

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
power that allows all available braking

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.830 
power that allows all available braking
power<00:01:45.110> at<00:01:46.110> full<00:01:46.409> brake<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> now<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.479> here

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
power at full brake so now I go here

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710 
power at full brake so now I go here
okay<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.610> figure<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.600> by

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
okay and you can figure this out just by

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.950 
okay and you can figure this out just by
reading<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.170> manual<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.880> link<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.750> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
reading the manual to this link but I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
reading the manual to this link but I
figured<00:01:55.290> I'll<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.710> give<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.130> video<00:01:56.280> okay

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
figured I'll just give you a video okay

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.209 
figured I'll just give you a video okay
so<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> only<00:01:58.469> button<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.070> works

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
so this is the only button that works

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.170 
so this is the only button that works
right<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.030> click<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.290> says<00:02:01.790> okay<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:02.850> if

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
right here click here it says okay so if

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.199 
right here click here it says okay so if
I<00:02:03.270> click<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:06.299> moves<00:02:06.719> it

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.720 

all<00:02:11.209> right<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:12.380> if<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.740> see<00:02:13.069> on<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.280> side

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
all right so if you see on the side

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.460 
all right so if you see on the side
it's<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.860> cut-off<00:02:15.860> voltage<00:02:16.670> right<00:02:17.120> okay<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.140> say

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
it's a cut-off voltage right okay so say

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.960 
it's a cut-off voltage right okay so say
I<00:02:18.530> want<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.770> go<00:02:18.860> down<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.040> break<00:02:19.340> strength<00:02:19.670> I

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
I want to go down to break strength I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.479 
I want to go down to break strength I
click<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.510> one<00:02:21.280> two<00:02:22.280> three<00:02:23.980> now<00:02:24.980> I'm<00:02:25.099> at<00:02:25.220> break

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
click it one two three now I'm at break

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.120 
click it one two three now I'm at break
strength<00:02:25.850> now<00:02:26.420> I'm<00:02:26.540> at<00:02:26.660> 100%<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.739> then<00:02:30.739> to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
strength now I'm at 100% see and then to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.590 
strength now I'm at 100% see and then to
move<00:02:31.310> those<00:02:31.610> across<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:33.500> hold<00:02:33.770> down<00:02:34.600> hold

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
move those across you hold down hold

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.100 
move those across you hold down hold
down<00:02:36.280> okay<00:02:37.280> now<00:02:37.819> I'm<00:02:38.180> at<00:02:38.769> about<00:02:39.769> 25%<00:02:40.959> maybe<00:02:41.959> a

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
down okay now I'm at about 25% maybe a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.860 
down okay now I'm at about 25% maybe a
little<00:02:42.319> less<00:02:42.500> maybe<00:02:42.670> 22%<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.450> hold<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.750> down

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
little less maybe 22% if I hold it down

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.449 
little less maybe 22% if I hold it down
again<00:02:45.700> movies<00:02:46.700> over<00:02:46.880> now<00:02:47.150> I'm<00:02:47.299> just<00:02:47.569> under<00:02:47.840> 50%
