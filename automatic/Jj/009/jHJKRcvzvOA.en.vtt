their heels the reach to the outer loop
of<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.590> course<00:04:11.830> would<00:04:12.010> be<00:04:12.070> very<00:04:12.340> tough<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.820> a

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
of the course would be very tough and a

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.229 
of the course would be very tough and a
fast<00:04:13.420> one<00:04:13.660> too

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.180 

the<00:04:19.840> Slovenians<00:04:20.350> were<00:04:20.410> doing<00:04:20.650> great<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.130> now

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
the Slovenians were doing great and now

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.790 
the Slovenians were doing great and now
France<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.090> lameta<00:04:22.330> air<00:04:22.569> and<00:04:22.780> retinas<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.440> the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
France is lameta air and retinas and the

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.890 
France is lameta air and retinas and the
duo<00:04:24.009> of<00:04:24.130> Kamata<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:25.000> Carrero<00:04:25.389> were<00:04:25.720> just

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
duo of Kamata and Carrero were just

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.050 
duo of Kamata and Carrero were just
behind<00:04:25.990> Britain's<00:04:26.530> Freeman<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.009> Tom<00:04:27.190> set<00:04:27.430> but

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
behind Britain's Freeman and Tom set but

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.279 
behind Britain's Freeman and Tom set but
there<00:04:28.180> was<00:04:28.270> still<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.449> long<00:04:28.630> way<00:04:28.840> before<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
there was still a long way before the

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.020 
there was still a long way before the
end<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.560> race<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:30.370> heavy<00:04:30.580> storm<00:04:30.819> was

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
end of the race and a heavy storm was

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.080 
end of the race and a heavy storm was
also<00:04:31.240> approaching

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.600 

so<00:04:38.810> this<00:04:39.080> was<00:04:39.290> one<00:04:39.470> tough<00:04:39.710> race<00:04:39.980> but<00:04:40.430> let's

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
so this was one tough race but let's

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.040 
so this was one tough race but let's
hear<00:04:40.790> what<00:04:40.970> any<00:04:41.150> earnings<00:04:41.480> have<00:04:41.720> occurred<00:04:42.020> to

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
hear what any earnings have occurred to

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.840 
hear what any earnings have occurred to
say<00:04:42.290> about<00:04:42.800> what<00:04:43.010> happened<00:04:43.310> on<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.520> first<00:04:43.550> day

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
say about what happened on the first day

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.960 
say about what happened on the first day
so<00:04:44.389> today<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:44.930> was<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.260> long<00:04:45.560> day<00:04:45.830> pretty<00:04:46.669> much

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970
