00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.700
 life declared 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:11.360
 wind with that space behind 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.260
 the death behind the death of both 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.260
 Laughter 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.529
 national 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.970
 of the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 the function of the sun's death time 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.850
 of the night to return new god is a 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.649
 irreverent verse 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 now people walk through the streets of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.860
 my mind for the place 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.930
 where to die 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.540
 We are very grateful for what we 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.000
 it happened more than anything with the people who came 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.350
 feeling during all the tables in 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.900
 the response of the audience was totally 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.300
 different from previous years and to us 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.250
 that this was not very profitable in all 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.080
 aspects in the emotional main thing in what 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.430
 human as a group because when it's going 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 well is a reality that in general not 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.270
 everyone goes well and we feel good with 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.340
 the show and of course that a 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.590
 level of show itself in what 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.450
 artistic was not not barbarous you go to 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.920
 summer theater with another energy with a 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.710
 important support from the people and good 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.500
 totally happy not only during 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.450
 the carnival but also during the year 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.220
 we had the opportunity and Argentina- a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.580
 lots of times to visit san cordoba 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.070
 juan santa fe a lot of province of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.619
 there and the truth we saw as a group 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.360
 amazing because with friends doing art to 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.500
 sing murga and on a trip to 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 Argentina in a bondi I noticed for 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 explain what that experience was 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.110
 did very rock and roll comes with 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.910
 a lot of force comes a bit controversial this 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.740
 we have been working on it 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.100
 enough time we do not want to fall into 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.330
 common places and in shabby things 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.979
 obviously we talk about sex and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.030
 sexuality as it has to be for that 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.430
 we advise 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.080
 with steady people sexologists who come 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.060
 achieves with us comes a lot of fun 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.850
 this has a lot of criticism a lot of criticism 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.410
 social to institutions to the times 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.880
 that we live also carry criticism of what 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.380
 what has happened of course is that it is 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.819
 very spicy and is next time 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.020
 with a lot of effort I think it's the year 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.550
 we are more different to everyone 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.660
 what we have been doing to start 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.610
 a few years that we have been doing 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.080
 a scheme that is a show that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.610
 starts and ends that is a story of 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.950
 a story these are very blocks 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.680
 separated from each other we talk about the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.850
 infidelity about the g point that 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.640
 potpourri that is with lots of 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.370

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.870
 phallic symbols we talked a little about 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.870
 World's End
