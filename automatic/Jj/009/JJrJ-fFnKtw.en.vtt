00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.589
 well hamo data is welcome to 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.930
 this new sport light before starting 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.210
 I want to tell you that I'm playing in the hungers 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.340
 games I need Italians just not 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.410
 I remember in p and in the name and in his 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 pronounced however you can see it in the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.470
 big black excavator channel why 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 play in the same server and play 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.900
 mainly the one just premium and me 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.940
 I call mike gx on minecraft or this one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 skin so if you find me 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.489
 tell me that we play together and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.260
 let's make team and however it says high 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.730
 on the right I'm using the ics her why 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.559
 I have no other way to show you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.540
 however I wanted to tell you that this fashion is 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.550
 been a day since there are e 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.590
 I also show this mod 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.329
 what does it do above all at the top a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610
 left as you see we have the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.590
 coordinates that are very different from 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.610
 these are a little more difficult to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.489
 to find 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 and in any case I find myself better with others 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 then clicking xv always activates the x6 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.060
 clicking the week there is eternal light 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.680
 in practice because even with the night 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.310
 always see a light without using it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.830
 there is nothing or with r you can see 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.920
 both caves if I'm not mistaken that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.229
 however this is the real stone finder 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.710
 which unfortunately does not work yet spared 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.380
 and I think I have explained everything to you in this way 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.729
 short while 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.430
 if you have not understood something you can 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.049
 also see the old videos including ho 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 also made a tutorial on how 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.820
 install this way and then see 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.549
 there are all in my channel enough that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.900
 write hicks there and all come out 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.000
 fashions with this look above all 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.549
 so see the ghanam style video 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.040
 I published that I did it 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.650
 that map I made thanks to mc edith 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 and minecraft no tu no 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.070
 minecraft 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.110
 the OCST is a well-known blog studio mode no oh well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.260
 anyway no if this minecraft block 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.899
 studio is practically via lanzone midi e 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.180
 he did everything and then I made a mc 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.680
 editing world and everything else and then 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.010
