climb<00:00:58.120> doesn't<00:00:59.120> look<00:00:59.180> very<00:00:59.270> much<00:00:59.630> in<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.530> minute

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060

climb doesn't look very much in a minute
not<00:01:02.060> necessarily<00:01:02.480> steep<00:01:03.220> but<00:01:04.220> when<00:01:04.339> we<00:01:04.430> get

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
not necessarily steep but when we get

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.480 
not necessarily steep but when we get
around<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:04.820> next<00:01:05.089> corner<00:01:05.920> its<00:01:06.920> sequence<00:01:07.310> to

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
around this next corner its sequence to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
around this next corner its sequence to
probably<00:01:08.180> fifteen<00:01:08.540> percent<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.270> gets<00:01:11.390> a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
probably fifteen percent and it gets a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.770 
probably fifteen percent and it gets a
little<00:01:11.630> bit<00:01:11.780> twisty<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.510> where<00:01:14.660> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
little bit twisty so this is where the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.800 
little bit twisty so this is where the
riders<00:01:15.170> are<00:01:15.260> going<00:01:15.410> to<00:01:15.470> start<00:01:15.979> feeling<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.810> so

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
riders are going to start feeling it so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.740 
riders are going to start feeling it so
as<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.050> can<00:01:18.200> see<00:01:19.030> quite<00:01:20.030> near<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.330> top<00:01:20.479> of<00:01:20.510> mid

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
as you can see quite near the top of mid

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.440 
as you can see quite near the top of mid
hope<00:01:20.930> stones<00:01:21.560> climb<00:01:22.010> now<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.270> is

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
hope stones climb now and this is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.109 
hope stones climb now and this is
probably<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.750> steepest<00:01:24.140> part<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.560> climb

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
probably the steepest part of the climb

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.780 
probably the steepest part of the climb
now<00:01:26.119> only<00:01:26.300> 2k<00:01:26.720> long<00:01:28.030> not<00:01:29.030> very<00:01:29.240> long<00:01:29.390> but

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
now only 2k long not very long but

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
now only 2k long not very long but
pretty<00:01:31.790> steep

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.380 

so<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.799> go<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.610> crest<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.000> top<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.330> the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
so to go the crest of the top of the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.410 
so to go the crest of the top of the
climb<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:39.189> is<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.340> lot<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.090> center

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
climb and this is a lot of the center

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.260 
climb and this is a lot of the center
she's<00:01:40.900> not<00:01:41.020> very<00:01:41.170> long<00:01:41.380> about<00:01:41.619> 50<00:01:41.890> meters<00:01:42.270> then

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
she's not very long about 50 meters then

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:55.690 
she's not very long about 50 meters then
it<00:01:43.360> all<00:01:43.420> kicks<00:01:43.689> off<00:01:43.780> again

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.330
