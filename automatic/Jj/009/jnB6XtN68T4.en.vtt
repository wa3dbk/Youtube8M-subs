00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.729 
explosive as we can each and every set
working<00:03:11.640> with<00:03:11.880> resistance<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:12.720> extra<00:03:13.410> muscle

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
working with resistance for extra muscle

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.890 
working with resistance for extra muscle
stimulation<00:03:14.220> then<00:03:14.820> we're<00:03:14.940> going<00:03:15.150> unresisted

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
stimulation then we're going unresisted

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990 
stimulation then we're going unresisted
to<00:03:16.260> really<00:03:16.500> move<00:03:16.680> free<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.100> easy<00:03:17.250> alright<00:03:17.519> so
