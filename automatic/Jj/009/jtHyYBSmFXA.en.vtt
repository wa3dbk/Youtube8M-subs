00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
mixture of stonework and snow and

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.740 
mixture of stonework and snow and
because<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.490> lot<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.970> stuff<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.360> designed

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
because a lot of this stuff is designed

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.410 
because a lot of this stuff is designed
to<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.930> stacked<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.680> uh<00:02:44.780> give<00:02:45.780> an<00:02:45.900> example

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
to be stacked like uh give an example

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.570 
to be stacked like uh give an example
but<00:02:48.420> how<00:02:49.380> things<00:02:49.740> are<00:02:49.920> supposed<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.280> fit

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
but how things are supposed to fit

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.440 
but how things are supposed to fit
