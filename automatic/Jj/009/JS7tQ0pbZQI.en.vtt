00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and they don't have to hit from the top

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.440 
and they don't have to hit from the top
so<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:15.990> poo<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:17.540> why<00:01:20.299> make<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so they can go poo and then why make it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.130 
so they can go poo and then why make it
back<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:22.170> boom<00:01:22.430> shake<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.850> boom<00:01:24.659> and
