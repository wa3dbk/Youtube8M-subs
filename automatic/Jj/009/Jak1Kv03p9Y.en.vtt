okay so i'm going to show you how to do

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.309 
okay so i'm going to show you how to do
a<00:00:01.740> couple<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.280> tricks<00:00:02.490> with<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.790> gyro<00:00:03.030> Duke

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:03.319 
a couple of tricks with the gyro Duke

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.410 
a couple of tricks with the gyro Duke
first<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.470> all<00:00:04.500> i'm<00:00:04.770> going<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.009> show<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.420> the

first of all i'm going to show you the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.250 
first of all i'm going to show you the
gyro<00:00:06.930> or<00:00:08.030> where<00:00:09.030> we're<00:00:09.480> just<00:00:09.630> going<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.840> spit

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
gyro or where we're just going to spit

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.849 
gyro or where we're just going to spit
like<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.969> ok<00:00:11.969> sir<00:00:12.360> front<00:00:12.900> us<00:00:13.110> football<00:00:15.859> that

like this ok sir front us football that

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.120 
like this ok sir front us football that
was<00:00:16.980> quite<00:00:17.220> fun<00:00:18.320> we're<00:00:19.320> using<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> weighted

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
was quite fun we're using the weighted

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.779 
was quite fun we're using the weighted
side<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> hoop<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.600> help<00:00:21.810> spin<00:00:22.109> around

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
side of the hoop to help spin around

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
side of the hoop to help spin around
time<00:00:23.789> holding<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> top<00:00:24.650> with<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> slip<00:00:26.250> on

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
time holding at the top with a slip on

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.080 
time holding at the top with a slip on
either<00:00:26.550> side<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:29.250> throw<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
either side like this and I throw the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.910 
either side like this and I throw the
inside<00:00:30.449> who<00:00:30.599> disturbs<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.230> spin<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.650> really

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
inside who disturbs I spin it really

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.569 
inside who disturbs I spin it really
fast<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.180> feel<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> waiting<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> I'm

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
fast and then I feel the waiting and I'm

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.819 
fast and then I feel the waiting and I'm
pulling<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.180> down<00:00:36.530> where<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> weights

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
pulling up and down where the weights

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.819 
pulling up and down where the weights
going<00:00:38.100> down<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> easiest<00:00:39.989> way<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
going down so the easiest way to get a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.250 
going down so the easiest way to get a
fit<00:00:41.040> i'm<00:00:41.160> taking<00:00:41.520> text<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> necklace<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
fit i'm taking text bit of a necklace to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
fit i'm taking text bit of a necklace to
get<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> pool<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.550> moment

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
get the the pool at the right moment

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660 
get the the pool at the right moment
easiest<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> without

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
easiest way to do it is to do it without

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.819 
easiest way to do it is to do it without
pulling<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.690> down<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.680> hold

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
pulling up and down first if I just hold

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.790 
pulling up and down first if I just hold
the<00:00:49.980> hip<00:00:50.100> still<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.140> can<00:00:52.140> feel<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> hoop

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the hip still do it I can feel the hoop

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.520 
the hip still do it I can feel the hoop
pulling<00:00:53.699> down<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.329> seven<00:00:55.079> points<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
pulling down at seven points and if you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
pulling down at seven points and if you
can't<00:00:55.800> feel<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.129> full<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.600> hoop<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:57.899> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
can't feel it full on the hoop then you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 
can't feel it full on the hoop then you
might<00:00:58.199> need<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.530> waiting<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.609> side<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
might need more waiting on one side of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.069 
might need more waiting on one side of
the<00:01:00.000> hope<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.270> give<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> more<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> both

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the hope to give you more of that both

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.920 
the hope to give you more of that both
feeling<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.609> feel<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> pulling<00:01:03.300> down<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
feeling so I can feel it pulling down I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.980 
feeling so I can feel it pulling down I
want<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> pull<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.420> pretty<00:01:06.420> much<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> same

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
want to pull down pretty much the same

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.530 
want to pull down pretty much the same
time<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.619> pulling<00:01:07.950> down<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.330> can

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
time as it's pulling down so if I can

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.200 
time as it's pulling down so if I can
get<00:01:09.659> used<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> Thea's<00:01:10.580> putting<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:12.060> as

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
get used to Thea's putting down just as

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.679 
get used to Thea's putting down just as
it<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.810> pulls<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.799> i<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.070> start

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
it is it pulls down but i can start

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
it is it pulls down but i can start
keeping<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> hoop<00:01:15.930> spinning<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.130> i

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
keeping the hoop spinning and then if i

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
keeping the hoop spinning and then if i
go<00:01:17.400> faster<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> speedo<00:01:20.240> might<00:01:21.240> help

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
go faster this is a speedo might help

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
go faster this is a speedo might help
you<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.990> around<00:01:22.110> looking<00:01:22.710> something<00:01:23.369> will

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you to do around looking something will

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.429 
you to do around looking something will
find<00:01:23.729> without<00:01:24.030> looking<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> hoop<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> get

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
find without looking at the hoop and get

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.410 
find without looking at the hoop and get
more<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> field<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> sort<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.820> feeling

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
more a field because it sort of feeling

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.319 
more a field because it sort of feeling
rather<00:01:28.049> than<00:01:28.320> cycling<00:01:29.030> when<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> hoops

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
rather than cycling when the hoops

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.740 
rather than cycling when the hoops
pulling<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> then<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.600> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
pulling down so and then you can do that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.200 
pulling down so and then you can do that
if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.439> bouncing<00:01:35.030> do<00:01:36.030> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
if you do that what bouncing do this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.719 
if you do that what bouncing do this
sort<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.540> thing<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.520> different

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
sort of thing you can do it in different

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.850 
sort of thing you can do it in different
direction<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> air<00:01:40.079> for

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
direction if you don't up in the air for

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.370 
direction if you don't up in the air for
everyone<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.570> magic<00:01:42.930> block<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
everyone to be so like magic block and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.679 
everyone to be so like magic block and
then<00:01:43.740> generally<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.369> sort<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.670> walking<00:01:45.390> them

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
then generally just sort of walking them

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.830 
then generally just sort of walking them
about<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:47.100> effective<00:01:47.700> by<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.659> moving

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
about is really effective by just moving

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.800 
about is really effective by just moving
them<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.590> body<00:01:50.420> doesn't<00:01:51.420> need<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
them around of body doesn't need to be a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
them around of body doesn't need to be a
specific<00:01:52.350> pattern<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.430> sort<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.670> flapping

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the outside one makes it move quite

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.330 
the outside one makes it move quite
differently<00:02:12.300> instead<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.350> an<00:02:13.710> off<00:02:13.830> body<00:02:14.100> wrist

you lots of different things to explore
you<00:02:21.990> can<00:02:22.170> try<00:02:22.380> doing<00:02:22.560> house<00:02:23.060> isolations<00:02:24.060> with

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
you can try doing house isolations with

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.480 
you can try doing house isolations with
them<00:02:24.620> which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.650> interesting<00:02:26.220> because<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
them which is interesting because the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.630 
them which is interesting because the
answer<00:02:26.610> hoop<00:02:27.000> moves<00:02:27.270> slightly<00:02:27.540> definitely

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
answer hoop moves slightly definitely

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.100 
answer hoop moves slightly definitely
and<00:02:29.640> then<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.450> lots<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.750> off<00:02:30.870> body

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
and then just just lots of off body

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.110 
and then just just lots of off body
stuff<00:02:31.440> i<00:02:31.560> mean<00:02:31.710> like<00:02:31.890> figure<00:02:32.160> eights<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
stuff i mean like figure eights the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.340 
stuff i mean like figure eights the
hoops<00:02:33.360> are<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.720> kind<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.930> move<00:02:34.110> together

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
hoops are going to kind of move together

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.160 
hoops are going to kind of move together
because<00:02:35.340> i'm<00:02:35.460> not<00:02:35.640> doing<00:02:36.360> any<00:02:36.540> weird<00:02:36.930> wrist

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
because i'm not doing any weird wrist

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.990 
because i'm not doing any weird wrist
twist<00:02:37.350> but<00:02:37.860> if<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.160> do<00:02:38.280> miss<00:02:38.460> twists<00:02:38.880> in

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
twist but if I just do miss twists in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.430 
twist but if I just do miss twists in
front<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.420> me<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:39.660> they're<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.080> worn<00:02:40.350> on

halsey<00:02:40.770> spins<00:02:41.130> then<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> inside<00:02:42.510> loop<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
halsey spins then the inside loop is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.990 
halsey spins then the inside loop is
going<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.170> move<00:02:43.290> separately<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.550> outside

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
going to move separately to the outside

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.440 
going to move separately to the outside
one<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.500> that's<00:02:46.500> more<00:02:46.680> interesting<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.000> then

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
one and that's more interesting and then

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.950 
one and that's more interesting and then

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
also you can bring it on body so I could

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.570 
also you can bring it on body so I could
bring<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.230> body<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:56.250> holding
