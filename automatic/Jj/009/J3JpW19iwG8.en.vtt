00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.619
 model p 2 which is a cutting 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.200
 knife shaped this knife classic 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.590
 so they can not only butcher 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.250
 something to the hunter but also apply it to 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:44.830

 notches 125 millimeters that is to say 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.710
 So far, actually here it is 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.899
 excavation length effective cutting edge 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 130 millimeters in my opinion of this 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.890

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.150

 cutting edge down concave knife 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.400

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.909

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.680
 rockwell units 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.200
 as master Alexey told me 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.040
 prednyak is not a typical hardening for his 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.970
 blades 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:07.259
 from steel d2 usually to the cutting edge 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:12.340
 hardening tougher and to the butt 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:16.690
 softer here is the whole blade 58 like him 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.730
 did not say this is optimal hardening exactly 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.250
 for this knife, I mean, it will be possible 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.590
 work perfectly in different conditions and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.590
 don't be afraid for something with him 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.120
