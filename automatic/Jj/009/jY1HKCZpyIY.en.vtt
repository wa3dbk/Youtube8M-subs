00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.720 

look<00:00:03.990> at<00:00:04.140> an<00:00:04.230> ear<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.410> corn<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:05.310> kernels

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
look at an ear of corn the kernels

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.460 
look at an ear of corn the kernels
aren't<00:00:06.000> exactly<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.750> same<00:00:06.960> all<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.379> way

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
aren't exactly the same all the way

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.560 
aren't exactly the same all the way
across<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.890> ear<00:00:08.340> oftentimes<00:00:09.030> at<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> lower

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
across that ear oftentimes at the lower

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.020 
across that ear oftentimes at the lower
part<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> ear<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.800> see<00:00:11.010> bigger<00:00:11.490> more

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
part of the ear you see bigger more

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.419 
part of the ear you see bigger more
round<00:00:12.420> kernels<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.769> middle<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> ear

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
round kernels in the middle of the ear

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.630 
round kernels in the middle of the ear
you<00:00:14.730> see<00:00:14.969> smaller<00:00:15.599> more<00:00:16.410> flat<00:00:16.859> kernels<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
you see smaller more flat kernels and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.250 
you see smaller more flat kernels and
then<00:00:17.789> at<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> top<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> ear<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.930> could<00:00:19.140> be

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
then at the top of the ear it could be

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
then at the top of the ear it could be
just<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.619> anything<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.400> typically<00:00:20.789> it's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
just about anything but typically it's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.759 
just about anything but typically it's
really<00:00:21.330> small<00:00:21.600> kernels<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> top<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
really small kernels at the top of the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650 
really small kernels at the top of the
year<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.130> are<00:00:23.160> usually<00:00:23.670> fairly<00:00:23.820> round<00:00:24.180> so

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
year that are usually fairly round so

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.570 
year that are usually fairly round so
what<00:00:24.900> seed<00:00:25.140> companies<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.800> done<00:00:26.039> when

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
what seed companies have done when

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.310 
what seed companies have done when
they're<00:00:26.760> cleaning<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.300> seed<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> processing

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
they're cleaning the seed and processing

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.140 
they're cleaning the seed and processing
the<00:00:28.439> seed<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.800> found<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.250> farmers<00:00:29.699> liked

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the seed they found that farmers liked

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.939 
the seed they found that farmers liked
having<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.660> consistent<00:00:31.050> seed<00:00:31.470> size<00:00:31.710> well

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
having a consistent seed size well

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.310 
having a consistent seed size well
they're<00:00:32.099> separated<00:00:32.820> big<00:00:33.390> seed<00:00:33.690> away<00:00:34.020> from

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
they're separated big seed away from

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770 
they're separated big seed away from
medium<00:00:35.130> sized<00:00:35.370> seed<00:00:35.670> away<00:00:36.030> from<00:00:36.390> small<00:00:36.660> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
medium sized seed away from small so

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
medium sized seed away from small so
yeah<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> whole<00:00:37.320> reason<00:00:37.500> why<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.860> these

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
yeah but the whole reason why is these

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.490 
yeah but the whole reason why is these
farmers<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.030> gonna<00:00:39.180> plant<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.719> seed<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
farmers are gonna plant this seed and in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.380 
farmers are gonna plant this seed and in
the<00:00:40.590> past<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.340> planners<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.120> quite

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the past the planners really quite

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.639 
the past the planners really quite
frankly<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.899> been<00:00:42.930> horrible

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
frankly have been horrible

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
frankly have been horrible
you<00:00:43.770> can't<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.280> plant<00:00:44.520> anything<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.239> have

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
you can't just plant anything you have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
you can't just plant anything you have
to<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.930> certain<00:00:46.469> seed<00:00:46.710> size<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.430> have

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to have a certain seed size and you have

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.069 
to have a certain seed size and you have
to<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.420> setting<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to have just the right setting and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
to have just the right setting and
everything<00:00:49.410> else<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.829> order<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.340> fairly

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
everything else in order to get fairly

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479 
everything else in order to get fairly

you know it really did make a lot of
difference<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.820> seed<00:01:12.119> size<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.630> had<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> of

and if you didn't have that right seed
size<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> setting<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.850> right

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
for a couple of these planters it wasn't

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
for a couple of these planters it wasn't
very<00:01:20.189> good<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.850> other<00:01:20.970> thing<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> was

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
very good the other thing that was

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
very good the other thing that was
interesting<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:22.110> looking<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> mixed<00:01:23.460> bag<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
interesting is looking at a mixed bag of

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.550 
interesting is looking at a mixed bag of
seed<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.780> some<00:01:24.960> companies<00:01:25.259> now

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
seed and there are some companies now

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
seed and there are some companies now
that<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> market<00:01:26.430> plateless<00:01:27.119> seed<00:01:27.360> where

that want to market plateless seed where

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
that want to market plateless seed where
it<00:01:27.869> could<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.439> round<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> flat<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.759> large

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

handle<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.909> you've<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.390> your

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
handle that you've got to have your

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
handle that you've got to have your
planter<00:01:36.900> set<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.799> handle<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
planter set up so it can handle a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
planter set up so it can handle a
variety<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> seed<00:01:39.150> sizes<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:40.259> we

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
variety of seed sizes and when we

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
variety of seed sizes and when we
compared<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> different<00:01:41.220> planters<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
compared the different planters with a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
compared the different planters with a
mixed<00:01:42.810> bag<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> variety<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.130> seed<00:01:44.340> sizes

the<00:01:45.000> performance<00:01:45.509> really<00:01:45.659> started<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> change

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the performance really started to change

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.719 
the performance really started to change
that's<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.009> our<00:01:47.159> farm<00:01:47.399> that's<00:01:47.579> one

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that's right so on our farm that's one

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.280 
that's right so on our farm that's one
of<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> reasons<00:01:48.180> why<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.659> were<00:01:48.840> using<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of the reasons why we were using a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.020 
of the reasons why we were using a
kinsey<00:01:49.649> planner<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.220> switched<00:01:50.549> over<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
kinsey planner now we switched over to a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.880 
kinsey planner now we switched over to a
case<00:01:51.299> IH<00:01:51.600> planter<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.259> handle<00:01:52.470> all<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
case IH planter that can handle all the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.200 
case IH planter that can handle all the
different<00:01:53.009> seed<00:01:53.340> sizes<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> little<00:01:54.030> better

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
different seed sizes a little better

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
different seed sizes a little better
without<00:01:54.479> us<00:01:54.780> constantly<00:01:55.320> having<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.770> make

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
without us constantly having to make

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.889 
without us constantly having to make
adjustments<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.659> very<00:01:57.840> best

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
adjustments there to get the very best

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.319 
adjustments there to get the very best
planting<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.369> important<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.000> may<00:02:00.119> say

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
planting and it's important you may say

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.510 
planting and it's important you may say
well<00:02:00.540> what's<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.200> big<00:02:01.350> deal<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
well what's the big deal with this and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
well what's the big deal with this and
why<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> plan<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.479> perfect

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
why do you have to plan it so perfect

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.810 
why do you have to plan it so perfect
and<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.590> reason<00:02:04.979> why<00:02:05.100> when<00:02:05.430> you're<00:02:05.549> looking

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and the reason why when you're looking

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.359 
and the reason why when you're looking
at<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> cornfield<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:07.500> example<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.250> you're

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
at a cornfield for example when you're

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
at a cornfield for example when you're
planting<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.879> seed<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.599> drop

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
planting that seed you want it to drop

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.410 
planting that seed you want it to drop
evenly<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.709> every<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.459> many<00:02:11.520> inches<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.180> want

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
evenly so every so many inches you want

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.400 
evenly so every so many inches you want
to<00:02:12.599> plant<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
to plant so there

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.380 
to plant so there
evenly<00:02:13.650> spaced<00:02:13.980> out<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.550> he<00:02:14.640> also<00:02:14.850> want<00:02:15.210> them

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
evenly spaced out and he also want them

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.750 
evenly spaced out and he also want them
at<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.630> same<00:02:15.870> depth<00:02:16.350> all<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> way<00:02:17.070> across<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
at the same depth all the way across the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.400 
at the same depth all the way across the
field<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.270> reason<00:02:18.600> why<00:02:18.720> they'll<00:02:18.990> all<00:02:19.170> come

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
field the reason why they'll all come

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.900 
field the reason why they'll all come
out<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.740> ground<00:02:20.010> about<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> same<00:02:20.670> day

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
out of the ground about the same day

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.730 
out of the ground about the same day
they'll<00:02:21.270> all<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.600> about<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.020> same<00:02:22.200> size<00:02:22.470> as

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
they'll all be about the same size as

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.410 
they'll all be about the same size as
they're<00:02:22.920> growing<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.880> little<00:02:24.090> easier

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
they're growing and it's a little easier

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.150 
they're growing and it's a little easier
to<00:02:24.570> compete<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.080> take<00:02:25.410> Bryan<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.860> me<00:02:25.950> for

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
to compete I take Bryan and me for

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.950 
to compete I take Bryan and me for
example<00:02:26.640> when<00:02:26.820> when<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.270> were<00:02:27.420> young<00:02:27.720> we

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
example when when we were young we

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.900 
example when when we were young we
weren't<00:02:28.320> exactly<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.860> same<00:02:29.070> age<00:02:29.280> or<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.700> same

weren't exactly the same age or the same
size<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.570> for<00:02:31.170> some<00:02:31.380> reason<00:02:31.830> Bryan<00:02:32.250> would

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
size and for some reason Bryan would

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.160 
size and for some reason Bryan would
tend<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> get<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> little<00:02:33.300> bit<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:33.690> food<00:02:33.990> than

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
tend to get a little bit more food than

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.200 
tend to get a little bit more food than
I<00:02:34.290> would<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:35.250> he<00:02:35.400> was<00:02:35.550> bigger<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
I would because he was bigger and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.970 
I would because he was bigger and
tougher<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.900> he<00:02:37.170> would<00:02:37.260> pull<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> away<00:02:37.650> it's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
tougher and he would pull it away it's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.440 
tougher and he would pull it away it's
the<00:02:38.070> same<00:02:38.310> thing<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.610> corn<00:02:38.910> plants<00:02:39.240> when<00:02:39.360> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the same thing with corn plants when you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.120 
the same thing with corn plants when you
have<00:02:39.570> one<00:02:39.810> that's<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.320> taller<00:02:40.710> it's<00:02:41.040> a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
have one that's a little taller it's a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.950 
have one that's a little taller it's a
few<00:02:41.370> leaves<00:02:41.610> ahead<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> next<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.660> over

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
few leaves ahead of the next one over

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.050 
few leaves ahead of the next one over
it's<00:02:43.500> gonna<00:02:43.770> take<00:02:44.040> all<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.520> water<00:02:44.730> all<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
it's gonna take all the water all the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.700 
it's gonna take all the water all the
nutrients<00:02:45.630> that's<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.020> shade<00:02:46.260> out<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
nutrients that's going to shade out the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.470 
nutrients that's going to shade out the
other<00:02:46.860> one<00:02:47.100> from<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.580> sunlight<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.330> not

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
other one from the sunlight so it's not

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120 
other one from the sunlight so it's not
gonna<00:02:48.660> grow<00:02:48.870> as<00:02:49.080> well<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.770> one<00:02:49.920> that's

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
gonna grow as well so the one that's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.070 
gonna grow as well so the one that's
ahead<00:02:50.250> early<00:02:50.610> usually<00:02:51.030> turns<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.600> great<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
ahead early usually turns out great and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.380 
ahead early usually turns out great and
the<00:02:52.170> one<00:02:52.320> that's<00:02:52.470> behind<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:53.490> know<00:02:53.610> well<00:02:54.360> that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the one that's behind you know well that

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.850 
the one that's behind you know well that
is<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.870> case<00:02:55.080> unless<00:02:55.800> they<00:02:56.040> ripen<00:02:56.550> too<00:02:56.790> quickly

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
is in case unless they ripen too quickly

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.740 
is in case unless they ripen too quickly
in<00:02:58.860> an<00:02:59.040> early<00:02:59.400> age<00:02:59.550> or<00:02:59.940> something<00:03:00.240> or<00:03:00.450> stop

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
in an early age or something or stop

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.620 
in an early age or something or stop
growing<00:03:01.140> something<00:03:01.710> well<00:03:02.700> anyway<00:03:03.120> hey

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
growing something well anyway hey

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.690 
growing something well anyway hey
getting<00:03:04.230> back<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> seed<00:03:04.890> size<00:03:05.190> thing<00:03:05.490> we

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
getting back to the seed size thing we

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.010 
getting back to the seed size thing we
just<00:03:05.910> wanted<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.420> understand<00:03:06.840> there<00:03:06.990> are

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
just wanted you to understand there are

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.810 
just wanted you to understand there are
a<00:03:07.140> lot<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.440> different<00:03:07.830> seed<00:03:08.040> sizes<00:03:08.580> when

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
a lot of different seed sizes when

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.240 
a lot of different seed sizes when
farmers<00:03:09.270> are<00:03:09.420> buying<00:03:09.600> corn<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.350> if<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.890> farmer

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
farmers are buying corn so if a farmer

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.250 
farmers are buying corn so if a farmer
does<00:03:11.400> not<00:03:11.580> have<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> right<00:03:12.090> planter<00:03:12.570> he<00:03:13.020> has

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
does not have the right planter he has

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.280 
does not have the right planter he has
to<00:03:13.470> look<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.130> certain<00:03:14.460> seed<00:03:14.910> size<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:16.110> buy

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
to look for a certain seed size to buy

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.860 
to look for a certain seed size to buy
and<00:03:16.710> seed<00:03:17.190> corn<00:03:17.459> supply<00:03:17.910> becomes<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.600> major

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
and seed corn supply becomes a major

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.600 
and seed corn supply becomes a major
problem<00:03:19.200> for<00:03:19.560> him<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:19.800> now<00:03:20.130> he<00:03:20.190> can't

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
problem for him because now he can't

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.340 
problem for him because now he can't
just<00:03:20.820> pick<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.209> one<00:03:21.390> variety<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:22.140> works

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
just pick the one variety that works

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.170 
just pick the one variety that works
good<00:03:22.560> he<00:03:22.800> has<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.040> have<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.190> one<00:03:23.430> variety<00:03:23.640> in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
good he has to have that one variety in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.420 
good he has to have that one variety in
the<00:03:24.570> right<00:03:24.750> seed<00:03:25.050> size<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.590> that's<00:03:25.890> difficult

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
the right seed size and that's difficult

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.790 
the right seed size and that's difficult
to<00:03:26.580> do<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:26.910> for<00:03:27.510> farmers<00:03:27.959> getting<00:03:28.230> seed<00:03:28.560> it's

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
to do so for farmers getting seed it's

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.890 
to do so for farmers getting seed it's
it's<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.340> tough<00:03:29.700> choice<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.570> what<00:03:30.720> they're

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
it's a tough choice of what they're

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.960 
it's a tough choice of what they're
gonna<00:03:31.020> do<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.350> how<00:03:31.920> they're<00:03:32.100> gonna<00:03:32.220> make<00:03:32.760> all

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
gonna do and how they're gonna make all

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.670 
gonna do and how they're gonna make all
this<00:03:33.120> work<00:03:33.390> out<00:03:33.570> because<00:03:33.780> sometimes<00:03:34.200> a

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
this work out because sometimes a

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.830 
this work out because sometimes a
variety<00:03:35.370> may<00:03:35.550> only<00:03:35.820> have<00:03:36.150> small<00:03:36.420> seed

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
variety may only have small seed

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.750 
variety may only have small seed
available<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.680> can't<00:03:37.890> even<00:03:38.130> get<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.550> big

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
available and you can't even get the big

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.510 
available and you can't even get the big
seed<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.450> may<00:03:39.840> not<00:03:40.080> get<00:03:40.380> exactly<00:03:40.830> what<00:03:41.430> you

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
seed so you may not get exactly what you

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.340 
seed so you may not get exactly what you
want<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.940> way<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.390> when<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.630> comes<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.080> weed

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
want that way but when it comes to weed

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.870 
want that way but when it comes to weed
control<00:03:43.590> things<00:03:44.220> are<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> little<00:03:44.550> easier

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
control things are a little easier

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.640 
control things are a little easier
because<00:03:45.510> we're<00:03:45.720> talking<00:03:45.930> about<00:03:46.200> things<00:03:46.470> that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
because we're talking about things that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.949 
because we're talking about things that
killed<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.459> week's<00:03:47.790> wheat<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.390> week<00:03:48.540> can

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
killed this week's wheat of the week can

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.530 
killed this week's wheat of the week can
you<00:03:49.080> identify<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.650> tough<00:03:50.070> weed

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
you identify this tough weed

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.599 
you identify this tough weed
