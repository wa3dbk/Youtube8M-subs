00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
inch X 4 500 a long time ago and the Tri

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
inch X 4 500 a long time ago and the Tri
nomas<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.820> maximizing<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> color

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
nomas was all about maximizing the color

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.990 
nomas was all about maximizing the color
and<00:00:54.329> using<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> time<00:00:55.430> individual<00:00:56.430> RGB

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and using at the time individual RGB

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
and using at the time individual RGB
LEDs<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.719> give<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> much<00:00:58.199> better<00:00:58.410> color

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
LEDs to give you a much better color

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.819 
LEDs to give you a much better color
gamut<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.760> we're<00:01:00.390> keeping<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.050> same<00:01:01.079> concept

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
gamut so we're keeping the same concept

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.009 
gamut so we're keeping the same concept
we<00:01:02.129> want<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.609> wider<00:01:02.850> color<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> time

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
we want to get wider color but this time

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
we want to get wider color but this time
we're<00:01:04.500> putting<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> filter<00:01:05.280> over<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> edge

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
we're putting a filter over the edge

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.410 
we're putting a filter over the edge
LEDs<00:01:06.659> around<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.409> TV<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.490> filter<00:01:08.760> kind

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
LEDs around the TV and this filter kind

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
LEDs around the TV and this filter kind
of<00:01:09.590> make<00:01:10.590> sure<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> balance<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.490> red

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of make sure that the balance of red

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.039 
of make sure that the balance of red
green<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.030> blue<00:01:12.210> light<00:01:12.390> coming<00:01:12.750> from<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
green and blue light coming from the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.420 
green and blue light coming from the
backlight<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.560> about<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> same<00:01:14.189> level

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
backlight is about the same level

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.420 
backlight is about the same level
because<00:01:15.000> sunlight<00:01:15.240> has<00:01:15.659> equal<00:01:16.380> spectrum<00:01:17.340> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
because sunlight has equal spectrum of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
because sunlight has equal spectrum of
red<00:01:17.549> green<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.850> blue<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.150> trying<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
red green and blue and you're trying to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.560 
red green and blue and you're trying to
achieve<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.049> level<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
achieve that level so we have this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
achieve that level so we have this
filter<00:01:21.570> technology<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> 4k<00:01:22.979> models<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
filter technology on the 4k models and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.210 
filter technology on the 4k models and
also<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> w9<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> TV<00:01:25.799> behind<00:01:26.100> me

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
also in the w9 which is the TV behind me

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.370 
also in the w9 which is the TV behind me
here<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.689> helping<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.020> color

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
here it's really helping with color

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.399 
here it's really helping with color
maybe<00:01:28.829> 20<00:01:29.340> 25<00:01:29.729> %<00:01:30.450> deeper<00:01:30.840> reds<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> greens

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
maybe 20 25 % deeper reds and greens

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.310 
maybe 20 25 % deeper reds and greens
also<00:01:31.829> blues<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:33.420> look<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.659> tropical<00:01:34.049> seas

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
also blues you look at tropical seas

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.130 
also blues you look at tropical seas
they<00:01:34.619> look<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> lot<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.720> emerald

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
they look a lot more you know emerald

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.160 
they look a lot more you know emerald
green<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.600> color<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.689> really

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
green is the kind of color that really

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
green is the kind of color that really
comes<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:41.340> helps<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.850> depth<00:01:42.150> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
comes out but also helps with depth of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
comes out but also helps with depth of
picture<00:01:42.810> excuse<00:01:43.439> me

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
picture excuse me

so<00:01:44.009> having<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> resolution<00:01:45.210> LED<00:01:45.600> backlight

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
so having the resolution LED backlight

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
so having the resolution LED backlight
Plus<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.530> color<00:01:46.770> technology<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.610> go

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
Plus this color technology really go

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.670 
Plus this color technology really go
better<00:01:48.210> sense<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> perspective<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
better sense of perspective off on the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
better sense of perspective off on the
image<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> minute

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
image and you can see that in a minute

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.800 
image and you can see that in a minute
behind<00:01:51.479> us

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
behind us

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.069 
behind us
yes<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.799> resort<00:01:54.100> 2<00:01:54.189> 3<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.640> is<00:01:55.090> 3d<00:01:55.570> but<00:01:55.810> it's<00:01:55.930> a

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
yes the resort 2 3 it is 3d but it's a

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.499 
yes the resort 2 3 it is 3d but it's a
2d<00:01:56.380> picture<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.009> looks<00:01:57.159> 3d<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.700> way<00:01:57.850> so

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
2d picture but it looks 3d in a way so

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.389 
2d picture but it looks 3d in a way so
that's<00:01:58.689> really<00:01:59.110> helping<00:01:59.470> for<00:01:59.619> texture<00:02:00.130> and

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
that's really helping for texture and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.090 
that's really helping for texture and
outline<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.479> resolution<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.860> color

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
outline and resolution just the color

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.639 
outline and resolution just the color

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
technology it's the try them is

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.020 
technology it's the try them is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
basically that much wider color space

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.770 
basically that much wider color space

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
don't know the answer to that but I know

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.840 
don't know the answer to that but I know
we<00:02:23.470> are<00:02:23.530> we're<00:02:23.830> trying<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.099> expand<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.640> color

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
we are we're trying to expand the color

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.030 
we are we're trying to expand the color
gamut<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.510> TV<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:25.989> display<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.560> then

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
gamut that the TV can display and then

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.530 
gamut that the TV can display and then
in<00:02:27.160> terms<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.610> capturing<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.450> know

in terms of capturing you know
camcorders<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.200> cameras<00:02:29.620> we'll<00:02:29.769> have<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.100> try

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
camcorders and cameras we'll have a try

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.009 
camcorders and cameras we'll have a try
luminous<00:02:30.910> color<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.569> recall<00:02:31.959> that

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
luminous color that can recall that

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.410 
luminous color that can recall that
wider<00:02:32.470> color<00:02:32.799> gamut<00:02:32.890> as<00:02:33.310> well<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.060> you've<00:02:34.209> got

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
wider color gamut as well so you've got

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.509 
wider color gamut as well so you've got
the<00:02:34.510> content<00:02:34.959> on<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.830> their<00:02:35.980> camera<00:02:36.370> or

color<00:02:40.090> technology<00:02:40.510> inside<00:02:40.989> as<00:02:41.140> well<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.530> then

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
color technology inside as well and then

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.680 
color technology inside as well and then
you're<00:02:42.010> getting<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.190> best<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.580> being<00:02:43.450> able<00:02:43.569> to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
you're getting the best of being able to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.180 
you're getting the best of being able to
display<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.260> accurately<00:02:44.830> all<00:02:45.010> those

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
display that accurately all those

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.309 
display that accurately all those
different<00:02:45.489> color<00:02:45.670> shades<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.599> new<00:02:46.690> panel

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.650 

so<00:02:50.319> that's<00:02:50.500> color<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:51.220> addition<00:02:51.670> trailer<00:02:52.269> in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
so that's color in addition trailer in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.039 
so that's color in addition trailer in

only got one ship called extremity pro
last<00:02:59.049> year<00:02:59.320> or<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.470> remember<00:02:59.560> we<00:02:59.799> had<00:02:59.950> actuality

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
last year or I remember we had actuality

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.430 
last year or I remember we had actuality
on<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.090> low<00:03:01.239> end<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.600> then<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> pro<00:03:02.200> version

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
on the low end and then the pro version

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.160 
on the low end and then the pro version
on<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.709> 850<00:03:03.310> now<00:03:04.000> we've<00:03:04.269> got<00:03:04.480> those<00:03:04.690> two<00:03:04.750> chips

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
on the 850 now we've got those two chips

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.380 
on the 850 now we've got those two chips
combined<00:03:05.620> into<00:03:05.859> one<00:03:06.070> which<00:03:06.790> means<00:03:07.030> even<00:03:07.299> the

picture quality from the HX 850 last
year<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.940> that's<00:03:16.060> no<00:03:16.510> extra<00:03:17.049> ality<00:03:17.260> Pro<00:03:17.500> but

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
year so that's no extra ality Pro but

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.640 
year so that's no extra ality Pro but
also<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.519> algorithm<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.230> inside<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.410> chips

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
also the algorithm in inside the chips

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.590 
also the algorithm in inside the chips
have<00:03:20.890> improved<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:22.000> we've<00:03:22.150> got<00:03:22.329> more

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
have improved so we've got more

that<00:03:38.799> chip<00:03:39.069> so<00:03:39.850> that's<00:03:40.389> quite<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.600> big

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
that chip so that's quite a big

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.020 
that chip so that's quite a big
improvement<00:03:40.989> from<00:03:41.290> last<00:03:41.350> year<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.489> it's<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
improvement from last year and it's the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.270 
improvement from last year and it's the
one<00:03:43.209> device<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.530> should<00:03:44.709> also<00:03:44.769> add<00:03:45.010> that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
one device and I should also add that

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.670 
one device and I should also add that
for<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.519> 4k<00:03:46.030> models<00:03:46.420> we<00:03:46.959> have<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.290> second

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
for the 4k models we have the second

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.349 
for the 4k models we have the second
chip<00:03:47.889> which<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.100> doing<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.609> upscaling<00:03:49.030> from

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
chip which is doing the upscaling from

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.050 
chip which is doing the upscaling from
two<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.780> four<00:03:49.959> K<00:03:50.170> in<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.920> case<00:03:51.130> on<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.430> 65<00:03:51.880> and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
two to four K in that case on the 65 and

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.120 
two to four K in that case on the 65 and
55<00:03:52.420> inches<00:03:52.630> they're<00:03:52.989> two<00:03:53.470> chips<00:03:53.769> in<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
55 inches they're two chips in the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.370 
55 inches they're two chips in the
