00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you can break that record I think it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:23.500 
you can break that record I think it
will<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.580> great<00:02:15.180> accomplishment<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:16.200> pass<00:02:22.310> I

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
will be a great accomplishment to pass I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.270 
will be a great accomplishment to pass I
think<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:25.140> my<00:02:25.350> CV<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.770> would<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> average

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
think in my CV I would have to average

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.490 
think in my CV I would have to average
right<00:02:26.730> around<00:02:26.760> 20<00:02:27.569> points<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.020> game<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
right around 20 points a game and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.550 
right around 20 points a game and
hopefully<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.069> play<00:02:29.459> at<00:02:29.610> least<00:02:29.819> 32<00:02:30.150> games

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
hopefully we can play at least 32 games

hopefully we can play at least 32 games
was<00:02:31.560> he<00:02:31.709> gets<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.160> record<00:02:32.580> or<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.880> purpose

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
was he gets that record or not purpose

on<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.660> final<00:02:37.170> pressure<00:02:37.500> cooker<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.280> Seattle

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.720 
on that final pressure cooker in Seattle
I<00:02:39.000> think<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.959> starting<00:02:40.290> five<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:41.430> as

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
I think that I was starting five is as

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220 
I think that I was starting five is as
good<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.060> any<00:02:42.209> starting<00:02:42.570> five<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.050> country

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
good as any starting five in the country

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.220 
good as any starting five in the country
and<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.100> think<00:02:44.310> I'll<00:02:44.459> bench<00:02:44.790> play<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:46.019> good

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
and I think I'll bench play is as good

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.960 
and I think I'll bench play is as good
as<00:02:46.380> any<00:02:46.680> bench<00:02:46.950> play<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> country<00:02:47.670> you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
as any bench play in the country you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.820 
as any bench play in the country you
know<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.269> get<00:02:48.450> ranked<00:02:48.810> up<00:02:48.930> by<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> lot<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.620> times

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
know we get ranked up by a lot of times

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.650 
know we get ranked up by a lot of times
in<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.130> preseason<00:02:50.550> then<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.090> lose<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> few
