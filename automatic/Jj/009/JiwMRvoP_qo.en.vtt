00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.290
 secondary fighter tank his

 little long so it's gone some 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.789
 fight for the honor of others for 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.030
 the glory that comes from the moment they 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.699
 fight atrocious my sense the stuffing

 people at rock it's a warrior 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.720
 legendary one of the last five 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.070
 survivors of an anti race known as the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.430
 name of the king darts 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.770
 he carries his broad and peace with grace and 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.620
 personable and is making its way in the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.719
 enemy ranks in a hypnotic style 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.880
 at each death in the opponent lalanne 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.399
 atrocious quivering of life seems 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.290
 drinking from his blood to barter feel a 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.399
 power that allows him to pursue 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.649
 its elegant the violent carnage atrox 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.899
 is present in the tales and legends 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.159
 for as long as there is a 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.960
 trace of human life 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.740
 for example, we are talking about a war 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.649
 forgotten between two big factions 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.600
 protectorate of Lords maj following 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.340
 a vertiginous series of victories 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.040
 seniors maj was about to cancel 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.800
 their hereditary enemies age 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.450
 but the day of the ultimate confrontation 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.810
 the lower protectorate army in 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.910
 number 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.260
 exhausted poorly equipped getting ready to 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.180
 the enigma holiday table all hope 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.520
 seemed lost when atrox appears at 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.300
 middle of the sparse ranks of the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.700
 protectorate 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.050
 in a few words he has a site at the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.300
 soldiers to fight until the last 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.940
 drop of blood and threw himself into 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.440
 the battle his presence was a source 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.990
 of inspiration for warriors 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.270
 desperate at first they were content 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.340
 to gawk at this unknown hero 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.770
 size and returns to the enemy's body 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.840
 and his blade moving in unison as 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.510
 if they were one but quickly 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.150
 the fighters feel seized by a 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.760
 powerful warrior momentum and threw themselves 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.860
 in the scrum after the date rocks 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.970
 each time as 10 up 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.530
 getting a ruthless triumph 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.450
 atrox gone after this fight 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.180
 but the new fury of the army of 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.550
 protectorate she endures in a series of 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.890
 victories followed this one and the soldiers 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.540
 of the protectorate end up going home 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.560
 they triumphantly they were welcomed 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.900
 like heroes 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.400
 but although they saved their 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.019
 civilization of destruction the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.450
 darkness had seized the ram 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.000
 something in the depths of had 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.530
 changed little by little the memories and aurec 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.500
 fighters gave way to a 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.440
 terrible illuminations far from 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.690
 lead as a hero he had perpetrated 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.120
 their hands terrible atrocities 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.420
 we find similar stories in 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.980
 the myths hours of many cultures 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.110
 if you have to believe them the presence of 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.209
 atrocious changed the course of a few 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.820
 of the most important conflicts of 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.040
 history if these stories presented 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.470
 atrocious as the unexpected savior in 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.989
 a period are the truth and 4 offs to 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.560
 sow everywhere in its wake the war 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.440
 and carnage 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.470
 that's history that's it that's it 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.050
 the story 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.180
 so I 'm giving you a little summary so 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.490
 that in fact atrocious it's a warrior for 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.890
 unknown to the battalion he defends no 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.450
 nation he is a little bit alone and 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.920
 in fact they arrive in the gifts he 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.290
 already existed for a very long time 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.690
 and it happens in wars actually 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.000
 to give some momentum for him 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.400
 allows to win to win except that 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.470
 do that the corons opposite coron their 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.380
 soul and after that the black gold their ram 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.650
 blackened and thus joined the darkness 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.950
 I think that's a little trick in 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.000
 genre 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:30.410
 it's not bad it's frankly it's 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.270
 a good being the story for ever 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.460
 for atrox I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.220
 it was not my favorite character I 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.840
 you do it but at least it's done 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.530
 and I know that many like it 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.630
 so here's a little dedication I find 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.630
 for a next champion he blamed
