Saurus<00:01:56.580> Rex

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
Saurus Rex

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.380 
Saurus Rex
I<00:01:59.560> put<00:02:00.560> him<00:02:00.710> more<00:02:00.980> on<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.400> horizontal<00:02:01.940> plane

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
I put him more on a horizontal plane

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.090 
I put him more on a horizontal plane
rather<00:02:03.200> than<00:02:03.380> operate<00:02:04.220> like<00:02:04.430> he<00:02:04.610> was

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
rather than operate like he was

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.580 
rather than operate like he was
I<00:02:06.159> just<00:02:06.460> think<00:02:06.700> he<00:02:06.790> looks<00:02:07.030> more<00:02:07.119> like

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
I just think he looks more like

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.820 
I just think he looks more like
Tyrannosaurus<00:02:08.590> Rex<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.459> this

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
Tyrannosaurus Rex like this

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.790 
Tyrannosaurus Rex like this
but<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.430> I've<00:02:11.580> done

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
but what I've done

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.570 
but what I've done
as<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.160> made<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:15.050> can<00:02:15.470> put<00:02:16.250> him<00:02:16.460> in

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
as I made it so that you can put him in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.620 
as I made it so that you can put him in
that<00:02:16.670> upright<00:02:17.000> position

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
that upright position

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.620 
that upright position
you<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.350> gotta<00:02:18.500> bend<00:02:18.770> his<00:02:18.920> tail<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.820> then

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
you just gotta bend his tail and then

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.040 
you just gotta bend his tail and then
bend<00:02:20.870> his<00:02:21.020> head<00:02:21.050> down<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.190> here<00:02:23.180> he<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
bend his head down and here he is the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.510 
bend his head down and here he is the
way<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.500> he<00:02:24.740> looked<00:02:25.070> in
