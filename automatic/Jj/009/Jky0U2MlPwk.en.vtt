00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
to test whether or not a laser would be

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.480 
to test whether or not a laser would be

potentially battling corals in this case
it's<00:00:25.199> not<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.529> bad<00:00:25.740> because<00:00:26.099> they're<00:00:26.250> both

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it's not that bad because they're both

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.230 
it's not that bad because they're both
my<00:00:26.550> knees<00:00:27.769> they're<00:00:28.769> actually<00:00:29.220> kind<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
my knees they're actually kind of just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.030 
my knees they're actually kind of just
growing<00:00:30.449> right<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.689> against<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.140> another<00:00:31.170> but

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
growing right up against one another but

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.260

distinct reason to keep them separate to

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
distinct reason to keep them separate to
eliminate<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> battles<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.350> a

one else in the environment and I've

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.190 
one else in the environment and I've
gone<00:01:05.700> ahead<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> used<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.420> green<00:01:06.659> targeting

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
gone ahead and used a green targeting

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
gone ahead and used a green targeting
laser<00:01:07.409> prior<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.090> too<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> look

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
laser prior to to this too just to look

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
laser prior to to this too just to look
for<00:01:10.320> any<00:01:10.500> dangerous<00:01:10.920> reflections<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.670> also

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
for any dangerous reflections are also

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.010 
for any dangerous reflections are also
to<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.119> certain<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> reflection

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to make certain that the reflection

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
to make certain that the reflection
wasn't<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> impact<00:01:13.920> other<00:01:14.130> corals

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
wasn't going to impact other corals

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.810 
wasn't going to impact other corals
nearby<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.840> cause<00:01:16.049> any<00:01:16.290> damage<00:01:16.520> ok<00:01:17.520> here

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
nearby and then cause any damage ok here

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.440 
nearby and then cause any damage ok here
we<00:01:17.880> go

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.580 

and<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.200> again<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.560> goal<00:01:25.399> here<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.909> just<00:01:26.210> to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
and so again the goal here is just to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.550 
and so again the goal here is just to
kind<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.649> lays<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.920> line<00:01:28.369> separating<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:30.380> two

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
kind of lays a line separating the two

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.480 
kind of lays a line separating the two
corals<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:33.259> can<00:01:33.409> see<00:01:33.649> that<00:01:33.679> all<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
corals and you can see that all the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:51.230 
corals and you can see that all the
polyps<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.210> immediate<00:01:35.360> area<00:01:35.770> close

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.620 

not<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.320> way<00:01:52.409> back<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
not going to go all the way back just to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
not going to go all the way back just to
do<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.960> front<00:01:55.350> corner<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.460> we'll

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
do the very front corner and then we'll

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.149 
do the very front corner and then we'll
watch<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.970> for<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:01.049> few<00:02:01.710> months<00:02:01.860> thereafter

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
watch this for a few months thereafter

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.649 
watch this for a few months thereafter
to<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> recovery<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.259> if

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
to see what the recovery is like and if

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.050 
to see what the recovery is like and if
we<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.960> could<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> vile<00:02:07.470> vile<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.160> use

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.800 

hopefully<00:02:12.060> you're<00:02:12.150> able<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.360> hear<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
hopefully you're able to hear the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.979 
hopefully you're able to hear the
popping<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.980> sizzling<00:02:14.400> sounds<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.840> can

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
popping and sizzling sounds and I can

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:24.729 
popping and sizzling sounds and I can
already<00:02:16.110> see<00:02:16.440> things<00:02:16.739> starting<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.130> slime<00:02:17.340> up

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739
