00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.290
 welcome to iron spartan 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.390
 we started with a warm up with 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.190
 our green diet santana the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.970
 heating for the whole part of the 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.290
 service leg called squat but 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.970
 we are inside a special machine 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.180
 in the machine and conditioned for this 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.040
 for this and with much 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.260
 protection of the lower back 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.469
 and in the area of â€‹â€‹the back 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.390
 we are heating 18 20 repetitions and 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.670
 little by little we are loading weight for 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.479
 encourage warmth and making it 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.130
 the work of a progressive pyramid 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.380
 Going up weight 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.950
 the exercise as you can see the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.650
 90 degree push-ups do not imply the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.370
 lumbar and legs are to the width 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.370
 of the shoulders 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.010
 we continue to gain weight we keep going up 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.090
 I think our fellow Christians 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.570
 continues to put weight on the athlete 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.359
 in these exercises we will make a 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.040
 ascending pyramid series of 20 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.650
 repetitions 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.450
 rising load inter repetitions we see 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.869
 load 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.310
 12 repetitions and we will do a series with 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.789
 maximum loads between 8 and 10 repetitions 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.789
 as we will see 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.430
 extension of wilders you have to regulate the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.010
 machine so that it is completely 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.349
 roll over the insteps and adjust 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.870
 well the seat so it does not get up 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.560
 the gluteus of the seat at the time of making 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.560
 the extension 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.080
 and we will do a series of warming 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.660
 between 2025 repetitions to give the 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.660
 maximum heat to the zone of 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.880
 as you can see 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.880
 we go up to 90 degrees and go down to 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.540
 with which we cause a job 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.060
 general in the checkered area 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.190
 here we will do 4 series also pyramid 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.270
 ascending plus a pumping we will do 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:07.240
 series of 15 12 10 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.460
 8 and the pumping back to take weight and 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.630
 we will do 15 more repetitions with which 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.470
 we will cause great congestion 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.270
 muscle and a great bloodstream to all 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.050
 the quadriceps area 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.940
 in this case I would enter haq 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.600
 this exercise is another type of 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.490
 squat which works 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.510
 with much more emphasis in the area 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.510
 anterior of the leg 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.060
 Exercise also our athlete Alberto 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.250
 Santana will cause maximum congestion 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.620
 realizing series 4 series d 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.350
 of ascending pyramid and one more series 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.610
 of pumping with which we will work 18 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.590
 what 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.710
 12 8 maximum weight we will extract weight and 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.000
 we will do again 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.000
 18 more repetitions 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.420
 with the envelopes alberto santana is 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.500
 performing deadweight stretches 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.580
 Romanian for the femoral ischium area 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.450
 Well, this is the whole part 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.450
 back of the leg 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.010
 this is a little unknown service 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.350
 which are the reverse squats with what 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.240
 which the gluteal area has the maximum 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.210
 implication 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.169
 we will do some 4 series between 15 and 18 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.419
 repetitions to stimulate this well 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.660
 muscle so sought after by all 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.600
 athletes 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.310
 without leaving a minute of rest 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.200
 we went on to stimulate the lower back and 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.200
 gluteus with lumbar extensions 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.400
 will perform Alberto about 4 series between 25 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.190
 and 30 repetitions 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.810
 with a break before series between 30 and 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.810
 45 seconds 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.969
 we will move to stimulate the area of 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.089
 waist once we have the 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.379
 Lumbar muscles totally worked with 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.139
 waist twists 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.860
 we will do about 100 repetitions two series 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.860
 continued 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.520
 the abdominals a contraction with 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.690
 ballast with ballast working between 45 and 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.479
 50 kg 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:44.970
 Alberto will perform 4 series between 25 and 30 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.419
 repeats this exercise once you 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.030
 we have finished it we will go to the 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.440
 cardio zone here are an exercise a 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.169
 little different than what you have seen 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.020
 usually they are striding 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.360
 made with elevation to 8% there is a 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.150
 not too high speed 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.330
 here we stimulate the entire gluteal area 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:10.520
 quadriceps and is really the icing on the 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.780
 our leg work cake 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.540
 gluteal and femoral 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.760
 this work 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:23.160
 are two minutes of completion of 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:26.580
 stride and a minute of normal work 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.880
 with normal stride and walking to zero 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.880
 degrees
