00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.980
 so here we have an aerocool power supply 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:17.670
 600 watt bronze ovsky strike 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:21.420
 80 + rus and so the specifications stated 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.990
 producer to write amp 600 watt 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:33.410
 line 12 is normal for a 600 padded jacket so 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.410
 here again we have some specifications 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:45.260
 it's not modular just a bunch of whole 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:57.570
 baltic 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:01:02.329
 network cable itself is a power supply such 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.329
 reddish burgundy 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.970
 here is such 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.420
 preferred mounting position 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:26.740
 fan down I do not know it glows 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:30.160
 or not a fan here insert 140 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:36.430
 the fan looks so good 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:39.880
 who is the principle of lying will be like this 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:48.310
 we are all sorts of crap as far as I am 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:54.220
 I know 5 goes with us sata 5 mole x 24 + 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:57.970
 20 + 4 motherboard where that one here four 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.550
 plus four processor on and a connector is it 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:07.659
 we have a signature and an express 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.350
 we are two pis express 6 plus 2 and 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.680
 what both 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.810
 it is very good that is the principle 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.170
 You can easily top it anytime. 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:22.920
 connect but not done without a flop like 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:26.830
 there is always such a venti cooler block 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.110
 uninterrupted power supply unit 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:36.720
 power computer such materialchik 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.720
 nice here so thank you
