00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
CPU it is running Windows 8 so I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.580 
CPU it is running Windows 8 so I
definitely<00:00:40.649> wanted<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> upgrade<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.520> memory

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
definitely wanted to upgrade the memory

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.930 
definitely wanted to upgrade the memory
so<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.890> we're<00:00:43.980> gonna<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.430 

would<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:47.969> done<00:00:48.149> an<00:00:48.270> unboxing<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.140> but

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
would have done an unboxing of this but

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.600 
would have done an unboxing of this but
obviously<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> Christmas

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
obviously because it was a Christmas

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
obviously because it was a Christmas
gift<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:52.020> daughter<00:00:52.230> wanted<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> open<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
gift and my daughter wanted to open it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
gift and my daughter wanted to open it
right<00:00:53.010> away<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:53.579> wasn't<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.030> any<00:00:54.149> time

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
right away there wasn't really any time

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
right away there wasn't really any time
for<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.460> know<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.760> really

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
for that but you know there really

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.470

whatever and just documentation really

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
whatever and just documentation really
and<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.369> obviously<00:01:09.290> power

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and then you do get obviously power

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 
and then you do get obviously power
supply<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.979> AC<00:01:11.430> adapter<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> course<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
Wireless n connectivity which is nice so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.359 
Wireless n connectivity which is nice so
I<00:01:52.200> mean<00:01:52.409> overall<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> pretty<00:01:53.130> basic

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.660 
one here and one here which will undo
and<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.230> panel<00:02:17.860> will<00:02:17.950> slide<00:02:18.220> down<00:02:18.430> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
and then this panel will slide down and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.770 
and then this panel will slide down and
then<00:02:18.880> we<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.270> get<00:02:19.480> at<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.690> memory<00:02:21.480> ok<00:02:22.480> screws

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
then we can get at the memory ok screws

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.810 
then we can get at the memory ok screws
are<00:02:22.900> out<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.010> panel<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.550> slides

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
are out and then this panel just slides

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.360 
are out and then this panel just slides
down<00:02:25.050> like<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.440> then<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.130> just

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
down like that and then you can just

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.450 
down like that and then you can just
lift<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.640> off<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:32.190> I've<00:02:33.190> got<00:02:33.370> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
a couple of 4 gig sticks so we'll get

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.400 
a couple of 4 gig sticks so we'll get
eight<00:03:10.090> gigs<00:03:10.330> total<00:03:10.720> once<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:11.050> get<00:03:11.200> everything

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
installed changing memory on laptops is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.080 
installed changing memory on laptops is
actually<00:03:17.230> pretty<00:03:17.350> easy<00:03:17.760> memories<00:03:18.760> held<00:03:18.940> in

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
actually pretty easy memories held in

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.760 
actually pretty easy memories held in
place<00:03:19.209> by<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.540> couple<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.870> latches<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.560> either

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
place by a couple of latches on either

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.560 
place by a couple of latches on either
side<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.430> just<00:03:21.640> disengage<00:03:22.090> those<00:03:22.330> latches

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
side so you just disengage those latches

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.930 
side so you just disengage those latches
like<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.860> then<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.340> memory<00:03:24.550> just<00:03:24.760> pops

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
like that and then the memory just pops

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.430 
like that and then the memory just pops
out<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:26.530> then<00:03:27.459> installation<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.480> pretty<00:03:29.020> easy

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
out and then installation is pretty easy

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.130 
out and then installation is pretty easy
just<00:03:29.800> do<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.160> opposite<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.880> just<00:03:31.150> bring

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
just do the opposite you just bring

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.350 
just do the opposite you just bring
memory<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.739> an<00:03:32.860> angle<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.370> then<00:03:34.150> just

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
memory in on an angle and then just

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.210 
memory in on an angle and then just
press<00:03:34.510> down<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.050> then<00:03:35.890> you'll<00:03:36.070> hear<00:03:36.160> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
press down and then you'll hear the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.560 
press down and then you'll hear the
click<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.750> then<00:03:37.989> we're<00:03:38.110> doing<00:03:39.030> eight<00:03:40.030> gigs

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
click and then we're doing eight gigs

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.960 
click and then we're doing eight gigs
total<00:03:41.200> there<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:41.920> there's<00:03:42.280> our<00:03:42.430> second<00:03:42.820> piece

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
total there so there's our second piece

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.740 
total there so there's our second piece
go<00:03:43.600> ahead<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.900> push<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.170> down<00:03:44.320> assistant

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
go ahead and push that down assistant

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.800 
go ahead and push that down assistant
like<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:47.070> nice<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.100> easy

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.320 

but<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.230> menus<00:03:51.740> I'll<00:03:52.250> just<00:03:52.640> put<00:03:52.970> everything

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
but the menus I'll just put everything

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.770 
but the menus I'll just put everything
back<00:03:53.690> together<00:03:53.990> again<00:03:55.450> we<00:03:56.450> put<00:03:56.569> everything

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
back together again we put everything

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.410 
back together again we put everything
back<00:03:57.020> together<00:03:57.340> rebooted<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.550> we<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.209> see

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
back together rebooted and we can see

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.010 
back together rebooted and we can see
that<00:03:59.540> we've<00:03:59.660> got<00:03:59.690> eight<00:03:59.959> gigs<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.350> memory<00:04:02.020> that

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020
