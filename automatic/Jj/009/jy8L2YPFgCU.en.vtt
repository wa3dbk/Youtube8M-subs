you have to shoot that see that glowing
ass<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.620> shoot<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> ass

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
ass of it and you shoot it in the ass

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
ass of it and you shoot it in the ass
and<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.719> will<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.290> like

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and then it it will it's just like

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.080 
and then it it will it's just like
actually<00:00:40.770> centipede<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.489> make<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
actually centipede it will make it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.479 
actually centipede it will make it
smaller<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.420> smaller<00:00:42.980> -<00:00:43.980> brother<00:00:44.280> I'm

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
smaller and smaller - brother I'm

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.860 
smaller and smaller - brother I'm
shooting<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> backside<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
shooting in the backside in it and the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
shooting in the backside in it and the
pertinent<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.950> anyway<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.489> gameplay

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
pertinent but anyway so this gameplay

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
pertinent but anyway so this gameplay
though<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.180> more<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.719> how<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> kill<00:00:49.920> these

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
though is more of how to kill these

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.470 
though is more of how to kill these
big-ass<00:00:51.410> corpses<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.120> idea<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.210> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
big-ass corpses and the idea is you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
big-ass corpses and the idea is you
can't<00:00:54.719> shoot<00:00:54.989> him<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.260> he's<00:00:55.379> faced<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
can't shoot him when he's faced on you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.189 
can't shoot him when he's faced on you
have<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> shoot<00:00:57.030> him<00:00:57.199> when<00:00:58.199> he<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.780> like<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
have to shoot him when he is like on the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.729 
have to shoot him when he is like on the
side<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.370> he<00:01:02.699> opens<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.090> his<00:01:03.589> like<00:01:04.589> right

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
side or what he opens up his like right

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.990 
side or what he opens up his like right
here<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.220> him<00:01:05.400> shoot<00:01:05.790> him<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
here you can see him shoot him in the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.350 
here you can see him shoot him in the
back

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
back

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.390 
back
but<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> best<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.200> he<00:01:07.290> opens<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.710> his<00:01:07.770> his

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
but the best is when he opens up his his

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
but the best is when he opens up his his
arms<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.260> shoot<00:01:10.380> me<00:01:10.500> between

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
arms then then you can shoot me between

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.469

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
but yeah these guys are can be difficult

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.870 
but yeah these guys are can be difficult
it<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.620> be<00:02:03.710> difficult<00:02:03.890> around<00:02:04.190> if<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.700> don't

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.850 
it can be difficult around if you don't
have<00:02:05.030> enough<00:02:05.240> players<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.840> believe<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.620> did

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
have enough players I believe I just did

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.210 
have enough players I believe I just did
this<00:02:07.270> one<00:02:08.270> one<00:02:08.780> time<00:02:08.960> I<00:02:08.990> did<00:02:09.260> it<00:02:09.380> with<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:09.860> two

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
this one one time I did it with just two

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.070 
this one one time I did it with just two
players<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.850> then<00:02:10.970> another<00:02:11.420> time<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:11.690> did<00:02:11.960> it

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
players and then another time I did it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.220 
players and then another time I did it
with<00:02:12.200> four<00:02:12.950> players<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.930> got<00:02:15.110> down

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
with four players so I just got down

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.390 
with four players so I just got down
right<00:02:15.500> here<00:02:15.650> we're<00:02:15.800> kind<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.220> pickle

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
right here we're kind of in a pickle

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.980 
right here we're kind of in a pickle
like<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.060> didn't<00:02:17.270> think<00:02:17.390> we'd<00:02:17.570> be<00:02:17.600> able<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.870> beat

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
like I didn't think we'd be able to beat

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.740 
like I didn't think we'd be able to beat
this<00:02:18.110> round<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:19.100> know<00:02:19.310> get<00:02:19.520> big<00:02:19.730> fun<00:02:20.000> when

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
this round but you know get big fun when

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.240 
this round but you know get big fun when
we<00:02:20.840> had<00:02:20.960> four<00:02:21.230> players<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:21.710> ended<00:02:22.070> up<00:02:22.130> getting

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
we had four players we ended up getting

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.940 
we had four players we ended up getting
around<00:02:22.490> 48<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.990> more<00:02:24.170> players<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.530> merrier

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
around 48 so the more players in merrier

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550 
around 48 so the more players in merrier
in<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.420> mode<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:26.660> sure<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.170> don't<00:02:27.350> think

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
in this mode for sure and I don't think

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
in this mode for sure and I don't think
it<00:02:27.650> gets<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:28.040> don't<00:02:28.310> think<00:02:28.460> it's<00:02:28.550> any<00:02:28.700> easier

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
it gets I don't think it's any easier

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.410 
it gets I don't think it's any easier
when<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.480> have<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:31.940> player<00:02:32.210> or<00:02:32.240> two

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
when you have like one player or two

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.540 
when you have like one player or two
player<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.900> think<00:02:33.080> it's<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.470> same<00:02:33.710> like

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
player I think it's just the same like

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.730 
player I think it's just the same like
difficulty<00:02:35.420> level<00:02:35.660> unlike<00:02:35.990> zombies<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
difficulty level unlike zombies and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.160 
difficulty level unlike zombies and
probably<00:02:37.310> Call<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.820> Duty<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.870> little<00:02:39.050> bit

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
probably Call of Duty it's a little bit

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.690 
probably Call of Duty it's a little bit
easier<00:02:39.410> I'm<00:02:39.980> looking<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.280> for<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.460> trapped

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
easier I'm looking this for the trapped

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.050 
easier I'm looking this for the trapped
ourselves<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:42.220> my<00:02:43.220> brother<00:02:43.490> just<00:02:43.670> got<00:02:43.850> down
