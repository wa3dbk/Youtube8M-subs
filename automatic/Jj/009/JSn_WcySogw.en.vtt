figured here the rain in the background
it's<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.840> start<00:02:01.020> choking<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.350> down<00:02:01.700> um<00:02:02.700> but

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it's to start choking it down um but

you<00:02:50.670> don't<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.880> what<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.120> does<00:02:51.270> basically

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you don't know what that does basically

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.720 
you don't know what that does basically
what<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.110> does<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.620> allows<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.430> switch

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
what it does is allows you to switch

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.960 
what it does is allows you to switch
between<00:02:53.760> weapons<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:55.200> fast<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.550> use

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
between weapons really fast so I use

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.400 
between weapons really fast so I use
this<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.050> see<00:02:58.140> I've<00:02:58.230> got<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
this as you can see I've got the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.500 
this as you can see I've got the
crossbow<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.920> mum<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.340> border<00:03:00.210> if<00:03:00.420> you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
crossbow on the mum and border if you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.330 
crossbow on the mum and border if you
pick<00:03:00.690> up<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.870> weapon<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.590> switch<00:03:01.860> really

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
pick up a weapon you can switch really

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.770 
pick up a weapon you can switch really
fast<00:03:02.580> between<00:03:02.790> them<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.210> it's<00:03:03.360> much<00:03:03.540> better

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
fast between them and it's much better

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.000 
fast between them and it's much better
if<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.020> want<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.830> little

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
if you want to like go on a little

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.950 
if you want to like go on a little
streak<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.580> pick<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.180> weapons<00:03:06.480> off<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.630> floor

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
streak and pick up weapons off the floor

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.080 
streak and pick up weapons off the floor
and<00:03:07.110> switch<00:03:07.350> about<00:03:07.650> eyes<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.370> think<00:03:08.670> that's<00:03:08.970> one

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and switch about eyes I think that's one

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.280 
and switch about eyes I think that's one
of<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.240> funnest<00:03:09.360> thing<00:03:09.570> about<00:03:09.780> playing<00:03:10.020> game

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
of the funnest thing about playing game

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.470 
of the funnest thing about playing game
playing<00:03:10.980> Call<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.160> Duty<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.090> it's

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
playing Call of Duty is that it's

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.660 
playing Call of Duty is that it's
picking<00:03:12.660> up<00:03:12.810> guns<00:03:13.410> improvising<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.460> think

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
picking up guns improvising and I think

and<00:05:05.300> there<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.290> war<00:05:06.590> 2000<00:05:07.389> wa2000<00:05:08.389> is

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
and there the war 2000 wa2000 is

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.090 
and there the war 2000 wa2000 is
probably<00:05:08.960> one<00:05:09.139> of<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.320> easiest<00:05:09.710> ones<00:05:09.889> to<00:05:09.979> get

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
probably one of the easiest ones to get

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.159 
probably one of the easiest ones to get
headshots<00:05:10.310> with<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:11.419> if<00:05:11.540> you<00:05:11.660> want<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.900> headshot

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
headshots with so if you want a headshot

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.210 
headshots with so if you want a headshot
feeds<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.710> guess

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
feeds I guess

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.850 
feeds I guess
same<00:05:14.030> with<00:05:14.210> stick<00:05:14.660> with<00:05:14.780> this<00:05:14.930> class<00:05:15.229> all<00:05:15.710> this

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
same with stick with this class all this

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.440 
same with stick with this class all this
setup<00:05:16.160> there<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.729> then<00:05:16.820> just<00:05:17.030> switch<00:05:17.300> a

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
setup there and then just switch a

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.150 
setup there and then just switch a
sniper<00:05:17.690> round<00:05:17.990> are<00:05:18.289> probably<00:05:18.560> gonna<00:05:18.830> try<00:05:19.039> and

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
sniper round are probably gonna try and

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.250 
sniper round are probably gonna try and
get<00:05:19.250> one<00:05:19.400> with<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.580> PSG<00:05:20.060> because<00:05:20.300> there's<00:05:21.110> not

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
get one with the PSG because there's not

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.110 
get one with the PSG because there's not
many<00:05:21.350> there<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.979> not<00:05:22.190> many<00:05:22.340> people<00:05:22.430> have<00:05:22.940> done

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
many there and not many people have done

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.080 
many there and not many people have done
that<00:05:23.240> yet<00:05:23.510> sir<00:05:24.130> all<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.250> OU<00:05:25.280> 96<00:05:25.729> obviously

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.760

I've<00:05:26.180> only<00:05:26.330> seen<00:05:26.510> one<00:05:26.539> headshot<00:05:27.410> for<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:27.620> with

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
I've only seen one headshot for you with

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.260 
I've only seen one headshot for you with
that<00:05:27.949> quad<00:05:28.430> herself<00:05:28.789> even<00:05:29.000> though<00:05:29.060> that's

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
that quad herself even though that's

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.629 
that quad herself even though that's
crazy<00:05:29.750> but<00:05:30.380> I<00:05:30.410> guess<00:05:30.740> that's<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.070> I'll<00:05:31.400> go<00:05:31.550> on

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
crazy but I guess that's that I'll go on

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.840 
crazy but I guess that's that I'll go on
through<00:05:31.820> my<00:05:32.030> combat<00:05:32.900> record<00:05:33.139> so<00:05:33.919> as<00:05:34.639> you<00:05:34.760> can

accuracy<00:06:17.450> that's<00:06:18.320> pretty<00:06:18.590> good<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:19.220> see<00:06:19.400> how

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
accuracy that's pretty good to see how

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.010 
accuracy that's pretty good to see how
many<00:06:19.639> kills<00:06:19.910> it<00:06:20.030> is<00:06:20.150> obviously<00:06:20.599> if<00:06:20.780> you<00:06:20.870> get

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
many kills it is obviously if you get

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.520 
many kills it is obviously if you get
more<00:06:21.229> kills<00:06:22.210> it<00:06:23.210> obviously<00:06:23.630> is<00:06:23.990> harder<00:06:24.289> to<00:06:24.410> get

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
more kills it obviously is harder to get

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.960 
more kills it obviously is harder to get
in<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.650> accuracy<00:06:24.830> backup<00:06:25.310> obviously<00:06:25.729> when<00:06:25.849> it

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
in the accuracy backup obviously when it

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.940 
in the accuracy backup obviously when it
first<00:06:26.120> came<00:06:26.389> out<00:06:26.599> Michael<00:06:27.440> must<00:06:27.710> have<00:06:27.830> been

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
first came out Michael must have been

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.320 
first came out Michael must have been
terrible<00:06:28.340> because<00:06:28.520> it<00:06:28.639> was<00:06:28.789> hard<00:06:28.970> to<00:06:29.030> snipe

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
terrible because it was hard to snipe

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.060 
terrible because it was hard to snipe
but<00:06:29.570> yeah<00:06:31.300> accuracy<00:06:32.300> hunts<00:06:32.900> about<00:06:33.169> I<00:06:33.260> mean<00:06:33.530> PSG

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
but yeah accuracy hunts about I mean PSG

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.570 
but yeah accuracy hunts about I mean PSG
is<00:06:34.130> almost<00:06:34.370> at<00:06:34.550> 50%<00:06:34.909> that's<00:06:35.180> quite<00:06:35.450> good

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
is almost at 50% that's quite good

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.369 
is almost at 50% that's quite good
and<00:06:36.699> all<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.360> snipers<00:06:37.539> are<00:06:37.840> arresting<00:06:38.319> the

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:38.379 
and all the snipers are arresting the

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.700 
and all the snipers are arresting the
highest<00:06:38.770> and<00:06:39.069> shotguns

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
highest and shotguns

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.140 
highest and shotguns
yeah<00:06:41.740> what<00:06:42.280> else<00:06:42.460> could<00:06:42.669> I<00:06:42.759> show<00:06:43.030> you<00:06:45.150> most

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
yeah what else could I show you most

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.969 
yeah what else could I show you most
kills<00:06:46.419> hundred<00:06:46.810> fifty-eight<00:06:47.050> that's<00:06:47.770> quite

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
kills hundred fifty-eight that's quite

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:58.640 
kills hundred fifty-eight that's quite
good<00:06:48.009> I<00:06:50.550> guess<00:06:51.550> that's<00:06:52.270> that<00:06:55.409> total<00:06:56.409> -<00:06:56.620> you

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
good I guess that's that total - you

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.159 
good I guess that's that total - you
shot<00:06:59.729> times<00:07:00.729> killed<00:07:01.030> by<00:07:01.210> obviously<00:07:01.719> it's<00:07:02.139> the

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
shot times killed by obviously it's the
