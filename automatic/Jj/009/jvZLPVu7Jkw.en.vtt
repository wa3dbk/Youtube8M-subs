00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.119 
classrooms around the country and still
interact<00:05:07.599> with<00:05:07.689> the<00:05:07.870> teacher<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.710> interact

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
interact with the teacher and interact

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.409 
interact with the teacher and interact
with<00:05:09.219> each<00:05:09.340> other<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:09.879> so<00:05:10.060> on

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
with each other and so on

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.980 
with each other and so on
so<00:05:10.930> there<00:05:11.889> are<00:05:11.919> those<00:05:12.099> kinds<00:05:12.639> of<00:05:12.729> apps<00:05:12.990> that

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
so there are those kinds of apps that

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.390 
so there are those kinds of apps that
that<00:05:14.409> are<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.830> version<00:05:15.009> of<00:05:15.310> the

that are in the version of the
government<00:05:15.729> post<00:05:15.909> I'll<00:05:16.060> do<00:05:16.419> those<00:05:16.599> news<00:05:16.870> today

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
government post I'll do those news today

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.779 
government post I'll do those news today
where<00:05:17.560> they<00:05:17.770> already<00:05:17.919> have<00:05:18.219> computing

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
where they already have computing

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.050 
where they already have computing
devices<00:05:19.289> you<00:05:20.289> see<00:05:20.319> engineering<00:05:21.250> students<00:05:21.939> in

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
devices you see engineering students in

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.529 
devices you see engineering students in
India<00:05:22.500> at<00:05:23.500> this<00:05:23.740> stage<00:05:24.039> if<00:05:24.219> you<00:05:24.759> are<00:05:24.969> in<00:05:25.360> a

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
India at this stage if you are in a

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.839 
India at this stage if you are in a
college<00:05:25.990> or<00:05:26.229> university<00:05:26.379> and<00:05:27.310> you're<00:05:27.550> taking

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
college or university and you're taking

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.200 
college or university and you're taking
it<00:05:27.879> most<00:05:28.750> likely<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:29.199> do<00:05:29.379> yeah<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:30.250> this<00:05:30.939> may

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
it most likely you do yeah so this may

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.749 
it most likely you do yeah so this may
not<00:05:31.389> necessarily<00:05:31.689> be<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:33.610> know<00:05:33.639> perfect

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
not necessarily be the you know perfect

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.999 
not necessarily be the you know perfect
initial<00:05:36.759> deployment<00:05:37.110> but<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.229> vision<00:05:38.589> isn't

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
initial deployment but the vision isn't

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.700 
initial deployment but the vision isn't
for<00:05:39.610> just<00:05:39.849> engineering<00:05:40.210> students<00:05:40.659> the<00:05:41.409> vision

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
for just engineering students the vision

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.610 
for just engineering students the vision
is<00:05:41.889> all<00:05:42.639> the<00:05:42.909> way<00:05:42.999> down<00:05:43.210> all<00:05:43.509> 220<00:05:44.469> million

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
is all the way down all 220 million

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.550 
is all the way down all 220 million
students<00:05:45.069> or<00:05:45.669> potentially<00:05:46.270> 360<00:05:46.870> million<00:05:47.050> kids

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
students or potentially 360 million kids

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.749 
students or potentially 360 million kids
across<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.979> country<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.370> should<00:05:48.580> be<00:05:48.699> in

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
across the country that should be in

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.640 
across the country that should be in
school

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
school

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.619 
school
so<00:05:50.650> this<00:05:50.800> is<00:05:50.949> it's<00:05:51.310> that<00:05:51.490> it's<00:05:52.240> that<00:05:52.330> whole

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
so this is it's that it's that whole

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.350 
so this is it's that it's that whole
range<00:05:52.870> of<00:05:54.479> kids<00:05:55.479> and<00:05:56.409> even<00:05:57.189> when<00:05:58.000> engineering

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
range of kids and even when engineering

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.369 
range of kids and even when engineering
students<00:05:58.659> do<00:05:59.080> have<00:05:59.349> you<00:06:00.159> know<00:06:00.279> 60<00:06:00.789> or<00:06:00.909> 65%<00:06:01.379> may

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379 
students do have you know 60 or 65% may

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.920 
students do have you know 60 or 65% may
have<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:03.310> know<00:06:03.430> but<00:06:03.759> when<00:06:04.149> you<00:06:04.240> have<00:06:04.360> 30<00:06:04.509> or<00:06:04.719> 40

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
have you know but when you have 30 or 40

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.139 
have you know but when you have 30 or 40
percent<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:05.409> don't<00:06:05.699> that's<00:06:06.699> a<00:06:06.819> big<00:06:07.000> deal

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:07.149 
percent that don't that's a big deal

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:10.170 
percent that don't that's a big deal
yeah<00:06:07.750> so<00:06:08.740> I<00:06:09.129> mean<00:06:09.580> is<00:06:09.639> there<00:06:09.759> anything<00:06:09.909> else

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
yeah so I mean is there anything else

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.540 
yeah so I mean is there anything else
that<00:06:10.360> special<00:06:11.169> about<00:06:11.469> this<00:06:11.889> deployment<00:06:12.279> or

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
that special about this deployment or

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.930 
that special about this deployment or
this

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
this

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.700 
this
you<00:06:13.270> want<00:06:13.450> to<00:06:13.510> show<00:06:13.660> us<00:06:13.870> there's<00:06:14.110> pretty<00:06:14.410> stock

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
you want to show us there's pretty stock

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.440 
you want to show us there's pretty stock
and<00:06:15.070> rice<00:06:15.370> it's<00:06:15.760> pretty<00:06:16.150> start

which we have 18 US patents and that is

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.610 
which we have 18 US patents and that is
what<00:06:33.700> makes<00:06:33.940> it<00:06:34.060> powerful<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:34.780> useful<00:06:35.170> engine

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
what makes it powerful the useful engine

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.460 
what makes it powerful the useful engine
in<00:06:35.950> the<00:06:36.100> environment<00:06:36.720> but<00:06:37.720> as<00:06:38.080> far<00:06:38.320> as<00:06:38.350> the

in the environment but as far as the
hardware<00:06:38.710> goes<00:06:39.840> you<00:06:40.840> know<00:06:40.960> it's<00:06:41.520> nothing<00:06:42.520> too

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
hardware goes you know it's nothing too

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.060 
hardware goes you know it's nothing too
extraordinary<00:06:43.570> and<00:06:44.050> it's<00:06:44.440> not<00:06:44.620> intended<00:06:44.890> to

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
be you know the key focus is breaking

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.950
