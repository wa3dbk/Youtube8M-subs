00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it's so it's bad it's bad I probably

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.010 
it's so it's bad it's bad I probably
should<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:20.550> get<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.880> new<00:02:21.060> rad<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.750> but

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
should just get a new rad for it but

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020 
should just get a new rad for it but
yeah<00:02:22.770> we'll<00:02:23.160> wait<00:02:23.310> till<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:23.760> blows<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
yeah we'll wait till this one blows a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.610 
yeah we'll wait till this one blows a
big<00:02:24.300> hole<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.930> need<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.200> flush<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
big hole in it but I need to flush it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.250 
big hole in it but I need to flush it
and<00:02:26.150> top<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.330> up<00:02:27.420> with<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.810> proper<00:02:30.260> green

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and top it up with the proper green

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.590 
and top it up with the proper green
stuff<00:02:31.590> there<00:02:31.860> what's<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.190> called<00:02:32.600> Prestone

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
stuff there what's it called Prestone

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.420 
stuff there what's it called Prestone
that's<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.990> stuff<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.530> need<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.190> put<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that's the stuff I need to put the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.400 
that's the stuff I need to put the
proper<00:02:35.760> ratio<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.360> Prestone<00:02:36.810> into<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.200> cuz<00:02:37.350> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
proper ratio of Prestone into it cuz I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.630 
proper ratio of Prestone into it cuz I
don't<00:02:37.590> want<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.770> freeze<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.220> crack<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.520> block

that way yeah yeah video proof maybe

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.910 
that way yeah yeah video proof maybe
next<00:02:51.090> year<00:02:51.390> when<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.780> weather's<00:02:52.080> nicer<00:02:52.470> and

next year when the weather's nicer and
you<00:02:53.459> know<00:02:53.580> cuz<00:02:53.760> mutton<00:02:54.060> pretty<00:02:54.540> much<00:02:54.690> done<00:02:54.959> now

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
you know cuz mutton pretty much done now

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.580 
you know cuz mutton pretty much done now
it's<00:02:55.320> frozen<00:02:56.270> starting<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.330> freeze<00:02:57.590> it's

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
it's frozen starting to freeze it's

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.050 
it's frozen starting to freeze it's
really<00:02:58.800> hard<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.190> equipment<00:02:59.400> too<00:02:59.790> when

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
really hard on the equipment too when

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.510 
really hard on the equipment too when
you<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:00.330> in<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.510> mud<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.340> probably<00:03:02.340> won't<00:03:02.459> be

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
you go in the mud so probably won't be

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.310 
you go in the mud so probably won't be
doing<00:03:02.640> no<00:03:02.820> more<00:03:02.970> modern<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.360> year<00:03:03.660> unless<00:03:03.870> so

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
doing no more modern this year unless so

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.900 
doing no more modern this year unless so
you<00:03:04.530> know<00:03:04.620> we<00:03:04.800> got<00:03:04.920> 30<00:03:05.130> degree<00:03:05.459> weather<00:03:05.489> out

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
you know we got 30 degree weather out

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.509 
you know we got 30 degree weather out
and<00:03:06.060> stuff<00:03:06.269> like<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:07.340> probably<00:03:08.340> doing

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
and stuff like that but probably doing

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.620 
and stuff like that but probably doing
more<00:03:08.700> mud<00:03:08.880> next<00:03:09.239> year<00:03:11.120> but<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.209> works<00:03:12.360> good<00:03:12.570> for

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
more mud next year but it works good for

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.600 
more mud next year but it works good for
a<00:03:12.840> four-cylinder<00:03:13.440> man<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.769> go<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.100> went<00:03:14.400> through

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
a four-cylinder man I go I went through

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.699 
a four-cylinder man I go I went through
some<00:03:14.790> some<00:03:15.180> heavy<00:03:15.390> shit<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:16.170> really
