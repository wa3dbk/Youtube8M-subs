okay<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> eclipse

okay you know that we have the eclipse

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.130 
okay you know that we have the eclipse
here<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.070> five<00:02:05.310> days<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.689> quake<00:02:06.930> watch

end of this video to show you something
that<00:02:12.209> might<00:02:12.420> make<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.660> think<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:13.140> little

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that might make you think a little

that might make you think a little

planetary lineup that day if anything

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
galaxy kind of can join but watch what I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.570 
galaxy kind of can join but watch what I
do<00:02:28.380> with<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.710> dates<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> rest

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
do with the dates here and the rest

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.100 
do with the dates here and the rest
should<00:02:29.670> become<00:02:30.180> clear<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.810> something<00:02:31.020> to

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
should become clear just something to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.230 
should become clear just something to
think<00:02:31.140> about<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.220> news<00:02:32.400> folks<00:02:32.640> be

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
think about that's the news folks be

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:57.450 
think about that's the news folks be
safe
