so we've created what is called a

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.770 
so we've created what is called a
virtual<00:03:59.460> cursor<00:03:59.700> so<00:04:00.360> I'm<00:04:00.420> going<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.600> go<00:04:00.690> ahead

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
virtual cursor so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.900 
virtual cursor so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:00.990> activate<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:02.100> cursor<00:04:02.430> again<00:04:02.520> so<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:02.790> you
