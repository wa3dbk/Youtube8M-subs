to<00:02:15.049> need<00:02:15.170> about<00:02:15.620> one<00:02:16.579> to<00:02:17.239> two<00:02:17.690> feet<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:17.989> twine<00:02:18.380> I

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
to need about one to two feet of twine I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
to need about one to two feet of twine I
would<00:02:19.100> just<00:02:19.280> custom<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.120> basically<00:02:20.299> how

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
would just custom it to basically how

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.240 
would just custom it to basically how
long<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.140> need<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.530> stretch<00:02:21.829> from<00:02:22.010> your

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
long you need it to stretch from your

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.490 
long you need it to stretch from your
container<00:02:22.640> however<00:02:23.180> big<00:02:23.329> or<00:02:23.420> small<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:23.930> to

container however big or small it is to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400 
container however big or small it is to
the<00:02:24.620> actual<00:02:24.769> plant<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.239> we'll<00:02:26.359> go<00:02:26.510> ahead

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
the actual plant so we'll go ahead

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.790 
the actual plant so we'll go ahead
measure<00:02:27.710> that<00:02:27.950> out<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.670> cut<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.800> then

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
measure that out and cut it and then

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.110 
measure that out and cut it and then
once<00:02:31.010> we<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.370> hole<00:02:31.760> through<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.060> top

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
once we have that hole through the top

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.150 
once we have that hole through the top
of<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.450> container<00:02:32.840> here<00:02:33.260> we're<00:02:33.920> going<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.100> go

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
of the container here we're going to go

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.400 
of the container here we're going to go
ahead<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.460> string<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.630> through<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.170> top

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
ahead and string it on through the top

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.320 
ahead and string it on through the top
here<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.670> we're<00:02:37.790> going<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.940> link<00:02:38.180> it

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
here and then we're going to link it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.120 
here and then we're going to link it
from<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.660> bottom<00:02:39.200> pushing<00:02:39.680> all<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> way<00:02:40.010> to

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
from the bottom pushing all the way to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.520 
from the bottom pushing all the way to
the<00:02:40.370> bottom<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.910> container<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:41.630> then

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the bottom of the container and then

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.750 
the bottom of the container and then
we're<00:02:42.620> going<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.770> connect<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.430> plant

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
we're going to connect it to the plant

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.640 
we're going to connect it to the plant
when<00:02:44.360> we<00:02:44.450> get<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> plant<00:02:45.110> we<00:02:45.410> go<00:02:45.530> ahead

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
when we get it to the plant we go ahead

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.010 
when we get it to the plant we go ahead
and<00:02:45.920> push<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.460> into<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.850> soil<00:02:47.150> we<00:02:47.720> want<00:02:47.900> to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
and push it into that soil we want to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.660 
and push it into that soil we want to
reach<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.380> down<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.920> roots<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> plant

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
reach it down to the roots of the plant

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.090 
reach it down to the roots of the plant
that<00:02:49.940> way<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.810> roots<00:02:51.200> were<00:02:51.530> actually<00:02:51.920> where

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
that way the roots were actually where

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.070 
that way the roots were actually where
the<00:02:52.220> plant<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.610> feeding<00:02:53.120> will<00:02:53.660> actually<00:02:53.990> be

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
the plant is feeding will actually be

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.170 
the plant is feeding will actually be
able<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.290> drink<00:02:54.860> from<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.520> twine<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.000> was

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
able to drink from the twine this was

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.020 
able to drink from the twine this was
basically<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.660> straw<00:02:57.050> from<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.040> twine<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.910> the

basically a straw from the twine to the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.510 
basically a straw from the twine to the
actual<00:02:59.630> container<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.320> water<00:03:00.350> itself<00:03:01.250> it's

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
actual container of water itself it's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.000

just making sure that it actually does
work<00:03:13.820> one<00:03:14.720> suggestion<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.470> would<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:15.830> is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
work one suggestion I would have is

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.100 
work one suggestion I would have is
before<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.670> go<00:03:16.850> ahead<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.360> push<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.780> into<00:03:17.930> the

before you go ahead and push it into the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.950 
before you go ahead and push it into the
plants<00:03:18.620> soil<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.790> would<00:03:20.330> go<00:03:20.510> ahead<00:03:20.810> and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
plants soil I would go ahead and

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.640 
plants soil I would go ahead and
actually<00:03:21.200> wet<00:03:21.770> down<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.970> wick<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> twine

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.090 
one into the other I kind of feel like
it's<00:03:32.480> not<00:03:32.690> really<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.050> creased<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.980> way

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
it's not really all creased all the way

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.190 
it's not really all creased all the way
through<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.460> watering<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.360> wick<00:03:35.780> before

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
through the watering of this wick before

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.260 
through the watering of this wick before
this<00:03:36.410> twine<00:03:36.680> before<00:03:37.040> will<00:03:37.190> kind<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.460> help<00:03:37.610> make

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
this twine before will kind of help make

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.660 
this twine before will kind of help make
the<00:03:38.420> process<00:03:38.570> already<00:03:39.260> started<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.400> plant

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
the process already started the plant

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.610 
the process already started the plant
will<00:03:40.820> continue<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.660> drink<00:03:41.960> from<00:03:42.110> this<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.560> I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
will continue to drink from this and I

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.130 
will continue to drink from this and I
would<00:03:42.830> suggest<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.940> have<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.840> water

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
would suggest that you have the water

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.560 
would suggest that you have the water
source<00:03:45.560> just<00:03:45.950> be<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.130> little<00:03:46.520> bit<00:03:46.880> higher<00:03:47.150> not<00:03:47.540> a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
source just be a little bit higher not a

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.390 
source just be a little bit higher not a
lot<00:03:47.870> higher<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.140> would<00:03:48.500> say<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.890> half

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
lot higher I would say this a half

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.100 
lot higher I would say this a half
gallon<00:03:49.820> container<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.600> as<00:03:50.750> much<00:03:50.930> as

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
gallon container really is as much as

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.960 
gallon container really is as much as
you<00:03:51.200> want<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.470> go<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:52.460> a<00:03:52.550> little<00:03:52.730> bit

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
you want to go but just a little bit

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.420 
you want to go but just a little bit
higher<00:03:53.210> than<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:53.930> actual<00:03:54.620> source<00:03:54.920> itself

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
higher than the actual source itself

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.030 
higher than the actual source itself
that<00:03:55.700> way<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.270> water<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.660> coming<00:03:56.900> up<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.680> down

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
that way the water is coming up and down

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.699 
that way the water is coming up and down
as<00:03:58.490> opposed<00:03:59.270> to<00:03:59.480> trying<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.900> reach<00:04:00.170> its<00:04:00.380> way<00:04:00.560> up

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
as opposed to trying to reach its way up

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.290 
as opposed to trying to reach its way up
it<00:04:00.890> might<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.220> be<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.430> bit<00:04:01.670> harder<00:04:02.000> but<00:04:02.180> I've

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
it might just be a bit harder but I've

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.730 
it might just be a bit harder but I've
never<00:04:02.510> given<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:02.990> try<00:04:03.260> so<00:04:03.440> I'm<00:04:03.530> not<00:04:03.709> a

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
never given that a try so I'm not a

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.520 
never given that a try so I'm not a
complete<00:04:04.070> expert<00:04:04.700> at<00:04:04.820> this<00:04:05.000> all<00:04:05.180> but<00:04:05.990> it's

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
complete expert at this all but it's

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.040 
complete expert at this all but it's
certainly<00:04:06.980> done<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.610> pretty<00:04:08.090> good<00:04:08.360> job<00:04:08.600> itself

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
certainly done a pretty good job itself

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.350 
certainly done a pretty good job itself
I'm<00:04:09.380> just<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:09.830> excited<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.520> have<00:04:10.700> something<00:04:11.270> to

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the system in itself turned out to be a

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
hold the water in but it turned out to

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.190 
hold the water in but it turned out to
be<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.280> nice<00:04:34.640> alternative<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.690> some<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.140> those

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200

be a nice alternative to some of those
expensive<00:04:37.070> systems<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.700> you<00:04:37.790> find<00:04:38.030> at<00:04:38.150> the

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
expensive systems that you find at the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.330 
expensive systems that you find at the
store<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.540> find<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.380> lot<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.860> products<00:04:40.250> out

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
store I find that a lot of products out

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.520 
store I find that a lot of products out
there<00:04:40.460> cost<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.840> know<00:04:41.960> they<00:04:42.080> look<00:04:42.290> nice

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
there cost you you know they look nice

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.340 
there cost you you know they look nice
but<00:04:43.280> they<00:04:43.430> cost<00:04:43.640> upwards<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.210> at<00:04:44.330> least<00:04:44.450> $20

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
but they cost upwards of at least $20

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.010 
but they cost upwards of at least $20
just<00:04:45.590> for<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.860> few<00:04:46.100> plant<00:04:46.460> feeders<00:04:46.910> for<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.510> I

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
just for a few plant feeders for this I

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.920 
just for a few plant feeders for this I
can<00:04:48.380> have<00:04:48.560> several<00:04:48.979> feeders<00:04:49.520> for<00:04:49.940> far<00:04:50.630> less<00:04:50.900> of

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
can have several feeders for far less of

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.080 
can have several feeders for far less of
a<00:04:51.140> cost<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.710> certainly<00:04:52.100> hope<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.640> becomes

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
a cost so I certainly hope it becomes

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.670 
a cost so I certainly hope it becomes
effused<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:53.810> guys<00:04:54.020> who<00:04:54.260> happen<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.560> be
