00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hello, friends

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.949
 rdx racing suit 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.939
 England produced these costumes in two 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 colors one you can see us no 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.510
 gray with black yellow accents also 2 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.440
 you can see now on screen 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 they are produced in sizes sml xl 2xl 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.050
 I'm currently wearing xl size 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 here they are a lot on me well in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.570
 In principle, it is quite tolerable 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.750
 engage are created the bottom is very dense 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.140
 nylon fabric which practically no 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 air permeate this 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.690
 Do + elastic wrists added yet 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.170
 Velcro with which you can 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.660
 well 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.870
 then be it but also here with us 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.560
 there are strings that tighten 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.040
 throat and very deep deep 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.460
 the hood is this than it will not fly 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.650
 even with the most intense workouts 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.259
 This costume is made with sturdy fabric. 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.900
 as I said in it is possible not only 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.270
 you can run a sparring session you 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.580
 can conduct a full sparring 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.299
 fix wear gloves work on 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.920
 shells on the bags to work feet 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.220
 We do not give full blows 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.130
 the fact that the costume can be torn as is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.290
 similar but cheap for 100 hryvnia 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.610
 just made is sincere about 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.770
 I would like to talk in size 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.770
 more detail 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.490
 you have 77 without 75 kilograms here is my size 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.729
 it's rather 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.229
 and at the moment I like I said 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.600
 I'm trying on now 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.390
 x el que here excel to us i'm a little 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.789
 too big for a belt and a bit 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.000
 long pants but basically this 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.069
 tolerant pants by the way long credit 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.049
 still pretty wide pants we fit 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.860
 a little later when and under better seen 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:19.019
 let's take a closer look at the jacket here 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.420
 what can we say now 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.290
 see this here velcro on the sleeves well 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.239
 naturally 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.980
 gum also 2 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:39.510
 and of course elastic on the belt plus 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.840
 in addition a flypaper for the best 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:51.950
 fixing the less will come 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.950
 this air is actually better than gum 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.800
 time is not rezik beach lacing on 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.800
 throat 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.220
 go outside to show 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.040
 can see here very cool 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.970
 quality stitching and the actual costume in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.940
 two materials 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.950
 here is this material inside it is very 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:34.160
 dense and the air is absolutely not allowed 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:37.670
 and also wanted to say 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.170
 show pockets in more detail here they are 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.000
 are in front 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:56.830
 shallow on the size of the palm just on 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.830
 pass the length of the palm pass on the pants 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.090
 pants a little wide enough 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.400
 reminds bloomers here but it is a principle 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.670
 for an assembly suit is normal because 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.750
 what people who are involved 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.310
 martial arts will strike 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.910
 feet well it should not be torn 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.130
 actually therefore vodka costume 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.830
 should not generally sit tight 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.330
 must be pretty free from 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:30.560
 Therefore, the hands of what you would need you even 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.080
 measure the thickness of the trouser leg 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.450
 it turns out thirty seven and a half 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.460
 centimeters that's pretty wide by the way 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.980
 about 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.070
 inscriptions inscriptions on my 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.040
 look made excellent by the way supplier 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.710
 declares that this costume can be washed in 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.080
 washing machine but i wouldn't you 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.120
 advised though you can 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.660
 try it once 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.270
 can do one control wash 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.950
 here and see what happens 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.000
 one thing will surely endure 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.860
 I honestly have not tried but 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.950
 to a large extent to erase 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.200
 racing suit cars i just don't even 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.570
 I see the point here is such a material which 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.410
 not just absorbs so under 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.360
 you can just turn it out 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.060
 you can even throw buckets there 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.980
 pour some powder 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.240
 time to wash 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:33.200
 and then just dip a couple of times in the water 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.970
 without powder and everything does not seem to be 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.450
 this will be enough without racing 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.450
 suit 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.500
 also on our belt here 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:51.269
 there are laces there is country 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:54.149
 gum wednesday is very similar 

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:58.109
 tracksuit but so pretty with 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:59.759
 wide leg here that's discomfort though 

00:05:58.109 --> 00:06:06.479
 it absolutely does not bring any 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:08.609
 to my contrary it is even very comfortable there 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:14.309
 was the company maximus since all successful 

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:17.119
 workouts bye here to be honest 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:17.119
 already sweated
