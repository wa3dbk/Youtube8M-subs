but on my hand cuff earrings and this is

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.220 
but on my hand cuff earrings and this is
what<00:05:30.190> they<00:05:30.220> look<00:05:30.490> like<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.990> can<00:05:32.140> either

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
what they look like and you can either

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.740 
what they look like and you can either
leave<00:05:32.620> them<00:05:32.860> dangling<00:05:33.430> or<00:05:33.700> you<00:05:34.210> can<00:05:34.360> have<00:05:34.540> them

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
leave them dangling or you can have them

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.870 
leave them dangling or you can have them
hook<00:05:34.900> around<00:05:35.080> on<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.620> back<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.310> I<00:05:36.520> think<00:05:36.550> that

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
hook around on the back and I think that

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.280 
hook around on the back and I think that
hooking<00:05:37.240> them<00:05:37.360> around<00:05:37.540> in<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.780> back<00:05:37.960> makes

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
hooking them around in the back makes

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.140 
hooking them around in the back makes
them<00:05:38.470> look<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.650> lot<00:05:38.770> cooler<00:05:39.010> so<00:05:39.760> I<00:05:39.790> want<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.060> go

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
them look a lot cooler so I want to go

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.360 
them look a lot cooler so I want to go
ahead<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.510> do<00:05:40.630> that<00:05:40.660> my<00:05:41.500> earrings<00:05:41.710> are<00:05:41.950> on<00:05:42.100> as
