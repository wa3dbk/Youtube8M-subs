00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
in the tomato sauce and this is pretty

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
in the tomato sauce and this is pretty
much<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.140> we're<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> make<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> sauce

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
much how we're going to make the sauce

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.560 
much how we're going to make the sauce
from<00:01:20.430> scratch<00:01:23.030> followed<00:01:24.030> by<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> tomato

from scratch followed by the tomato
paste<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.439> does<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> gives<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
paste now what this does is it gives the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.700 
paste now what this does is it gives the
sauce<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.540> body<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.140> makes

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
sauce a little bit more body and makes

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.359

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just a balance of the taste and tweak it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.570 
just a balance of the taste and tweak it
a<00:01:38.369> little<00:01:38.400> bit

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
a little bit

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.710 
a little bit
season<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.480> was<00:01:41.660> solved<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:43.510> my<00:01:44.510> all-time

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
season it was solved and my all-time

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.380 
season it was solved and my all-time
favorite<00:01:45.590> spice<00:01:45.860> ground<00:01:46.340> black<00:01:46.550> pepper<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
favorite spice ground black pepper and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.090 
favorite spice ground black pepper and
of<00:01:47.510> course<00:01:47.750> I'm<00:01:48.020> going<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.320> use<00:01:48.440> quite<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.830> bit

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
of course I'm going to use quite a bit

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.960 
of course I'm going to use quite a bit
of<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:51.010> now<00:01:52.010> what<00:01:52.190> we're<00:01:52.310> going<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.580> do<00:01:52.760> is

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
of this now what we're going to do is

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.790 
of this now what we're going to do is
give<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.360> stir<00:01:53.540> until<00:01:54.080> everything<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
give this a stir until everything is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.550 
give this a stir until everything is
well<00:01:55.130> combined<00:01:55.990> now<00:01:56.990> you're<00:01:57.170> probably<00:01:57.380> saying

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
well combined now you're probably saying

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.350 
well combined now you're probably saying
to<00:01:57.860> yourself<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.400> really<00:01:59.120> different

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
to yourself this is really different

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.540 
to yourself this is really different
from<00:01:59.720> any<00:01:59.960> other<00:02:00.170> spaghetti<00:02:00.680> sauce<00:02:00.950> I've<00:02:01.220> had

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
from any other spaghetti sauce I've had

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.450 
from any other spaghetti sauce I've had
but<00:02:02.060> believe<00:02:02.390> me<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.780> outcome<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.500> absolutely

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
but believe me the outcome is absolutely

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.880 
but believe me the outcome is absolutely
wonderful<00:02:07.840> next<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.020> be<00:02:09.140> really<00:02:09.680> different

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
wonderful next to be really different

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.250 
wonderful next to be really different
I'm<00:02:10.280> going<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.790> add<00:02:11.060> in<00:02:11.270> some<00:02:11.300> beef<00:02:11.630> stock<00:02:11.930> and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
I'm going to add in some beef stock and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.780 
I'm going to add in some beef stock and
if<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.770> don't<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.040> beat<00:02:13.220> stock<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.700> can

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
if you don't have beat stock you can

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.830 
if you don't have beat stock you can
just<00:02:14.000> use<00:02:14.120> water<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.940> I'm<00:02:17.150> going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.600> reduce

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
just use water then I'm going to reduce
