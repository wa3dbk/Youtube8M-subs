people<00:00:43.460> pay<00:00:43.760> attention<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.270> this<00:00:44.360> form<00:00:44.690> factor

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
people pay attention to this form factor

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.590 
people pay attention to this form factor
so<00:00:45.880> after<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:47.000> Dell<00:00:47.210> Streak

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
so after the Dell Streak

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.330 
so after the Dell Streak
it<00:00:47.750> was<00:00:47.930> Samsung<00:00:48.410> that<00:00:48.530> really<00:00:48.890> created<00:00:49.190> this

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
it was Samsung that really created this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.180 
it was Samsung that really created this
market<00:00:49.760> space<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.270> in<00:00:51.199> saying<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:51.859> large

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
market space and in saying that a large

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.799 
market space and in saying that a large
part<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.489> their<00:00:52.609> future<00:00:52.789> potential<00:00:53.300> market

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
part of their future potential market

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.360 
part of their future potential market
depends<00:00:54.230> on<00:00:54.289> what<00:00:54.440> happens<00:00:54.590> in<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.949> next<00:00:55.190> six

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
depends on what happens in the next six

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.299 
depends on what happens in the next six
months<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:56.140> say<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.320> because<00:00:57.530> Apple<00:00:57.949> seems<00:00:58.160> to

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
months I say this because Apple seems to

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.529 
months I say this because Apple seems to
be<00:00:58.399> putting<00:00:58.609> quite<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:58.969> lot<00:00:59.149> of<00:00:59.180> thought<00:00:59.480> into

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
be putting quite a lot of thought into

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.950 
be putting quite a lot of thought into
their<00:00:59.989> 5.5<00:01:00.739> inch<00:01:01.010> iPhone<00:01:01.250> 6<00:01:01.940> according<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.870> all

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
their 5.5 inch iPhone 6 according to all

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.439 
their 5.5 inch iPhone 6 according to all
sources<00:01:03.260> anyway<00:01:03.710> sources<00:01:04.640> also<00:01:04.879> say<00:01:05.059> that

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
sources anyway sources also say that

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.270 
sources anyway sources also say that
it's<00:01:05.540> going<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.810> have<00:01:05.930> an<00:01:06.020> Apple<00:01:06.380> a8<00:01:06.560> chip<00:01:06.830> and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
it's going to have an Apple a8 chip and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.120 
it's going to have an Apple a8 chip and
NFC<00:01:08.150> finally<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.350> makes<00:01:09.590> things<00:01:09.860> pretty

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
NFC finally so this makes things pretty

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.190 
NFC finally so this makes things pretty
interesting<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.300> phone<00:01:11.540> tablet<00:01:11.960> playing

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
interesting and the phone tablet playing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.170 
interesting and the phone tablet playing
ground<00:01:12.500> maybe<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.980> bit<00:01:13.220> less<00:01:13.430> one<00:01:13.640> side<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:14.030> this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
ground maybe a bit less one side at this

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.440 
ground maybe a bit less one side at this
time<00:01:14.450> round<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:16.100> moving<00:01:16.460> back<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.730> Samsung<00:01:17.270> I

was<00:01:17.720> actually<00:01:17.900> starting<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.380> get<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.590> little

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
was actually starting to get a little

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.499 
was actually starting to get a little
bit<00:01:18.950> bored<00:01:19.220> with<00:01:19.310> their<00:01:19.520> devices<00:01:20.060> but<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
bit bored with their devices but the

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.819 
bit bored with their devices but the
knight<00:01:20.689> for<00:01:20.930> this<00:01:21.140> time<00:01:21.350> round<00:01:21.590> actually

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
knight for this time round actually

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.170 
knight for this time round actually
surprised<00:01:22.369> me<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.579> little<00:01:22.790> bit

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
surprised me a little bit

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.330 
surprised me a little bit
it<00:01:23.720> seems<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.170> Samsung<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:24.740> fully<00:01:24.979> put<00:01:25.159> their

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
it seems that Samsung is fully put their

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.649 
it seems that Samsung is fully put their
weight<00:01:25.490> behind<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.939> note<00:01:26.119> series<00:01:26.329> for<00:01:26.600> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
weight behind the note series for the

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.660 
weight behind the note series for the
first<00:01:26.869> time<00:01:27.200> as<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.829> mentioned<00:01:28.189> earlier<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
first time as I mentioned earlier the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.670 
first time as I mentioned earlier the
note<00:01:28.880> series<00:01:29.090> was<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:29.659> an<00:01:29.750> experiment<00:01:30.110> but

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
note series was just an experiment but

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.219 
note series was just an experiment but
now<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.159> seems<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.790> have<00:01:31.880> fully<00:01:32.090> matured<00:01:32.450> the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
now it seems to have fully matured the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.020 
now it seems to have fully matured the
main<00:01:33.439> thing<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:33.829> Samsung<00:01:34.280> did<00:01:34.490> was<00:01:34.759> listen

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
main thing that Samsung did was listen

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.330 
main thing that Samsung did was listen
to<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.329> feedback<00:01:35.570> from<00:01:35.960> their<00:01:36.170> customers

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
to the feedback from their customers

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.850 
to the feedback from their customers
what<00:01:37.340> do<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.460> mean<00:01:37.670> by<00:01:37.729> this<00:01:38.049> well<00:01:39.049> firstly

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
what do I mean by this well firstly

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.639 
what do I mean by this well firstly
let's<00:01:40.310> take<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> look<00:01:40.700> at<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.850> design<00:01:41.290> at<00:01:42.290> first

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
let's take a look at the design at first

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.109 
let's take a look at the design at first
glance<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.159> may<00:01:43.369> think<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.640> this<00:01:43.850> pretty

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
glance you may think that this pretty

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.639 
glance you may think that this pretty
much<00:01:44.299> looks<00:01:44.540> like<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.689> knight<00:01:44.960> 3<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.439> I<00:01:45.590> don't

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
much looks like the knight 3 and I don't

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.950 
much looks like the knight 3 and I don't
blame<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.130> for<00:01:46.250> but<00:01:47.149> upon<00:01:47.420> closer<00:01:47.689> inspection

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
blame you for but upon closer inspection

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.230 
blame you for but upon closer inspection
you<00:01:48.619> can<00:01:48.829> actually<00:01:49.189> see<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.549> differences<00:01:50.060> and

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
you can actually see the differences and

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.910 
moving on a few of you may be wondering
what<00:05:07.480> my<00:05:07.600> thoughts<00:05:07.870> are<00:05:08.080> on<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.500> Note<00:05:08.680> edge

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
what my thoughts are on the Note edge

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.250 
what my thoughts are on the Note edge
and<00:05:09.190> for<00:05:09.670> me<00:05:09.730> personally<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.210> think<00:05:10.960> it's<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.140> bit

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
and for me personally I think it's a bit

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.690 
and for me personally I think it's a bit
of<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.410> quirky<00:05:11.710> device<00:05:12.010> and<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.340> pricing

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
of a quirky device and the pricing

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.700 
of a quirky device and the pricing
strategy<00:05:12.910> is<00:05:13.210> incorrect<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.990> be<00:05:14.170> priced<00:05:14.410> above

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
strategy is incorrect to be priced above

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.790 
strategy is incorrect to be priced above
the<00:05:14.890> note<00:05:15.040> 4<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.630> people<00:05:16.630> who<00:05:17.200> use<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.590> phone

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
the note 4 and people who use the phone

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800 
the note 4 and people who use the phone
with<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.400> dexterous<00:05:18.910> hand<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.300> covers<00:05:19.630> up<00:05:19.780> the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
with a dexterous hand that covers up the

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.750 
with a dexterous hand that covers up the
curved<00:05:20.650> edge<00:05:20.920> will<00:05:21.160> be<00:05:21.190> finding<00:05:21.640> it<00:05:21.700> very

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
curved edge will be finding it very

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.150 
curved edge will be finding it very
difficult<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.510> actually<00:05:22.690> use<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.410> device<00:05:23.680> at

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
difficult to actually use the device at

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.660 
difficult to actually use the device at
all

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
all

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.180 
all
so<00:05:25.480> in<00:05:25.600> conclusion<00:05:25.750> Samsung<00:05:26.620> has<00:05:26.800> put<00:05:27.040> their

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
so in conclusion Samsung has put their

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.680 
so in conclusion Samsung has put their
best<00:05:27.340> foot<00:05:27.580> forward<00:05:27.910> because<00:05:28.360> they<00:05:28.480> know<00:05:28.660> that

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
best foot forward because they know that

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.690 
best foot forward because they know that
Apple<00:05:29.020> is<00:05:29.290> hot<00:05:29.470> in<00:05:29.590> their<00:05:29.710> heels<00:05:29.950> and<00:05:30.190> this
