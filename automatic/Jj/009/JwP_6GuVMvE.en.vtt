right so I'm a big story guy if they

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
right so I'm a big story guy if they
released<00:01:12.119> DLC<00:01:12.689> campaign<00:01:13.409> expansion<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> if

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
released DLC campaign expansion and if

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
released DLC campaign expansion and if
the<00:01:14.610> campaign<00:01:15.000> expansion<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:15.630> awesome<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the campaign expansion was awesome and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.109 
the campaign expansion was awesome and
long<00:01:16.530> enough<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.549> worth<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
long enough and was really worth the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
long enough and was really worth the
price<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.020> okay<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.590> they

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
price I would be okay with it if they

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.050 
price I would be okay with it if they
released<00:01:20.100> multiplayer<00:01:20.549> maps<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and if you play multiplayer a lot then I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.550

will<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.390> okay<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.110> behavior

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
will be okay with that behavior

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
will be okay with that behavior
multiplayer<00:01:26.009> maps<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.460> past<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.970> wasn't

multiplayer maps in the past I wasn't
too<00:01:27.600> excited<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.650> was<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
too excited about because I was more of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.920 
too excited about because I was more of
a<00:01:29.100> campaign<00:01:29.460> guy<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.210> never<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.810> into

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
a campaign guy I never really got into

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
a campaign guy I never really got into
multiplayer<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.650> only<00:01:31.770> part<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.460> tried

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
multiplayer the only part I really tried

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.580 
multiplayer the only part I really tried
to<00:01:32.759> play<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.360> halo<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.350> thing<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to play a lot with halo the one thing I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.929 
to play a lot with halo the one thing I
think<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.100> goober<00:01:35.490> three<00:01:35.640> should

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
think that goober three should

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
think that goober three should
definitely<00:01:36.299> avoid<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.110> happened<00:01:37.439> with

definitely avoid is what happened with

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
that was the first time that I ever

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.190 
that was the first time that I ever
played<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.520> map<00:01:53.729> multiplayer<00:01:54.630> wise<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
played on that map multiplayer wise I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.709 
played on that map multiplayer wise I
never<00:01:55.649> put<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.159> map<00:01:56.369> any<00:01:56.790> other<00:01:57.119> time<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
never put on that map any other time and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.060 
never put on that map any other time and
this<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> national<00:01:58.229> team<00:01:58.469> collection

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
this was on the national team collection

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580 
this was on the national team collection
so<00:01:59.280> i<00:01:59.520> bought<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.149> castle<00:02:00.540> map<00:02:00.719> pack<00:02:00.990> kind<00:02:01.469> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so i bought the castle map pack kind of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440 
so i bought the castle map pack kind of
wastefully<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.490> i<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.850> when<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> bought

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
wastefully but i think when you bought

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
wastefully but i think when you bought
the<00:02:03.780> limited<00:02:04.380> edition<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.070> those<00:02:05.219> map

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the limited edition you got those map

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.490 
the limited edition you got those map
packs<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:06.030> free<00:02:06.479> i<00:02:06.509> think<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.170> were<00:02:07.229> cool

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
packs for free i think they were cool

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
packs for free i think they were cool
maps<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.489> never<00:02:08.729> played<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.270> them

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
maps but we just never played on them

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.479 
maps but we just never played on them
ever<00:02:09.660> hopefully<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.619> these<00:02:10.800> extra<00:02:11.340> maps

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
ever hopefully with these extra maps

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.340 
ever hopefully with these extra maps
they<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.120> free<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.660> will<00:02:12.840> obviously

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
they will be free that will obviously

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.840 
they will be free that will obviously
increase<00:02:13.650> popularity<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.700> will

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
increase popularity and that will

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940 
increase popularity and that will
increase<00:02:15.090> population<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:16.230> those<00:02:16.380> Maps<00:02:16.680> I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
increase population for those Maps I

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.710 
increase population for those Maps I
just<00:02:17.280> hope<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.490> when<00:02:18.030> they<00:02:18.240> release<00:02:18.510> this

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
just hope that when they release this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.050 
just hope that when they release this
content<00:02:19.260> people<00:02:19.650> will<00:02:19.740> actually<00:02:19.920> go<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
going to be I guess arena type maps so

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.330 
going to be I guess arena type maps so
they're<00:03:34.260> not<00:03:34.410> necessarily<00:03:34.530> big<00:03:35.100> team<00:03:35.310> battle

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340

maps<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.270> really<00:03:36.720> curious<00:03:37.080> if<00:03:37.500> we're<00:03:37.860> gonna

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.280 
maps I'm really curious if we're gonna
get<00:03:38.250> any<00:03:38.580> big<00:03:39.060> scale<00:03:39.390> maps<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:39.960> not

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
get any big scale maps that are not

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.260 
get any big scale maps that are not
going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.560> be<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.860> war<00:03:41.010> zone<00:03:41.310> most<00:03:41.820> likely<00:03:42.000> we

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
going to be for war zone most likely we

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.730 
going to be for war zone most likely we
are<00:03:42.300> but<00:03:42.660> that's<00:03:42.780> something<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.050> look<00:03:43.110> into<00:03:43.350> I

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
are but that's something to look into I

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.440 
are but that's something to look into I
