off<00:01:47.759> calories<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.450> carbohydrates<00:01:49.290> like

different<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:59.579> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.780> problem<00:02:01.140> starts

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
different but I think the problem starts

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
different but I think the problem starts
when<00:02:01.649> you're<00:02:01.890> starting<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.430> replace<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
when you're starting to replace the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.410 
when you're starting to replace the
calories<00:02:03.420> from<00:02:04.369> carbohydrates<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.790> calories

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
calories from carbohydrates for calories

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.869 
calories from carbohydrates for calories
from<00:02:06.570> avocados<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.890> let's<00:02:08.099> say<00:02:08.340> for<00:02:08.669> dinner

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
from avocados so let's say for dinner

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.759 
from avocados so let's say for dinner
you<00:02:09.059> would<00:02:09.179> eat<00:02:09.419> for<00:02:09.749> possible<00:02:10.200> colors<00:02:10.559> per

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
you would eat for possible colors per

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.180 
you would eat for possible colors per
day<00:02:12.319> so<00:02:13.319> what<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.919> get

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
day so what you can get

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.940 
day so what you can get
is<00:02:14.750> problems<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:15.900> sugar<00:02:16.200> absorption<00:02:16.740> and

doing I don't really so much so I think
it's<00:04:16.530> gotta<00:04:16.799> be<00:04:16.950> something<00:04:17.160> else<00:04:17.519> behind<00:04:17.790> it

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
it's gotta be something else behind it

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.960 
it's gotta be something else behind it
um<00:04:19.070> they<00:04:20.070> meant<00:04:20.310> taking<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.790> too<00:04:20.940> personally
