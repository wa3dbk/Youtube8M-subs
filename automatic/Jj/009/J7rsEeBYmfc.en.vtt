00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
therefore the of it I thought I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.310 
therefore the of it I thought I
just<00:00:18.180> show<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> bleeding<00:00:19.020> procedure

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
just show you the bleeding procedure

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.040 
just show you the bleeding procedure
anyway<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:20.270> I've<00:00:21.270> already<00:00:21.480> cracked<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
anyway now I've already cracked the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.820 
anyway now I've already cracked the
valve<00:00:22.260> open<00:00:22.710> I've<00:00:23.490> got<00:00:23.820> one<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> these<00:00:24.830> tubes

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
valve open I've got one of these tubes

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
valve open I've got one of these tubes
into<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.849> bleeding<00:00:27.269> jar<00:00:27.539> with<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
into a bleeding jar with a little bit of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.609 
into a bleeding jar with a little bit of
brake<00:00:28.590> fluid<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> bottom<00:00:29.580> now<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:31.529> can

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
brake fluid in the bottom now you can

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.310 
brake fluid in the bottom now you can
just<00:00:31.859> use<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.239> peanut<00:00:33.239> butter<00:00:33.510> jar<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> piece

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
just use a peanut butter jar and a piece

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
just use a peanut butter jar and a piece
of<00:00:34.350> fish<00:00:34.649> tank<00:00:35.010> hose<00:00:35.280> makes<00:00:35.670> no<00:00:35.940> difference

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of fish tank hose makes no difference

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.650 
of fish tank hose makes no difference
just<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.020> long<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.260> you've<00:00:38.250> got<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.370> hose

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
just as long as you've got a hose

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.709 
just as long as you've got a hose
continuously<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:40.079> into<00:00:40.559> some<00:00:41.370> fluid<00:00:41.719> what

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
continuously going into some fluid what

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.770 
continuously going into some fluid what
the<00:00:42.809> fluid<00:00:43.140> does<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> stops<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> air

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the fluid does is it stops the air

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.260 
the fluid does is it stops the air
flowing<00:00:45.780> back<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.039> tube<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> open

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
flowing back up the tube so you open

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.950 
flowing back up the tube so you open
your<00:00:49.309> nipple<00:00:50.309> valve<00:00:51.620> quite<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> fair<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.960> at

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
your nipple valve quite a fair right at

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
your nipple valve quite a fair right at
least<00:00:55.079> half<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> turn<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:55.949> basically<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
least half a turn now basically all you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.950 
least half a turn now basically all you
have<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.660> pump

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.680 

as<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:06.010> can<00:01:06.130> see<00:01:08.280> fluids<00:01:09.280> going<00:01:09.369> into<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.420> jar

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
as you can see fluids going into the jar

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.260 
as you can see fluids going into the jar
and<00:01:11.880> any<00:01:12.880> air<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:15.040> coming<00:01:15.280> out<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.030> can't

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
and any air is coming out and you can't

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.600 
and any air is coming out and you can't
see<00:01:16.450> through<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.750> tube<00:01:17.020> very<00:01:17.470> well<00:01:17.710> but<00:01:17.950> all

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
see through the tube very well but all

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.240 
see through the tube very well but all
that<00:01:19.090> is<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:19.390> continuously<00:01:19.960> full<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.680> brake

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
that is now continuously full of brake

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.609 
that is now continuously full of brake
fluid<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:27.060> weary<00:01:28.060> tighten<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.600> valve<00:01:28.810> if<00:01:29.470> I

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
fluid so weary tighten the valve if I

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.580 
fluid so weary tighten the valve if I
pull<00:01:29.800> this<00:01:29.979> off<00:01:30.240> watch<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> tube

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.500 

there<00:01:35.590> goes<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:35.830> line<00:01:36.070> of<00:01:36.220> brake<00:01:36.370> fluid<00:01:36.510> down

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
there goes a line of brake fluid down

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.910 
there goes a line of brake fluid down
into<00:01:37.780> there<00:01:37.930> so<00:01:38.110> there's<00:01:38.290> no<00:01:38.410> air<00:01:38.680> in<00:01:38.710> it

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
into there so there's no air in it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.510 
into there so there's no air in it
always<00:01:39.700> dispose<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.690> used<00:01:41.680> brake<00:01:42.130> fluid

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
always dispose of used brake fluid

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.470 
always dispose of used brake fluid
properly<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.750> never<00:01:44.380> put<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.940> fluid<00:01:46.360> that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
comes out of the bleeding nipples back

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.840 
comes out of the bleeding nipples back
