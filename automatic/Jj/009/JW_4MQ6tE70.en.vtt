00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290 

so<00:00:00.450> I<00:00:00.810> just<00:00:01.170> finished<00:00:01.500> doing<00:00:01.650> my<00:00:01.939> ombre<00:00:02.939> hair

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
so I just finished doing my ombre hair

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.410 
so I just finished doing my ombre hair
and<00:00:03.629> it<00:00:04.470> came<00:00:04.680> out<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.250> little<00:00:05.430> bit<00:00:05.670> more<00:00:06.120> subtle

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
and it came out a little bit more subtle

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
and it came out a little bit more subtle
than<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.750> had<00:00:06.930> hoped<00:00:06.960> but<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.529> guess<00:00:07.830> that's<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
than I had hoped but I guess that's a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.370 
than I had hoped but I guess that's a
good<00:00:08.400> thing<00:00:08.460> because<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.570> can<00:00:09.750> always<00:00:09.929> work

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
good thing because you can always work

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.259 
good thing because you can always work
with<00:00:10.620> subtle<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.250> can't<00:00:11.550> work<00:00:11.790> with<00:00:12.030> too

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
with subtle but you can't work with too

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.900 
with subtle but you can't work with too
crazy<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.960> feel<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.380> at<00:00:13.559> least<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.670> had

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
crazy I feel like at least so and I had

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.730 
crazy I feel like at least so and I had
decided<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.420> wasn't<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.929> do<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.139> intro

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
decided I wasn't going to do this intro

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.490 
decided I wasn't going to do this intro
until<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> few<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:18.359> washes<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.140> because

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
until a few more washes just because

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.769 
until a few more washes just because
obviously<00:00:20.160> color<00:00:20.730> comes<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.210> darker<00:00:21.660> when

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
obviously color comes out darker when

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
obviously color comes out darker when
you<00:00:21.900> first<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.769> kind<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.070> washes<00:00:23.250> out

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you first do it it kind of washes out

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.820 
you first do it it kind of washes out
but<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> figured<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.510> okay<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.410> can

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
but I figured that's okay because I can

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.099 
but I figured that's okay because I can
always<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.519> an<00:00:26.640> update<00:00:26.910> video<00:00:27.150> later<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.720> so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
always do an update video later on so

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.070 
always do an update video later on so
first<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.800> foremost<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.490> used<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.750> Revlon

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080

kids and you will see like me doing the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.920 
kids and you will see like me doing the
steps<00:00:34.050> later<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.520> over<00:00:35.670> it

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930

from<00:00:39.480> medium<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> dark<00:00:40.290> brown<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.480> had

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
from medium to dark brown here so I had

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
from medium to dark brown here so I had
initially<00:00:43.920> thought<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.090> do

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
initially thought I was just going to do

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
initially thought I was just going to do
the<00:00:45.360> ends<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.649> had<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> few

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the ends but then I had put a few

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.540 
the ends but then I had put a few
streaks<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.329> top<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.440> came<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.739> kind

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
streaks up on top to that came up kind

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
streaks up on top to that came up kind
of<00:00:50.700> mix<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.360> were<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> orange<00:00:52.710> e<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
of mix they were kind of orange e and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
of mix they were kind of orange e and
brassy<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.539> didn't<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> way

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
brassy and I just didn't like the way

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.979 
brassy and I just didn't like the way
they<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> went<00:00:56.550> over<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> dark

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
they look so I went over it with a dark

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.439 
they look so I went over it with a dark
brown<00:00:58.289> hair<00:00:58.410> color<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.850> sure<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.300> will

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
brown hair color and I'm sure it will

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
brown hair color and I'm sure it will
show<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> little<00:01:01.109> bit<00:01:01.260> more<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.859> washes<00:01:02.340> out

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
show a little bit more as it washes out

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.630

from<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:52.710> from<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.750> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
from here to here and then from here to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.410 
from here to here and then from here to
here<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.350> did<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> way<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.240> just

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
here I did this and that way I was just

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
here I did this and that way I was just
able<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.899> leave<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.290> 20<00:01:58.680> minutes<00:01:58.950> all

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
able to leave it on 20 minutes all

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
able to leave it on 20 minutes all
together<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.939> wash<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.210> off<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.750> i<00:02:01.110> love

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
together and just wash it off and i love

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
together and just wash it off and i love
the<00:02:01.649> effect<00:02:02.009> i<00:02:02.189> feel<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.790> did<00:02:02.969> come<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the effect i feel like it did come out a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
the effect i feel like it did come out a
little<00:02:03.719> bit<00:02:03.960> more<00:02:04.170> subtle<00:02:04.530> than<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.070> hoping

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
little bit more subtle than I was hoping

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.340 
little bit more subtle than I was hoping
for<00:02:05.430> but

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
for but

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.899 
for but
I think<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.860> easier<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.340> work<00:02:07.610> with<00:02:07.670> and

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
I think this is easier to work with and

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.120 
I think this is easier to work with and
also<00:02:08.300> since<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.350> just<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.679> first<00:02:09.709> time

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
also since this is just the first time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.850 
also since this is just the first time
that<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.819> did<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.300> obviously<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.110> will<00:02:12.350> wash<00:02:12.620> out

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
that I did it obviously it will wash out

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.680 
that I did it obviously it will wash out
a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.190> bit<00:02:13.370> lighter<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.090> few<00:02:14.330> more

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
a little bit lighter in a few more

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.500 
a little bit lighter in a few more
washes<00:02:15.310> but<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.670> guys<00:02:16.819> know<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.030> don't<00:02:17.180> wash

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
washes but as you guys know I don't wash

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.840 
washes but as you guys know I don't wash
my<00:02:17.780> hair<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.020> often<00:02:18.590> um<00:02:18.770> only<00:02:19.040> about<00:02:19.340> once<00:02:19.580> or

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
my hair that often um only about once or

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.110 
my hair that often um only about once or
twice<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.330> week<00:02:20.780> at<00:02:21.020> most<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.730> gonna<00:02:22.880> take

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
twice a week at most so it's gonna take

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.420 
twice a week at most so it's gonna take
a<00:02:23.150> few<00:02:23.239> weeks<00:02:23.600> what<00:02:24.080> I'm<00:02:24.200> thinking<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
a few weeks what I'm thinking is in a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.760 
a few weeks what I'm thinking is in a
few<00:02:25.640> weeks<00:02:25.840> hopefully<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.870> can<00:02:27.020> condition<00:02:27.620> my

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
few weeks hopefully I can condition my

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.559 
few weeks hopefully I can condition my
hair<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.130> oil<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.730> stuff<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.180> get<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.390> back

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
hair and oil and stuff and get it back

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.840 
hair and oil and stuff and get it back
restored<00:02:30.100> from<00:02:31.100> all<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.459> damage<00:02:31.819> that

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
restored from all the damage that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.970 
restored from all the damage that
obviously<00:02:32.360> bleach<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.020> hair<00:02:33.170> color<00:02:33.440> does<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
obviously bleach and hair color does and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.670 
obviously bleach and hair color does and
then<00:02:34.190> what<00:02:34.370> i<00:02:34.400> can<00:02:34.610> do<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:34.819> redo<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:36.470> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
then what i can do is redo just the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.740 
then what i can do is redo just the
bottom<00:02:36.860> portion<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.760> what<00:02:37.970> we'll<00:02:38.180> see<00:02:38.569> in<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
bottom portion and what we'll see in the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.479 
bottom portion and what we'll see in the
video<00:02:38.989> what<00:02:39.170> i<00:02:39.200> had<00:02:39.410> done<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:39.830> done<00:02:40.250> like

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
video what i had done is just done like

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.670 
video what i had done is just done like
patches<00:02:40.850> down<00:02:41.330> here<00:02:41.780> for<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.350> more<00:02:42.650> natural

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
patches down here for a more natural

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.100 
patches down here for a more natural
look<00:02:43.130> but<00:02:43.310> what<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.819> might<00:02:44.120> do<00:02:44.360> next<00:02:44.569> time<00:02:44.870> is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
look but what I might do next time is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.280 
look but what I might do next time is
just<00:02:45.350> kind<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.830> dip<00:02:46.130> diet<00:02:47.120> from<00:02:47.540> here<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.080> here

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
just kind of dip diet from here to here

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.830 
just kind of dip diet from here to here
Bleacher<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.100> we'll<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:49.940> but<00:02:50.269> obviously

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
Bleacher it and we'll see but obviously

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.960 
Bleacher it and we'll see but obviously
it's<00:02:51.410> better<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.860> do<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.010> gradually<00:02:52.340> in

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
it's better to do it gradually in

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.509 
it's better to do it gradually in
smaller<00:02:53.360> steps<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.380> that's<00:02:54.739> what<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:54.950> came<00:02:55.250> out

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
smaller steps so that's what it came out

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.410 
smaller steps so that's what it came out
at<00:02:55.790> I'm<00:02:56.090> as<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.380> hope<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:58.069> guys<00:02:58.420> enjoyed

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
the kind of bits and pieces of the

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.059 
the kind of bits and pieces of the
tutorial<00:03:02.480> um<00:03:03.049> I've<00:03:03.500> mentioned<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.950> before

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
tutorial um I've mentioned this before

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.340 
tutorial um I've mentioned this before
I'm<00:03:04.819> a<00:03:04.880> mom<00:03:05.209> there's<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.569> lot<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.780> noise<00:03:06.019> in<00:03:06.049> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
I'm a mom there's a lot of noise in the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.660 
I'm a mom there's a lot of noise in the
background<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:06.920> it's<00:03:07.040> kind<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.220> hard<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.489> me

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
background so it's kind of hard for me

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.509 
background so it's kind of hard for me
to<00:03:07.790> do<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:08.090> full-on<00:03:08.360> tutorials<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.650> think

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
to do like full-on tutorials but I think

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.920 
to do like full-on tutorials but I think
you<00:03:10.610> get<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.790> picture<00:03:11.030> obviously<00:03:11.360> there's<00:03:11.870> a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
you get the picture obviously there's a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.800 
you get the picture obviously there's a

them so i feel like this is a good
compromise<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:31.190> between<00:03:31.609> because<00:03:31.850> it's<00:03:32.510> in

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
is just go ahead and take my own brush

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.420 
is just go ahead and take my own brush
that<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.130> had<00:04:23.490> from<00:04:24.090> last<00:04:24.180> year<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.130> paint<00:04:26.130> on

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
that I had from last year and paint on

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
that I had from last year and paint on
some<00:04:26.850> highlights<00:04:27.740> into<00:04:28.740> my<00:04:28.860> hair<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.430> could<00:04:29.460> use

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
some highlights into my hair I could use

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.540 
some highlights into my hair I could use
the<00:04:30.480> cap<00:04:30.900> for<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:31.650> it's<00:04:31.890> just<00:04:32.070> easier<00:04:32.490> to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
the cap for this but it's just easier to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.700 
the cap for this but it's just easier to
control<00:04:32.940> without<00:04:33.390> the<00:04:33.840> cap<00:04:34.400> paint<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.790> on<00:04:36.030> I

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
control without the cap paint it on I

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.780 
control without the cap paint it on I
should<00:04:37.710> probably<00:04:37.920> put<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.460> gloves<00:04:38.700> on<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:40.790> do

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
should probably put the gloves on I do

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.510 
should probably put the gloves on I do
have<00:04:42.240> some<00:04:42.510> soil<00:04:42.870> years<00:04:43.290> i<00:04:43.500> had<00:04:43.740> just<00:04:44.010> in<00:04:44.250> case

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
have some soil years i had just in case

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.520 
have some soil years i had just in case
I<00:04:44.730> needed<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.750> I'm<00:04:45.900> thinking<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.470> I

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
I needed it and I'm thinking that I

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.260 
I needed it and I'm thinking that I
might<00:04:46.620> actually<00:04:47.010> need<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:47.910> what<00:04:48.060> I'm<00:04:48.150> going

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
might actually need it so what I'm going

00:04:48.270 --> 00:05:05.450 
might actually need it so what I'm going
to<00:04:48.360> do<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:49.560> take<00:04:49.920> a<00:04:50.520> little<00:04:51.060> section<00:05:04.460> mons

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
to do is just take a little section mons

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:25.570 
to do is just take a little section mons
coming

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.999 

so<00:05:26.580> basically<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.120> have<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.569> few<00:05:27.900> random<00:05:28.470> foils

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
so basically I have a few random foils

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.939 
so basically I have a few random foils
like<00:05:29.370> just<00:05:29.639> around<00:05:30.030> my<00:05:30.270> head<00:05:30.569> just<00:05:31.229> again<00:05:31.710> so

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
like just around my head just again so

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.360 
like just around my head just again so
it<00:05:32.039> blends<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.639> I<00:05:33.300> have<00:05:33.539> done<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:34.349> few<00:05:34.889> thicker

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
it blends and I have done a few thicker

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.700 
it blends and I have done a few thicker
foils<00:05:35.819> on<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.030> bottom<00:05:36.419> but<00:05:36.720> now<00:05:37.199> I'm<00:05:37.380> kind<00:05:37.590> of

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
foils on the bottom but now I'm kind of

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.219 
foils on the bottom but now I'm kind of
thinking<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:38.160> maybe<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.819> should<00:05:39.270> just<00:05:39.300> do<00:05:40.080> it

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
thinking that maybe I should just do it

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.879 
thinking that maybe I should just do it
all<00:05:40.440> um<00:05:40.800> on<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.449> bottom<00:05:42.449> I'm<00:05:42.750> not<00:05:43.080> sure<00:05:43.560> how

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
all um on the bottom I'm not sure how

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.570 
all um on the bottom I'm not sure how
it's<00:05:44.130> going<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.699> come<00:05:44.940> out<00:05:45.710> but<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:47.310> guess<00:05:47.550> I

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
it's going to come out but I guess I

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.460 
it's going to come out but I guess I
wasn't<00:05:48.210> trying<00:05:48.569> to<00:05:48.660> go<00:05:48.750> for<00:05:48.930> anything<00:05:49.139> too

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
wasn't trying to go for anything too

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.870 
that I went so high up it's gonna be

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.250 
that I went so high up it's gonna be
kind<00:07:52.680> of<00:07:52.770> a<00:07:52.920> mess<00:07:53.190> to<00:07:53.550> work<00:07:53.850> with<00:07:54.090> that<00:07:54.260> hard

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.260 
kind of a mess to work with that hard

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.710 
kind of a mess to work with that hard
but<00:07:55.650> I'm<00:07:56.610> going<00:07:56.940> to<00:07:57.000> go<00:07:57.090> ahead<00:07:57.120> and<00:07:57.300> do<00:07:57.540> this
