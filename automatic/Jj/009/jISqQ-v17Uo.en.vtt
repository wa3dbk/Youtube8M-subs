00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.750
 I 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.380
 I 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.650
 I 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.870
 hello hi cpie camille and I hope that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 you are well and today we are 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.170
 found for a new open video 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.520
 nature and so as you can very 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 certainly hear the birds we 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.970
 accompanied today and I chose 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.320
 still a plan with clear because I 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.820
 find it really great for a 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.410
 opening I can lay the cards in 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.090
 the grass is really very nice and 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.010
 today we will open two boosters 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.720
 diamond and pearl storm with 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.100
 the illustration of torterat and 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.780
 nocturnal war who are really 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.220
 beautiful so basically I had them 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.050
 just keep in my 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.190
 sealed booster collection but they 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.200
 have made me feel good on this Sunday 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.700
 so why not we're going to spend everything from 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 following the opening I will show you 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.580
 however the back of a booster is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.920
 really nice 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.020
 the sun the science episode so I 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.020
 start with the torterat it's gone 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.360
 it's true little torterat he is well 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:50.710
 adapted finally I panda the booster 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.420
 that's the sun's bumping into actually 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.490
 do you remember it's the 1 2 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 3 go 3-2 normally it seems to me that 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.170
 for tf1 the second storm series 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.619
 win this one it hockey 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.599
 so let's go do not think you sounded the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.490
 booster who sees the coast is so when 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.009
 we start with an exchange card with 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.770
 a cart on it and there is a small 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.560
 party pushes too that I neglected 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.030
 drill roselia very nice enrolled lennox 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.110
 I do not know what he's doing here because 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.180
 that he does not do better on the contrary it is 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:28.030
 full sun 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.860
 onyx interac the ofppt is decidedly the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.750
 pot that draw more but I hope for 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.989
 to bring you luck is a 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.319
 good pick a tichot duck very nice 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.709

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.950
 Well, you 're really out of luck. 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.209
 little pity let's see what we 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.970
 reserve following the 103rd no no it's 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.900
 a secret does not say will not mount 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:57.040
 show them now more in 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.170
 patronage was starting what very copious ellis 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.760
 hyper v was born beginning of the video I 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.670
 did you say go shoot us the charizard 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.530

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.390
 it's monstrous finally not at the beginning of 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.040
 the video actually he told me just before 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.640
 we start the video was going to turn 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.820
 a secret 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.830
 finally to laugh at the draco then have 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.030
 you do not know what actually there is 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.250
 also their salamèche is installed 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.930
 secret inside this series and 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.420
 the draco is it's just huge of 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.060
 fall on this left there a single 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.390
 boston the statue here is secret but 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.790
 it's the pickaxe more you see it's 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.410
 thanks to her is too beautiful this is the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.780
 dragon surrender made the seven basic 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.000
 that they have but this series there no it's 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.800
 right base 17 so if jitters 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.910
 at the bottom of the bag olonne may be there 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.380
 I may be confusing with us in the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.300
 same position the same number of adrs not 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.160

 just as lucky but that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.440
