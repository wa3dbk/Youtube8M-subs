about the blister grill this year is
we've<00:00:48.239> added<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.769> technology<00:00:49.769> which<00:00:49.949> we<00:00:50.100> call

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we've added a technology which we call

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.780 
we've added a technology which we call
mag<00:00:50.790> seal<00:00:51.089> mag<00:00:51.809> seal<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.230> an<00:00:52.350> oil<00:00:52.589> magnetic<00:00:53.579> oil

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
mag seal mag seal is an oil magnetic oil

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.450 
mag seal mag seal is an oil magnetic oil
that<00:00:54.150> we<00:00:54.659> put<00:00:54.930> around<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.680> entrance<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.309> where

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that we put around the entrance to where

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.539 
that we put around the entrance to where
the<00:00:57.180> full<00:00:57.780> shaft<00:00:58.050> goes<00:00:58.290> up<00:00:58.409> and<00:00:58.589> down<00:00:58.619> and<00:00:59.070> that

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
the full shaft goes up and down and that

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.950 
the full shaft goes up and down and that
prevents<00:00:59.909> water<00:00:59.939> from<00:01:00.299> getting<00:01:00.659> into<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
prevents water from getting into the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
prevents water from getting into the
body<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.470> reel<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.339> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.180> take<00:01:03.360> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
body of the reel so you can take this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
body of the reel so you can take this
reel<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.799> under<00:01:05.010> water<00:01:05.129> pull<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
reel put it under water pull it out and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
reel put it under water pull it out and
water<00:01:06.240> will<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> body<00:01:07.080> which

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
water will not get in the body which

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
water will not get in the body which
helps<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> prevent<00:01:08.340> corrosion<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> also

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
helps to prevent corrosion but it also

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
helps to prevent corrosion but it also
keeps<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.350> smooth<00:01:11.009> because<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:11.970> like

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
keeps it very smooth because it's like

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719 
keeps it very smooth because it's like
an<00:01:12.210> oil<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.320> smooth<00:01:13.740> we've<00:01:14.340> added<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
an oil so it's very smooth we've added a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.420 
an oil so it's very smooth we've added a
Xion<00:01:15.150> side<00:01:16.049> plate<00:01:16.350> body<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
Xion side plate body to this so it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.490 
Xion side plate body to this so it's
very<00:01:17.580> lightweight<00:01:17.900> it's<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> very<00:01:19.200> affordable

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
very lightweight it's a very affordable

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.039 
very lightweight it's a very affordable
real<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.930> of
