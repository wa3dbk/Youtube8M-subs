00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.310
 when we welcome a customer we have to 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.660
 to inform him of the risks that the 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:20.210
 potential that can have as well 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.650
 before after a tattoo it stings 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.880
 hurts it's an offense and it's 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.850
 an offense put year to stripes 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.369
 touch any skin whatever 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.250
 it is necessary a certificate of hygiene 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.260
 a diploma to us we learn a hygiene 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.330
 as well for the tattoo as well 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.590
 to make a sign if there is no 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.480
 diploma on this hygiene we do not have the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.159
 right to touch is lyon the first 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.530
 thing the most important thing is 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.080
 hand hygiene so well 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.220
 clean hands start with them 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.720
 hands the wrists the forearms and to 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 thumbs between the gaps 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.860
 currence hands always first the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.920
 hands up for closed does not fall 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.590
 not on the hands the paper you have 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.250
 tap you do not see rubbed by pat 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.689
 hands and after forearms 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.600
 once it's done it's a passage 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.149
 to textbooks 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 so what is very important is that 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.770
 so it's thermos sachets or lady 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.929
 which goes into an autoclave 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.909
 a type b autoclave there are markers 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.460
 that change color that turns black 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.100
 once the weather and temperature 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.929
 sterilization are achieved by 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.909
 report to new legislation we have a 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.130
 tracking number 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.510
 because if after one month we do not have 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.280
 in use 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.260
 the buses that are inside we have to 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.020
 return to autoclave redo a 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.170
 sterilization cycle so now 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.940
 one for each customer tone each customer 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.490
 have a sheet filled in where there is the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.620
 name the first name phone number and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.920
 especially important is at the back 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.460
 we note the buses we will use 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.890
 needles that are single-use open 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 in front of the customer threw after 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.930
 containers provided for this purpose so we 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.840
 prepare the work plan that's 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.130
 single-use material so between 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.480
 every customer must know that he 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.400
 a quarter of an hour must elapse 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.490
 are we to use products 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.270
 kind of hospitals so we have to clean 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.250
 machines and do not clean the bench the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.760
 work plan and so all again - 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.760
 fifteen minutes 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.340
 tattoo parlors and salons 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.709
 goâve piercing is separated these two 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.840
 totally different hygiene here is a 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.670
 room for tattoo a room paul 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.860
 persie but also for the hall 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.050
 sterilization that has to be apart and 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.390
 an extra room where he will see 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.640
 all the waste since naturally 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.750
 everything we use these disposable 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.580
 this is the beast language the base line 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.239
 needles needles go into 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.510
 hard waste and the effect feeds me is 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.390
 relegating all this fight I have you go 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.090
 in a chapel of soft waste everything 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.160
 what are we going to use his disposables 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.160
 except labusquière and sterilized 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.660
 at 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.090
 and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.109
 after the tattoo there are things that we 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.000
 do not have to say no pool 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.340
 hamann no no no Jacuzzi 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.209
 sauna no uv we must not forget that 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.670
 the skin is leather 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.700
 so we have creams and sprays for 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.799
 treat the info so we have to put in 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.819
 before creams that are for the 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.500
 healing 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.480
 once the tattoo is finished one 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.340
 See you again fifteen days later to see 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.530
 if the pigmentation and go back to 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.209
 the interior is so scarring is 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.829
 okay anyone can come to 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.539
 tattoo 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.329
 so you have to explain that the skin does not 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.620
 can not heal alone he 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.699
 must give him a hand it's 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.789
 for that we are kings after 15 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.789
 days
