00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello everyone knows in hen d 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030
 it's for a new video 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.330
 so today we will learn 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.080
 how to shower and a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.000
 bath then down we will start all 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.500
 right now that's the outline of the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.859
 shower 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.349
 I prefer to leave two like that of 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.689
 job cube you can leave a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.590
 it's your faith, it's you who 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.890
 decide and also he tries anyway 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.829
 a margin for the shower on both 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 at least three cubes because what he 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.960
 need some space after you put here 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.120
 we will put 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.739
 good so that's fine we'll put 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:00.300
 a lever here and a piston here and there 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:07.680
 will put the water in phase where the game 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:10.979
 that the scoundrels really sorry and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.510
 that's good I know years is simple and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.450
 fast like that at least it's not a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.880
 shower too complicated because this one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.509

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 shower 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.420
