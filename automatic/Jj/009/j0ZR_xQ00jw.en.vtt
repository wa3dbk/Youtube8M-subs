00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.350 
generators and color gradient there's
these<00:01:54.530> three<00:01:54.770> presets<00:01:55.399> here<00:01:55.579> these<00:01:56.179> are<00:01:56.329> the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
other ones they look decent but I liked

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.800 
other ones they look decent but I liked
it<00:02:03.890> better<00:02:04.130> when<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:04.549> a<00:02:04.640> gradient<00:02:05.239> I'm<00:02:05.599> just

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
it better when it's a gradient I'm just

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.160 
it better when it's a gradient I'm just
personal<00:02:06.200> preference<00:02:06.909> alright<00:02:07.909> so<00:02:08.269> you're

it's right here now we're just going to
follow<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.900> all<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.380> way<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.829> end<00:02:22.040> until

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
follow it all the way to the end until

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.509 
follow it all the way to the end until
the<00:02:22.790> second<00:02:23.299> burst<00:02:24.040> I'm<00:02:25.040> going<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.280> put<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
the second burst I'm going to put it

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.170 
the second burst I'm going to put it
right<00:02:25.549> there<00:02:25.780> okay<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:28.040> split<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.579> it's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
right there okay so split that it's

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.059 
right there okay so split that it's
about<00:02:30.489> about<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.519> second<00:02:32.090> long<00:02:32.269> but<00:02:33.109> now<00:02:33.829> for

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
about about a second long but now for

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.199 
about about a second long but now for
the<00:02:34.190> whole<00:02:34.430> entire<00:02:34.790> thing

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the whole entire thing

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.099 
the whole entire thing
it's<00:02:35.569> just<00:02:35.870> fading<00:02:36.650> out<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.060> kind<00:02:39.019> of

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
it's just fading out so that kind of

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.620 
it's just fading out so that kind of
flashes<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.370> alright<00:02:41.060> but<00:02:41.389> you<00:02:41.480> can

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
flashes like that alright but you can

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.110 
flashes like that alright but you can
see<00:02:41.810> it's<00:02:41.959> covering<00:02:42.380> up<00:02:42.530> our<00:02:42.650> video<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:43.970> go

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
see it's covering up our video so we go

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.349 
see it's covering up our video so we go
to<00:02:44.769> source<00:02:45.769> thing<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.900> go<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.959> screen<00:02:48.530> okay

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
to source thing and go to screen okay

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.319 
to source thing and go to screen okay
now<00:02:50.359> it's<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:51.380> gonna<00:02:51.530> make<00:02:51.889> that<00:02:52.790> flash

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
now it's just gonna make that flash

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.220 
now it's just gonna make that flash
feeling<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:55.040> suddenly<00:02:55.340> burst<00:02:55.850> in<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.600> then

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
feeling is it suddenly burst in and then

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.280 
feeling is it suddenly burst in and then
it<00:02:57.380> slowly<00:02:57.709> fades<00:02:58.370> out<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.049> beats

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
it slowly fades out with the beats

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.770 
it slowly fades out with the beats
course<00:03:00.829> so<00:03:01.819> now<00:03:02.030> we're<00:03:02.269> just<00:03:02.299> going<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.569> do

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
course so now we're just going to do

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.410 
course so now we're just going to do
that<00:03:02.989> again

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
that again

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.199 
that again
and<00:03:04.510> that's<00:03:05.260> pretty<00:03:05.980> much<00:03:06.099> it<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.459> there's

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
and that's pretty much it so there's

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.050 
and that's pretty much it so there's
nothing<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:07.599> else<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.349> um<00:03:09.030> I'll<00:03:10.030> just
