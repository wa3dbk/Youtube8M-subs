 the course will begin on November 4 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.580
 and ends on December 8 let's say that 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.740
 the first module and what would be the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.070
 presentation module will last a 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.420
 week and will start on November 4 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.720
 coinciding with the opening of the course and 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.250
 will end or should end on 10 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.500
 November although we are going to 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.110
 keep the module open until the 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.960
 completion of the course on December 8 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.199
 the second module will open on 11 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.510
 November and should end on 17 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.550
 November the same will remain open 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.739
 until 8 December , the third module 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.019
 on facebook open 18 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.350
 November and will close on 24 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.550
 November for a week and also 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.379
 will remain open until 8 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.969
 December and finally the fourth module 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.299
 from other social networks and tools 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.010
 will be opened on November 25 and already 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.049
 will close to December 8 coinciding 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.600
 with the completion of the course this is 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.729
 this last module lasts two weeks already 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.470
 which also has a final activity that 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.950
 will count therefore for what is the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.140
 course certificate comment that has 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.659
 leave the modules open until the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.579
 completion of the course is advisable 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.649
 to keep you going by taking them to 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.979
 day because if not at the end it is going to 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.229
 put together we also take into account why 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.329
 lasts the second the last module two 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.399
 weeks that also at least in Spain 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.289
 there are two days that are party 6 and 8 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.630
 of December with which therefore that's why 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.060
 we also give a little more time and 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.429
 then the hangouts that we had thought 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.009
 that is to say the videoconferences are going to 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.390
 perform on Monday , November 18 is 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.810
 say once the second is finished 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.049
 twitter module at 6 pm 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.429
 - Spanish time-- and this one in this one 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.520
 well you can do all the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.500
 questions that you want how we are going to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.290
 do well 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.620
 will be live more or less so far 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.130
 we calculate that both Latin America and 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.229
 Spain 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.060
 it's not a few hours when the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.210
 people sleeping is to say that you can 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.850
 see it in the video 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.020
 will be done through twitter 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.460
 using a hashtag that already 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.380
 we will comment then you 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.480
 we will ask the questions with that 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.950
 hashtag and us using the technique 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.500
 because the back channel will go 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.180
 showing the questions and the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.600
 resolving the same on Monday 2 of 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.150
 December at 6 hours 16 18 hours 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.190

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.570
 I will ask your questions and I will 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.480
 I will solve 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.100
 both videoconferences or videos although 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.830
 you can not see live will be 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.220

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.610
 you can check them then to see them 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.460
