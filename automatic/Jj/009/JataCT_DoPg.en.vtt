robots robots I have to tell you about

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.030 
robots robots I have to tell you about
this<00:00:11.849> thing<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.840> saw<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.530> solves<00:00:13.920> one

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
this thing that I saw and it solves one

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
this thing that I saw and it solves one
of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.219> greatest<00:00:14.490> problems<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.420> robotics

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
of the greatest problems of robotics

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.590 
of the greatest problems of robotics
today<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.920> that's<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.970> your<00:00:18.180> room<00:00:18.420> but

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
today and that's that your room but

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.300 
today and that's that your room but
can't<00:00:18.840> fit<00:00:19.080> into<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.380> corner<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.130> there's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
can't fit into the corner so there's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.429 
can't fit into the corner so there's
always<00:00:20.430> dusty<00:00:20.850> corners<00:00:21.180> rumors<00:00:21.689> around<00:00:21.840> in

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
always dusty corners rumors around in

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.519 
always dusty corners rumors around in
cars<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.369> obviously<00:00:24.240> not<00:00:24.510> um<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.140> evolution

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
cars are obviously not um but evolution

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.050 
cars are obviously not um but evolution
robotics<00:00:26.189> has<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.490> come<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.910> their

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
robotics has just come out with their

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.540 
robotics has just come out with their
new<00:00:27.300> sweeper<00:00:27.810> named<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.590> mint<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.310> it's

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
new sweeper named the mint and it's

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.730 
new sweeper named the mint and it's
square<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> uses<00:00:30.630> Swiffer<00:00:30.869> pads<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.500> can't

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
square and uses Swiffer pads I can't

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.200 
square and uses Swiffer pads I can't
believe<00:00:31.830> somebody's<00:00:32.160> using<00:00:32.279> Swiffer<00:00:32.730> pads<00:00:32.850> on

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
believe somebody's using Swiffer pads on

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
believe somebody's using Swiffer pads on
a<00:00:33.270> robot<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.930> mean<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> kind<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> makes<00:00:34.590> sense<00:00:34.800> i

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
a robot I mean it kind of makes sense i

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.500 
a robot I mean it kind of makes sense i
mean<00:00:35.070> Swiffer<00:00:35.430> pads<00:00:35.550> are<00:00:35.880> already<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.210> there

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
mean Swiffer pads are already out there

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.700 
mean Swiffer pads are already out there
so<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.410> buy<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so it's not like you have to buy a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.630 
so it's not like you have to buy a
separate<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.489> sweeping<00:00:39.329> package<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.230> your

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
separate like sweeping package for your

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.680 
separate like sweeping package for your
robotics<00:00:41.640> I'll<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
robotics I'll be like you go to the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
robotics I'll be like you go to the
corner<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> pick<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.590> robot<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.670> Swiffer

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
corner you pick up your robot a Swiffer

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.670 
corner you pick up your robot a Swiffer
pad<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.570> stop<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> back<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.350> its<00:00:46.440> charger

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
pad you stop it back in its charger

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.010 
pad you stop it back in its charger
awesome<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.210> kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> awesome<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.870> kind

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
awesome I just kind of awesome it's kind

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.240 
awesome I just kind of awesome it's kind
of<00:00:49.050> weird<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.320> could<00:00:49.469> might<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.860> Swiffer<00:00:50.129> pads

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of weird I could might just Swiffer pads

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
of weird I could might just Swiffer pads
seems<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> weird<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> me<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
seems kind of weird to me but like I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.840 
seems kind of weird to me but like I
said<00:00:52.500> they're<00:00:52.829> already<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.579> think

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
said they're already out there I think

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.610 
said they're already out there I think
it<00:00:53.910> makes<00:00:54.059> total<00:00:54.270> sense<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.379> even

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it makes total sense and it's not even

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.080 
it makes total sense and it's not even
that<00:00:55.739> expensive<00:00:55.860> either<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.850> you're

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that expensive either it's like you're

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
that expensive either it's like you're
completely<00:00:57.719> cleaning<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.199> after<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> toddler

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
completely cleaning up after a toddler

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.680 
completely cleaning up after a toddler
that's<00:00:59.520> true<00:00:59.760> that's<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> swiffer<00:01:00.480> back

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that's true that's a lot of swiffer back

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.060 
that's true that's a lot of swiffer back
I<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.930> cats<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.410> don't<00:01:01.559> think<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> Swiffer<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
I have cats I don't think a Swiffer is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.500 
I have cats I don't think a Swiffer is
