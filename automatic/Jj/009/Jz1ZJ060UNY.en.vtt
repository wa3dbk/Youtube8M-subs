it's<00:01:56.549> another<00:01:56.939> plastic<00:01:57.240> component<00:01:57.930> from<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it's another plastic component from the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
it's another plastic component from the
factory<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.740> prone<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> leak<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
factory which is prone to leak and you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.399 
factory which is prone to leak and you
can<00:01:59.909> add<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.329> upgrade<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.259> can

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
can add on the upgrade to that you can

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.560 
can add on the upgrade to that you can
also<00:02:01.439> order<00:02:02.250> these<00:02:02.369> powder<00:02:02.790> coated<00:02:03.299> which<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
also order these powder coated which is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
also order these powder coated which is
super<00:02:04.049> cool<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> paint<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
super cool so you don't have to paint it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.459 
super cool so you don't have to paint it
yourself<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.570> order<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.140> chrome

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
yourself you can order it with a chrome

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.889 
yourself you can order it with a chrome
finish<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.190> even<00:02:08.369> order<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.879> polished<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
finish you can even order it polished I

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.420 
finish you can even order it polished I
think<00:02:10.289> for<00:02:10.470> me<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.830> probably<00:02:11.190> do<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
think for me I would probably do the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.250 
think for me I would probably do the
powder<00:02:11.610> coated<00:02:12.120> black<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.080> keep

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
powder coated black just to keep

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.000 
powder coated black just to keep
everything<00:02:13.500> under<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
everything under the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.979 
everything under the
engine<00:02:14.250> compartments<00:02:14.760> subtle<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.870> is

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
engine compartments subtle but there is

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.390 
engine compartments subtle but there is
something<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.650> super<00:02:17.010> cool<00:02:17.250> about

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
something that is super cool about

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.860 
something that is super cool about
having<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.849> bright<00:02:18.060> shiny<00:02:18.329> chrome<00:02:18.599> piece

coolant leak again it replaces basically

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.869 
coolant leak again it replaces basically
a<00:02:45.659> one-time-use<00:02:46.349> component<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.640> original

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
a one-time-use component so the original

a one-time-use component so the original
one<00:02:48.239> that's<00:02:48.450> plastic<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.440> first<00:02:49.709> time<00:02:49.890> you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.770 
either rusty or rounded out or both and
let's<00:03:11.040> face<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.670> thing<00:03:11.909> looks<00:03:12.180> awesome

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
let's face it this thing looks awesome

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.800 
let's face it this thing looks awesome
again<00:03:13.670> powder-coated<00:03:14.670> black<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:15.030> think<00:03:15.269> now

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
again powder-coated black I think now

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.390 
again powder-coated black I think now
when<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.079> first<00:03:16.379> seen<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.739> part<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> did<00:03:17.190> have

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
when I first seen this part I did have

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.759 
when I first seen this part I did have
one<00:03:17.639> concern<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:18.660> was<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.989> heat<00:03:19.410> soak

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
one concern and that was the heat soak

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.860 
one concern and that was the heat soak
and<00:03:19.980> heat<00:03:20.220> transfer<00:03:20.519> difference<00:03:21.480> between

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
and heat transfer difference between

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.229 
and heat transfer difference between
this<00:03:22.169> component<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:22.949> it's<00:03:23.459> factory<00:03:23.940> plastic

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
this component and it's factory plastic

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.030 
this component and it's factory plastic
counterpart<00:03:25.109> now<00:03:25.500> we're<00:03:25.680> talking<00:03:25.949> about

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
counterpart now we're talking about

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.069 
counterpart now we're talking about
thermostats<00:03:26.669> and<00:03:26.879> coolant<00:03:27.150> temp<00:03:27.329> sensors<00:03:27.690> so

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
thermostats and coolant temp sensors so

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.059 
thermostats and coolant temp sensors so
we're<00:03:28.230> not<00:03:28.290> talking<00:03:28.500> about<00:03:28.680> something<00:03:28.949> that

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
we're not talking about something that

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.099 
we're not talking about something that
has<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.489> be<00:03:29.519> accurate<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.150> like<00:03:30.299> point<00:03:30.750> zero

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
has to be accurate to like point zero

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.409 
has to be accurate to like point zero
one<00:03:31.410> degree<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:32.069> just<00:03:32.549> wonder<00:03:32.819> about<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.209> heat

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
one degree I just wonder about the heat

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.479 
one degree I just wonder about the heat
soak<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.900> how<00:03:34.319> long<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.829> would<00:03:35.010> hold<00:03:35.190> heat

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
soak and how long this would hold heat

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.879 
soak and how long this would hold heat
versus<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.209> plastic<00:03:36.930> counterpart<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.739> may

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
versus the plastic counterpart it may

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.619 
versus the plastic counterpart it may
not<00:03:38.069> be<00:03:38.160> any<00:03:38.400> kind<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:38.819> issue<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.329> something

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
not be any kind of issue just something

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.180 
not be any kind of issue just something
that<00:03:39.660> popped<00:03:39.989> into<00:03:40.199> my<00:03:40.379> head<00:03:40.410> when<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> took<00:03:40.980> a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
that popped into my head when I took a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.879 
that popped into my head when I took a
look<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.609> it<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.419> that<00:03:42.660> would<00:03:42.930> not<00:03:43.139> in<00:03:43.410> any<00:03:43.650> way

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
look at it but that would not in any way

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.650 
look at it but that would not in any way
shape<00:03:43.919> or<00:03:44.280> form<00:03:44.340> stop<00:03:44.790> me<00:03:44.940> from<00:03:45.090> installing

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
shape or form stop me from installing

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.900 
shape or form stop me from installing
