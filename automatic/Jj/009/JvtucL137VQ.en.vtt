00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
they're coming up all over the bed and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
they're coming up all over the bed and
they<00:00:24.480> are<00:00:24.539> mostly<00:00:24.900> coming<00:00:25.140> up<00:00:25.380> right<00:00:25.710> around

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
they are mostly coming up right around

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.150 
they are mostly coming up right around
the<00:00:26.130> base<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.900> original<00:00:27.900> plants<00:00:28.320> not<00:00:28.890> so

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the base of the original plants not so

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.880 
the base of the original plants not so
much<00:00:29.630> away<00:00:30.630> from<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> plants<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
much away from the plants out in the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.069 
much away from the plants out in the
middle<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:33.930> are

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
middle as you can see here there are

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
middle as you can see here there are
none<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.910> even<00:00:35.910> though<00:00:36.000> there<00:00:36.149> were<00:00:36.239> some

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
none and even though there were some

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.729 
none and even though there were some
roots<00:00:36.600> spread<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> happen<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> end<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
roots spread to happen at the end of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.600 
roots spread to happen at the end of
last<00:00:37.860> summer<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.620> new<00:00:40.860> combs<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.460> not

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
last summer the the new combs are not

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.069 
last summer the the new combs are not
coming<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.059> where<00:00:42.300> those<00:00:42.450> roots<00:00:42.719> spread

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
coming up where those roots spread

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.319 
coming up where those roots spread
they're<00:00:43.260> only<00:00:43.440> coming<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:45.059> base<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
they're only coming up at the base of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.240 
they're only coming up at the base of
the<00:00:45.600> plants<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> thought<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.010> kind<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the plants so I thought that was kind of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.770 
the plants so I thought that was kind of
interesting<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.850> was<00:00:48.000> hoping<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
interesting I was hoping for some in the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.740 
interesting I was hoping for some in the
middle<00:00:49.219> this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.280> April<00:00:50.789> 10th<00:00:51.059> three<00:00:51.570> days

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
middle this is April 10th three days

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.689 
middle this is April 10th three days
later<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> combs<00:00:53.250> are<00:00:53.520> much

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
later as you can see the combs are much

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.229 
later as you can see the combs are much
larger<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.649> also<00:00:55.949> some<00:00:56.239> combs

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
larger and now there are also some combs

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
larger and now there are also some combs
coming<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.219> between<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> plans<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.910> i

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
coming up in between the plans which i

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
coming up in between the plans which i
think<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.719> cool<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.890> here

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
think is kind of cool like right here

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.119 
think is kind of cool like right here
and<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:03.019> these<00:01:04.019> weren't<00:01:04.379> coming<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:04.920> three

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and here these weren't coming up three

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
and here these weren't coming up three
days<00:01:05.280> ago<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.880> that's<00:01:06.090> pretty<00:01:06.390> neat<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.049> I'm

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
days ago so that's pretty neat that I'm

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.590 
days ago so that's pretty neat that I'm
starting<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.100> stuff<00:01:08.340> come<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
starting to see stuff come up in the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.149 
starting to see stuff come up in the
middle<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> plants<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.650> some<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> these

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
middle of the plants and some of these

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.969 
middle of the plants and some of these
are<00:01:11.220> getting<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.640> big<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.360> see

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979

are getting pretty big as you can see
here's<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.189> over<00:01:14.310> by<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> edge<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:16.909> here's

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
here's one over by the edge and here's

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.140 
here's one over by the edge and here's
another<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.330> by<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> edge<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.850> then<00:01:20.850> here's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
another one by the edge and then here's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.130 
another one by the edge and then here's
another<00:01:21.390> shot<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> entire<00:01:22.770> bamboo<00:01:23.220> grove

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.550 

okay<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.280> April<00:01:29.549> 16th<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.290> see

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.819 
okay now it's April 16th and you can see
the<00:01:31.920> combs<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.460> about<00:01:32.670> three<00:01:33.240> feet<00:01:33.630> tall<00:01:34.079> some

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the combs are about three feet tall some

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950 
the combs are about three feet tall some
a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.310> taller<00:01:35.570> some<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.810> bit

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
shorter and you can also see that there

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.710 
shorter and you can also see that there
are<00:01:39.750> combs<00:01:40.290> coming<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.220> between<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.540> main

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
are combs coming up in between the main

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.280 
are combs coming up in between the main
plants<00:01:43.380> which<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.369> pretty<00:01:44.670> cool<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.290> still

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
plants which is pretty cool it still

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.730 
plants which is pretty cool it still
looks<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> columns<00:01:47.399> coming<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:48.740> right

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
looks like the columns coming up right

looks like the columns coming up right
next<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> plants<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> strongest

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
next to the plants are the strongest

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.039 
next to the plants are the strongest
ones<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.770> tallest<00:01:53.009> ones<00:01:53.960> there<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:54.990> a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
example of one that's grown to about the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.050 
example of one that's grown to about the
height<00:02:47.739> of<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.790> original<00:02:49.000> plant<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
height of the original plant and the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.330 
height of the original plant and the
color<00:02:52.359> variation<00:02:53.109> on<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.319> stems<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.769> amazing

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
color variation on the stems is amazing

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.399

light yellow and the purple compared
with<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.500> darker<00:02:59.920> yellow<00:03:00.129> of<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.670> older

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
with the darker yellow of the older

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.530 
with the darker yellow of the older
stems<00:03:01.659> it's<00:03:02.620> really<00:03:03.040> beautiful<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.700> another

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
wind as it blows to the leaves on these

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.659 
wind as it blows to the leaves on these
plants<00:03:10.030> it's<00:03:10.209> just<00:03:10.659> a<00:03:11.370> beautiful<00:03:12.370> soothing

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.130 
so now it is June 2nd and as you can see
the<00:03:33.630> bamboo<00:03:34.260> grove<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:35.640> much<00:03:36.420> much<00:03:36.810> thicker

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
the bamboo grove is much much thicker

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.089 
the bamboo grove is much much thicker
than<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.500> was<00:03:37.650> before<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.569> a<00:03:39.739> lot<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.950> new

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
than it was before and a lot of the new

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.250 
than it was before and a lot of the new
combs<00:03:41.459> are<00:03:41.790> taller<00:03:42.209> than<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.810> original

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
combs are taller than the original

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.820 
combs are taller than the original
plants<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:44.750> not<00:03:45.750> all<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:46.020> them<00:03:46.319> grew<00:03:46.530> taller

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
plants now not all of them grew taller

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.220 
plants now not all of them grew taller
than<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.250> original<00:03:47.700> plants<00:03:48.209> which<00:03:48.660> surprised

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
than the original plants which surprised

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.410 
than the original plants which surprised
me<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.500> little<00:03:49.650> bit<00:03:49.800> but<00:03:50.520> they've<00:03:50.970> only<00:03:51.150> been<00:03:51.330> to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
me a little bit but they've only been to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.240 
me a little bit but they've only been to
the<00:03:51.540> ground<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:51.989> one<00:03:52.170> year<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.530> maybe<00:03:53.010> that's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
the ground for one year so maybe that's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.850 
the ground for one year so maybe that's
to<00:03:53.400> be<00:03:53.489> expected<00:03:54.440> but<00:03:55.440> there<00:03:55.620> are<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.830> couple

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
to be expected but there are a couple

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.220 
to be expected but there are a couple
that<00:03:56.280> did<00:03:56.489> grow<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.880> good<00:03:57.330> couple<00:03:57.690> feet<00:03:57.900> taller

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
that did grow a good couple feet taller

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.449 
that did grow a good couple feet taller
than<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.950> original<00:03:59.640> plants<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:01.160> there's<00:04:02.160> my

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
than the original plants and there's my

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.820 
than the original plants and there's my
daughter<00:04:02.730> having<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.120> little<00:04:03.300> bit<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.510> fun<00:04:03.830> in

shots of it like I said it's a lot

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.880 
shots of it like I said it's a lot
thicker<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.180> it's<00:04:12.810> already<00:04:13.260> providing<00:04:13.799> a

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
thicker and it's already providing a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.219 
thicker and it's already providing a
much<00:04:14.069> better<00:04:14.250> screen<00:04:14.870> it'll<00:04:15.870> be<00:04:15.989> really

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
much better screen it'll be really

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.219 
much better screen it'll be really
interesting<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:17.100> see<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.840> this<00:04:18.840> bamboo

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
interesting to see what this bamboo
