178 degrees the picture quality and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.229 
178 degrees the picture quality and
everything<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.030> much<00:00:57.210> better<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.600> more

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
everything is so much better for more

everything is so much better for more
and<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.420> probably<00:01:00.749> also<00:01:01.019> notice<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
and you probably also notice that the

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.670 
and you probably also notice that the
little<00:01:02.999> menu<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.629> has<00:01:03.899> been<00:01:04.170> changed<00:01:04.559> as

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
little menu here has been changed as

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.140 
little menu here has been changed as
well<00:01:04.940> now<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.210> easily<00:01:06.960> access<00:01:07.170> the

settings for wireless Bluetooth and GPS
but<00:01:13.260> what's<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.710> interesting<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.580> is

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
but what's really interesting here is

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.610 
but what's really interesting here is
now<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.450> three<00:01:15.810> different<00:01:16.200> modes<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
now you get three different modes of

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.580 
now you get three different modes of
power<00:01:17.280> users<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.300> can<00:01:18.540> choose<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:18.900> normal

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
power users you can choose the normal

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.800 
power users you can choose the normal
mode<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.310> highest<00:01:21.000> processing<00:01:21.600> power

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
mode which is highest processing power

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
mode which is highest processing power
the<00:01:22.380> best<00:01:22.650> contrast<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.700> picture<00:01:24.090> quality's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the best contrast in picture quality's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.340 
the best contrast in picture quality's
and<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.520> use<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.480> power<00:01:27.810> saving

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and you can also use the power saving

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.420 
and you can also use the power saving
mode<00:01:28.380> which<00:01:29.190> is<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.500> which<00:01:31.500> introduces<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
mode which is the which introduces the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.060 
mode which is the which introduces the
contrast<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.210> tries<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.870> reduce<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> process

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
contrast and tries to reduce the process

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.660 
contrast and tries to reduce the process
B<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.940> in<00:01:36.380> as<00:01:37.380> trade-off<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.190> gives<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
B but in as trade-off it gives you a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
B but in as trade-off it gives you a
much<00:01:39.030> longer<00:01:39.920> battery<00:01:40.920> usage<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.020> can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
much longer battery usage and you can

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.660 
much longer battery usage and you can
also<00:01:43.350> choose<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> balance<00:01:44.280> though<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
also choose the balance though which is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.560 
also choose the balance though which is
just<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.450> between<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.350> processing

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
just right in between the processing

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.020 
just right in between the processing
the<00:01:47.720> battery<00:01:48.590> life<00:01:49.240> okay<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.710> then<00:01:52.030> another

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the battery life okay and then another

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.530 
the battery life okay and then another
thing<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.690> they've<00:01:54.020> added<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.540> multi

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
thing that they've added is the multi

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.310 
thing that they've added is the multi
tasking<00:01:57.140> video<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:58.090> since<00:01:59.090> 3.1<00:01:59.870> you<00:02:00.110> can

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
tasking video so since 3.1 you can

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.800 
tasking video so since 3.1 you can
access<00:02:00.740> all<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.010> recently<00:02:01.820> open<00:02:02.150> apps<00:02:02.390> from

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
access all the recently open apps from

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.330 
access all the recently open apps from
the<00:02:03.880> multitasking<00:02:04.880> tab<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.770> what<00:02:06.770> they<00:02:06.950> added

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
the multitasking tab and what they added

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.520 
the multitasking tab and what they added
here<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:08.030> little<00:02:08.090> cross<00:02:08.840> marked<00:02:09.259> on<00:02:09.380> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
here is this little cross marked on the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.820 
here is this little cross marked on the
side<00:02:09.740> here<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:10.759> with<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:12.020> can<00:02:12.320> easily

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
side here so with that you can easily

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.040 
side here so with that you can easily
turn<00:02:13.100> off<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:14.620> open<00:02:15.620> task<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.370> then<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.870> can

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
turn off the open task and then you can

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.910 
turn off the open task and then you can
kill<00:02:18.320> them<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.740> save<00:02:19.010> your<00:02:19.670> red<00:02:22.000> ok<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.150> then

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
kill them to save your red ok and then

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.150 
kill them to save your red ok and then
let's<00:02:24.920> take<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.400> look<00:02:25.700> at<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.000> browser

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
let's take a look at the browser

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.860 
let's take a look at the browser
unfortunately<00:02:28.160> though<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.550> browser<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.330> not

unfortunately though the browser is not

unfortunately though the browser is not
that<00:02:30.410> much<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:31.100> an<00:02:31.310> improvement<00:02:31.670> from<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
that much of an improvement from the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.050 
that much of an improvement from the
tegra<00:02:32.810> two<00:02:32.989> devices<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.739> believe<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:34.910> because

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
tegra two devices I believe it's because

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.040 
tegra two devices I believe it's because
the<00:02:35.860> browser<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.130> not<00:02:37.489> really<00:02:37.940> optimized<00:02:38.870> for

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the browser is not really optimized for

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.400 
the browser is not really optimized for
a<00:02:39.260> quad-core<00:02:39.620> yet<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.459> also<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.170> browser

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
a quad-core yet and also it the browser

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.250 
a quad-core yet and also it the browser
performance<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:43.250> probably<00:02:43.630> heavily<00:02:44.630> software

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
performance is probably heavily software

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.229 
performance is probably heavily software
related<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.130> wouldn't<00:02:46.400> really<00:02:46.700> see<00:02:46.970> that

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
related so you wouldn't really see that

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.009 
related so you wouldn't really see that
big<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.810> jump<00:02:48.100> but<00:02:49.100> as<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.269> can<00:02:50.450> see<00:02:50.660> overall

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
big of a jump but as you can see overall

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.380 
big of a jump but as you can see overall
it<00:02:51.290> still<00:02:51.560> looks<00:02:51.799> pretty<00:02:51.860> smooth

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
it still looks pretty smooth

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.280 
it still looks pretty smooth
pinch-to-zoom<00:02:53.390> still<00:02:53.989> works<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:56.750> just<00:02:57.049> not

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
pinch-to-zoom still works it's just not

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.610 
pinch-to-zoom still works it's just not
as<00:02:57.970> fluid<00:02:58.970> or<00:02:59.180> as<00:02:59.360> smooth<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:00.019> would<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.470> to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
as fluid or as smooth you would like to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.789 
as fluid or as smooth you would like to
see<00:03:00.860> um<00:03:01.510> or<00:03:02.510> where<00:03:03.049> where<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.380> would<00:03:03.560> see<00:03:03.769> on

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
see um or where where you would see on

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.880 
see um or where where you would see on
the<00:03:04.130> iPad<00:03:04.519> but<00:03:05.329> with<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.049> ice<00:03:06.079> cream<00:03:06.500> sandwich

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
the iPad but with the ice cream sandwich

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.670 
the iPad but with the ice cream sandwich
coming<00:03:07.100> out<00:03:07.570> if<00:03:08.570> it's<00:03:09.019> anything<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
coming out if it's anything like the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.670 
coming out if it's anything like the
Galaxy<00:03:10.220> Nexus<00:03:10.400> browser<00:03:10.910> then<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:12.019> think<00:03:12.440> we're

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
Galaxy Nexus browser then I think we're

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.930 
Galaxy Nexus browser then I think we're
having<00:03:13.040> much<00:03:13.250> credit<00:03:13.700> browser<00:03:15.820> okay<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:17.000> then

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
having much credit browser okay and then

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.479 
having much credit browser okay and then
some<00:03:19.940> people<00:03:20.090> ask<00:03:20.390> me<00:03:20.600> about<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.489> typing

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
some people ask me about the typing

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.259 
some people ask me about the typing
experience<00:03:22.640> on<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:24.459> transformer<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.120> you

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
experience on the transformer so as you

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.770 
experience on the transformer so as you
can<00:03:26.420> see<00:03:26.690> when<00:03:26.959> typing<00:03:27.700> using<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.970> enjoy

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
can see when typing using the enjoy

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.229 
can see when typing using the enjoy
default<00:03:30.290> keyboard<00:03:30.470> there<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.430> no<00:03:31.670> lag<00:03:31.940> between

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
default keyboard there is no lag between

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.300 
default keyboard there is no lag between
the<00:03:33.170> typing<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.790> display<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.390> tax

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
the typing and the display of the tax

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.790 
the typing and the display of the tax
really<00:03:36.610> nice<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.090> what<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.750> sous<00:03:38.080> added<00:03:38.530> here

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
really nice and what a sous added here

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.970 
really nice and what a sous added here
is<00:03:38.980> they<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:40.150> hen<00:03:40.900> writing<00:03:41.319> keyboard<00:03:41.800> and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
is they have a hen writing keyboard and

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.780 
is they have a hen writing keyboard and
I<00:03:42.340> find<00:03:42.610> this<00:03:42.819> very<00:03:43.750> useful<00:03:44.739> too<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.430> there's

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
I find this very useful too so there's

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.520 
I find this very useful too so there's
many<00:03:46.060> different<00:03:46.180> mo<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.780> can<00:03:46.989> use<00:03:47.170> for<00:03:47.440> the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
many different mo you can use for the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.500 
many different mo you can use for the
typing<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:49.209> can<00:03:49.510> do<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:50.819> double<00:03:51.819> hen<00:03:52.060> writing

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
typing you can do a double hen writing

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.170 
typing you can do a double hen writing
as<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.739> simply<00:03:54.010> just<00:03:54.450> write<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:57.180> letters

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
as you can simply just write the letters

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.900 
as you can simply just write the letters
and<00:03:58.480> then<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.709> can<00:03:59.950> also<00:04:00.690> make<00:04:01.690> it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
and then you can also make it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.759 
and then you can also make it
transparent<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.780> again<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.380> can<00:04:05.620> do<00:04:05.920> p<00:04:07.769> right

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
transparent so again you can do p right

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.759 
transparent so again you can do p right
and<00:04:09.069> it's<00:04:09.670> now<00:04:09.819> limited<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.569> English<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.560> can

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
hear the speaker that well but even

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.600 
hear the speaker that well but even
though<00:06:53.660> it's<00:06:53.840> only<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.320> one<00:06:54.590> sided<00:06:54.830> speaker<00:06:55.400> the

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
though it's only a one sided speaker the

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.120 
though it's only a one sided speaker the
sound<00:06:55.880> quality<00:06:56.030> is<00:06:56.450> really<00:06:56.570> nice<00:06:57.080> and<00:06:57.680> it's

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
sound quality is really nice and it's

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.330 
sound quality is really nice and it's
pretty<00:06:58.370> it<00:06:58.700> honestly<00:06:59.120> is<00:06:59.180> quite<00:06:59.600> loud<00:06:59.840> as<00:07:00.080> well

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.830 
so I think in general you'll be really
happy<00:07:04.100> with<00:07:04.669> the<00:07:04.790> screen<00:07:05.090> and<00:07:05.270> the<00:07:05.330> speaker

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
happy with the screen and the speaker

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:15.000 
happy with the screen and the speaker
