00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.400
 hello again welcome to another video 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.840
 this 2 I bring an informative video 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.690
 first all apologize for this 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.450
 rudimentary background the truth is that I've 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.390
 tried to do with webcam but continued 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.880
 giving me the same problems is worth it 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.490
 So, until you have a webcam 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.160
 new then I will not be able to show you my face 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.890
 it's worth so good apart from this we're going 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 to really talk about what we do not care 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.340
 and esque 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 they have interviewed me tito and that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.210
 today you have uploaded to your channel you find in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 the description and if not here the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.160
 link to that interview is worth because there 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.100
 we talked about my career as 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.199
 vgc player over the years 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 we also talk about my facet 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.920
 youtuber proposal you know what part of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.870
 competitive player to youtube 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 also good really had to say what 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.070
 others or apart from youtubers today ecuador 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 competitive is good because here the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.339
 people mind pending better know me 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.229
 for my videos and you are here for my 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.510
 videos not so well we talked a little 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.940
 about more things you already know that I 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.039
 I have a lot of labia and I pass a good one 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.830
 while talking, so the interview is 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.830
 a little long and I think oyster shoots 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.390
 for if you want to enter a bit more in 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729
 detail you are not 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.460
 around here somewhere a link to that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.120
 interview is in that channel tito big 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 but with a person by the way 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.330
 I was doing a project wants 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.730
 zoom in a little more boss goes up to the people 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.070
 raising fighting by interviewing people 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.350
 important and interviewed poke Ã¡lex and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 has earrings interview people 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.040
 quite interesting so os 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.020
 I recommend that you think about it for 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.760
 to be aware of these 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.640
 interviews and not only this but their 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.280
 vgc bouts is worth so good this is 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.780
 the first part of the informative video and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.060
 I take good advantage 9 do it for a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 I take this video to talk about 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.650
 another issue and that is that the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.440
 new computer you know that I have it 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.810
 saying some months and finally I've 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.110
 managed to raise the money is worth for the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.090
 new pc so this month of this month 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.130
 surely will not happen this month and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.320
 has the new computer worth this 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.420
 week in principle I will go with lux vale 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.580
 to see fish configurations and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.400
 pieces of fish if we make a 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.110
 computer for diets or buy a 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.330
 configuration is worth it because there are stores 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.610
 where they have their settings and back 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.280
 sold already assembled so good we'll see 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.100
 what is more 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.090
 and with better quality-price I'm doing well 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.950
 because it good to note that no 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.380
 it will be a more than decent thing so 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.360
 Think well what 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.120
 what I'm looking for is a computer 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.310
 I can perform more or less quickly 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.990
 the videos because you do not have to have 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.470
 much power so I do because 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.170
 I do recorded in the 3ds that I can 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.690
 do with this game to saw down and little 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.640
 thing more so I do not need a bit of a 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.010
 pepinazo as a video that can 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.710
 reuse videos well because at last 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.600
 and after all, it's a long time 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.660
 invest and when you do it faster 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.000
 less time I lose and honest not so 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.640
 well this week in principle I've already 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.280
 agreed with the go see it to see prices 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.270
 and such and in principle when they are finished 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.030
 Christmas before the end of the year could 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.460
 buy the computer and see with the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.740
 computer sell a webcam and a 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.540
 microphone a microphone is obvious because 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.660
 if you can not record with the pc because 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.140
 I'm always recording with him 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.090
 the laptop's microphone so 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.460
 I will need a new microphone to try 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.320
 make it something decent, and the webcam 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.300
 for having a better webcam 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.620
 quality that I use because it is not 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.980
 difficult because after all I'm 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.870
 using the laptop webcam not so 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.850
 I do not think that this is all that 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.740
 get a little informed also that 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.990
 meaning that used to talk 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.640
 of this and nothing else we see in the 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.830
 next video subscribe commented 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.240

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.460
