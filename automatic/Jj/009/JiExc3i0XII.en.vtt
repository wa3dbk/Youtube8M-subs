00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.120
 How do you get 6 from the airbrush 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.990
 First is how to hold 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:32.160
 The basic way to hold the airbrush is to hold it like holding a pencil 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:36.040
 Place the middle of the first joint of the index finger on the button 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.650
 Easy to adjust the amount of paint spray 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.800
 Commonly used airbrushes are double action 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.470
 Double-action push and pull 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.530
 This is the basic behavior 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.020
 Let's put water in a trial and blow it 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:01.880
 Press the button to get air out 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.880
 Water will come out if you lower the back slowly while pressing the button 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.600
 This is a needle cap and nozzle cap 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.820
 If you remove these two, the nozzle and needle will come out 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.110
 This is dozzle and needle 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.830
 Press the button for double action 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.130
 Pull slowly 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.200
 Then the needle goes back 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:55.899
 6 from the nozzle comes out 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.899
 If you understand the mechanism of the air brush fun of airbrush will be up to many times 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.899
 Yup 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.629
 In single action, air and paint come out when you press a button 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:29.459
 Adjust the amount of paint by turning the back adjustment screw 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.459
 This is useful when you want to blow a fixed amount of paint 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.720
 Minutes 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:43.910
 Double action paint by pressing the button and pulling slowly while keeping the air out 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.070
 Adjust the amount of and spray 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.070
 You can get a fine touch 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.130
 1 minute 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:10.880
 The trigger action is the first to pop when the trigger is triggered 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.880
 Paint will come out if you keep pulling back as it is 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.060
 1 minute 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:28.569
 There are a variety of airbrush nozzle diameter sizes 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:33.629
 From 0.15 mm to 1.2 mm 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.629
 You can choose various sizes depending on the application 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.020
 Minutes 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:47.450
 Some airbrushes have different sizes of paint cups 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:52.610
 As the nozzle diameter increases, the amount of paint used also increases. 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.610
 Size according to the amount used 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.610
 Hmm 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:03.300
 Beauty 4 is very lightweight compared to brass made of aluminum airbrush g 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.930
 it was done 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:11.209
 Minutes 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:16.239
 The needle adjuster can reduce the width of the push button 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.239
 It is a screw that can reduce the amount of paint coming out 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.510
 Hmm 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:41.420
 The piston type compresses and stabilizes air by the oscillating motion of the piston like an automobile engine 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.420
 Air supply can be done 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.990
 Hmm 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:07.139
 Since the linear type does not generate Kudo noise from its advanced structure using electromagnetic force, it can be used at night 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:07.139
 You can use it without worrying about it 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.910
 Hmm 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:20.030
 At first please connect the hose to the compressor 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.139
 All the hose joints are the same, so don't worry 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.120
 Please install 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.770
 Next to the regulator 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:35.370
 Please attach it on the left side towards the regulator 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:40.600
 And attach the hose connected to the airbrush on the right side 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:44.140
 Finally I connected the airbrush and finished 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:49.350
 Regulator mounts airbrush holder 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.350
 Please set it a little further away with the balloon
