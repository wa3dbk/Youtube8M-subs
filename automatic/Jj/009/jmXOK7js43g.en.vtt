00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello dear students 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.710
 this is an extra lesson 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 for those who are engaged in video course 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.180
 playing the guitar if you don't practice 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.760
 video course and if our lesson you will be 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.450
 interesting then welcome today we 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.599
 we will analyze 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.270
 fanfare this will look spectacular on 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.970
 some kind of celebration or when making a cake 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.220
 or when part of a birthday 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.560
 circumstances you will see and for us it 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.820
 very familiar to the ear will 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.820
 very original look here 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
 listen to 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.710
 then pause and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.590
 all or it may be a ceremony 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 awards must be honored 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.430
 somewhere to flash 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.530
 for those who are used to chord 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.540
 c you can put someone else there to put 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.930
 a full chord can be put 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.450
 incomplete chord c we know that incomplete 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.980
 on for busting full chord for fight 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.980
 c and went get 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 54 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:50.290
 down down down down down down 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.420
 up it is necessary to work separately from 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.420
 before you play the chord if 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:03.520
 you better start getting arm 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:12.730
 I am free to memorize it separately 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:15.310
 Perhaps the most difficult will be 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.410
 sweepingly we can do when we do 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.900
 individual touches and when we / do 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.220
 itâ€™s better to do it here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.220
 strings now 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.930
 on the same chord it would be desirable as 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:42.430
 applying 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.430
 second string and get 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.000
 Well 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.270
 goes further 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:59.380
 same prices same prices 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.130
 so what is the importance here see what 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.130
 strings work 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.360
 then comes this 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.550
 so when we put the same to us 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.150
 It is desirable to take this string to highlight more 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.150
 so 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.840
 i.e. not so shares and if you can 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.650
 play barre 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.650
 when 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:49.930
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:49.930
 ta ta izzz you can also 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.970
 So 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.730
 you can play any chord try 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.730
 still open for example i can will be so 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:26.130
 exercise at the same time on the subject of stretching 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.810
 so here's a pen pull here in this 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.810
 the case of a finger we go beyond the neck 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:39.039
 5 and the fourth went here the same as 

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:43.959
 h7 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:54.260
 and 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:54.260
 Here it is possible to sound 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.830
 if you want it here once again pull 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:14.539
 here on the chord I can work two from 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:17.180
 stretch marks and this is very useful all one and 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.720
 the same time we learn something for us 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.729
 interesting and not our fingers exercise 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.970
 not just sitting at idle and doing 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.360
 and we do it already inside our 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:34.030
 works so what cord can still be 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.030
 even to fail g6 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.410
 if it is difficult for you to learn / and play 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.610
 fractions or laziness then you can do more 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.860
 it's easier to just hit the guitar 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.190
 strings and at this time your company 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.590
 will be 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.660
 this fraction to hum for this need 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.420
 choose a convenient chord to convenient 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:09.720
 canalian for your voice I would for myself 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.720
 I chose if I sang in a voice 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.320
 this is the easiest option 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.210
 dear students 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.760
 and in front you will find a lot of interesting things I 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.090
 I will continue to cook some 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.040
 analyzes any useful advice if you 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.470
 not my student on you also interesting under 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.330
 video there is a link to the site 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.800
 sign up for a free course there 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.780

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.210
 information and will also receive 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.770
 extra stuff with you was 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.770
 Victoria Yudina all the best
