foam<00:00:22.199> cushions<00:00:22.710> there's<00:00:23.400> two<00:00:23.640> reasons<00:00:23.970> why

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
foam cushions there's two reasons why

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.939 
foam cushions there's two reasons why
you<00:00:24.150> want<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.630> replace<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.990> foam<00:00:25.410> cushion<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
you want to replace the foam cushion the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.070 
you want to replace the foam cushion the
first<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> foam<00:00:27.630> cushion<00:00:27.990> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
first one is that the foam cushion is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960 
first one is that the foam cushion is
gonna<00:00:28.230> lose<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.680> density<00:00:29.160> from<00:00:29.340> sliding<00:00:29.699> in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
gonna lose the density from sliding in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.009 
gonna lose the density from sliding in
and<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> vehicle

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and out of the vehicle

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
and out of the vehicle
the<00:00:31.320> constant<00:00:31.830> weight<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.189> sliding<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.700> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the constant weight of sliding in and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760 
the constant weight of sliding in and
out<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> gonna<00:00:33.239> crush<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.840> left<00:00:34.170> side<00:00:34.410> or

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
out is gonna crush that left side or

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.470 
out is gonna crush that left side or
right<00:00:35.130> side<00:00:35.190> depending<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> driver<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
right side depending on a driver and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
right side depending on a driver and
passenger<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.620> gonna<00:00:37.739> make<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:37.950> really

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
passenger and it's gonna make it really

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.790 
passenger and it's gonna make it really
weak<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.570> makes<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.110> weak<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
weak when it makes it really weak the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
weak when it makes it really weak the
leather<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.520> cloth<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:42.180> gonna<00:00:42.360> wear<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> lot

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
leather or cloth is gonna wear out a lot

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.810 
leather or cloth is gonna wear out a lot
quicker<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.920> usually<00:00:44.160> creates<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
quicker because it usually creates a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.910 
quicker because it usually creates a
crease<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> leather<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.350> cloth<00:00:46.379> can

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
crease and so the leather or cloth can

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.510 
crease and so the leather or cloth can
fold<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.370> top<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.789> itself<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.420> rip<00:00:49.020> open

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
fold on top of itself and rip open

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.619 
fold on top of itself and rip open
Brian's<00:00:50.520> gonna<00:00:50.700> show<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> little

demonstration here about an old foam
cushion<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> density's<00:00:54.960> worn<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
cushion that the density's worn out and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
cushion that the density's worn out and
then<00:00:55.800> also<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> new<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
then also as well as a new one this

here the when the leather cover was on

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.710 
here the when the leather cover was on
it<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.670> wasn't<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> cover<00:01:09.270> wouldn't<00:01:09.570> ripped

up or anything and everything looked
fine<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.540> it's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
fine on it but it's you can see it's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.170 
fine on it but it's you can see it's
really<00:01:13.080> thin<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.070> real<00:01:14.400> soft<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.060> has

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
really thin it's it's real soft it has

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.789 
really thin it's it's real soft it has
no<00:01:15.360> density<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:15.840> support<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> leather

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
no density or support for the leather

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
no density or support for the leather
you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> Dewalt<00:01:18.479> battery<00:01:18.840> he<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.470> just

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you can get a Dewalt battery he can just

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.190 
you can get a Dewalt battery he can just
sit<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.400> sits<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> crease<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
sit just sits down the crease there I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.780 
sit just sits down the crease there I
mean<00:01:22.380> there's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> big<00:01:22.770> hole<00:01:23.009> dug<00:01:23.640> up

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
mean there's a big hole dug up

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.210 
mean there's a big hole dug up
underneath<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.780> underneath<00:01:25.110> side<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.740> frame

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
underneath the underneath side the frame

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
underneath the underneath side the frame
will<00:01:26.400> cut<00:01:26.580> into<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> foam<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.360> under<00:01:27.900> here

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
will cut into the foam to under here

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.370 
will cut into the foam to under here
you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> big<00:01:30.020> cuts<00:01:31.020> into<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you can see how the big cuts into the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.120 
you can see how the big cuts into the
foam<00:01:31.650> there

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
foam there

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859 
foam there
so<00:01:32.490> where's<00:01:32.850> from<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> bottom<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> top

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so where's from the bottom and the top

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.480 
so where's from the bottom and the top
so<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.380> only<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> friction<00:01:35.040> from<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> top

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
so not only the friction from the top

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
so not only the friction from the top
when<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.150> slide<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.509> truck

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
when you when you slide out the truck

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.870 
when you when you slide out the truck
from<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> bottom<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> also<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> frame

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
from the bottom it also on the frame

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
from the bottom it also on the frame
also<00:01:39.210> starts<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> tearing<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> foam<00:01:40.500> also

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
also starts to tearing up the foam also

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.850 
also starts to tearing up the foam also
so<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> makes<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> big<00:01:43.470> difference<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
so this is makes a big difference you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.859 
so this is makes a big difference you
can<00:01:44.040> see<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> new<00:01:44.549> foam<00:01:44.790> being<00:01:45.030> set<00:01:45.270> bad

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
can see with a new foam being set bad

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
can see with a new foam being set bad
right<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.200> top<00:01:46.560> doesn't<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.490> anything<00:01:47.820> it's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
right on top doesn't do anything it's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.819 
right on top doesn't do anything it's
just<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.450> sits<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.899> firm<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.380> thing<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.680> just

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
just it sits up firm this thing is just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it sags and in the middle of it you can

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
it sags and in the middle of it you can
see<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.799> even<00:01:52.890> sits<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> end<00:01:53.640> it'll<00:01:54.180> sit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
see it even sits on the end it'll sit

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.389 
see it even sits on the end it'll sit
sideways<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> crease<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.250> just

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
sideways in the crease there it's just

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.450 
sideways in the crease there it's just
it's<00:01:56.640> real<00:01:56.939> real<00:01:57.180> soft<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.460> without

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
it's real real soft and so without

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.969 
it's real real soft and so without
replacing<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:01.020> covers<00:02:01.380> gonna<00:02:01.469> wear<00:02:01.770> out

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
replacing it your covers gonna wear out

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.490 
replacing it your covers gonna wear out
if<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:02.430> haven't<00:02:02.610> already<00:02:02.759> worn<00:02:03.149> out<00:02:03.500> when

of a Chevy work van Brian's gonna grab

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.380 
of a Chevy work van Brian's gonna grab
one<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.690> older<00:02:18.959> ones<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.240> an

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
one of the older ones and this is an

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.570 
one of the older ones and this is an
obvious<00:02:21.540> reason<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.319> on<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.920> particular<00:02:23.430> one

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
obvious reason to on this particular one

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.420 
obvious reason to on this particular one
the<00:02:23.760> cover<00:02:24.030> was<00:02:24.270> blown<00:02:24.480> wide<00:02:24.990> open<00:02:25.190> you'll<00:02:26.190> see

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the cover was blown wide open you'll see

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.190 
the cover was blown wide open you'll see
this<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.819> there's<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.030> metal<00:02:27.420> frame<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.930> runs

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
this and there's a metal frame that runs

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.310 
this and there's a metal frame that runs
right<00:02:29.130> down<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.520> side<00:02:29.850> here<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.170> that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
right down this side here and so that

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.140 
right down this side here and so that
metal<00:02:31.590> frame<00:02:31.800> literally<00:02:32.310> there's<00:02:32.490> no<00:02:32.730> density

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
metal frame literally there's no density

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.630 
metal frame literally there's no density
here<00:02:33.630> as<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:34.230> as<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.500> flaps<00:02:34.830> wide<00:02:35.070> open<00:02:35.459> so

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
here as well as this flaps wide open so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.880 
here as well as this flaps wide open so
you're<00:02:35.790> gonna<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.330> metal<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.740> you're

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
you're gonna have that metal that you're

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.979 
you're gonna have that metal that you're
sitting<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.840> you're

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
sitting on right there so you're

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.420 
sitting on right there so you're
definitely<00:02:40.230> gonna<00:02:40.530> want<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.860> replace<00:02:41.160> one

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
definitely gonna want to replace one

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.580 
definitely gonna want to replace one

here's<00:03:16.680> another<00:03:16.860> instance<00:03:17.820> there's<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.239> couple

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
here's another instance there's a couple

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.960 
here's another instance there's a couple
different<00:03:18.630> frame<00:03:19.079> designs<00:03:19.500> where<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.579> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
different frame designs where the the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.060 
different frame designs where the the
spring<00:03:21.299> assembly<00:03:21.690> underneath<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.260> foam<00:03:22.769> sits

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
spring assembly underneath the foam sits

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.340 
spring assembly underneath the foam sits
on<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.400> frame<00:03:23.670> will<00:03:23.940> cut<00:03:24.239> into<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> foam<00:03:25.019> and

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
on the frame will cut into the foam and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.530 
on the frame will cut into the foam and
you<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.100> see<00:03:26.280> here<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.120> see<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.450> little

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
you can see here you can see the little

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.350 
you can see here you can see the little
design<00:03:27.900> here<00:03:27.930> there's<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> frame<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
design here there's for the frame the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.199 
design here there's for the frame the
springs<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:31.170> cut<00:03:31.530> into<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.010> foam<00:03:32.250> all<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
springs just cut into the foam all the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.340 
springs just cut into the foam all the
way<00:03:33.329> down<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.110> stick<00:03:34.320> your

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
way down it so you can stick your

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.350 
way down it so you can stick your
fingers<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.220> inch<00:03:35.579> into<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.880> end<00:03:36.239> of

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
fingers you know inch into the end of

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.180 
fingers you know inch into the end of
the<00:03:36.420> cover<00:03:36.630> all<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.049> way<00:03:37.140> around<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.070> you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
the cover all the way around and so you

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.890 
the cover all the way around and so you
just<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.700> funk<00:03:39.000> just<00:03:39.239> keeps<00:03:39.450> sitting<00:03:39.690> lower

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
just the funk just keeps sitting lower

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.420 
just the funk just keeps sitting lower
and<00:03:40.079> lower<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.410> lower<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.739> frame<00:03:41.040> and

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
and lower and lower in the frame and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.729 
and lower and lower in the frame and
it's<00:03:41.970> just<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.390> no<00:03:42.870> good<00:03:43.110> it's<00:03:43.350> it's<00:03:43.590> gonna

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
it's just it's no good it's it's gonna

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.140 
it's just it's no good it's it's gonna
eventually<00:03:44.250> it'll<00:03:44.610> come<00:03:44.790> all<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.060> way

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
eventually it'll come all the way

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.210 
eventually it'll come all the way
through<00:03:45.420> also<00:03:45.900> what<00:03:46.620> part<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> frame

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
through also what part of the frame

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.250 
through also what part of the frame
slides<00:03:47.549> here<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.030> here<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.570> side<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.049> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
slides here and here this side just it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.890 
slides here and here this side just it
rips<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:50.340> cuts<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.670> right<00:03:50.850> through<00:03:51.150> so

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
rips it just cuts it right through so

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.690 
rips it just cuts it right through so
you're<00:03:52.079> gonna<00:03:52.200> lose<00:03:52.410> all<00:03:52.590> support<00:03:53.040> there<00:03:53.280> it's

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
you're gonna lose all support there it's

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.550 
you're gonna lose all support there it's
just<00:03:53.790> gonna<00:03:53.970> tear<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.390> foam<00:03:54.630> up<00:03:54.840> because<00:03:55.410> now

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
just gonna tear the foam up because now

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.690 
just gonna tear the foam up because now
you're<00:03:55.709> just<00:03:55.799> riding<00:03:56.100> down<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> metal<00:03:56.519> and

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
you're just riding down on the metal and

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.340 
you're just riding down on the metal and
the<00:03:56.790> metals<00:03:57.150> cutting<00:03:57.450> up<00:03:57.540> into<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.959> end<00:03:58.230> of

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
the metals cutting up into the end of

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.680 
the metals cutting up into the end of
the<00:03:58.410> cushion<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.549> we've<00:03:59.910> we've<00:04:00.209> designed<00:04:00.540> the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
the cushion so we've we've designed the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.630 
the cushion so we've we've designed the
replacements<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.350> have<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.560> fiber<00:04:02.010> backing

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
replacements that have a fiber backing

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.030 
replacements that have a fiber backing
so<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.630> spring<00:04:03.930> assembly<00:04:04.350> can't<00:04:04.620> cut<00:04:04.920> up

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
so that the spring assembly can't cut up

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.979 
so that the spring assembly can't cut up
cut<00:04:05.700> through<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> new<00:04:06.299> foam<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:06.780> when<00:04:06.900> you

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
cut through the new foam so when you

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.479 
cut through the new foam so when you
take<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.350> time<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.560> act<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:07.950> spend<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.340> money

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
take the time to act and spend the money

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.880 
take the time to act and spend the money
to<00:04:08.610> go<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.760> replace<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.299> foam<00:04:09.799> you're<00:04:10.799> not

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
to go and replace the foam you're not

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.289 
to go and replace the foam you're not
gonna<00:04:11.010> be<00:04:11.190> back<00:04:11.370> in<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.579> same<00:04:11.760> place<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
gonna be back in the same place like the

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.580 
gonna be back in the same place like the
factory<00:04:12.690> foam<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.109> kind<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.470> the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.990 
factory foam that's kind of just the
springs<00:04:14.190> are<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.430> gonna<00:04:14.519> cut<00:04:14.760> right<00:04:14.790> it

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
springs are just gonna cut right it
