00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:18.800
 hello back explaining now common 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:21.380
 Dismounting the cover for us to have 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.830
 logical board access to the board that I 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.810
 I need to be able to reset you 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.660
 need a philips key and a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.970
 screwdriver find children for 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.440
 removal of the screwdriver screws 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:40.760
 just for us to clear the roads 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.199
 so let's go here from the side 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.140
 to where you connect the USB cable is the part 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.129
 that we are going to remove is the side that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.879
 board 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.010
 So let's get out of this side is 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.540
 first we will get to this 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.540
 screw the philips wrench 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.600
 after removal of these screws the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.800
 remainder is simple, just take the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.790
 latches 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.400
 We're pulling out the latches. 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.860
 please note that we will have to take two 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.020
 initially one lock is 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.630
 approximately that other 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.020
 approximately here 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.820
 well, I'll just put the key 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.830
 slit and press 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.229
 see how easy it is I'll hold or come 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.080
 here put the screwdriver to push 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 for the tooth and gives a slight twist as well 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.619
 simple 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.789
 the two locks of everything I'm going to continue 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.850
 holding fashion candles that I will have 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.710
 who put the work again now in two 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.450
 locks I want to show you 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:02.259
 here it is here under the equipment 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 With the same finger, I can take it off. 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.960
 pulling that lock and already leave javi 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.380
 enough printer 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.760
 in this second lock that if I force a 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.850
 little else she already releases other 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.130
 two locks you have here 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.019
 so you have the option of forcing a 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.049
 little more to open or you can 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:33.790
 You can only stand here and I came with the 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:37.180
 screwdriver and lateral force here is 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.470
 easier to pull stronger than already released 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.310
 the latches 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.380
 so I 'm going to just need to finish 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.769
 pull and I already took the tam 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.760
 then these locks have nothing to do with 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.500
 complicated 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.780
 It's just you take the bottom off the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.239
 locks underneath and then comes with 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.670
 key is to note that the 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.130
 which has 33 latches 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.410
 is locked then you will press 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.370
 that she will return, but if she does 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:16.790
 How did I do it has no secret? 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:20.310
 it is enough to take the first two 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.650
 raising printer here below with 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.530
 a little strength that is a bit of 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.280
 force that you will be able to 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.170
 locks that is the board you do not need 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.319
 disassemble the entire printer to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.060
 access to the license plate is already here 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.480
 This is what I need to be able to try. 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.450
 receive tam and equipment 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.440
 so here we have several flashes and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.410
 cables 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.140
 everyone will have to be removed 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.600
 I already created a video of how to mount the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.510
 new plate how to return the plate to 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.180
 printer is very simple 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:05.220
 now we will remove the flex is just 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:07.590
 pull only pull all tones do not need 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.739
 worrying about the montage because I did 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.650
 a video explaining and you will see that 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.140
 one flat does not fit into another's place 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.430
 So it's pretty easy today without any 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.940
 Work fits in somewhere in 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.690
 other only pull a tea the cables or wires 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.840
 cars all cars 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.039
 ready I pulled the cables now I can remove 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.560
 the screws are four screws or 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.729
 start here 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.559
 by the bottom graphics 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.099
 four bolts people will die 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.099
 quickly 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:54.039
 today I took the second 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:14.980
 the have yourself in my room 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:29.100
 see that the plate continued to fix it 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.640
 remained fixed because she is arrested here 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.040
 inside the usb support 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:41.400
 so it 's very simple just pull the board 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:46.290
 behind it will come loose 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:51.420
 I carefully do not always have a block 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:55.440
 rock behind 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:58.650
 ready we already removed the plate is this plate 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:04.920
 that I need you to send me to 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:06.180
 power representing note that we are joining 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.310
 five screws 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.130
 these four little sling screws 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.430
 board is on the outside of the 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.220
 very simple printer is the suggestion 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.850
 What I give to you is packing the 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.060
 plate is you take a sheet a4 and 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:30.150
 wrap the plate with this sheet of paper 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:32.310
 normal to 4 and I will fly half shin and go 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.169
 in a packing house buy a meter 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.840
 bubble wrap that's pretty cheap I guess 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.740
 which is a real 2 reais and pass one 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.229
 plastic bubble to protect the plate 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:47.250
 wrap it with bubble wrap and 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:49.140
 send it to us it's doing it 's people it 's 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.740
 for now only this 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.740
 thank you
