00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.729 

well<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:32.109> was<00:00:32.259> fun

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
well that was fun

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.860 
well that was fun
so<00:00:33.309> how<00:00:33.399> is<00:00:33.550> our<00:00:33.670> work<00:00:33.850> now<00:00:34.480> is<00:00:34.690> actually

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
so how is our work now is actually

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.049 
so how is our work now is actually
pretty<00:00:35.140> simple<00:00:35.499> this<00:00:35.920> is<00:00:36.219> all<00:00:36.489> there<00:00:36.609> is<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.760> it

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
pretty simple this is all there is to it

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.579 
pretty simple this is all there is to it
I<00:00:37.390> know<00:00:37.780> there's<00:00:38.019> a<00:00:38.050> lot<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.199> command<00:00:38.440> blocks

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
I know there's a lot of command blocks

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.349 
I know there's a lot of command blocks
here<00:00:38.769> but<00:00:38.979> a<00:00:39.010> lot<00:00:39.159> of<00:00:39.219> it<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.399> just<00:00:39.429> repetition

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
here but a lot of it is just repetition

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.270 
here but a lot of it is just repetition
so<00:00:40.989> here<00:00:41.260> is<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.469> first<00:00:41.620> part<00:00:41.920> this<00:00:42.039> is<00:00:42.100> the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
so here is the first part this is the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.750 
so here is the first part this is the
boring<00:00:42.609> pot<00:00:42.850> so<00:00:43.769> basically<00:00:44.769> all<00:00:44.889> this<00:00:45.219> top

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
boring pot so basically all this top

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.239 
boring pot so basically all this top
layer<00:00:45.999> does<00:00:46.239> is<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:47.319> puts<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.739> into<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.069> mode

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
layer does is it puts you into a mode

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.689 
layer does is it puts you into a mode
called<00:00:48.609> star<00:00:48.909> mode<00:00:49.120> for<00:00:49.690> 30<00:00:49.870> seconds<00:00:50.499> so<00:00:50.699> when

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
called star mode for 30 seconds so when

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.700 
called star mode for 30 seconds so when
it<00:00:51.850> detects<00:00:52.179> you<00:00:52.329> have<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.479> nether<00:00:52.690> star<00:00:52.780> it

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
it detects you have a nether star it

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.439 
it detects you have a nether star it
will<00:00:53.949> clear<00:00:54.219> that<00:00:54.370> it's<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.819> put<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.210> into

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
will clear that it's and put you into

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.719 
will clear that it's and put you into
star<00:00:55.989> mode<00:00:56.139> and<00:00:56.440> there<00:00:57.039> are<00:00:57.129> some<00:00:57.249> times<00:00:57.460> and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
star mode and there are some times and

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.189 
star mode and there are some times and
stuff<00:00:57.879> but<00:00:58.120> that's<00:00:58.629> boring

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
stuff but that's boring

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.770 
stuff but that's boring
next<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.309> colorful<00:01:00.850> display<00:01:01.179> transition

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
next the colorful display transition

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.289 
next the colorful display transition
thingamabob<00:01:02.649> so<00:01:03.519> you<00:01:03.579> can<00:01:03.940> probably<00:01:04.059> guess

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
thingamabob so you can probably guess

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.789 
thingamabob so you can probably guess
how<00:01:04.329> this<00:01:04.570> works<00:01:04.750> but<00:01:05.140> you're<00:01:05.500> probably<00:01:05.680> a

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
how this works but you're probably a

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.969 
how this works but you're probably a
little<00:01:05.860> bit<00:01:06.189> wrong<00:01:06.310> just<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.850> little<00:01:07.060> bit<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.320> in

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
little bit wrong just a little bit so in

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.209 
little bit wrong just a little bit so in
this<00:01:09.219> command<00:01:09.460> block<00:01:09.640> we<00:01:10.270> have<00:01:10.920> execute<00:01:11.920> at<00:01:12.189> a

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
this command block we have execute at a

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:14.370 
this command block we have execute at a
player<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.909> star<00:01:13.240> made<00:01:13.390> one<00:01:13.659> so<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.200> have<00:01:14.289> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
player in star made one so you have to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.800 
player in star made one so you have to
be<00:01:14.469> in<00:01:14.530> star<00:01:14.740> mode<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.219> do<00:01:15.280> anything<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.880> we

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
be in star mode is to do anything and we

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.359 
be in star mode is to do anything and we
are<00:01:16.930> summoning<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.380> skeleton<00:01:17.740> so<00:01:18.159> this

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
are summoning a skeleton so this

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.340 
are summoning a skeleton so this
skeleton<00:01:18.759> has<00:01:18.939> some<00:01:19.329> armor<00:01:19.630> on<00:01:19.750> in<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.170> case

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
skeleton has some armor on in this case

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.319 
skeleton has some armor on in this case
he<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.770> red<00:01:21.399> armor<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:22.780> is<00:01:22.899> just<00:01:23.130> repeated

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
he is red armor so this is just repeated

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.830 
he is red armor so this is just repeated
ten<00:01:25.329> times<00:01:25.539> for<00:01:25.960> ten<00:01:26.140> different<00:01:26.439> colors<00:01:26.649> now

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
ten times for ten different colors now

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.080 
ten times for ten different colors now
you'll<00:01:28.840> notice<00:01:29.049> that<00:01:29.460> we're<00:01:30.460> using<00:01:30.640> summon

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
you'll notice that we're using summon

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.660 
you'll notice that we're using summon
here<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:32.109> not<00:01:32.350> teleport<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.399> we're<00:01:33.520> using

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
here and not teleport and we're using

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.490 
here and not teleport and we're using
summon<00:01:34.119> for<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> special<00:01:35.079> reason

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
summon for a special reason

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.389 
summon for a special reason
so<00:01:36.250> basically<00:01:36.899> if<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:39.509> use<00:01:40.509> teleport<00:01:41.399> it's

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
so basically if you use teleport it's

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.130 
so basically if you use teleport it's
too<00:01:42.609> slow<00:01:42.820> okay<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:43.659> we're<00:01:43.929> not<00:01:44.079> using

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
too slow okay so we're not using

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.569 
too slow okay so we're not using
teleport<00:01:44.679> here<00:01:44.770> because<00:01:45.039> it<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.159> too<00:01:45.399> slow

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
teleport here because it is too slow

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.010 
teleport here because it is too slow
I'll<00:01:45.759> try<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.179> give<00:01:46.359> you<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.450> demonstration<00:01:46.630> of

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
I'll try to give you a demonstration of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.819 
I'll try to give you a demonstration of
things<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.310> if<00:01:48.579> I<00:01:48.729> go<00:01:48.880> into<00:01:49.060> five<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.320> summon

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
things so if I go into five and I summon

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.219 
things so if I go into five and I summon
a<00:01:50.920> skeleton<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:51.820> okay<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:52.929> I<00:01:53.049> come<00:01:53.200> over

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
a skeleton here okay and I come over

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:53.669 
a skeleton here okay and I come over
here

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
here

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.160 
here
and<00:01:55.859> you'll<00:01:56.859> see<00:01:57.069> that<00:01:57.189> there<00:01:57.369> is<00:01:58.049> even<00:01:59.049> though

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
and you'll see that there is even though

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.389 
and you'll see that there is even though
very<00:01:59.499> fast<00:01:59.920> there<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:01.829> very<00:02:02.829> short<00:02:03.159> period

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
very fast there is a very short period

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.160 
very fast there is a very short period
where<00:02:03.759> he<00:02:03.789> actually<00:02:04.179> travels<00:02:04.569> from<00:02:04.780> his<00:02:04.929> spot

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
where he actually travels from his spot

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.660 
where he actually travels from his spot
to<00:02:05.200> me<00:02:05.530> it's<00:02:06.249> not<00:02:06.369> instant<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.340> problem

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
to me it's not instant and the problem

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.580 
to me it's not instant and the problem
there<00:02:09.820> is<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.450> because<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.990> transition

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
there is is that because the transition

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.470 
there is is that because the transition
from<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.460> know<00:02:12.550> red<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.910> orange<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.270> yellow<00:02:13.330> to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
from you know red to orange to yellow to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.780 
from you know red to orange to yellow to
green

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
green

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.690 
green
cetera<00:02:14.150> has<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.659> be<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:14.870> fast<00:02:15.140> by<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.069> time<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
cetera has to be so fast by the time the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.849 
cetera has to be so fast by the time the
skeleton<00:02:17.120> has<00:02:17.239> arrived<00:02:17.569> at<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.620> already

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
skeleton has arrived at you it's already

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:19.330 
skeleton has arrived at you it's already
too<00:02:19.099> late

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
too late

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.080 
too late
so<00:02:20.469> teleporting<00:02:21.469> isn't<00:02:21.950> fast<00:02:22.280> enough<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.939> I

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so teleporting isn't fast enough and I

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.699 
so teleporting isn't fast enough and I
try<00:02:23.299> to<00:02:23.329> kind<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.959> give<00:02:24.109> a<00:02:24.140> demonstration<00:02:24.349> of

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
try to kind of give a demonstration of

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.080 
try to kind of give a demonstration of
this<00:02:25.450> with<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.629> actual<00:02:26.870> system<00:02:27.439> place<00:02:27.650> so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.280 
this with the actual system place so
this<00:02:29.090> phone<00:02:29.560> should<00:02:30.560> work<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:31.989> wait<00:02:32.989> now<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.170> know

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
this phone should work I wait now I know

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.380 
this phone should work I wait now I know
it's<00:02:33.439> damaged<00:02:33.739> let's<00:02:33.980> get<00:02:34.159> started<00:02:34.519> okay<00:02:35.329> so

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
it's damaged let's get started okay so

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.630 
it's damaged let's get started okay so
as<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.870> can<00:02:35.989> see<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:37.280> one's<00:02:37.489> actually

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
as you can see this one's actually

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.289 
as you can see this one's actually
working<00:02:38.799> but<00:02:39.799> if<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.040> was<00:02:40.220> teleporting<00:02:40.819> then

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
working but if this was teleporting then

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.629 
working but if this was teleporting then
the<00:02:42.139> transition<00:02:42.650> would<00:02:42.799> look<00:02:42.980> very<00:02:43.280> strange

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
the transition would look very strange

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.610 
the transition would look very strange
because<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.450> would<00:02:44.569> be<00:02:44.689> too<00:02:44.719> slow<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.500> it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
because it would be too slow and it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.339 
because it would be too slow and it
would<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.639> wouldn't<00:02:46.819> look<00:02:46.970> right

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
would just it wouldn't look right

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.869 
would just it wouldn't look right
finally<00:02:48.349> first<00:02:48.620> song<00:02:48.829> we<00:02:49.129> are<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:49.700> using

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
finally first song we are just using

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.720 
finally first song we are just using
command<00:02:50.239> blocks<00:02:50.450> not<00:02:50.689> no<00:02:50.840> blocks<00:02:51.109> and<00:02:51.730> yeah

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
command blocks not no blocks and yeah

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.839 
command blocks not no blocks and yeah
it's<00:02:52.909> just<00:02:53.060> based<00:02:53.239> off<00:02:53.450> one<00:02:54.409> of<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.980> many<00:02:55.489> many

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
it's just based off one of the many many

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.479 
it's just based off one of the many many
many<00:02:55.970> star<00:02:56.840> themes<00:02:57.139> from<00:02:57.980> mario<00:02:58.280> games

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
