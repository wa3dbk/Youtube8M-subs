iPhone 5c just to kind of see what it

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.440 
iPhone 5c just to kind of see what it
was<00:02:01.009> gonna<00:02:01.219> do<00:02:01.490> with<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.820> front<00:02:02.060> camera<00:02:02.360> as

was gonna do with the front camera as

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.730 
was gonna do with the front camera as
well<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.869> first<00:02:05.899> lens<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.350> started<00:02:06.619> playing

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
well so the first lens I started playing

well so the first lens I started playing
with<00:02:06.979> was<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.399> macro<00:02:07.909> as<00:02:08.030> soon<00:02:08.209> as<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.509> the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
with was the macro as soon as I got the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.350 
with was the macro as soon as I got the
stickies<00:02:09.080> on<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.530> went<00:02:09.890> right<00:02:10.250> for<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.789> lens<00:02:11.090> I

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
stickies on I went right for that lens I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.150 
stickies on I went right for that lens I
just<00:02:11.900> picked<00:02:12.080> up<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.380> about<00:02:12.620> anything<00:02:12.920> I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
just picked up just about anything I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.979 
just picked up just about anything I
could<00:02:13.190> find<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.700> kind<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.300> test<00:02:14.599> this<00:02:14.780> thing

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
could find to kind of test this thing

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.949 
could find to kind of test this thing
out<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.410> it's<00:02:15.980> pretty<00:02:16.220> amazing<00:02:16.489> at<00:02:16.910> how<00:02:17.450> much

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
out and it's pretty amazing at how much

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.500 
out and it's pretty amazing at how much
that<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:19.400> little<00:02:19.730> lens<00:02:19.970> could<00:02:20.360> actually

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that this little lens could actually

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.589 
that this little lens could actually
produce<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:21.290> mean<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.590> detail<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.580> some<00:02:23.510> of

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
produce I mean the detail on some of

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.150 
produce I mean the detail on some of
these<00:02:23.690> very<00:02:23.810> very<00:02:24.230> small<00:02:24.530> objects<00:02:25.010> just

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
these very very small objects just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.949 
these very very small objects just
really<00:02:25.730> shone<00:02:26.030> through<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.360> mean<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.810> see

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
really shone through I mean you can see

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.070 
really shone through I mean you can see
for<00:02:27.140> yourself<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:28.610> really<00:02:29.569> did<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> good

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
for yourself that it really did a good

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.530 
for yourself that it really did a good
job<00:02:30.349> as<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.650> macro<00:02:31.160> lens<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.880> it's<00:02:32.060> right<00:02:32.299> there

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
job as a macro lens and it's right there

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.940 
job as a macro lens and it's right there
in<00:02:32.810> your<00:02:32.930> pocket<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.560> was<00:02:33.739> friggin<00:02:34.190> amazing

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.110 

but<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:39.980> still<00:02:40.220> don't<00:02:40.400> think<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.640> this

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
but I still don't think it's this

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.930 
but I still don't think it's this
amazing<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:41.959> crazy<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.280> my<00:02:43.489> actual

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
amazing this is crazy that is my actual

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.259 
amazing this is crazy that is my actual
fingerprint<00:02:44.599> that<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.349> nuts<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:46.819> level<00:02:47.180> of

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
fingerprint that is nuts the level of

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.600 
fingerprint that is nuts the level of
detail<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.079> sick<00:02:48.319> for<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.680> small<00:02:49.220> tiny

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
detail is just sick for this small tiny

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.670 
detail is just sick for this small tiny
little<00:02:49.790> macro<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.930> then<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.200> course<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.560> had<00:02:51.650> to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
little macro and then of course I had to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280 
little macro and then of course I had to
try<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:51.980> fisheye<00:02:52.400> lens<00:02:52.670> out<00:02:52.959> obviously<00:02:53.959> it's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
try the fisheye lens out obviously it's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.100 
try the fisheye lens out obviously it's
not<00:02:54.500> going<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.459> be<00:02:55.579> overly<00:02:56.209> useful<00:02:56.690> for<00:02:56.930> most

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
not going to be overly useful for most

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.140 
not going to be overly useful for most
photography<00:02:57.739> applications<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
photography applications but it is a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.270 
photography applications but it is a
totally<00:02:59.690> fun<00:03:00.170> little<00:03:00.530> lens<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:00.950> playing

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
totally fun little lens to be playing

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.039 
totally fun little lens to be playing
around<00:03:01.459> with<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:02.510> as<00:03:02.630> far<00:03:02.780> as<00:03:02.900> some

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
around with and as far as some

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.380 
around with and as far as some
real-world<00:03:03.410> samples<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.670> polarizer<00:03:05.090> does<00:03:05.359> a

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
real-world samples the polarizer does a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.059 
real-world samples the polarizer does a
pretty<00:03:05.720> fantastic<00:03:05.930> job<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.560> keeping<00:03:06.739> that

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
pretty fantastic job of keeping that

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.059 
pretty fantastic job of keeping that
sideways<00:03:07.579> light<00:03:07.910> from<00:03:08.590> bouncing<00:03:09.590> off<00:03:09.709> really

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
sideways light from bouncing off really

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.430 
sideways light from bouncing off really
shiny<00:03:10.310> objects<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:10.970> ruining<00:03:11.630> your<00:03:11.810> shot<00:03:12.019> so

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
shiny objects and ruining your shot so

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.440 
shiny objects and ruining your shot so
the<00:03:12.799> Sun<00:03:13.069> was<00:03:13.250> really<00:03:13.489> coming<00:03:13.819> off<00:03:14.060> those<00:03:14.269> two

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
the Sun was really coming off those two

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.530 
the Sun was really coming off those two
beams<00:03:14.720> totally<00:03:15.709> softened<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.489> down<00:03:16.700> toned<00:03:17.389> it

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
beams totally softened it down toned it

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.970 
beams totally softened it down toned it
down<00:03:17.569> so<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.170> didn't<00:03:18.380> ruin<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.680> picture

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
down so that it didn't ruin the picture

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.970 
down so that it didn't ruin the picture
and<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.609> wide-angle<00:03:20.359> lens<00:03:21.019> really<00:03:21.410> does<00:03:21.680> help

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
and the wide-angle lens really does help

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.190 
and the wide-angle lens really does help
increase<00:03:22.310> your<00:03:22.609> field<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:22.970> view<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.389> don't<00:03:23.900> know

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
increase your field of view I don't know

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.349 
increase your field of view I don't know
exactly<00:03:24.319> what<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:25.069> ratio<00:03:25.489> is<00:03:25.700> but<00:03:26.000> it's

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
exactly what the ratio is but it's

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.280 
exactly what the ratio is but it's
pretty<00:03:26.660> significant<00:03:28.810> now<00:03:29.810> as<00:03:29.930> far<00:03:30.079> as<00:03:30.139> the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
pretty significant now as far as the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.470 
pretty significant now as far as the
fisheye<00:03:30.650> lens<00:03:30.889> is<00:03:31.040> concerned<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.239> going<00:03:32.389> to
