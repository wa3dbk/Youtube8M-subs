it's assuming you all know what the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.139 
it's assuming you all know what the
third<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> swagger<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.850> harder

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
third is it swagger I think it's harder

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.940 
third is it swagger I think it's harder
to<00:00:45.180> define<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> cockiness<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.379> confidence

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to define the cockiness or confidence

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.200 
to define the cockiness or confidence
because<00:00:47.070> normally<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:47.610> i<00:00:47.670> hear<00:00:47.910> swagger
