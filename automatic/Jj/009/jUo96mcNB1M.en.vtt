let's go ahead and take a look you know

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.280 
let's go ahead and take a look you know
right<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.689> already<00:01:27.810> set<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
right now I have it already set up to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
right now I have it already set up to
dynamic<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:29.310> switch<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.640> over<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> standard

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
dynamic will switch on over to standard

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
dynamic will switch on over to standard
and<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.990> changes<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> colors<00:01:31.740> ever<00:01:32.340> so

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and a changes the colors ever so

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
and a changes the colors ever so
slightly<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.939> obviously<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:34.020> isn't<00:01:34.259> really

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
slightly so obviously this isn't really

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.249 
slightly so obviously this isn't really
in<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:35.250> opinion<00:01:35.299> dynamic<00:01:36.299> standard<00:01:36.780> natural

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
in my opinion dynamic standard natural

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.899 
in my opinion dynamic standard natural
and<00:01:37.409> movie<00:01:37.680> mode<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.009> my<00:01:38.130> opinion<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.610> not

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and movie mode in my opinion are not

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.690 
and movie mode in my opinion are not
meant<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.799> sort<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.369> night
