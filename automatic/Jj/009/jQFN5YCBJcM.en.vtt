00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
gameplay with the m8a1 was when I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.760 
gameplay with the m8a1 was when I

downside<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.420> field<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:16.170> kind<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.440> puts

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
downside to that field just kind of puts

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.130 
downside to that field just kind of puts
me<00:03:16.770> off<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.550> rate<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.910> which<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
me off is that the rate in which the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.480 
me off is that the rate in which the
bullets<00:03:19.470> actually<00:03:19.650> registered<00:03:20.310> under

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
bullets actually registered under

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.340 
bullets actually registered under
players<00:03:20.880> right<00:03:21.210> I<00:03:21.390> noticed<00:03:21.960> that<00:03:22.020> when<00:03:22.260> I'm

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
players right I noticed that when I'm

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.080 
players right I noticed that when I'm
shooting<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.740> player<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.280> he's<00:03:23.430> moving<00:03:23.670> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
shooting the player and he's moving the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.300 
shooting the player and he's moving the
bullets<00:03:24.750> actually<00:03:24.960> reached<00:03:25.350> target<00:03:25.950> pretty

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
bullets actually reached target pretty

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.670 
bullets actually reached target pretty
late<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.690> trouble<00:03:28.200> time<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
late and is that trouble time with the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.060 
late and is that trouble time with the
bullets<00:03:29.040> after<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.030> fire<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.930> know<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.650> lag

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
bullets after you fire you know that lag

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.040 
bullets after you fire you know that lag
it's<00:03:32.340> what<00:03:32.490> like<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.790> lag<00:03:33.060> feel<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.690> I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
it's what like this lag feel to it I

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.450 
it's what like this lag feel to it I
don't<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.500> if<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.770> should<00:03:34.800> call<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.220> lagging

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
don't know if I should call it lagging

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.970 
don't know if I should call it lagging
was<00:03:35.760> nasty<00:03:36.060> drop<00:03:36.510> short<00:03:36.750> over<00:03:37.410> he<00:03:37.620> tries<00:03:37.740> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
was nasty drop short over he tries to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.010 
was nasty drop short over he tries to
drop<00:03:38.280> short<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.610> do<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.790> jump<00:03:39.060> shot<00:03:39.240> who<00:03:39.420> wins<00:03:39.630> the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
drop short I do a jump shot who wins the

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.560 
drop short I do a jump shot who wins the
jump<00:03:40.260> shot<00:03:40.320> dude<00:03:40.650> wins<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.460> maybe<00:03:41.640> that's

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
jump shot dude wins but maybe that's

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.120 
jump shot dude wins but maybe that's
just<00:03:42.690> because<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.260> case<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:43.800> anyway<00:03:44.010> was

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
just because of that case but anyway was

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.160 
just because of that case but anyway was
out<00:03:44.370> yeah<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.820> there's<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.210> this<00:03:45.360> travel

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
out yeah so there's like this travel

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140 
out yeah so there's like this travel
time<00:03:46.470> lag<00:03:46.950> between<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.610> bullets<00:03:47.940> when<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
time lag between the bullets when I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.090 
time lag between the bullets when I
should<00:03:48.780> depends<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.530> know<00:03:49.560> depends<00:03:50.070> on

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
should depends you know depends on

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.040 
should depends you know depends on
distance<00:03:50.370> as<00:03:50.730> well<00:03:50.910> but<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.690> further<00:03:51.870> away

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
distance as well but the further away

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.930 
distance as well but the further away
the<00:03:52.260> player<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.650> obviously<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:53.580> gonna<00:03:53.730> take

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
the player is obviously it's gonna take

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.760 
the player is obviously it's gonna take
longer<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.660> travel<00:03:55.050> for<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.260> bullets<00:03:55.590> right

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
longer to travel for the bullets right

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.370 
longer to travel for the bullets right
but<00:03:56.070> still<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:57.360> kind<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.780> kind<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.260> feels

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
but still it's kind of kind of feels

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.420 
but still it's kind of kind of feels
awkward<00:03:58.560> when<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:58.890> compare<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.370> other

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
awkward when you compare it to other

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.030 
awkward when you compare it to other
weapons<00:03:59.880> right<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.290> only<00:04:01.440> downside

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
weapons right so that is only downside

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.060 
weapons right so that is only downside
to<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.280> weapon<00:04:02.580> i<00:04:02.670> think<00:04:02.910> but<00:04:03.540> i<00:04:03.600> use<00:04:04.350> the

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
to this weapon i think but i use the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.940 
to this weapon i think but i use the
stock<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:05.910> fast<00:04:06.210> mags<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.600> sorry<00:04:07.020> i'm<00:04:07.680> using

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
stock and fast mags for sorry i'm using

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.830 
stock and fast mags for sorry i'm using
stock<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.490> reflex<00:04:08.970> sight<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.300> attachments

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
stock and reflex sight for attachments

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.050 
stock and reflex sight for attachments
and<00:04:09.990> these<00:04:10.590> two<00:04:10.830> are<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.130> best<00:04:11.370> combinations

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
and these two are the best combinations

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.150 
and these two are the best combinations
for<00:04:12.330> i<00:04:12.570> think<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.410> all<00:04:13.530> around<00:04:13.800> assault

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
for i think for all around assault

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.830 
for i think for all around assault
rifles<00:04:14.550> i've<00:04:14.790> used<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.240> for<00:04:15.390> pretty<00:04:15.600> much<00:04:15.660> all

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
rifles i've used it for pretty much all

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.539 
rifles i've used it for pretty much all
in<00:04:16.020> seoul<00:04:16.170> rifles<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.650> i<00:04:16.680> really<00:04:17.010> find<00:04:17.250> it

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
in seoul rifles and i really find it

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.120 
in seoul rifles and i really find it
awesome<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.540> using<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.020> stock<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> crucial

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
awesome to using a stock is a crucial

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.120 
awesome to using a stock is a crucial
