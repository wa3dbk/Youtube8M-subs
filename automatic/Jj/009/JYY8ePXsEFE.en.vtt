lvx

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
lvx

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.990 
lvx
and<00:01:09.240> lvx<00:01:10.110> produces<00:01:10.799> new<00:01:10.950> collections<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and lvx produces new collections just a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
and lvx produces new collections just a
few<00:01:12.270> times<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.659> year<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:13.920> make<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
few times a year but they really make a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.249 
few times a year but they really make a
point<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.119> season<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.020> on

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
point to make them on season and on

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.260 
point to make them on season and on
trend<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.909> cool<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
trend and I think that's really cool of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
trend and I think that's really cool of
them<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.500> release<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> collection

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
them that when they release a collection

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.550 
them that when they release a collection
it's<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.180> curated<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.140> all<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it's really well curated and all the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
it's really well curated and all the
colors<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.549> perfect<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> upcoming

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
colors are just perfect for the upcoming

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.649 
colors are just perfect for the upcoming
season<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.430> most<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:26.820> lvx<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
season what I like most about lvx is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
season what I like most about lvx is
that<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> gel<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.799> formula<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> tend

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that it's a gel like formula so I tend

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
that it's a gel like formula so I tend
to<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.450> pretty<00:01:30.780> good<00:01:30.990> wear<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to get pretty good wear out of it and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
to get pretty good wear out of it and
like<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> said<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> colors<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.659> always<00:01:33.840> on

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
like I said the colors are always on

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.560 
like I said the colors are always on
point<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.280> great<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.329> can

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
point so it's great to know that you can

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.140 
point so it's great to know that you can
just<00:01:36.600> buy<00:01:37.380> whatever<00:01:37.680> shade<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.759> going

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
just buy whatever shade and it's going

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.520 
just buy whatever shade and it's going
to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.390> current<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.020> current<00:01:40.049> color

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to be current with the current color

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.889
