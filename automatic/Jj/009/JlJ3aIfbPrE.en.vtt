ruins<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.190> Tiahuanaco<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.360> guess<00:00:36.719> I'm

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
ruins of Tiahuanaco I guess I'm

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
ruins of Tiahuanaco I guess I'm
pronouncing<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.530> correctly<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:38.460> looks<00:00:38.640> like

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
pronouncing that correctly it looks like

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940 
pronouncing that correctly it looks like
Tiahuanaco<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:39.870> ACO<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> end<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> it

Tiahuanaco with an ACO at the end of it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.180 
Tiahuanaco with an ACO at the end of it
so<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.309> guess<00:00:41.879> its<00:00:42.149> Tijuana<00:00:42.629> Co<00:00:42.899> known<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so I guess its Tijuana Co known as the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
so I guess its Tijuana Co known as the
