and the cool thing is it has the
steering<00:02:03.270> axle<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> back<00:02:03.930> yes<00:02:04.770> /<00:02:04.979> sweet<00:02:05.189> so

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
steering axle on the back yes / sweet so

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.650 
steering axle on the back yes / sweet so
yeah<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.310> then<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.850> course<00:02:07.880> hit<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.539> know

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
yeah and then you of course hit you know

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.600 
yeah and then you of course hit you know
oh<00:02:08.869> if<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.530> switch<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.950> right<00:02:10.039> implement

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
oh if you switch to the right implement

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.510 
oh if you switch to the right implement
put<00:02:11.480> your<00:02:11.570> pipe<00:02:11.690> out<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.160> one<00:02:13.280> thing<00:02:13.370> we

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
put your pipe out and the one thing we

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.010 
put your pipe out and the one thing we
noticed<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> pipes<00:02:14.210> are<00:02:14.390> longer<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:14.870> these

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
noticed is the pipes are longer on these

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.730 
noticed is the pipes are longer on these
yeah<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.370> gonna<00:02:16.460> be<00:02:16.610> easier<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.970> get<00:02:17.210> to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
yeah so it's gonna be easier to get to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.210 
yeah so it's gonna be easier to get to
the<00:02:18.740> semis<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.370> stuff<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.360> offload<00:02:20.960> yep<00:02:21.560> bit

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
the semis and stuff to offload yep bit

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.040 
the semis and stuff to offload yep bit
so<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.610> same<00:02:22.760> animation<00:02:23.150> as<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.840> horse

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
so it's the same animation as the horse

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.390 
so it's the same animation as the horse
in<00:02:24.380> game<00:02:24.650> yep

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
in game yep

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.690 
in game yep
but<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.000> cool<00:02:26.450> right<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.520> when

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
but it's cool right I like it so when

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.380 
but it's cool right I like it so when
you<00:02:28.790> actually<00:02:28.970> fold<00:02:29.510> up<00:02:29.840> you'll<00:02:30.500> notice<00:02:30.770> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
you actually fold up you'll notice the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.850 
you actually fold up you'll notice the
pipe<00:02:32.390> actually<00:02:32.630> sticks<00:02:33.080> out<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.290> other<00:02:33.560> side

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
pipe actually sticks out the other side

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.070 
pipe actually sticks out the other side
just<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.190> little<00:02:34.220> bit<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:35.420> that's<00:02:35.570> all<00:02:35.810> the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
just a little bit so that's all the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.750 
just a little bit so that's all the
longer<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:36.890> really<00:02:37.250> compared<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
longer it is really compared to the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.670 
longer it is really compared to the
in-game<00:02:37.910> horse<00:02:38.360> one<00:02:38.540> right<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.410> should<00:02:39.590> have

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
in-game horse one right it should have

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.900 
in-game horse one right it should have
had<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:40.040> for<00:02:40.070> comparison<00:02:40.430> but<00:02:40.760> that's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
had it here for comparison but that's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.080 
had it here for comparison but that's
okay<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:42.050> just<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.260> little<00:02:42.410> bit<00:02:42.500> longer

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
okay so it's just a little bit longer

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.080 
okay so it's just a little bit longer
play<00:02:44.090> yet<00:02:44.300> it's<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:44.870> good<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.459> hood<00:02:46.700> so

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
play yet it's all good in the hood so

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.060 
play yet it's all good in the hood so
this<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.330> an<00:02:47.450> actual<00:02:47.810> wagon<00:02:48.260> as<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.890> see

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070

there you go yeah it's working that's
cool

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
cool

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.400 
cool
I<00:03:55.850> actually<00:03:56.090> really<00:03:56.480> like<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:56.660> yeah<00:03:57.230> that

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
I actually really like that yeah that

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.470 
I actually really like that yeah that
doesn't<00:03:57.860> go<00:03:58.130> when<00:03:58.310> you're<00:03:58.459> not<00:03:58.579> in<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:58.910> because

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
doesn't go when you're not in it because

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.270 
doesn't go when you're not in it because
that's<00:03:59.660> realistic<00:04:00.079> cuz<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.560> PTO<00:04:00.829> would<00:04:01.130> need

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
that's realistic cuz the PTO would need

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.979 
that's realistic cuz the PTO would need
to<00:04:01.400> spend<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:01.940> PTO<00:04:02.209> does<00:04:02.269> actually<00:04:02.750> spend

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
to spend and the PTO does actually spend

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.460 
to spend and the PTO does actually spend
oh<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:04.130> does<00:04:04.340> Wow<00:04:04.610> yeah<00:04:05.420> let<00:04:06.049> me<00:04:06.079> get<00:04:06.260> a<00:04:06.290> better

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
hang this is a good like starter hager

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.150 
hang this is a good like starter hager
wagon<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.110> really<00:04:09.620> cool<00:04:09.769> if<00:04:09.860> you're<00:04:09.980> playing

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
like a classic e farm yes this would be

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.170 
like a classic e farm yes this would be
the<00:04:12.440> way<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.590> go<00:04:12.769> sure<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.489> know<00:04:13.610> farms

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
the way to go sure you know farms

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.460 
the way to go sure you know farms

that work I'm not gonna lie I think it's

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.510 
that work I'm not gonna lie I think it's
really<00:04:21.599> really<00:04:21.750> cool<00:04:22.049> yeah<00:04:22.349> it's<00:04:22.979> not<00:04:23.160> from<00:04:23.400> my

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
really really cool yeah it's not from my

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.420 
really really cool yeah it's not from my
typical<00:04:23.910> go<00:04:24.330> big<00:04:24.539> farming<00:04:25.050> right<00:04:25.680> but<00:04:26.250> if

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
typical go big farming right but if

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.950 
typical go big farming right but if
you're<00:04:26.580> running<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.000> smaller<00:04:27.270> combines<00:04:27.750> or

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
you're running the smaller combines or

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.680 
you're running the smaller combines or
maybe<00:04:28.169> like<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.440> classic<00:04:29.039> combine<00:04:29.569> it<00:04:30.569> would

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
maybe like a classic combine it would

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.499 
maybe like a classic combine it would
totally<00:04:30.810> work<00:04:31.020> first<00:04:31.889> off<00:04:32.069> why<00:04:32.340> well<00:04:33.060> you

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
totally work first off why well you

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.360 
totally work first off why well you
never<00:04:33.599> know<00:04:33.750> he<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.650> know<00:04:34.740> there's<00:04:34.949> that<00:04:35.160> farm

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
never know he you know there's that farm

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.809 
never know he you know there's that farm
odd<00:04:35.750> right<00:04:36.750> yay<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.979> this<00:04:38.160> one<00:04:38.340> does<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.610> a

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
odd right yay so this one does have a

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.400 
odd right yay so this one does have a
turnable<00:04:39.240> axel<00:04:39.599> only<00:04:39.870> when<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.080> go<00:04:40.199> forward

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
turnable axel only when you go forward

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.469 
turnable axel only when you go forward
apparently<00:04:40.860> not<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:41.669> Reverse<00:04:41.759> don't<00:04:42.240> need<00:04:42.389> to

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
apparently not in Reverse don't need to

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.059 
apparently not in Reverse don't need to
turn<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.780> Reverse<00:04:43.080> John<00:04:43.380> apparently<00:04:44.009> it

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
turn in Reverse John apparently it

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.820 
turn in Reverse John apparently it
actually<00:04:44.340> makes<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.610> easier<00:04:44.880> if<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.060> doesn't

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
actually makes it easier if it doesn't

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.589 
actually makes it easier if it doesn't
turn<00:04:46.830> in<00:04:47.099> reverse<00:04:47.460> for<00:04:47.789> some<00:04:47.940> reason<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.419> most

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
turn in reverse for some reason the most

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.499 
turn in reverse for some reason the most
so<00:04:49.470> there<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.740> go<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:50.190> unloads<00:04:51.000> just<00:04:51.210> like<00:04:51.360> the

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
so there you go it unloads just like the

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.020 
so there you go it unloads just like the
end<00:04:51.599> game<00:04:51.780> but<00:04:52.039> see<00:04:53.039> how<00:04:53.099> far<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.789> I'm

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
end game but see how far like I'm

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.420 
end game but see how far like I'm
farther<00:04:54.479> away<00:04:54.659> and<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.889> helps<00:04:56.130> because<00:04:56.310> these

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
farther away and it helps because these

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.830 
farther away and it helps because these
wheels<00:04:56.669> stick<00:04:56.940> out<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.120> little<00:04:57.300> farther<00:04:57.569> than

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
wheels stick out a little farther than

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.469 
wheels stick out a little farther than
you<00:04:58.050> game<00:04:58.229> one<00:04:58.409> two<00:04:58.729> right<00:04:59.729> you<00:04:59.940> kind<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.270> need

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
you game one two right you kind of need

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.409 
you game one two right you kind of need
that<00:05:00.509> extra<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.169> pipeline<00:05:01.770> right<00:05:02.280> oh<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:02.819> agree

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
that extra of pipeline right oh I agree

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.110 
that extra of pipeline right oh I agree
so<00:05:03.710> they<00:05:04.710> work<00:05:04.889> they<00:05:05.190> hold<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.490> four<00:05:05.669> crops

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
so they work they hold the four crops

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.850 
so they work they hold the four crops
I've<00:05:06.690> tested<00:05:07.080> them<00:05:07.199> out<00:05:07.259> a<00:05:07.319> little<00:05:07.500> bit<00:05:07.650> here

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
I've tested them out a little bit here

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.839 
I've tested them out a little bit here
and<00:05:07.979> there<00:05:08.039> and<00:05:09.919> yeah<00:05:10.919> that's<00:05:11.159> three<00:05:11.580> auger
