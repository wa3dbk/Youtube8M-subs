00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
 salient guest in the action 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.860
 jacob nail episode apau sneaky wrote 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.620
 it is bad at the moment in division 3 about which i was talking about 20 16 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.479
 dollars 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:19.730
 so i did start year at psv that's why i decided i hope i work there 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.990
 soon will be playing in place two 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.900
 and then I hope that this week I will be around 60,000 euros 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.779
 fun not all then it might also be nice idea that its a punishment for that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.850
 but also during the annual so 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.840
 but we will see that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 although this episode is going to play and hopefully I can draw 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.570
 we will all see 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.969
 the best response from the previous episode was provada 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.289
 and then come into action but a good street football brand monta of it 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.069
 Spanish football and that's what I'm going to do now so I can't do that 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:56.830
 seller in fighting the fire 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's a bit stupid of mine at ketnet 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.449
 it not i has leon of overweight no right i just got behind 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.200
 but as you can see clearly so babacar 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.140
 taught in this workshop 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.830
 but luckily I found it important at the end of this episode 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.710
 we can now also play tricks with which the first opponent has 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.730
 done pretty good to see 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.310
 I go very slow midfield where the devil is attacking 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.540
 on behalf of the interest rates 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.840
 on a beach 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.140
 because that is also not true 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.590
 that was my first 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.619
 the happy note 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.619
 the highest interest this is the customer 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.120
 grabbing another huge chance by this measure must score that is meanwhile 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.899
 is it still 0 0 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.289
 probably i can then get the scoreboard that indicates that big fire why on 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.940
 it's going to happen the second half 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.610
 though I am I think so 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.160
 this is certainly not deserved 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.150
 he abandons dropping people 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.530
 and he scores local residents of Schiphol who just go to play and fall asleep 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 because I just want again the competition for starting fire costa this must 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.389
 we are a crime 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.889
 why not just score me paul meulenberg antipasta and through the coupons 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:14.859
 from 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.859
 the hand which as outside 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.210
 the fnv 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.699
 young young young young young 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.829
 vienna the austrian wenger 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.049
 what is trackbacken 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.159
 I am married November start that adds that he did not say 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.679
 bah bah bah bah as a living being others 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.679
 but maybe I can resent something from this group 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.749
 the justice i am not joining could play offensive because i just want this 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.129
 at Ben it turned out that the opponent 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.129
 in terms of crow camp karman 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.340
 wageningen anp i also got them from these effects are football 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.109
 no it has remained to play in the last ek 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.289
 just look to the side this past week 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.619
 jan winschoten 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:14.859
 and yet the water district of the bride has remained the same and I must and will 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.139
 because of this less than, for example, the opponent also has a share 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.169
 three soldiers in eindhoven waving exactly the same switzerland but the 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.289
 ten are roughly equivalent to Kastrati which will still be there 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.449
 not with monkeys the manager 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.979
 he had to debate 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
 I think that bladder jaw 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.189
 embankment that next 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.619
 what a pity but does not seem completely out of connection is a problem I am 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:46.159
 curious what will happen next in four crew members meanwhile 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.329
 I'll wait 5 minutes away, he just won't let them have more time 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.610
 home apparently worth it 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.140
 so i have to quit the game and then i hope i have this all too 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.749
 that must be an important one 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.150
 3 let's be now 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.330
 We are then that we are on the right track but I think it is good that 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.759
 nothing at all 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:13.379
 those people who are the left corner equality thinkers the emergency fund less 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.059
 can 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:19.070
 the next game would be just as easy as we wanted a year earlier 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.420
 then, for example, a storm said so 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.890
 personnel decline 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.930
 but my team is roughly comparable so it can go all over again on this one 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.069
 contest 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.460
 the hands off the agenda bah bah bah 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.400
 that these 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.680
 only misery twentieth minute 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.949
 In addition, there is a nice goal 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.020
 I think I'm lower that day but it doesn't matter at all 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.220
 he also turned out to have some fuel 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.879
 the east has 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.599
 this is another trainer 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.729
 dr.ir 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:47.700
 I want that too 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.920
 two Belgians this is going well and that makes this episode one more 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.730
 good luck 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.499
 no offside 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.659
 well i missed my first year to adjust 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:58.550
 Rotterdam 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.230
 Tarzan side people who scored three times in a row 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.919
 it has meanwhile become a rustic matter 2 0 for yes it is must that scored 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.539
 the bank can do that 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.839
 sdw 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.270
 young young young you can miss such an opportunity 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.370
 no look and there he has the first goal I just have a few huge ones 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.800
 village street in those matters not and there I claim your ticket and a sex offense 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.279
 dalmat act 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.779
 shoot jones 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.330
 and that is certainly a regular keeper 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.240
 and the ball that spring ride on the blisters sit nicely the main cast on baker tooth 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.300
 youth work doesn't work again 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.629
 the coolest out maybe you can make up for a bit now 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.659
 he just doesn't want where I just don't want to score all the luck is driving away 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.009
 last ten years 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.650
 for him it was best at the competition and I eventually won 2 so me 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.570
 at the moment 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.610
 the four points in the vision tip 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.699
 I have to get something in. I want to be able to get a PhD 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.550
 but we will all experience that for the next episodes I see 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.610
 sometimes it is strongly occupied 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.210
 I have that unexpected 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.949
 so there I go for sure that I can be there almost the entire game 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.460
 play would equal 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.760
 but I also deposited together let me know what I can do 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:12.369
 to win 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:15.999
 the awards were nice episode that the thumbs up and look 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.029
 of course the country 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.700
 I see blowing 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.930
 tile mdp 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.330
 unizo boss article 6 2 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.330
 the 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.400
 but that was going on
