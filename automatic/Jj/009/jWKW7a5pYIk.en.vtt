00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
use coconut oil or you can use an

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.520 
use coconut oil or you can use an
organic<00:00:40.730> shortening<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:41.989> when<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.260> go<00:00:42.470> to

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
organic shortening but when you go to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.610 
organic shortening but when you go to
melt<00:00:43.070> chocolate<00:00:43.880> chips<00:00:44.329> they<00:00:44.960> are<00:00:45.110> made<00:00:45.350> not

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
melt chocolate chips they are made not

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.500

to<00:00:45.829> melt<00:00:46.010> they're<00:00:46.550> made<00:00:46.880> to<00:00:47.090> hold<00:00:47.270> their<00:00:47.480> shape

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
to melt they're made to hold their shape

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.260 
to melt they're made to hold their shape
so<00:00:48.020> you<00:00:48.050> have<00:00:48.470> to<00:00:48.649> add<00:00:48.829> a<00:00:48.860> little<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
so you have to add a little of the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.120 
so you have to add a little of the
shortening<00:00:50.660> or<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.020> coconut<00:00:51.200> oil<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:51.980> in

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
shortening or the coconut oil to it in

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.520 
shortening or the coconut oil to it in
order<00:00:52.370> for<00:00:52.610> it<00:00:52.700> to<00:00:52.730> melt<00:00:53.000> correctly<00:00:53.450> so<00:00:53.989> then<00:00:54.500> I

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
order for it to melt correctly so then I

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.400 
order for it to melt correctly so then I
like<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.950> melt<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:55.309> in<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.579> microwave

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
like to melt it in the microwave

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.170 
like to melt it in the microwave
30-second<00:00:57.410> intervals<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.550> takes<00:00:58.940> probably

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
30-second intervals it takes probably

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.020 
30-second intervals it takes probably
two<00:00:59.719> and<00:01:00.110> then<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.800> residual<00:01:01.340> heat<00:01:01.640> from<00:01:01.670> the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
two and then the residual heat from the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.329 
two and then the residual heat from the
bowl<00:01:02.239> when<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:02.780> stir<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.140> will<00:01:03.829> completely

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
bowl when you stir it will completely

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.620 
bowl when you stir it will completely
melt<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.789> chocolate<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.210> rest<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.509> way

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
melt the chocolate the rest of the way

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.289 
melt the chocolate the rest of the way
so<00:01:06.079> remember<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:06.590> chocolate<00:01:07.399> and<00:01:07.610> heat<00:01:07.909> are

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
so remember that chocolate and heat are

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.690 
so remember that chocolate and heat are
like<00:01:08.659> mortal<00:01:09.049> enemies<00:01:09.469> and<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:10.400> better

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
like mortal enemies and so it's better

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.660 
like mortal enemies and so it's better
to<00:01:10.850> err<00:01:11.510> on<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.840> side<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.470> under<00:01:13.130> heating<00:01:13.549> it

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
to err on the side of under heating it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.820 
to err on the side of under heating it
then<00:01:13.880> over<00:01:14.240> heating<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.140> once<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:15.619> have

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
then over heating it so once you have

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.520 
then over heating it so once you have
your<00:01:16.040> melted<00:01:16.909> smooth<00:01:17.479> chocolate<00:01:18.110> like<00:01:18.260> this
