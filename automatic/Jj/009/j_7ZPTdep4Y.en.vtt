first<00:01:44.409> generation<00:01:44.950> iPad<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.579> doubted<00:01:45.909> in<00:01:46.149> the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:46.239 
first generation iPad I doubted in the

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.819 
first generation iPad I doubted in the
eye<00:01:46.270> photos<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.170> appears<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.679> screen

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
eye photos and it appears on the screen

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.830 
eye photos and it appears on the screen
as<00:01:48.129> the<00:01:48.250> iPhoto<00:01:48.579> was<00:01:48.789> not<00:01:49.060> compatible<00:01:49.420> my

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
as the iPhoto was not compatible my

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.460 
as the iPhoto was not compatible my
first<00:01:50.170> generation<00:01:50.619> iPad

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
first generation iPad

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.490 
first generation iPad
so<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:54.150> thing<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.870> can<00:01:54.990> understand<00:01:55.320> one

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so the thing is you can understand one

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.230 
so the thing is you can understand one
thing<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:56.010> let's<00:01:56.370> say<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
thing that let's say if we have the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.140 
thing that let's say if we have the
first<00:01:57.510> generation<00:01:57.570> data<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.700> course<00:02:00.000> we

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
first generation data and of course we

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.730 
first generation data and of course we
won<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.450> iOS<00:02:00.810> 6<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.290> want<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.560> buy<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
won the iOS 6 and we want to buy the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.820 
won the iOS 6 and we want to buy the
iPad<00:02:01.980> 3

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.630 

I<00:02:04.860> spent<00:02:05.550> roughly<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.620> 799<00:02:07.620> something<00:02:08.400> in

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I spent roughly on a 799 something in

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.990 
I spent roughly on a 799 something in
Thailand<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:10.140> buy<00:02:10.290> 3G<00:02:10.860> first<00:02:11.190> generation<00:02:11.640> iPad

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
Thailand to buy 3G first generation iPad

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.930 
Thailand to buy 3G first generation iPad
and<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.540> want<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> resell<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.710> some<00:02:14.700> winners

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and I want to resell it and some winners

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.090 
and I want to resell it and some winners
give<00:02:15.360> me<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.750> best<00:02:15.960> price<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.290> think<00:02:16.530> was<00:02:16.920> like

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
give me the best price I think was like

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.760 
give me the best price I think was like
300<00:02:17.820> bucks<00:02:18.830> from<00:02:19.830> $7.99<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:22.140> sometimes<00:02:22.650> it's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
300 bucks from $7.99 so sometimes it's

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.630 
300 bucks from $7.99 so sometimes it's
hard<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.190> accept<00:02:23.580> some<00:02:23.940> common<00:02:24.330> unacceptable

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
hard to accept some common unacceptable

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.460 
hard to accept some common unacceptable
so<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> only<00:02:26.940> reason<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.020> first<00:02:28.290> error

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
so the only reason that the first error

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.470 
so the only reason that the first error
is<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:29.310> compatible<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
is not that is not compatible with the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.950 
is not that is not compatible with the
average<00:02:30.660> success<00:02:31.820> we<00:02:32.820> want<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.180> sell<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.570> iPad

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
average success we want to sell the iPad

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.220 
average success we want to sell the iPad
3<00:02:35.090> that's<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.650> that's<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.860> honest<00:02:38.370> answer

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
3 that's the that's the honest answer

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
3 that's the that's the honest answer
