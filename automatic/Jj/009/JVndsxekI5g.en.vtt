keep<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> cold<00:01:21.180> air<00:01:21.360> coming<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.200> go

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
keep the cold air coming in and as we go

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.830 
keep the cold air coming in and as we go
through<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> weekend<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:24.330> winds<00:01:24.600> start<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
through the weekend the winds start to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.149 
through the weekend the winds start to
shift<00:01:24.930> around<00:01:25.290> more<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> an<00:01:25.799> easterly

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
shift around more of an easterly

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
shift around more of an easterly
direction<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.570> weather<00:01:28.110> system<00:01:28.530> after

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
direction so it's weather system after

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.399 
direction so it's weather system after
weather<00:01:28.979> system<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.869> is<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.990> keep<00:01:31.110> their<00:01:31.290> way

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
weather system that is to keep their way

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.649 
weather system that is to keep their way
working<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.520> long<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.060> cold<00:01:33.509> snap

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
working in so how long is this cold snap

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
working in so how long is this cold snap
going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> last<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:35.369> probably

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
going to last you think well probably

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.010 
going to last you think well probably

all the children out there we say oh

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
all the children out there we say oh

that they'd have all the weather there
are<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.159> hints<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.549> things<00:01:41.759> might

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
are little hints that things might

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.399 
are little hints that things might
change<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.259> big

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
change but the way it is it's just a big

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.569 
change but the way it is it's just a big
block<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.649> cold<00:01:43.979> air<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.369> sort<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
block of cold air that is sort of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429 
block of cold air that is sort of
sitting<00:01:44.820> there<00:01:44.970> nothing<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> next<00:01:46.290> sort

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
sitting there nothing in the next sort

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
sitting there nothing in the next sort
of<00:01:46.470> 5<00:01:46.710> 10<00:01:47.070> days<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.520> seems<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.180> just

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
of 5 10 days it seems like it is just

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
of 5 10 days it seems like it is just
coming<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:48.780> through<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> weekend<00:01:49.770> it'll

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
coming but through the weekend it'll

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.380 
coming but through the weekend it'll
become<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.490> cold<00:01:50.700> East<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> live<00:01:51.210> it'll

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
become more of a cold East to live it'll

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
become more of a cold East to live it'll
work<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> east<00:01:52.649> coast<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.009> the

the early part of it next week everyone

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.420 
the early part of it next week everyone
should<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.590> prepared<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.979> could<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.250> quite

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
should be prepared that could be quite

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
should be prepared that could be quite
another<00:01:59.640> quite<00:02:00.200> extreme<00:02:01.200> storm<00:02:01.740> system<00:02:02.040> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
another quite extreme storm system that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.160 
another quite extreme storm system that
could<00:02:02.280> work<00:02:02.430> its<00:02:02.640> way<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.240> no<00:02:03.659> end<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
could work its way and so no end for the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.679 
could work its way and so no end for the
cold<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:05.250> yet<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.820> seeing<00:02:06.000> some<00:02:06.180> pictures

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
cold just yet just seeing some pictures

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.499 
cold just yet just seeing some pictures
of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> snow<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.979> from<00:02:08.399> Aberdeen<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.209> fact

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
of the snow in from Aberdeen in fact

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
of the snow in from Aberdeen in fact
where<00:02:09.810> people<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.500> clearing<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.580> roads

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
where people are clearing the roads

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
where people are clearing the roads
there<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.569> see

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
there as you can see

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.250 
there as you can see
where<00:02:14.099> is<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.489> cold<00:02:15.060> snap<00:02:15.480> coming<00:02:15.870> from

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
where is this cold snap coming from

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.380 
where is this cold snap coming from
because<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:16.829> isn't<00:02:17.219> it<00:02:17.400> unseasonable<00:02:17.939> early

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
because it's isn't it unseasonable early

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.300 
because it's isn't it unseasonable early
to<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.719> such<00:02:18.959> about<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> cold<00:02:19.859> weather<00:02:20.069> it's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to have such about a cold weather it's

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.740 
to have such about a cold weather it's
interesting<00:02:20.549> if<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:20.879> remember<00:02:21.180> last<00:02:21.329> year<00:02:21.659> it

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
interesting if you remember last year it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.240 
interesting if you remember last year it
was<00:02:21.840> more<00:02:22.019> into<00:02:22.290> December<00:02:22.739> when<00:02:22.859> we<00:02:22.890> had<00:02:23.129> that

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
was more into December when we had that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.559 
was more into December when we had that
cold<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.790> somebody<00:02:24.120> flicked<00:02:24.329> a<00:02:24.420> light

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
cold it's like somebody flicked a light

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.149 
cold it's like somebody flicked a light
switch<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:24.989> Pullman<00:02:25.409> there<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.709> were<00:02:25.859> into

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
switch and Pullman there we were into

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.319 
switch and Pullman there we were into
winter<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.579> we<00:02:26.640> worked<00:02:26.849> our<00:02:27.030> way<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
winter and we worked our way up to

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.819 
winter and we worked our way up to
Christmas<00:02:27.689> that<00:02:27.870> way<00:02:28.049> we're<00:02:28.500> still<00:02:28.739> in

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
Christmas that way we're still in

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.110 
Christmas that way we're still in
November<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.609> a<00:02:29.670> couple<00:02:29.939> of<00:02:29.969> weeks

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
November so it's a couple of weeks

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.089 
November so it's a couple of weeks
earlier<00:02:30.329> than<00:02:30.629> say<00:02:30.810> last<00:02:31.079> year<00:02:31.290> not

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
earlier than say last year not

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.679 
earlier than say last year not
completely<00:02:32.579> unseasonable<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.450> when<00:02:33.569> you've

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
completely unseasonable but when you've

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.089 
completely unseasonable but when you've
got<00:02:33.719> people<00:02:34.109> out<00:02:34.200> there<00:02:34.349> with<00:02:34.469> snow<00:02:34.680> shovels

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
got people out there with snow shovels

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.009 
got people out there with snow shovels
and<00:02:35.219> it's<00:02:35.340> November<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.849> say<00:02:36.060> did<00:02:36.629> I<00:02:36.719> do<00:02:36.780> this

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
and it's November you say did I do this

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.289 
and it's November you say did I do this
last<00:02:37.290> year<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:38.040> does<00:02:38.280> feel<00:02:38.519> different<00:02:38.549> but

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
last year it does feel different but

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.750 
last year it does feel different but
it's<00:02:39.959> obviously<00:02:40.290> cold<00:02:40.590> arctic<00:02:41.189> air<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.609> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
it's obviously cold arctic air it's that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.160 
it's obviously cold arctic air it's that
northerly<00:02:42.150> wind<00:02:42.420> that's<00:02:42.599> brought<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.019> in

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
northerly wind that's brought it in
