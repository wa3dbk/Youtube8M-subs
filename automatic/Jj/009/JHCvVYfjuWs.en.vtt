00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the sniper's nest now I thought it was a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.509 
the sniper's nest now I thought it was a
golden<00:01:03.480> weapon<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.890> camouflaged

golden weapon but it's just camouflaged
so<00:01:06.020> let's<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.159> box<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
so let's see it's in this box right here

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
so let's see it's in this box right here
it's<00:01:10.350> called<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> galbi<00:01:11.430> campaign<00:01:12.030> scout

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's called the galbi campaign scout

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.800 
it's called the galbi campaign scout
rifle<00:01:12.659> now<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.890> box<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> hundred

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
rifle now the box is at a hundred

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.990 
rifle now the box is at a hundred
lockpick<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.170> hard<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.590> open<00:01:17.000> it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
lockpick so it's very hard to open it's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
lockpick so it's very hard to open it's
kind<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> hard<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.869> early<00:01:19.290> level

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
kind of hard to get an early level

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
kind of hard to get an early level
unless<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.119> don't<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.630> maybe<00:01:21.780> some

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
magazines already perceptions up really

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.570 
magazines already perceptions up really
high<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.900> than<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.650> don't<00:01:26.310> see<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
high other than that I don't see how you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.289 
high other than that I don't see how you
can<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
can get it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
can get it
here's<00:01:27.630> some<00:01:27.780> ammo<00:01:27.930> also<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
here's some ammo also right here and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.630 
here's some ammo also right here and
then<00:01:29.700> some<00:01:30.000> healing<00:01:30.210> powder<00:01:30.650> but<00:01:31.650> let's<00:01:32.100> shoot

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
then some healing powder but let's shoot

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.399 
then some healing powder but let's shoot
it<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.509> how<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.990> sounds<00:01:37.100> all<00:01:38.100> right

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
it off and see how it sounds all right

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.850 
it off and see how it sounds all right
so<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.619> scope<00:01:40.829> doesn't<00:01:41.310> look<00:01:41.400> any<00:01:41.520> different

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
so the scope doesn't look any different

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.920 
so the scope doesn't look any different
you<00:01:43.370> know<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.790> its<00:01:43.970> semi-automatic<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:44.840> it

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
you know in its semi-automatic so it

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.550 
you know in its semi-automatic so it
goes<00:01:45.080> pretty<00:01:45.230> fast<00:01:45.580> let's<00:01:46.580> see<00:01:47.230> how<00:01:48.230> it<00:01:48.380> looks

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
goes pretty fast let's see how it looks

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.750 
goes pretty fast let's see how it looks
