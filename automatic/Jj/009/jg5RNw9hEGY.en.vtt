if you want to see the button or if you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.219 
if you want to see the button or if you
want<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.119> pair<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> particular<00:02:06.780> remote<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
want to pair a particular remote of a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.680 
want to pair a particular remote of a
STB<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.009> decays<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.550> something<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.360> may<00:02:09.509> use

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
STB or decays or something you may use

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.260 
STB or decays or something you may use
that<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.379> why<00:02:10.739> after<00:02:11.099> pairing<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.849> need<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that and why after pairing you need to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.490 
that and why after pairing you need to
use<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.629> particular<00:02:12.840> but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
use this particular but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400 
use this particular but
that<00:02:13.680> 1<00:02:13.890> 2<00:02:14.040> 3<00:02:14.190> /<00:02:14.550> input<00:02:14.880> 2<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.840> accessing<00:02:16.140> that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
that 1 2 3 / input 2 for accessing that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.590 
that 1 2 3 / input 2 for accessing that
then<00:02:16.860> there<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.370> normal<00:02:17.700> 3d<00:02:17.970> button<00:02:18.300> mute

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
then there is a normal 3d button mute

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.170 
then there is a normal 3d button mute
button<00:02:18.960> program<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.070> channel<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.030> is

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
button program and channel so that is

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.170 
button program and channel so that is
what<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.870> regarding<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.500> remote<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
what is regarding this remote and the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.760 
what is regarding this remote and the
normal<00:02:24.480> point<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.780> view<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:24.990> now<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.290> could<00:02:25.590> go

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
normal point of view so now we could go

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.480 
normal point of view so now we could go
back<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.690> back<00:02:27.690> side<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.170> remote

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
back to the back side of the remote

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.540 
back to the back side of the remote
where<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.700> what<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.390> technicality<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.140> volt

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
where the what is a technicality in volt

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.740 
where the what is a technicality in volt
along<00:02:32.550> with<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.730> remote<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.390> remote

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
along with this remote so this remote

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.780 
along with this remote so this remote
this<00:02:34.320> particular<00:02:34.860> remote<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.220> compatible

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
this particular remote is compatible

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.720 
this particular remote is compatible
with<00:02:36.570> most<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> models<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.459> only

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
with most of the models the only

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.730 
with most of the models the only
restriction<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.300> there<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.630> two<00:02:39.810> things<00:02:39.990> one

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
restriction is there are two things one

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.320 
restriction is there are two things one
is<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.130> particular<00:02:44.490> feature<00:02:44.700> set<00:02:45.060> like
