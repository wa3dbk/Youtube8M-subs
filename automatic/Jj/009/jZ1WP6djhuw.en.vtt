I've<00:00:57.600> done<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:57.960> yet<00:00:58.079> although<00:00:58.379> several

I've done one yet although several

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
I've done one yet although several
people<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.100> asked<00:00:59.370> me<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.820> well<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.120> will

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
people have asked me to so well I will

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.939 
people have asked me to so well I will
be<00:01:00.510> sure<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> address<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.710> haven't

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
be sure to address that if I haven't

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.840 
be sure to address that if I haven't
reached<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.430> point<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> near<00:01:04.379> future<00:01:04.850> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
reached this point in the near future I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.990 
reached this point in the near future I
think<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.990> fun<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> clarify<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
think that it's a fun way to clarify and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.399 
think that it's a fun way to clarify and
I<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.210> find<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.840> sometimes<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:12.170> number<00:01:13.170> one

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
I also find that sometimes if number one

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.690 
I also find that sometimes if number one
if<00:01:13.590> you're<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.890> gonna<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> clear<00:01:14.460> answer

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
if you're not gonna a clear answer

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
if you're not gonna a clear answer
perhaps<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.570> something<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
perhaps it's not something that you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
perhaps it's not something that you
should<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.409> doing<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.770> spread<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.640> you're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
should be doing a spread on if you're

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.749 
should be doing a spread on if you're
reading<00:01:18.450> for<00:01:18.600> yourself<00:01:19.049> or<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.250> someone<00:01:20.310> else

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
reading for yourself or for someone else

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.810 
reading for yourself or for someone else
and<00:01:21.150> number<00:01:22.140> two<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.619> find<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.580> can

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and number two I find that if I I can

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
and number two I find that if I I can
get<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> space<00:01:24.540> where<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> am<00:01:25.710> looking

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
get to a space where I when I am looking

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.760 
get to a space where I when I am looking
for<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> terrifying<00:01:26.850> card<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.630> am<00:01:31.470> drawing

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
for a terrifying card that I am drawing

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.069 
for a terrifying card that I am drawing
to<00:01:32.009> any<00:01:32.220> tarot<00:01:32.460> cards<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.450> convoluting

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
to any tarot cards and I'm convoluting

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.679 
to any tarot cards and I'm convoluting
my<00:01:34.229> spread<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.180> fact<00:01:36.479> that

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
my spread and so I like the fact that

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
my spread and so I like the fact that
with<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:36.900> Oracle<00:01:37.380> deck<00:01:37.530> I've<00:01:37.799> had<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> clarifier

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
I only draw one card and that's it and I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
I only draw one card and that's it and I
don't<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.290> myself<00:01:43.409> draw<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.009> seven<00:01:44.430> cards

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
don't want myself draw like seven cards

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.850

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
clarifier and so I just wanted to kind

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.620 
clarifier and so I just wanted to kind
of<00:02:29.010> do<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> little<00:02:29.400> video<00:02:29.700> talking<00:02:30.090> about<00:02:30.450> how

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
of do a little video talking about how

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.470 
of do a little video talking about how
we<00:02:30.690> grow<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.200> our<00:02:31.320> decks<00:02:31.620> over<00:02:31.890> time<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.730> why

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
we grow with our decks over time and why

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
we grow with our decks over time and why
sometimes<00:02:33.840> when<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.320> purchase<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.740> deck

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
sometimes when we purchase the deck

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
sometimes when we purchase the deck
maybe<00:02:36.560> we<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:38.520> like<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.030> deck<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.450> we<00:02:39.570> have<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
maybe we we like the deck and we have a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
maybe we we like the deck and we have a
great<00:02:39.990> experience<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:43.500> we

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
great experience with it but as we

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.710 
great experience with it but as we
continue<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.340> work<00:02:44.520> with<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.240> as<00:02:45.450> time

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
continue to work with it and as time

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.740 
continue to work with it and as time
goes<00:02:45.900> by<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.320> perhaps<00:02:46.500> we<00:02:46.860> take<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> break<00:02:47.750> from

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
goes by and perhaps we take a break from

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.900 
goes by and perhaps we take a break from
using<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.230> deck<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> period<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.160> time<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
using the deck for a period of time and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.780 
using the deck for a period of time and
then<00:02:51.450> we<00:02:51.720> start<00:02:52.290> using<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.710> deck<00:02:52.890> again<00:02:53.250> we

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
then we start using the deck again we

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.790 
then we start using the deck again we
find<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.420> relationship<00:02:54.540> deepens<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
find that the relationship deepens and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.570 
find that the relationship deepens and
bears<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:58.170> new<00:02:59.130> things<00:02:59.400> to

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
bears and that we have new things to

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:11.780 
bears and that we have new things to
bring<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> each<00:03:00.210> other<00:03:07.430> okay<00:03:09.800> so<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.580> been

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
bring to each other okay so I have been

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.090 
bring to each other okay so I have been
having<00:03:12.000> again<00:03:12.570> incredible<00:03:13.260> experiences<00:03:13.860> with

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
having again incredible experiences with

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:23.470 
having again incredible experiences with
this<00:03:14.250> deck<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:15.120> Willie<00:03:17.600> Patsy<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:20.810> get<00:03:21.810> clarity

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
this deck it Willie Patsy to get clarity

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.030 
this deck it Willie Patsy to get clarity
for<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.570> messages<00:03:25.020> that<00:03:25.170> are<00:03:25.290> coming<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.800> and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
for the messages that are coming in and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.000 
for the messages that are coming in and
I<00:03:26.490> like<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.000> fact<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.870> guidebook<00:03:28.560> isn't

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
I like the fact that the guidebook isn't

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.320 
I like the fact that the guidebook isn't
too<00:03:29.220> in-depth<00:03:29.640> because<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.180> keeps<00:03:30.420> me<00:03:30.660> from

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
too in-depth because this keeps me from

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.120 
too in-depth because this keeps me from
doubting<00:03:33.330> myself<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.110> wanting<00:03:34.740> to<00:03:34.770> go<00:03:34.950> back

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
doubting myself and wanting to go back

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.440 
doubting myself and wanting to go back
and<00:03:35.280> look<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.880> know<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.330> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
and look because I know that the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.210 
and look because I know that the
guidebook<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.050> really<00:03:37.440> meant<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.710> be<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.100> a

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
guidebook is really meant to be just a

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.830 
guidebook is really meant to be just a
jumping-off<00:03:38.700> point<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.240> that<00:03:39.360> she<00:03:39.510> kept<00:03:39.720> it

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
jumping-off point and that she kept it

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.220 
jumping-off point and that she kept it
that<00:03:39.870> way<00:03:40.050> for<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.560> reason<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:42.330> have<00:03:43.080> been

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
that way for that reason so I have been

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.140 
that way for that reason so I have been
able<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.470> develop<00:03:43.650> my<00:03:44.010> own<00:03:44.040> unique<00:03:44.670> meanings

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
able to develop my own unique meanings

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.290 
able to develop my own unique meanings
for<00:03:45.390> each<00:03:45.540> card<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.020> this<00:03:46.140> deck<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.800> from<00:03:47.790> each

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
for each card in this deck and from each

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.330 
for each card in this deck and from each
time<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.720> use<00:03:48.870> them<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.350> have<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> new<00:03:49.890> experience

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
time I use them I have a new experience

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.340 
time I use them I have a new experience
and<00:03:50.700> another<00:03:51.000> meaning<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.630> another<00:03:51.960> meaning

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
and another meaning and another meaning

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.540 
and another meaning and another meaning
gets<00:03:52.500> added<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.950> card<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.370> there's

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
gets added to the card and there's

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.970 
gets added to the card and there's
another<00:03:53.790> layer<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:55.010> people<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.510> very

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
another layer and people have very

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.490 
another layer and people have very
comforting<00:03:59.570> reactions<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:00.960> deck

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
comforting reactions to this deck

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.250 
comforting reactions to this deck
they<00:04:01.800> love<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.400> artwork<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.270> they<00:04:03.900> get<00:04:04.110> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
they love the artwork and they get a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.980 
they love the artwork and they get a
message<00:04:04.560> that's<00:04:04.950> clear<00:04:05.810> but<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:07.050> isn't<00:04:07.500> um

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
message that's clear but that isn't um

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.390 
message that's clear but that isn't um
it's<00:04:09.990> done<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.440> very<00:04:10.650> loving<00:04:10.920> way<00:04:11.160> through

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
it's done in a very loving way through

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.949 
it's done in a very loving way through
the<00:04:11.520> artwork<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.300> quite<00:04:12.510> often<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.900> don't

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
the artwork and so quite often I don't

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.650 
the artwork and so quite often I don't
even<00:04:13.200> really<00:04:13.410> have<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.800> say<00:04:13.980> anything<00:04:14.660> they

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
even really have to say anything they

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:25.340 
even really have to say anything they
see<00:04:15.720> an<00:04:16.049> image<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.500> one

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:34.080 

and<00:04:31.800> they<00:04:32.800> share<00:04:33.009> a<00:04:33.039> mess<00:04:33.310> if<00:04:33.520> they<00:04:33.699> see<00:04:33.759> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
and they share a mess if they see the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.980 
and they share a mess if they see the
message<00:04:34.419> like<00:04:34.570> here<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.960> old<00:04:35.139> times<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.910> they

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
message like here the old times and they

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.240 
message like here the old times and they
automatically<00:04:37.990> know<00:04:38.259> themselves<00:04:38.500> for<00:04:39.190> the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
automatically know themselves for the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.120 
automatically know themselves for the
most<00:04:39.460> part<00:04:39.759> what<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.440> they<00:04:41.740> need<00:04:41.949> to

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
most part what it is that they need to
