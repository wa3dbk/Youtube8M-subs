00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.310
 By the way, how did you feel overwhelming in Germany? 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.630
 he had his good things and his things more 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.939
 the problem was that he did not have too much level of German 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.409
 and that was a problem 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.729
 but we were practicing that many companies 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.880
 the truth that I preferred Italy but it was impossible 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.329
 besides kan and the theme of the schedules in germany kills me 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.569
 fifth at seven in the afternoon already knew nothing 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.769
 and the food is tremendous 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.230
 I only liked the sausage if the cyclone 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.360
 min and the cold that's how it is 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.480
 I am the most suitable for this type of countries, I like the beach 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.840
 warmth hello was the popes 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.140
 what valuation does of nut 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.090
 rebate stamp 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.100
 not much 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.400
 the truth is that I thought that the German system was better and had 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.760
 better means 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 but they have a lower level than in Spain 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.580
 that was the impression that they leave and maybe a half the problems with the language 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.160
 they were a problem 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.610
 it would be an experience that I would not repeat 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.780
 besides the Germans are all so squared 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 yes but it has better beer in the world does not seem good 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.320
 the best beer they have in that country 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.920
 besides that they serve it hot that yes that is hallucinating 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.800
 I went to a beer party in Munich is the best I've seen that my 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.390
 life a big party 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.850
 I see that the sic actions in general 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.180
 throughout these studies are good 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 you will achieve that your level of qualification is adequate 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.020
 I've never had a problem with studies 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.140
 I also have a very high IQ 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 I am very qualified for any job 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.609
 and days out 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.609
 in the case of the hospital delegation project abroad 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 good 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.600
 each country has its things 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.630
 and I would prefer to work in the United States 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 I have never been but I think it would be great 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.450
 what I would never do 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.019
 it would be peaceful 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 or to asia I think I would not like the experience 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.359
 good to the best for a short period 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.769
 as a punctual trip 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.449
 Maybe yes 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.699
 but it also depends on the conditions I do not know 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.419
 is something that I have not considered at the moment and I would have to think about 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.579
 is following a training course currently no no 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.140
 I already have the title of miss practices 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.819
 what is left is to start working 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.069
 now I have dedicated I want to see a book for a long time because it has already been 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.659
 many years studying 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.739
 the student stage for me is over
