00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
- and what's the difference from the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.729 
- and what's the difference from the
demo2<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> back<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:34.050> added<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
demo2 is on the back now we just added a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.869 
demo2 is on the back now we just added a
new<00:00:35.250> battery<00:00:36.030> container<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> back<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
new battery container on the back and

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.490 
new battery container on the back and
innovate<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.510> see<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> little<00:00:40.020> battery

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
innovate you can see a little battery

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.660 
innovate you can see a little battery
inside<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.300> using<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.670> 1500

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670

mini and Patrick is true Inspectorate

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520 
mini and Patrick is true Inspectorate
inside<00:00:47.730> using<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.960> battery<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
inside using this kind of battery you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.069 
inside using this kind of battery you
can<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> monitor<00:00:51.329> working<00:00:51.750> for

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
can just make the monitor working for

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.560 
can just make the monitor working for
one<00:00:52.260> hour<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.460> also<00:00:53.610> use<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.210> bigger

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
one hour in your can also use a bigger

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.500 
one hour in your can also use a bigger
battery<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> 2002<00:00:55.890> anime<00:00:56.219> am<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
battery like the 2002 anime am so if you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.990 
battery like the 2002 anime am so if you
work<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> half<00:00:58.980> hour<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.579> your

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
work like one and a half hour all your

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.470 
work like one and a half hour all your
this<00:01:00.329> d7o<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> class<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.149> change

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
this d7o to class it's just a change

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.170 
this d7o to class it's just a change
that<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.750> battery<00:01:04.250> container<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> nothing<00:01:06.030> has

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that a battery container and nothing has

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
that a battery container and nothing has
changed<00:01:06.570> about<00:01:06.659> amico<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> show<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> pictures

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
changed about amico to show the pictures

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
changed about amico to show the pictures
again<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.060> case<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.750> not

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
again to you in case you are not

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590 
again to you in case you are not
familiar<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:12.030> design<00:01:12.450> output

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
familiar with this the design output

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
familiar with this the design output
allows<00:01:12.990> chemistry<00:01:13.590> Avista<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.130> means<00:01:14.760> very

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
allows chemistry Avista a means very

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
bright monitor is the high resolution

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.410 
bright monitor is the high resolution
and<00:01:17.939> also<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.140> blackness<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.640> monitor

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and also the blackness of this monitor

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.580 
and also the blackness of this monitor

chain rage 450 city per square meter

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.789 
chain rage 450 city per square meter
this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.950> very<00:01:26.159> high<00:01:27.350> practice<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.619> can

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
this is a very high practice you can

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
this is a very high practice you can
even<00:01:29.670> use<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.420> monitor<00:01:30.689> under<00:01:31.049> sunlight

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
even use this monitor under sunlight

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.249 
even use this monitor under sunlight
without<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.400> sunshade<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.420> also<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.079> can

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
without the sunshade but also you can

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.740 
without the sunshade but also you can
see<00:01:34.500> come<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.799> visa<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.670> instantiate<00:01:36.329> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
see come see visa for instantiate this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.560 
see come see visa for instantiate this
is<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.290> easy<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.650> carry<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.369> also<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
is very easy to carry and also when you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
is very easy to carry and also when you
contribute<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:41.009> easy<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> open

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
contribute it is very easy to open

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660 
contribute it is very easy to open
okay<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> top<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.040> through

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
okay so on the top you can see through

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.260 
okay so on the top you can see through
antennas<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.720> 5.8<00:01:46.530> antennas<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
antennas the 5.8 antennas and has the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.620 
antennas the 5.8 antennas and has the
beauty<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.780> diversity<00:01:49.470> inside<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.340> aw<00:01:50.630> detect

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
beauty in diversity inside so aw detect

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.560 
beauty in diversity inside so aw detect
the<00:01:52.140> signal<00:01:52.530> strengths<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.310> each<00:01:53.640> receiver

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
the signal strengths of each receiver

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.310 
the signal strengths of each receiver
model<00:01:54.869> inside<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.130> choose<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.149> one<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
model inside and I choose the one is the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.950 
model inside and I choose the one is the
bestest<00:01:58.860> signal<00:01:59.430> strength<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.390> switches
