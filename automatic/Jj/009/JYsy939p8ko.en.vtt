00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.630
 today we are going to make a plasticine dog 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.019
 the material we need friends expression 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.780
 a white black coffee rose and our 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.950
 classic toothpick that we use in all 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.110
 our videos and let's start 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.990
 let's start using the pressure 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.300
 a white 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.550
 and let's start making a sketch 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.770
 friends like we did in our video 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.710
 previous a very basic bear 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.010
 to be able to form the body of our 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.340
 dog 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.590
 on this occasion 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.410
 we started to assemble 4 this month down 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.780
 to form the legs two lines towards 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.790
 up the tail and the head 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.250
 in this very basic way very rough very 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.550
 rudimentary but this will be our guide 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.470
 to be able to do the dog that we want 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.910
 this time we are going to start 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.400
 work now 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.890
 the front legs we stretch the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.160
 platinum down and we form a 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.220
 small base where the fingers will go in 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.170
 our plasticine dog 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.720
 once we finish making the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.400
 front legs we started working 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.890
 with hind legs 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.430
 we generate the leg first then we give 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.370
 a fold down and we start to 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 create the dog's heel in this way 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.070
 and then we form a base in the end 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.380
 of the tip of the leg to be able 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.010
 create later the fingers of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.500
 our body 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.760
 in this way 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.360
 so we are left this way 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.180
 now we start working too 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.610
 let's shape it let's finish 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.710
 well the hind legs both without 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.390
 finish and we will remove the excess 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.580
 clay 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.450
 because the tail needs a little less than 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.810
 clay 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.300
 in this way that we stay better 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.350
 once we have fulfilled this 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.150
 we started 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.020
 we will use a spot more 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.570
 clay 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.250
 to do it in the little one there is a dog 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.140
 in this way so that they look 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:20.510
 a real dog that develops 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.270
 then we start to generate you have us 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.250
 what to say yes 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.640
 then we're going to start working at 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.220
 head let's put a piece of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.240
 plasticine coffee on top of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.050
 his head to be able to create him 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.570
 his coat brown and we started to 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.330
 go down to lower the coffee pressure by the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.150
 nape of the dog in this way to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.850
 make that coffee color that the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.950
 dogs 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.440
 of this race we have something like this now 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.560
 let's also make him in his ears 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.900
 we take plasticine coffee and we're going to 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.439
 insert in your head 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.379
 to be able to make his ears if we go 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.110
 stretching in this way until you create 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.200
 its solid we take two pieces of 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.110
 presents coffee and we insert one of 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.700
 each side in this way so that we 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.860
 let our clay dog ​​be like this 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.390
 press the ears so that we 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.630
 something with our 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.550
 then we fold them a little down 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.550
 we hang them so that they remain 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.660
 all right 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.760
 now with the toothpick or with the tip of the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.489
 stick let's make it two 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.269
 perforations in the part or in the area 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.519
 coffee this way and we're going to put you 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.930
 let's also make a small 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:01.030
 opening in front to do what 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.190
 It will be your mouth in this way 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.100
 now with two plasticine balls 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.830
 black let's make those eyes 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.470
 we are going to introduce them in those holes that 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.350
 We made something for us with our 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.870
 friends your little black eyes 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.299
 yes 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.879
 all right 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.889
 now let's put another country you will 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:24.590
 presses black on the tip of the head 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.020
 our dog to make his nose 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.840
 without stretching by the magicians so that we 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.850
 is something like this friends and with the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.340
 tip of the stick we will leave the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.080
 perforations in this way for 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.580
 make his nostrils 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.680
 something like this 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.470
 well once we have this we are going to 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.240
 make a piece of pink plasticine 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.639
 we cut a pink people spot and 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.310
 we put it in his mouth to make it 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.780
 happy to the dog of this evil now 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.150
 let's start making spots to 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.240
 our dog are going to start making him 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.729
 wrong the black spot on his back 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.270
 this way and we started to spread the 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.150
 up to the tail in this way now you 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.110
 you can put brown spots on them 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.620
 black of the size you want more 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.809
 black plus coffee to taste if I'm not going to 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.180
 put some pieces of placenta coffee 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:21.889
 in his four legs and I'm going to put it 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.639
 that piece of black person in his 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:29.559
 back and part of his work yes so that 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:33.349
 you see a dog sorry this way if 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:35.779
 we're going to do it like this declared 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.830
 we are spotted on his four legs 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:43.280
 a little coffee on his black back and 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.770
 ready we are like foreigners 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.750
 now since we finished this we are going to 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.080
 make a small cleft in your tongue 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.430
 to acquire an effect 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.650
 to the language more comes out not yet 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.840
 well now with the tip of the stick 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.740
 let's slice a bit of the white 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.550
 and we're going to stick it in the center of 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.860
 eye if for that it gave me an effect as of 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.860
 light and look much better 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:19.309
 and so they have more life in their eyes 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.460
 finally we will form the fingers of 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:25.430
 the legs we are going to make three indentations 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.849
 in each leg and we're going to turn it around 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.300
 at the tip to be able to separate the fingers 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.219
 to be able to separate one from another from this 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.909
 way and this we will apply in the 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.909
 four paws 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.490
 that we stay in something like that, the 4 of us 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.470
 steps we go to the waists 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.370
 there is these will be the other friends 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.370
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:50.669
