00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.290
 finished perfumes and my perfumes 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.210
 Favorites of almost those who intervene 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.900
 Well, it's these pretty ones of you 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.510
 understand and if they are interested in which 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.750
 it is but it is not treated then 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.090
 come with me and let's start 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.680
 Girl listens on TV for backgrounds 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.510
 because look more is watching TV 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.350
 remember that my mom is on vacation 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.350
 with me 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.449
 the first perfume that I am going to teach you 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.449
 it's this because it's my favorite 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.180
 of this already bought as 3000 I am very 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:10.480
 very bad describing the smells so 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.730
 I'm not going to tell you what that smells like 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.330
 nothing else I will tell you if they are sweet or 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.740
 if they are fresh and this one is very fresh 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.740
 I love it very much 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.870
 I like it because when I put on 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.990
 well I do not know if it happens I have a perfume 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.050
 is this mine I have this perfume is that of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.750
 law 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.910
 When I put it on, I smell it all 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 time I love the smell but I do not 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.740
 like to smell less all the time and for 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.500
 there I read that if the perfume that you put on 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.860
 you smell it all the time that perfume does not 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.870
 it's for you I do not know if it's true or false 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.100
 but with that perfume I do not like it 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.140
 other people 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.690
 if they smell it to me but I do not so this one 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 is in the first place 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.890
 the next perfume that I'm going to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.570
 teach is this this I love 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.740
 very much fascinates me is cool too 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.930
 I'm going to leave the names of the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.090
 perfumes in the information box by 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.830
 order as I am teaching them in case 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.950
 interesting one this is one of the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.800
 favorite perfumes and also finished 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.870
 I love this very much, it makes me fall in love and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.050
 also its perfume that I do not smell 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.540
 so this one is perfect for me the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.910
 next perfume is this powder 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.910
 also this month 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.950
 I love super super super cool what 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.590
 that is cool and I love it 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.310
 very much also I finished it as 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.510
 can see 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.670
 and I like it very much, it makes me fall in love 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.049
 and he used it every day 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.209
 but then it does not end before using 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.150
 before using this he used this more than the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.370
 another but find out if this one falls in love 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.000
 I love how I told them and this one is in 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 the third place is not that I like it 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.430
 less than the others who use it on the 3rd 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.760
 that I am teaching him and finally 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.099
 finished is this and this I love no 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.859
 I know if it's fresh or sweet it's like a 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.340
 combination but it's cooler than sweet 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.370
 and I love I love this very much 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.980
 perfume I smelled it but it did not bother me 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.319
 I like this other itself smelled so as 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.389
 suddenly in movements that I was moving 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.989
 the hair or so this one would 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.269
 but I really love the girls that 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.180
 have this perfume know the rich what 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.400
 Rich that smells and then I fall in love 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.239
 very much 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.099
 as you know how important a woman is 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.400
 angry and you know about those little things 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.010
 I love I love smelling rich car in 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.470
 weather 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.390
 I have not finished this perfume but 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.670
 it is also one of my favorites this 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.440
 it's sweet 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.180
 I have not already since that time I think that 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.780
 this is the second bottle that I bought 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.390
 because this one lasts for years and years 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.810
 with nothing else I make one here one here and 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.810
 another one here I swear I still see the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.610
 next day how strong is good 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.220
 in me because as you know the 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.190
 depths always hit them the same as 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.049
 people and this one I like a lot but it 's 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.250
 very strong so that's also why 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.710
 I wanted to teach 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.040
 what I'm going to teach you are these 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.270
 victoria's secret lotions 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.640
 they are small enough to swim 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.790
 cosmetic as to swallow the bag 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.400
 and so to refresh I like to 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.560
 cool me 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.020
 I like it very much also these 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.400
 they are fresh there is one this is sweet this 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.670
 if it's a little sweet but like 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.160
 it also refreshes 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.490
 I like to wear them on the night that I 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.550
 bathroom so I can put them to sleep and I 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.770
 I love them very much they are very light 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.410
 they really last me all the time so 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.889
 I recommend them for when they are 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.590
 Because in the 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.770
 at work and with the warmth is the 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.680
 put and I swear they cool 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.720
 very much 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.240
 if you are interested in these networks that 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.479
 require paquito the link so that the 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.139
 go find this comes out to me I like 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.849
 very much 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.889
 I have not finished this perfume either 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.830
 but it's one of my favorites is the one 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.219
 I'm using more right now it's sweet this 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.779
 if it's sweet, it's like vanilla 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:29.700
 I can say because I read it in the box 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:33.800
 that smells like vanilla and this 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.800
 I love it very much 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.320
 I really like this one, I love it 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.030
 how it smells like I tell you if it's very sweet 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.920
 it's not for every day but for a 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.870
 special occasion so I that in this 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.569
 special occasion I put it matters 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.460
 I also like this one a lot 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.499
 I'm going to show you a perfume that swims 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.979
 what mail with my favorites and products 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:06:02.270
 finished is this one and the truth is that 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:05.570
 I do not like anything I do not like at all 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.580
 and I do not know I do not know why they smell rich and 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.060
 It smells rich but when putting it on 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.360
 no do not smell and how it smells hard here 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.370
 it's a smell and it's another that I do not like 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.300
 for nothing I know the truth so that what 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:23.270
 buy but good ended and and who 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.700
 know when this gays do not finish it 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.030
 finally it is this perfect that brought me 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.449
 my sister-in-law of Paris this come what 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.779
 beautiful 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.430
 this one is also super super strong one 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:39.789
 sum of my favorites because I do not use it 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:44.469
 a lot but if I have used it and it is also 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:46.809
 a perfume type and it is also a perfume 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.479
 that you wear it and you smell everything 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:52.330
 the time when I put it on and everything 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:55.749
 the time I'm smelling myself so it has 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.789
 a nice smell but I got dizzy so 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:00.460
 I do not like much that is if I like the 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:03.039
 smell but I do not like it so much 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.180
 what a mental dilemma and that's all 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:09.449
 favorite perfumes and not so favorite 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.370
 I have more but those are common 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:14.139
 relevant because I like them but they are not 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.810
 my favorites with the ones I put in from time to time 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.060
 when and these things that you know 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.969
 not one as a woman because it has like 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.680
 much of everything I believe and so of perfumes 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:26.379
 How do I love perfumes? 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.419
 I also have got varied but the 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:31.580
 that I teach them are like more my 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:33.939
 favorites are the ones that I more fair 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.349
 except this one who wanted to teach them 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:38.509
 then and the girls who use it have 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:43.069
 the same problem as me that is that the 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:44.990
 time to put on what smells different than 

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:49.069
 here in the little bottle I do not know if it's the 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:50.509
 unique or what is happening to me but that is 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:54.379
 everything for today I hope you liked it 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:58.870
 I send you a kiss from panda from 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:58.870
 here and see you in the next bye 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.510
 Y
