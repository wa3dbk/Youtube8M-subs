dividing<00:02:04.680> both<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.100> these<00:02:05.280> windows<00:02:05.670> down<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
dividing both of these windows down to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.680 
dividing both of these windows down to
create<00:02:06.840> four<00:02:07.229> different<00:02:07.259> 3d<00:02:08.099> view<00:02:08.520> windows

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
create four different 3d view windows

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.090 
create four different 3d view windows
so<00:02:11.690> we're<00:02:11.900> going<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.050> change<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.590> top-left

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
so we're going to change the top-left

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.100 
so we're going to change the top-left

we're<00:02:51.500> going<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.680> leave<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.980> bottom<00:02:52.280> left

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
we're going to leave the bottom left

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.750 
we're going to leave the bottom left
view<00:02:52.940> panel<00:02:53.420> as<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.709> treaty<00:02:54.709> perspective<00:02:55.489> view

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
view panel as a treaty perspective view

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.290 
view panel as a treaty perspective view
so<00:02:56.000> we<00:02:56.120> can<00:02:56.150> see<00:02:56.540> our<00:02:56.660> object<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:57.260> 3d<00:02:57.560> space<00:02:58.300> so

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
so we can see our object in 3d space so

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300 
so we can see our object in 3d space so
this<00:02:59.480> would<00:02:59.720> be<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.870> typical<00:03:00.260> 3d<00:03:00.739> modeling

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
this would be a typical 3d modeling

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.810 
this would be a typical 3d modeling
setup<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.750> very<00:03:02.989> useful<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.820> see

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
setup and it's very useful to see

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.640 
setup and it's very useful to see
objects<00:03:05.300> from<00:03:05.510> different<00:03:05.810> angles<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.440> this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
objects from different angles like this

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.430 
objects from different angles like this
especially<00:03:06.920> if<00:03:07.280> you're<00:03:07.430> tracing<00:03:07.820> an<00:03:08.440> object

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
especially if you're tracing an object

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.520 
especially if you're tracing an object
from<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.800> particular<00:03:10.310> perspective<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:12.110> to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
from a particular perspective so to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.060 
from a particular perspective so to
merge<00:03:12.800> windows<00:03:13.340> we<00:03:13.610> can<00:03:13.760> right-click<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:14.510> any

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
merge windows we can right-click on any

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.289 
merge windows we can right-click on any
dividing<00:03:16.070> line<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:17.239> select<00:03:18.019> join<00:03:18.650> area

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
dividing line and then select join area

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.580

from the drop-down menu there or

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.039 
from the drop-down menu there or
alternatively<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:23.239> can<00:03:23.390> grab<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.810> striped

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
alternatively you can grab the striped

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.050 
alternatively you can grab the striped
corner<00:03:24.470> from<00:03:24.650> one<00:03:24.890> window<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.250> drag<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.880> into

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
corner from one window and drag it into

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.569 
corner from one window and drag it into
another<00:03:26.390> one<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.049> then<00:03:27.620> select<00:03:28.010> which<00:03:28.220> window

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
another one and then select which window

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.430 
another one and then select which window
you<00:03:29.209> want<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.510> be<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.930> one<00:03:30.049> that's<00:03:30.260> left

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
you want to be the one that's left

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.210 
you want to be the one that's left
behind<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.200> next<00:03:33.380> we're<00:03:33.560> going<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.709> change<00:03:34.010> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
behind so next we're going to change the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.870 
behind so next we're going to change the
3d<00:03:34.700> View<00:03:35.000> window<00:03:35.030> into<00:03:35.780> an<00:03:35.930> outliner<00:03:36.530> window

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
3d View window into an outliner window

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.970 
3d View window into an outliner window
just<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.000> show<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.329> how<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.630> can<00:03:38.840> work<00:03:39.650> and

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
just to show you how you can work and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.600 
just to show you how you can work and
customize<00:03:40.670> your<00:03:40.700> treaty<00:03:41.180> space<00:03:41.570> here<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
customize your treaty space here and

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.770 
customize your treaty space here and
then<00:03:43.610> we're<00:03:43.730> going<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:43.880> change<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.299> outliner

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
then we're going to change the outliner

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.610 
then we're going to change the outliner
window<00:03:44.900> into<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.620> 3d<00:03:46.130> View<00:03:46.489> window<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:47.620> we're

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
window into a 3d View window and we're

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.009 
window into a 3d View window and we're
going<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.799> select<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.340> camera<00:03:49.610> view<00:03:50.000> from<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
going to select the camera view from the

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.930 
going to select the camera view from the
drop<00:03:51.200> down<00:03:51.230> menu<00:03:51.410> or<00:03:51.860> alternatively<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:52.850> can

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
drop down menu or alternatively you can

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.920 
drop down menu or alternatively you can
press<00:03:53.000> 0<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.079> your<00:03:54.500> number<00:03:54.829> pad<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.780> can

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
press 0 on your number pad so this can

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.380 
press 0 on your number pad so this can
be<00:03:57.049> very<00:03:57.230> useful<00:03:57.820> actually<00:03:58.820> if<00:03:58.910> you<00:03:59.060> want<00:03:59.239> to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
be very useful actually if you want to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.479 
be very useful actually if you want to
preview<00:03:59.720> of<00:04:00.049> what<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.350> camera<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.739> seeing<00:04:01.130> at

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
preview of what the camera is seeing at

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.360 
preview of what the camera is seeing at
all<00:04:01.700> times<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.769> basically<00:04:03.769> when<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.010> render

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
all times so basically when you render

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.069 
all times so basically when you render
your<00:04:04.400> animations<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.360> what<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.720> camera

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
your animations it's what the camera

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.199 
your animations it's what the camera
sees<00:04:06.109> so<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.160> always<00:04:07.310> have<00:04:07.400> this<00:04:07.730> preview

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
sees so you can always have this preview

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.569 
sees so you can always have this preview
up<00:04:08.359> in<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.600> top<00:04:08.780> right<00:04:08.989> corner<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:10.130> give<00:04:10.489> you

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
up in the top right corner to give you

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.220 
up in the top right corner to give you
an<00:04:10.700> idea<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.060> what<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.510> animation<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.079> going
