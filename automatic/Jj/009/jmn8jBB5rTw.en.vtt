 B 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.039
 W 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.560
 some band 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.939
 so good we're talking here about romario 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.939
 the Russian tennis player who at the same time with citizenship the country 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.199
 were found 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.199
 satisfied with the structure 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.630
 the historic center of Quito but we were talking before it happened 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.660
 I was asked when their allies because they create the worshiped and 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.580
 best way on the narrow rides to where you will make an experience 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.700
 I do not think so 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.340
 home based 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 talking is my heart 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 the candidate still the guests 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.210
 sitting 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.009
 this will make one of the main productive poles 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.830
 we are taking for chemical 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.370
 to understand how this future country 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.280
 we have here a copy of the country to the site that the price will be most of the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.549
 What are your customers? 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.579
 they can control the costs of the wrong turbid 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.049
 with these by plane being here you can see that it is a bag that has 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.810
 a charism within 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.400
 and how does this work? 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.450
 the parents manage to introduce within this tiger goals - however linked 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.370
 more or less quantity making it one more edition more 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.170
 heavy to get imposed and siena or down to accumulate water 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.140
 but I said most of the prices this month but not all 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.620
 because this country captive of them being the sharks 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.640
 and the beaches 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.380
 the shirt 1 other manaira 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 like fat in the liver but the best way but to register make a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.340
 years experience 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.070
 still 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 the fire arrives good things we will be with our clients 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 thank you very much 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.989
 It's a country they had 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.239
 thank you so much other fish 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.990
 So, what do we have here? We have two countries. 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.769
 check out 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.409
 The vain needs such heat here. 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.680
 so we have 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.230
 two countries this team has a buck with the art 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.099
 it is as if it is a possible country for courses to begin more easily 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.420
 and that we have a country what's in a bag with the little boy imagine that it's a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.779
 shark on the beach 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.059
 and that we can do we have to play our country both of us 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.779
 in vague chaos in the water see what happens 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.939
 We've already had our little fish. 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.229
 we have here 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.560
 the country has couscous and indemnities and allies 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.049
 click here a country that has the genius we seek to leave 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.659
 with his goal to the computer or with sufficient efforts there of the debate 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:02.129
 but the best way for us to have the function of the pretorious team 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.870
 is to imagine what would happen if it did not exist we need to do 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.019
 a bad thing does wrong expressomt wicket 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.219
 give us plants 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.889
 I'll do a bad thing, it's one of the countries 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.680
 I chose eight years ago 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.680
 why they play what has resulted in grain 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.989
 mr 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.369
 let's make a spring lasa me paris hilton and kim 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:26.829
 a needle 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.829
 and now we'll see what happens 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:36.249
 the house to succeed my land 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.120
 Saint-Etienne Pretoria 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.390
 go to the bottom 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.069
 while they try to continue here 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.129
 flowers of life 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.519
 future alert to judge yourself shark than you think 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.370
 hence why we have with this experience how it is that future parents 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.330
 I hope they have to be equal this victory at home and they will have liked 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330
 Ana, thank you so much. 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.449
 today we learn that this country has two ways of controlling the costs of 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.189
 event 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.109
 which are the circumstances of arriving at mogi's home in the territory 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.680
 this has caused global investments in staleness accumulated murmurs in the 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.759
 liver 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.979
 It's difficult but it's not 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:20.959
 then ax 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.959
 it is thanks to the parents who have appeared in events like the submarine 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.650
 after years of schema change promises 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.210
 make a great system of crimes I get boring 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.180
 So 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180
 this conquest 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.559
 the art 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:42.610
 Paulo 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.189
 it's our time 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.279
 we'll get to 15 of the voices at home we avoided and until the next 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:55.860
 because
