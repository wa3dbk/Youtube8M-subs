00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
this where luxury meet power so i'm very

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.870

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
what kind of what I'm worried about this

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.520 
what kind of what I'm worried about this
boat<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:21.959> going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> cost<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.440> lot

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
boat is that it's going to cost a lot

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.440 
boat is that it's going to cost a lot
I'm<00:02:22.620> Way<00:02:22.739> boats<00:02:23.069> in<00:02:23.220> GTA<00:02:23.520> 5<00:02:23.760> they<00:02:23.940> do<00:02:24.000> cost<00:02:24.300> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
I'm Way boats in GTA 5 they do cost a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.050 
I'm Way boats in GTA 5 they do cost a
lot<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.599> money<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:26.459> fact<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.730> not<00:02:26.910> many

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
lot of money and the fact that not many

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.180 
lot of money and the fact that not many
people<00:02:27.120> actually<00:02:27.420> use<00:02:27.720> boats<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.500> huge

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
people actually use boats is a huge

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.770 
people actually use boats is a huge
downside<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.760> pretty<00:02:30.209> much<00:02:30.300> everybody

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
downside for pretty much everybody

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.479 
downside for pretty much everybody
because<00:02:31.650> there's<00:02:31.860> not<00:02:31.920> many<00:02:32.010> people<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.340> use

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
because there's not many people that use

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.460 
because there's not many people that use
boats<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.030> if<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.209> costs<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.480> lot<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.630> money<00:02:33.720> why

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
boats and if it costs a lot of money why

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.870 
boats and if it costs a lot of money why
would<00:02:34.650> people<00:02:34.920> want<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.099> buy<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> boat<00:02:35.489> in<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
would people want to buy the boat in the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.130 
would people want to buy the boat in the
first<00:02:36.060> place<00:02:36.239> if<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.599> kind<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.810> makes<00:02:36.989> any

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
first place if that kind of makes any

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.660 
first place if that kind of makes any
sense<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.620> that's<00:02:38.220> why<00:02:38.400> I'm<00:02:38.459> worried<00:02:38.610> about

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
sense so that's why I'm worried about

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
sense so that's why I'm worried about
with<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> labid<00:02:39.300> data<00:02:39.330> Toro<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:40.019> long<00:02:40.200> as<00:02:40.380> it's

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
with the labid data Toro as long as it's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.020 
with the labid data Toro as long as it's
pretty<00:02:40.769> good<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.099> has<00:02:41.250> different<00:02:41.700> features

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
pretty good and has different features

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.949 
pretty good and has different features
