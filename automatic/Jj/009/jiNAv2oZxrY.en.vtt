00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.189 
as you can see i'm not actually manually
controlling<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.340> system<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.569> popping<00:04:22.960> up

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
controlling the system it is popping up

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:30.710 
controlling the system it is popping up
in<00:04:23.379> here<00:04:23.620> myself

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.140 

so<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.260> regime<00:04:31.620> will<00:04:31.830> hold<00:04:32.430> its<00:04:32.610> own<00:04:32.700> position

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
so the regime will hold its own position

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.050 
so the regime will hold its own position
in<00:04:33.360> GPS<00:04:33.780> lock<00:04:34.020> up<00:04:34.410> in<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> sky<00:04:34.950> as<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.670> can<00:04:35.850> see

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
in GPS lock up in the sky as you can see

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.140 
in GPS lock up in the sky as you can see
it<00:04:36.630> has<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.830> power<00:04:38.070> line<00:04:38.310> interview<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.060> it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
it has the power line interview and it

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.770 
it has the power line interview and it
as<00:04:39.270> simple<00:04:39.570> as<00:04:39.690> clicking<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:40.080> switch<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:42.510> an

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
as simple as clicking a switch and an

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.190 
as simple as clicking a switch and an
image<00:04:43.050> has<00:04:43.170> been<00:04:43.200> taken<00:04:44.750> do<00:04:45.750> not<00:04:45.930> get<00:04:46.050> much

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
image has been taken do not get much

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.340 
image has been taken do not get much
more<00:04:46.380> simple<00:04:46.800> now<00:04:46.980> but<00:04:47.490> once<00:04:47.640> again<00:04:48.350> image

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
more simple now but once again image

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.890 
more simple now but once again image
taken

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.200 

the<00:04:54.900> camera<00:04:55.290> system<00:04:55.620> also<00:04:55.800> can<00:04:56.160> be<00:04:56.210> zoomed

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
the camera system also can be zoomed

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:05.470 
the camera system also can be zoomed
from<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:58.020> ground<00:04:58.280> hold<00:04:59.280> em<00:04:59.490> great

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:06:05.610 

you

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.680 

as<00:06:06.220> you<00:06:06.400> can<00:06:06.520> see<00:06:06.760> that<00:06:06.940> was<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.060> very<00:06:07.240> simple

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
as you can see that was a very simple

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.120 
as you can see that was a very simple
and<00:06:07.900> quick<00:06:08.110> demonstration<00:06:08.350> of<00:06:08.979> how<00:06:09.070> the

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
and quick demonstration of how the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.550 
and quick demonstration of how the
microphone<00:06:09.699> system<00:06:10.090> can<00:06:10.270> be<00:06:10.300> used<00:06:10.660> to<00:06:10.930> monitor

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
microphone system can be used to monitor

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.939 
microphone system can be used to monitor
power<00:06:11.919> lines<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.820> very<00:06:13.120> simple<00:06:13.449> to<00:06:13.600> use<00:06:13.949> the

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
power lines is very simple to use the

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:16.710 
power lines is very simple to use the
machine<00:06:15.340> does<00:06:15.580> ninety<00:06:16.000> percent<00:06:16.120> of<00:06:16.419> the<00:06:16.510> work

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
machine does ninety percent of the work

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.379 
machine does ninety percent of the work
the<00:06:17.440> GPS<00:06:17.979> and<00:06:18.160> the<00:06:18.250> relative<00:06:18.639> sensors<00:06:19.030> inside

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
the GPS and the relative sensors inside

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.390 
the GPS and the relative sensors inside
it's<00:06:19.600> stabilized<00:06:20.440> the<00:06:20.620> machine<00:06:20.919> and<00:06:21.130> keep<00:06:21.250> it

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
it's stabilized the machine and keep it

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.879 
it's stabilized the machine and keep it
locked<00:06:21.639> in<00:06:21.790> and<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.479> very<00:06:22.810> little<00:06:23.020> work<00:06:23.320> left

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
locked in and is very little work left

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.280 
locked in and is very little work left
for<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.220> pilot<00:06:24.430> to<00:06:24.610> do<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:25.870> take<00:06:26.020> photographs

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
for the pilot to do to take photographs

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.110 
for the pilot to do to take photographs
from<00:06:26.680> paula's<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.220> saw<00:06:27.400> was<00:06:27.520> quite<00:06:27.699> simple

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
from paula's you saw was quite simple

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.450 
from paula's you saw was quite simple
it's<00:06:28.210> little<00:06:28.540> Airy<00:06:28.979> rotate<00:06:29.979> the<00:06:30.100> machine

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
it's little Airy rotate the machine

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.790 
it's little Airy rotate the machine
focus<00:06:31.150> in<00:06:31.300> on<00:06:31.389> the<00:06:31.510> subject<00:06:31.930> flick<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.680> switch

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
focus in on the subject flick a switch

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.969 
focus in on the subject flick a switch
and<00:06:33.040> it<00:06:33.940> takes<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.270> photo<00:06:34.479> simple<00:06:35.229> as<00:06:35.320> that<00:06:35.350> you

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
and it takes a photo simple as that you

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.710 
and it takes a photo simple as that you
also<00:06:36.130> have<00:06:36.370> zoom<00:06:36.639> so<00:06:36.910> you<00:06:37.030> can<00:06:37.180> zoom<00:06:37.330> in<00:06:37.540> on<00:06:37.630> the

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
also have zoom so you can zoom in on the

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.719 
also have zoom so you can zoom in on the
subject<00:06:38.110> at<00:06:38.199> hand<00:06:38.229> and<00:06:38.620> for<00:06:39.220> landing<00:06:39.550> it<00:06:39.639> as

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
subject at hand and for landing it as

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.580 
subject at hand and for landing it as
simple<00:06:40.030> as<00:06:40.150> just<00:06:40.330> bring<00:06:41.020> the<00:06:41.169> throttle<00:06:41.440> down

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
simple as just bring the throttle down

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.529 
simple as just bring the throttle down
and<00:06:41.949> the<00:06:42.310> machine<00:06:42.610> comes<00:06:42.789> down<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.270> the<00:06:43.330> stays

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
and the machine comes down and the stays

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.230 
and the machine comes down and the stays
in<00:06:43.690> the<00:06:43.750> GPS<00:06:44.169> hall<00:06:44.380> so<00:06:45.310> I<00:06:45.340> hope<00:06:45.669> that<00:06:45.940> gives<00:06:46.150> you

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
in the GPS hall so I hope that gives you

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.670 
in the GPS hall so I hope that gives you
a<00:06:46.330> bit<00:06:46.449> of<00:06:46.479> an<00:06:46.570> idea<00:06:46.780> as<00:06:46.990> to<00:06:47.020> how<00:06:47.229> the<00:06:47.289> system

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
a bit of an idea as to how the system

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:57.210 
a bit of an idea as to how the system
works<00:06:47.919> and<00:06:48.100> just<00:06:48.639> a<00:06:48.910> simple<00:06:49.210> issues

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220
