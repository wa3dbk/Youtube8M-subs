00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.340
 hello youtube friends tell you that 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.780
 extra that you are welcome to a new 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.210
 video of the halo campaign 2 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.820
 anniversary in legendary and in speed rom 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.890
 that's how the beta of gilo 5 came out but 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.990
 that will not stop me from continuing 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.910
 with the series is not pretty corny all 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.710
 but then I have to continue with this 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.140
 that I started and really if I should 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.180
 continue what since they were given 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.610
 account in the previous days I was 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.050
 inactive I did not upload any video and then 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 this is because it makes me sick like 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.949
 I had told them but I wanted to take advantage 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.920
 precisely those days to practice 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.450
 the missions before recording them and not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.420
 committed as much face as usual 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.300
 happen to me and then I have practiced 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.870
 the missions from here to the mission of 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.789
 start and I have them then so 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.469
 call it perfected but there's still 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.420
 certain parts that cost me work 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.489
 but well we're going to skip the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.379
 kinematics to do the tutorial of 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.509
 this little lug and in fact if it's going to 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.160
 be very short we are going to last around 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.590
 five or six minutes if we do it from 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.729
 perfect shape epically and the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.160
 first trick that I will show you 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.680
 is to kill all his classmates so 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.930
 as bill inquisitors that we are let's 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.280
 to kill all our little friends of 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 a very sadistic way and you guys 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.370
 They wonder why you did why 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.830
 you have done that morbid thing and 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.900
 disturbing and well this is only 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 with the aim that the door opens 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.490
 faster believe me I'm nothing sadistic and 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.770
 I do not like to kill people but then to 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.090
 sometimes you have to do it then we're going to 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.860
 start already in this part we are going to 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.950
 activate the bed so that nobody sees us 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.070
 nobody gives an unexpected warning grabs us 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.780
 fired then I do not know if in what 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.890
 just said it makes sense but 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.649
 ignore me and we will continue in this 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.850
 blue energy passageway I have no idea 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.649
 why they did but good is 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.330
 Pretty cool saves us time and here 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.770
 let's get back and let's put 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.660
 the elevator running this with the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.130
 goal of saving time we grab 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.619
 these grenades that we will be of 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.110
 utility and we fall safely to that we 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.540
 grab the damage attack or something by the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.330
 style that they know is not in halo 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.310
 2 then the next trick we 're going 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.989
 to do is to go through this area without 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.030
 see us no enemy and this is 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.709
 activating the bed but they have to 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.930
 activate it just before touching the ground 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.069
 seconds when they touch the ground the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.079
 enemies already 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.209
 you can see then the best is 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.939
 activate it as before and it will give us a 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.469
 control point super good for there it 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.730
 I forgot to grip the referrals then 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.959
 You know there's going to be a rifle here 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.689
 I hope that nobody saw me in fact 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.790
 I'm going to activate the bed 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.290
 l lit that at first they killed they had 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.639
 that grab the ace rifle but good if 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.680
 they did not can grab it from here 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.079
 in the middle and they're going to have bullets this 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.469
 to shoot the sentinels ok 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.209
 let's shoot here is perfect and 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.680
 here they are going to throw grenades here they are going to 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.989
 gather many enemies while 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.090
 it reaches the phantom and distracts them in 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.530
 a tribe that is quite epic to see 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.209
 here they are already taking care of the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.219
 sentinels we give you a super I've made 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.590
 these guys now yes it comes to our 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.329
 super pro team and once you see that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.680
 it is decision of all the enemies I want 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.709
 see who are left here in this 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.590
 felt the troll has more who more than 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.840
 missing is that there are more girls if they can 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.629
 get rid of them sooner because 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.060
 if it's a waste of time to see there 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.830
 I was dying trash now yeah they're going to 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.620
 check the sides 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.840
 these doors that are commonly going to 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.610
 open 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.709
 but that is already after they killed 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.510
 I think that they are already there 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.760
 sides with opens first opened is 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.010
 first they were going to shoot the browns 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.959
 that will come out with a cannon 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.390
 fuel and already once they killed 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.370
 everyone here is missing one they usually go to 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.970
 leave more after 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.349
 or if your breast super critical of the jewel 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.060
 I think there was another here but good 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.769
 they took care of them let's go 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.690
 approaching this door and let's wait 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.730
 to which the control point is made and there 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.709
 is once it is put it is going to open 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.480
 immediately and we are going to meet 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.700
 with this elite what we are going to do 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.620
 well this is very fast so I'll try 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.299
 to explain it as quickly as possible if 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.700
 they fail no matter what they can try 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.680
 Sometimes they want this is going to kill 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.150
 that is usually elite still does not 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.519
 it starts firing from behind and this is 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.049
 quite annoying I think almost never 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.000
 I think it had never happened to me but 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.680
 well here already if you can not kill it 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.260
 well ignore it activate the bed to 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.669
 that nobody of these see them this if 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.229
 can happen before the drones better 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.120
 I think nobody here saw me or yes but 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.710
 well I left them behind they have to do 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.389
 this I quickly tell you is one of 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.010
 the most difficult parts and here we go to 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.270
 wait for the bed to go 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.850
 make a jump to see if it comes out I do not 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.010
 it came out but well I hope it does not cause me 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.600
 problems here if he's cute he sees us going 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.039
 to be much better if he saw me 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.860
 but well we passed quickly this 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.090
 I hope I do not die and I hope that 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.890
 gave me a checkpoint that's going to be 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.840
 pretty useful to see 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.520
 although it does not give me time anymore, I do not 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.110
 Give time today let's do this 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.270
 quick to the first try to see if I 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.340
 it's really going, it's pretty hardcore 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.100
 we go active no no here they left 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.720
 these seven forget it we no longer have 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.880
 time and I'm going to join I know already I 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.830
 I know if I already knew one here and I 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.210
 I got rid of all these enemies it cost me 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.980
 a little bit of work but he already gave me a 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.600
 control point let's hope that it 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.360
 we activate the bed and now we are going to 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.030
 to do there, it did not work out for me here and 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.710
 now we do the jump to the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.690
 pillars as it should and here we are going to 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.430
 get out great ones for some reason like 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.960
 I was late they left there but 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.360
 good what they are going to do is ignore them 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.910
 activate the bed once they are 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.800
 be loaded and be sure that of 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.390
 that no one sees them then we go to 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.430
 jump now yes as it is due to this 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.009
 part I hope those enemies do not come out 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.680
 from there 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.569
 or that is normally can be of 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.669
 backs have to look at that and 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.249
 now if we activate the bed here I do not think 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.380
 that there was nobody but good 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:47.410
 we continue let's kill these gloves 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.760
 if they are lucky they can be 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.540
 hit on the back and do not see them but 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.120
 good 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.610
 here I already got rid of all this area was 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.380
 quite random this can also be 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.850
 cost work an alternative that 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.040
 can do is kill all the groups 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.690
 that they were coming out of the door but 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.130
 It is very slow and I prefer to do so 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.050
 crazy though it costs me several 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.540
 attempts but well maybe that's why 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.400
 I get to make such good times in x 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.980
 What are you going to do here ? 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.780
 the camera before but look, I had the 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.970
 lucky that those elites were 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.970
 back hurt too bad mind mind 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.350
 that is said u and this one unfortunately that 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.060
 means the medium but good not 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.620
 cause a lot of damage and then we have reached 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.120
 this part without any problem 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.700
 they saw the supercross jumps and 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.170
 they will have to practice them equally for 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.970
 that you come out in a super way 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.650
 pro and we're in the last part what 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.150
 The only thing you have to do is to 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.830
 right in the middle to see which door is 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.510
 open first here at the door of the 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.190
 right it opened they were going to see the radar ok 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.930
 they will see that the enemies have already 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.970
 left the door And now as 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.340
 have left active in bed leave without 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.900
 no risk and now if we have the 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.760
 free way to continue with the 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.750
 mission this the look is usually not 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.660
 there normally and already goes with his partner 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.030
 but hey it took he stayed behind what 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.070
 they left for forever alone and now yes 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.990
 let's continue we are already in last 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.090
 part already instead of following the phantom and 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.250
 that gives you hard turns here in the 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.350
 nothing simply we are already going in the 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.030
 final part of the mission and what we are going 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.740
 to do is to land the bungee just in 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.880
 half of here we will activate the bed 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:16.100
 we fall as bill companies that we are 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.620
 hunters inquisitors and now if 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.330
 we complete the mission of the inquisitor 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.220
 in eight minutes I think my record had 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.000
 been of 5 effectively in fact almost 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.110
 it reached a little person out there but 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.750
 I had done it in a practical way and 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.340
 fact I was quite surprised because what 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.130
 I did on my first attempt, that is, not fail 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.890
 in nothing but good I'm not perfect had 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.690
 that I had to make a mistake in something already 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.190
 you know I am that extra that the boy face 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.110
 but I hope you liked it 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.669
 this guide remember to leave your like for 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.020
 continue with the series and do not forget 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.900
 subscribe not to miss the 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:52.810
 content of the spiral so that has 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.810
 been everything that frac says goodbye
