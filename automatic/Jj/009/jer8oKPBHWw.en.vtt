00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.050

 is not Chinese to men likewise said

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.860
 imperceptible to the rest of the universe

 whose secrets are as immutable as they are external 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.780

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 the mistakes 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.310
 linked to our nature 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.800
 that those errors 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 do not be the source of our calamities 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.850
 in this world 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.870

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.440
 they are built by oblivion 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.020
 that makes us capable of practicing 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.350
 the most fruity sadism 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 that in our families love cea 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.990
 whoever prevented our own borders will remind us 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.010
 that we are also able to practice 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.010
 Acts of truth and compassion 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.990
 and if now our understanding 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.650

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.670
 with each beat of our heart 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 everything good that we have received 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 enjoying it to the fullest 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.900
 that when speaking 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.450
