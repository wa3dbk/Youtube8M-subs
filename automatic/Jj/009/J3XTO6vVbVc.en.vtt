this<00:00:41.969> pollen<00:00:42.329> pattern<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> lot<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
this pollen pattern a lot I like it a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.369 
this pollen pattern a lot I like it a
lot<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.969> wish<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> fingers<00:00:46.170> were<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
lot I just wish that the fingers were a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
lot I just wish that the fingers were a
little<00:00:46.530> longer<00:00:46.829> because<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.149> end

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
little longer because like they end

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.709 
little longer because like they end
there<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:48.750> my<00:00:48.870> fingers<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:50.039> here

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
there but my fingers and like down here

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.720 
there but my fingers and like down here
so<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> does<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> close<00:00:53.579> your

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so what that does is when you close your

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.540 
so what that does is when you close your
palm<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.300> makes<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.660> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.070> cut<00:00:56.070> or<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
palm it makes it kind of cut or when you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
palm it makes it kind of cut or when you
close<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.760> hand<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.300> makes<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> palm<00:00:57.840> kind

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
close your hand it makes the palm kind

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.150 
close your hand it makes the palm kind
of<00:00:58.410> fold<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.070> itself<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> sometimes<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
of fold up on itself so sometimes it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
of fold up on itself so sometimes it
makes<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.760> able<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.149> feel<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> stick<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
makes you not able to feel to stick that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.649 
makes you not able to feel to stick that
