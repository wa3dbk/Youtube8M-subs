GTA online now if you're not familiar
with<00:00:11.130> what<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.670> helicopter<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.269> it's

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
with what this helicopter is it's

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.990 
with what this helicopter is it's
actually<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.230> main<00:00:13.549> helicopter<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.730> lot

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
actually the main helicopter that a lot

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.540 
actually the main helicopter that a lot
of<00:00:15.089> people<00:00:15.299> use<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.809> multiplayer<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.590> GTA<00:00:17.039> 4<00:00:17.130> it

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
of people use in multiplayer in GTA 4 it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070 
of people use in multiplayer in GTA 4 it
was<00:00:17.640> one<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.180> found<00:00:18.359> at<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> airport

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
was one that you found at the airport

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.390 
was one that you found at the airport
and<00:00:19.260> everybody<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.800> had<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> blast<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.310> it

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and everybody just had a blast with it

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.519 
and everybody just had a blast with it
and<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.820> actually<00:00:21.210> got<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.689> GTA<00:00:22.050> online<00:00:22.080> as

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and we actually got it in GTA online as

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.810 
and we actually got it in GTA online as
you<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.340> weird<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> way

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you see now it's weird the way

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.000 
you see now it's weird the way
helicopters<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:24.900> spawn<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.439> GTA<00:00:25.949> online

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
helicopters actually spawn in GTA online

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.970 
helicopters actually spawn in GTA online
so<00:00:26.279> basically<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.599> happens<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.230> depending

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
so basically what happens is depending

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.589 
so basically what happens is depending
on<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.220> rank<00:00:29.609> there's<00:00:29.939> gonna<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> certain

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
on your rank there's gonna be a certain

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
on your rank there's gonna be a certain
type<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> helicopter<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> will<00:00:31.800> spawn<00:00:32.130> at

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
type of helicopter that will spawn at

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.799 
type of helicopter that will spawn at
the<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.880> know<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> helipad

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the you know that on the helipad

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
the you know that on the helipad
so<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.559> example<00:00:35.070> there's<00:00:35.610> two<00:00:35.969> basic

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
so for example there's two basic

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
so for example there's two basic
helicopters<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.290> figure<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.620> they're<00:00:37.770> called

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
helicopters I figure what they're called

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
helicopters I figure what they're called
but<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.520> no<00:00:38.760> military<00:00:39.090> no<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.750> know

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
but there are no military no you know

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
but there are no military no you know
anything<00:00:40.590> there's<00:00:40.739> civilian<00:00:41.190> helicopters

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
anything there's civilian helicopters

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.180 
anything there's civilian helicopters
they<00:00:41.820> fit<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.239> people<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.780> there's<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.980> think

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
they fit for people and there's I think

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
they fit for people and there's I think
it's<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> ten<00:00:45.270> maybe<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.899> then

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it's from like one to ten maybe and then

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's from like one to ten maybe and then
from<00:00:46.590> 10<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.370> 25<00:00:48.059> somewhere<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.660> that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
from 10 to I think 25 somewhere in that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
from 10 to I think 25 somewhere in that
area<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> haven't<00:00:49.559> figured<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.370> that's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
area I haven't figured out and that's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.860 
area I haven't figured out and that's
the<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.910> maybe<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> guys<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.690> help

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the thing that maybe you guys can help

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.529 
the thing that maybe you guys can help
me<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.410> don't<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.980> precisely<00:00:53.610> what

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
me on but we don't know precisely what

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
me on but we don't know precisely what
level<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.160> are

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
level you actually get these are

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.740 
level you actually get these are
unlocked<00:00:56.789> these<00:00:57.000> things<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.510> these

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
unlocked these things on these

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.529 
unlocked these things on these
helicopters<00:00:58.079> anyway<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.850> 110

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
helicopters anyway so from like 110

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
helicopters anyway so from like 110
there's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> normal<00:01:01.199> helicopter<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.250> 10

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
there's a normal helicopter then from 10

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
there's a normal helicopter then from 10
to<00:01:02.520> maybe<00:01:02.640> 25<00:01:03.120> there's<00:01:03.359> another<00:01:03.660> normal

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to maybe 25 there's another normal

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.050 
to maybe 25 there's another normal
helicopter<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.619> from<00:01:04.769> 25<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.729> figure

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
helicopter then from 25 so we figure

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.500 
helicopter then from 25 so we figure
about<00:01:06.270> 35<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.189> cargobob<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
about 35 there is the cargobob which I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.910 
about 35 there is the cargobob which I
already<00:01:09.689> made<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> video<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.229> before<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
already made a video on that before and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.190 
already made a video on that before and
then<00:01:11.490> we're<00:01:11.729> figuring<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:13.020> firm

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
then we're figuring is because my firm

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
then we're figuring is because my firm
is<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.409> 35<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:13.979> 36<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.670> game<00:01:14.880> maybe<00:01:15.420> from

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
is like 35 or 36 in this game maybe from

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.410 
is like 35 or 36 in this game maybe from
35<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.500> 50<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.250> something<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
35 to 50 or something like that is the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.090 
35 to 50 or something like that is the
annihilator<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.439> 50<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.890> we

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
annihilator and then from 50 on we

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.429 
annihilator and then from 50 on we
figure<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.840> actual

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
figure is going to be the actual

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.440 
figure is going to be the actual
helicopter<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
helicopter that you can find in the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
helicopter that you can find in the
military<00:01:24.869> base<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
military base with I think it's like the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.260 
military base with I think it's like the
little<00:01:26.130> bird<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> shoots<00:01:27.060> rockets

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
little bird you know it shoots rockets

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.210 
little bird you know it shoots rockets
and<00:01:27.720> missiles<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:28.950> we're<00:01:29.070> that's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and missiles so that's what we're that's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740 
and missiles so that's what we're that's
what<00:01:29.579> we're<00:01:29.850> hoping<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.420> said<00:01:30.570> maybe

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
you guys can help us in the comments
maybe<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> level<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.840> 70<00:01:34.259> or

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
maybe if you are a level you know 70 or

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
maybe if you are a level you know 70 or
something<00:01:34.710> go<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> helipad<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> check<00:01:36.119> out

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
something go to a helipad and check out

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.090 
something go to a helipad and check out
and<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.689> actual<00:01:37.259> vehicle<00:01:37.560> spawns<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
and see what actual vehicle spawns and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.520 
and see what actual vehicle spawns and
let<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.850> anyway<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.990> Annihilator

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
let me know but anyway the Annihilator

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
let me know but anyway the Annihilator
is<00:01:40.729> pretty<00:01:41.729> much<00:01:41.939> exactly<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.630> GTA<00:01:43.079> 4<00:01:43.290> except

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
is pretty much exactly like GTA 4 except

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.080 
is pretty much exactly like GTA 4 except
it<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.950> reticle<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> lot

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it has a little reticle which is a lot

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.940 
it has a little reticle which is a lot
better<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.630> shooting<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.770> sort

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
better for shooting because you can sort

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.109 
better for shooting because you can sort
of<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.220> where<00:01:47.460> you're<00:01:47.670> aiming<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
of know where you're aiming that the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.060 
of know where you're aiming that the
only<00:01:48.270> problem<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.409> goes<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.860> every

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
only problem is and this goes for every

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.020 
only problem is and this goes for every
helicopter<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> can't<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.390> aim<00:01:51.689> down<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
helicopter you can't really aim down to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.940 
helicopter you can't really aim down to
it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> greatest<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.079> I'll<00:01:55.409> sort<00:01:55.799> some

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it's not the greatest and I'll sort some

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010 
it's not the greatest and I'll sort some
clips<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.759> me<00:01:56.969> maybe<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.540> suck<00:01:57.719> an<00:01:57.869> ally

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
clips of me maybe I just suck an ally

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
clips of me maybe I just suck an ally
but<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.189> bit<00:01:59.310> difficult<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.759> aim

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
but it is a little bit difficult to aim

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060 
but it is a little bit difficult to aim
it's<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.479> mainly<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.860> hope

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
it's it's mainly just for you know hope

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.740 
it's it's mainly just for you know hope
you<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:02.310> lucky<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.790> try<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> kill<00:02:03.509> somebody

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you get lucky and try to kill somebody

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.569 
you get lucky and try to kill somebody
but<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> still<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.740> pretty<00:02:04.829> cool<00:02:05.070> because<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
but it still is pretty cool because you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.249 
but it still is pretty cool because you
can't<00:02:05.820> find<00:02:06.060> these<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.360> single-player<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
can't find these in single-player and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.540 
can't find these in single-player and
it's<00:02:07.920> always<00:02:08.099> coolest<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.970> know<00:02:09.060> mess<00:02:09.209> okay

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
it's always coolest you know mess okay

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.040 
it's always coolest you know mess okay
especially<00:02:10.030> people<00:02:10.150> that<00:02:10.330> don't<00:02:10.540> know<00:02:10.720> what's

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
especially people that don't know what's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.600 
especially people that don't know what's
happening<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.590> about<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> helicopters<00:02:12.490> and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
happening and about the helicopters and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.740 
happening and about the helicopters and
stuff<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.910> could<00:02:13.060> fly<00:02:13.210> this<00:02:13.270> around<00:02:13.510> they're

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
stuff you could fly this around they're

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.390 
stuff you could fly this around they're
like<00:02:13.870> oh<00:02:13.960> my<00:02:13.990> god<00:02:14.380> how<00:02:14.620> did<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.860> get<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> you

think I don't think it I think the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.990 
think I don't think it I think the
cargobob<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.130> only<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.460> actually<00:02:21.610> fits

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
cargobob is only one that actually fits

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.940 
cargobob is only one that actually fits
six<00:02:22.300> people<00:02:22.600> obviously<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.530> people<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.100 
me actually trying to go against two
police<00:02:27.910> helicopters<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.570> as<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.750> see<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> am

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
police helicopters and as you see I am

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.750 
police helicopters and as you see I am
just<00:02:29.530> terrible<00:02:29.980> maybe<00:02:30.190> if<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.400> get<00:02:30.610> your

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
just terrible maybe if you get your

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.190 
just terrible maybe if you get your
flying<00:02:31.090> skill<00:02:31.480> up<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.720> might<00:02:31.840> help<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.170> little

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
flying skill up it might help a little

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400 
flying skill up it might help a little
bit<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:34.000> can't<00:02:34.060> tribe<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> heli<00:02:35.230> at

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
bit but I just I can't tribe a heli at

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.840 
bit but I just I can't tribe a heli at
all<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.740> I<00:02:36.160> mean<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.400> don't<00:02:36.460> know<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:36.730> these

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
all and I mean I don't know if these

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.850 
all and I mean I don't know if these
bullets<00:02:37.240> are<00:02:37.360> merely<00:02:37.720> meant<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.170> damage<00:02:38.710> other

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
bullets are merely meant to damage other

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.440 
bullets are merely meant to damage other
helis<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.490> mean<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.730> would<00:02:39.820> think<00:02:40.000> they<00:02:40.180> would

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
helis I mean you would think they would

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.450 
helis I mean you would think they would
so<00:02:40.630> I'm<00:02:40.840> assuming<00:02:41.050> there<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.500> like<00:02:41.650> 50<00:02:42.010> you

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
so I'm assuming there can be like 50 you

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.880 
so I'm assuming there can be like 50 you
know<00:02:42.550> 50<00:02:42.790> caliber<00:02:43.180> rounds<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:43.870> they<00:02:44.530> really

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
know 50 caliber rounds but they really

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.350 
know 50 caliber rounds but they really
don't<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.160> too<00:02:45.280> much<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.730> see<00:02:45.940> most<00:02:46.210> of

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
don't do too much and as you see most of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.970 
don't do too much and as you see most of
the<00:02:46.480> stuff<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.960> actually<00:02:47.170> damage<00:02:47.620> Ellie's<00:02:47.860> with

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the stuff I actually damage Ellie's with

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.440 
the stuff I actually damage Ellie's with
it's<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.280> by<00:02:48.430> me<00:02:48.640> running<00:02:48.970> into<00:02:49.180> him<00:02:49.390> in

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
it's just by me running into him in

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.960 
it's just by me running into him in
midair<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> maybe<00:02:51.220> they<00:02:51.490> should<00:02:51.730> I

Annihilator or if you have to go to the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.590 
Annihilator or if you have to go to the
actual<00:03:18.370> base<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.180> know<00:03:19.270> one<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.480> the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
actual base you know one of the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.360 
actual base you know one of the
helicopter<00:03:20.080> pads<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.440> get<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.709> because<00:03:21.190> I

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
helicopter pads to get it because I

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.890 
helicopter pads to get it because I
think<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.640> issue<00:03:21.790> we<00:03:21.970> might<00:03:22.090> run<00:03:22.270> into<00:03:22.330> is

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
think the issue we might run into is

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.260 
think the issue we might run into is
that<00:03:23.200> say<00:03:23.680> somebody<00:03:24.070> wants<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.340> cargobob<00:03:24.910> but

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
that say somebody wants a cargobob but

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.690 
that say somebody wants a cargobob but
their<00:03:25.420> level<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:25.840> 50<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:27.340> don't<00:03:27.520> have

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
their level like 50 and they don't have

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.760 
their level like 50 and they don't have
one<00:03:27.970> no<00:03:28.120> more<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:28.959> know<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.200> doesn't<00:03:29.350> spawn

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
one no more you know it doesn't spawn

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.310 
one no more you know it doesn't spawn
then<00:03:30.670> they're<00:03:31.030> kind<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.420> screwed<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.959> don't

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
then they're kind of screwed so I don't

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.410 
then they're kind of screwed so I don't
know<00:03:32.410> if<00:03:32.709> Rockstar<00:03:33.550> really<00:03:33.850> meant<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.060> do<00:03:34.209> that

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
know if Rockstar really meant to do that

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.449 
know if Rockstar really meant to do that
or<00:03:34.660> what<00:03:34.990> you<00:03:35.470> know<00:03:35.560> hopefully<00:03:35.770> we<00:03:36.070> can<00:03:36.100> call

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
or what you know hopefully we can call

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.920 
or what you know hopefully we can call
them<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.000> phone<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.209> choose<00:03:37.570> sort<00:03:37.870> of

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
them in the phone and choose sort of

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.140 
them in the phone and choose sort of
what<00:03:38.140> helicopter<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:38.800> want<00:03:39.120> because<00:03:40.120> that

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
what helicopter we want because that

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.760 
what helicopter we want because that
would<00:03:40.510> be<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.630> lot<00:03:40.780> more<00:03:40.959> convenient<00:03:41.410> because

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
would be a lot more convenient because

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.770 
would be a lot more convenient because
obviously<00:03:42.130> car<00:03:42.610> blobs<00:03:42.940> are<00:03:43.060> really<00:03:43.240> fun<00:03:43.480> and

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
obviously car blobs are really fun and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.440 
obviously car blobs are really fun and
they're<00:03:44.260> in<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.680> middle<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:45.220> who<00:03:45.790> knows<00:03:46.000> like

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
they're in the middle so who knows like

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.400 
they're in the middle so who knows like
I<00:03:46.480> said<00:03:46.720> we've<00:03:46.930> still<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.140> lot<00:03:47.380> more

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
I said we've still a lot more

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.260 
I said we've still a lot more
exploration<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.280> do<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.430> lot<00:03:48.700> more<00:03:48.880> cool<00:03:49.120> stuff

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
exploration to do a lot more cool stuff

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.210 
exploration to do a lot more cool stuff
one<00:03:49.840> thing<00:03:50.020> I<00:03:50.080> do<00:03:50.140> want<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.350> mention<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.920> this

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
one thing I do want to mention in this

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.400 
one thing I do want to mention in this
video<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.180> also<00:03:52.390> works<00:03:52.810> for<00:03:53.050> planes

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
video is that this also works for planes

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.500 
video is that this also works for planes
so<00:03:53.740> if<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.980> ever<00:03:54.100> go<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.550> think<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.240> only

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
so if you ever go to I think the only

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.820 
so if you ever go to I think the only
one<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.840> really<00:03:55.930> have<00:03:56.320> found<00:03:56.500> maybe

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
one that I really have found maybe

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.230 
one that I really have found maybe
there's<00:03:57.070> some<00:03:57.310> at<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.610> airport<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.060> haven't

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
there's some at the airport I haven't

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.370 
there's some at the airport I haven't
really<00:03:58.390> looked<00:03:58.510> too<00:03:58.720> much<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.050> airport

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
really looked too much in the airport

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.800 
really looked too much in the airport
cuz<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.709> locked<00:03:59.950> but<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.820> know<00:04:00.880> for<00:04:01.270> sure<00:04:01.300> at

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
cuz it is locked but I know for sure at

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.440 
cuz it is locked but I know for sure at
Trevor's<00:04:02.620> Air<00:04:02.800> Base<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.010> sandy<00:04:03.550> shores<00:04:03.790> you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
Trevor's Air Base and sandy shores you

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.530 
Trevor's Air Base and sandy shores you
can<00:04:04.660> find<00:04:04.990> the<00:04:05.590> helicopter<00:04:06.130> pad<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
can find the helicopter pad and the

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.810 
can find the helicopter pad and the
hangar<00:04:07.930> with<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.290> plane<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.860> usually<00:04:09.640> it'll

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
hangar with the plane and usually it'll

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.550 
hangar with the plane and usually it'll
spawn<00:04:10.150> either<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.570> think<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:11.140> think<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.470> goes

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
spawn either I think I think it goes

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.740 
spawn either I think I think it goes
like<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.800> crop<00:04:12.070> duster<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:13.150> one<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.570> other

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
like the crop duster to one of the other

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.960 
like the crop duster to one of the other
smaller<00:04:14.140> planes<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.739> actually<00:04:15.160> once<00:04:15.850> you

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
smaller planes and actually once you

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.060
