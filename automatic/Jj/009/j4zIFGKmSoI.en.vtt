00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
video on the computer itself and the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.849 
video on the computer itself and the
hardware<00:00:05.580> I'm<00:00:05.700> running<00:00:06.350> the<00:00:07.350> case<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.770> an

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
hardware I'm running the case is an

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.900 
hardware I'm running the case is an
antec<00:00:08.690> p180<00:00:09.690> three<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.349> think<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.759> not

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
antec p180 three I think it is it's not

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.190 
antec p180 three I think it is it's not
really<00:00:12.030> gay<00:00:12.360> miss<00:00:12.570> case<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.929> doesn't<00:00:13.110> have

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
really gay miss case it doesn't have

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.890 
really gay miss case it doesn't have
windows<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> side<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.900> millions

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
windows in the side of it and millions

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.720 
windows in the side of it and millions
of<00:00:15.990> blue<00:00:16.260> LEDs<00:00:16.800> like<00:00:17.130> every<00:00:17.369> other<00:00:17.430> gamers

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
of blue LEDs like every other gamers

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.880 
of blue LEDs like every other gamers
casing<00:00:18.330> too<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:18.869> yeah<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:19.410> not<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.560> into

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
casing too but yeah I'm not really into

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.109 
casing too but yeah I'm not really into
that<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.310> care<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.670> looks<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.939> us

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that I really care what it looks like us

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.859 
that I really care what it looks like us
as<00:00:21.210> long<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> functions<00:00:21.750> well<00:00:23.660> its<00:00:24.660> got<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
as long as it functions well its got the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.420 
as long as it functions well its got the
side<00:00:25.170> panels<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:25.890> thick<00:00:26.250> its

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
side panels of what really thick its

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.779 
side panels of what really thick its
aluminium<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.980> plastic<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
aluminium and then a plastic in the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.859 
aluminium and then a plastic in the
middle<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.240> another<00:00:30.510> layer<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
middle and then another layer of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.860 
middle and then another layer of
aluminium<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> outside<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.239> really

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
aluminium on the outside so it's really

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
aluminium on the outside so it's really
good<00:00:34.050> keeping<00:00:34.290> them<00:00:34.469> always<00:00:34.649> inside<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.930> even

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
good keeping them always inside it even

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720 
good keeping them always inside it even
the<00:00:37.020> front<00:00:37.260> door<00:00:37.440> itself<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.160> opens<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the front door itself when it opens is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.130 
the front door itself when it opens is
heavy<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.719> tell<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
heavy you can actually tell the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.369 
heavy you can actually tell the
difference<00:00:40.440> when<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> close<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:42.379> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
difference when you close it of the the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.779 
difference when you close it of the the
noise<00:00:43.590> level<00:00:43.739> drops<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.430> can't<00:00:44.610> hear<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
noise level drops you can't hear the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.920 
noise level drops you can't hear the
fans<00:00:45.030> anymore<00:00:46.640> I've<00:00:47.640> modified<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
fans anymore I've modified this one a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.090 
fans anymore I've modified this one a
bit<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> top<00:00:49.440> exhaust<00:00:50.329> fan<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:52.440> used<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
bit the top exhaust fan I used to have

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.389 
bit the top exhaust fan I used to have
like<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:54.500> piece<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> metal<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> same

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
like a piece of metal it's the same

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.299 
like a piece of metal it's the same
shape<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.910> fan<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> mean

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
shape as the fan if you get what I mean

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
shape as the fan if you get what I mean
so<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.609> would<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> reverse<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.570> wouldn't

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
so it would be reverse so you wouldn't

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.060 
so it would be reverse so you wouldn't
see<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.989> label<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.500> web<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.859> used<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
see the label in a web but it used to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
see the label in a web but it used to
make<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> racket<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.760> thing<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> trembled

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
make a racket that thing so I trembled

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.399 
make a racket that thing so I trembled
that<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.530> also<00:01:05.430> dremel<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> there's<00:01:07.229> two

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
that out also dremel the there's two

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
that out also dremel the there's two
fans<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> front<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:10.280> dremel<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> grill<00:01:11.909> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
fans in the front I dremel the grill in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
fans in the front I dremel the grill in
there<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:13.200> more<00:01:13.350> air<00:01:13.470> flow<00:01:13.650> under<00:01:13.950> stop<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there for more air flow under stop the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
there for more air flow under stop the
goddamn<00:01:14.460> noise<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.470> these

grill and it just sounds like a jet
engine<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.130> I've<00:01:23.869> dremel<00:01:24.869> tool<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> up

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
engine so I've dremel tool it up

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.609

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
hardware itself from running it's a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.580 
hardware itself from running it's a
gigabyte<00:01:29.509> was<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> an<00:01:30.780> ax<00:01:31.140> 58<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.040> d3r<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:34.470> was

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
gigabyte was it an ax 58 you d3r it was

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
gigabyte was it an ax 58 you d3r it was
pretty<00:01:34.799> good<00:01:35.180> when<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> bought<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
pretty good when I bought it about a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410 
pretty good when I bought it about a
year<00:01:37.020> ago<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.329> not

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
year ago I think so it's not it's not

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.399 
year ago I think so it's not it's not
that<00:01:39.630> good<00:01:39.810> anymore<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.380> still<00:01:40.890> does<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> job

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
that good anymore but still does the job

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
pretty good overclock horican anyway I'm

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.120 
pretty good overclock horican anyway I'm
happy<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.850> antec<00:01:59.850> kuhler<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:02.450> 620

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
happy with it antec kuhler is it a 620

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.069 
happy with it antec kuhler is it a 620
first<00:02:05.130> time<00:02:05.909> I've<00:02:06.060> ever<00:02:06.149> used<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.630> instead

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
first time I've ever used that instead

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.160 
first time I've ever used that instead
we're<00:02:07.290> cool<00:02:08.479> yeah<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.869> does<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.020> good

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
we're cool yeah I think it does a good

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.110 
we're cool yeah I think it does a good
job<00:02:10.229> notice<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> massive<00:02:11.340> drop<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.550> temp<00:02:11.879> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
job notice the massive drop in temp I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.820 
job notice the massive drop in temp I
did

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
did

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.190 
did
too<00:02:14.270> gentle<00:02:15.270> typhoon<00:02:15.800> 18<00:02:17.120> 50<00:02:18.120> rpm<00:02:18.360> fans<00:02:18.900> in

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.560 
too gentle typhoon 18 50 rpm fans in
push-pull<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.830> there's<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> side

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
push-pull so there's one on that side

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.970 
push-pull so there's one on that side
pushing<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.870> there's<00:02:21.990> one<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.650> exhaust

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
pushing and there's one on the exhaust

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.330 
pushing and there's one on the exhaust
side<00:02:23.250> pulley<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.840> not<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:24.870> say<00:02:25.110> oh<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:26.130> costs

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
side pulley I not just say oh it costs

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.100 
side pulley I not just say oh it costs
too<00:02:26.520> much<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.240> equitable<00:02:27.660> something<00:02:28.050> he

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
too much for that equitable something he

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.870 
too much for that equitable something he
is<00:02:28.170> better<00:02:28.350> which<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.590> true<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.220> rip<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
is better which is true but I rip the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.120 
is better which is true but I rip the
fans<00:02:30.090> out<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.450> my<00:02:30.570> old<00:02:30.630> one<00:02:30.870> my<00:02:31.710> old<00:02:31.890> computer

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
fans out of my old one my old computer

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.460 
fans out of my old one my old computer
so<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.490> didn't<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:32.880> pay<00:02:33.870> for<00:02:34.080> them<00:02:34.170> anyway

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
so I didn't really pay for them anyway

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.750 
so I didn't really pay for them anyway
they<00:02:34.680> were<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:34.890> sitting<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> spares<00:02:35.520> box

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
they were just sitting the spares box

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.450 
they were just sitting the spares box
thought<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> put<00:02:36.240> them<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:38.360> graphics<00:02:39.360> card<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
thought I put them on graphics card is a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.710 
thought I put them on graphics card is a
gigabyte<00:02:42.470> what<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.760> 69<00:02:44.760> 70<00:02:45.210> HD

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
gigabyte what is it a 69 70 HD

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.870 
gigabyte what is it a 69 70 HD
overclocked<00:02:48.720> version<00:02:49.110> 2<00:02:49.230> gigabyte<00:02:49.680> I've<00:02:49.920> got

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
overclocked version 2 gigabyte I've got

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.370 
overclocked version 2 gigabyte I've got
the<00:02:51.000> other<00:02:51.090> one<00:02:51.210> sitting<00:02:51.720> here<00:02:51.870> or<00:02:51.990> better<00:02:52.170> put

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
the other one sitting here or better put

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.590 
the other one sitting here or better put
that<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.680> that's<00:02:53.160> why<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.580> pieces<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.570> I

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
that in that's why it's in pieces so I

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.810 
that in that's why it's in pieces so I
have<00:02:54.780> crossfire<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.500> second<00:02:57.800> Ram<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.130> was<00:02:59.670> it

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
have crossfire on a second Ram is was it

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.330 
have crossfire on a second Ram is was it

6 eb white said just what I decatur

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.780 
6 eb white said just what I decatur
remember<00:03:02.810> g.skill<00:03:03.810> trident<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:05.220> think<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.550> is

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.410 

yeah<00:03:08.790> whatever<00:03:09.950> I've<00:03:10.950> got<00:03:11.610> another<00:03:12.000> knock<00:03:12.240> to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
yeah whatever I've got another knock to

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.090 
yeah whatever I've got another knock to
a<00:03:12.450> fan<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.900> there<00:03:13.110> because<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.770> was<00:03:13.800> an<00:03:13.920> empty

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
a fan in there because it was an empty

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.410 
a fan in there because it was an empty
space<00:03:14.340> i<00:03:14.520> thought<00:03:14.670> i<00:03:14.700> might<00:03:14.820> just<00:03:14.880> double<00:03:15.240> side

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
space i thought i might just double side

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.790 
space i thought i might just double side
tape<00:03:15.450> but<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.870> never<00:03:16.110> helps<00:03:16.200> without<00:03:16.560> air<00:03:16.770> flow

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
tape but it never helps without air flow

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.280 
tape but it never helps without air flow
over<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.360> processor<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.390> bit<00:03:19.550> there's<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.610> USB

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
over the processor a bit there's a USB

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.930 
over the processor a bit there's a USB
3.0<00:03:22.290> little<00:03:22.920> piece<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.220> your<00:03:23.310> card<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.760> there

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
3.0 little piece of your card in there

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.540 
3.0 little piece of your card in there
that's<00:03:24.720> what<00:03:25.100> just<00:03:26.100> cuz<00:03:26.220> i've<00:03:26.340> got<00:03:26.489> an

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
that's what just cuz i've got an

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.240 
that's what just cuz i've got an
external<00:03:26.970> hard<00:03:27.000> drive<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:28.290> runs<00:03:28.500> on<00:03:28.650> USB<00:03:28.920> so

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
external hard drive that runs on USB so

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.250 
external hard drive that runs on USB so
i<00:03:29.280> figured<00:03:29.610> on<00:03:29.700> use<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.090> extra<00:03:30.930> speed<00:03:33.260> hard

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
i figured on use the extra speed hard

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.860 
i figured on use the extra speed hard
drives<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.130> case<00:03:35.459> are<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.239> little

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
drives in this case are in this little

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.990 
drives in this case are in this little
tray<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.800> pull<00:03:38.010> out<00:03:38.100> if<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.760> undo

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
tray that you can pull out if you undo

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the screw to slides out and slides back

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.009 
the screw to slides out and slides back
in<00:03:40.680> there's<00:03:41.340> another<00:03:41.580> tray<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.630> goes<00:03:42.840> in

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
in there's another tray that goes in

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.740 
in there's another tray that goes in
there<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.350> can<00:03:43.500> carry<00:03:43.680> more<00:03:44.310> hard<00:03:44.610> drives

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
there that can carry more hard drives

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.300 
there that can carry more hard drives
but<00:03:45.750> obviously<00:03:46.050> with<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.440> graphics<00:03:46.890> card<00:03:47.130> it

but obviously with this graphics card it

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.580 
but obviously with this graphics card it
won't<00:03:47.459> fit<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.760> there<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:49.019> have<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.260> do<00:03:49.380> L

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
won't fit in there so you have to do L

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.860 
won't fit in there so you have to do L
lose<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.070> ability<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.550> put<00:03:50.760> more<00:03:51.390> than<00:03:51.600> for

I'm<00:03:57.720> hoping<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.230> second<00:03:58.530> one<00:03:58.680> should<00:03:59.130> fit

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
I'm hoping the second one should fit

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.940 
I'm hoping the second one should fit
while<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.730> can<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.209> can<00:04:00.510> see<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.750> will<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.769> don't

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
while I can I can see it will so I don't

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.490 
while I can I can see it will so I don't
think<00:04:02.130> I'll<00:04:02.220> have<00:04:02.310> an<00:04:02.400> issue<00:04:02.489> with<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:03.500> but

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
think I'll have an issue with that but

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.910 
think I'll have an issue with that but
yeah<00:04:06.410> well<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.620> there's<00:04:08.130> two<00:04:09.440> two<00:04:10.440> hard<00:04:10.799> drives

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
yeah well so there's two two hard drives

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.259 
yeah well so there's two two hard drives
both<00:04:12.440> western<00:04:13.440> digital<00:04:13.769> caviar<00:04:13.920> black<00:04:14.340> one

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
both western digital caviar black one

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.449 
both western digital caviar black one

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
term wattage one for storage and one for

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.909 
term wattage one for storage and one for

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
the operating system and all the games

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.380 
the operating system and all the games
and<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:21.080> power<00:04:22.080> suppliers<00:04:22.500> an<00:04:22.740> antec<00:04:23.100> CPI<00:04:23.940> 50

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
and that power suppliers an antec CPI 50

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.640 
and that power suppliers an antec CPI 50
which<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.080> over

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
which is the over

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.380 
which is the over
oversized<00:04:26.650> ones<00:04:26.920> that<00:04:27.730> there's<00:04:28.150> pretty<00:04:28.330> much

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
oversized ones that there's pretty much

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.260 
oversized ones that there's pretty much
designed<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.110> fit<00:04:29.290> in<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.500> case<00:04:29.790> it<00:04:30.790> came

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
designed to fit in this case it came

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.610 
designed to fit in this case it came
with<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.570> case<00:04:31.750> I've<00:04:31.900> had<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.050> room<00:04:32.290> how<00:04:32.440> much<00:04:32.590> a

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
with the case I've had a room how much a

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.480 
with the case I've had a room how much a
paper<00:04:32.920> was<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.160> long<00:04:33.340> time<00:04:33.520> ago<00:04:35.220> whats<00:04:36.220> am<00:04:36.340> I

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
paper was a long time ago whats am I

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.420 
paper was a long time ago whats am I
done<00:04:37.650> I<00:04:38.760> think<00:04:39.760> that's<00:04:39.880> about<00:04:40.000> it<00:04:40.150> ah<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:41.920> top

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
done I think that's about it ah that top

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.550 
done I think that's about it ah that top
fan<00:04:42.700> which<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.150> supposed<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.450> be<00:04:43.540> exhaust<00:04:43.930> or

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
fan which is supposed to be exhaust or

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.500 
fan which is supposed to be exhaust or
i'd<00:04:45.340> assume<00:04:45.670> it's<00:04:45.850> supposed<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.240> exhaust

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
i'd assume it's supposed to be exhaust

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.000 
i'd assume it's supposed to be exhaust
because<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.840> think<00:04:47.080> hot<00:04:47.230> air<00:04:47.380> would<00:04:47.500> rise<00:04:47.710> so

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
because you think hot air would rise so

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.760 
because you think hot air would rise so
every<00:04:48.490> top<00:04:48.670> one<00:04:48.850> will<00:04:49.000> be<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.150> blowhole<00:04:49.770> I've

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
every top one will be a blowhole I've

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.440 
every top one will be a blowhole I've
reversed<00:04:51.190> it<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.490> had<00:04:51.790> air<00:04:51.940> coming<00:04:52.180> in<00:04:52.420> and

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
reversed it and had air coming in and

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.600 
reversed it and had air coming in and
some<00:04:53.140> reason<00:04:53.470> I've<00:04:53.590> got<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> massive<00:04:54.250> drop<00:04:54.580> in

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
some reason I've got a massive drop in

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.150 
some reason I've got a massive drop in
temperatures<00:04:55.150> I'm<00:04:55.270> assuming<00:04:55.690> because<00:04:55.780> it

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
temperatures I'm assuming because it

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.140 
temperatures I'm assuming because it
sucking<00:04:57.160> air<00:04:57.370> in<00:04:57.400> at<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.670> top<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:57.910> then

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
sucking air in at the top and then

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.580 
sucking air in at the top and then
pushing<00:04:58.420> it<00:04:58.510> through<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.750> radiator<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.560> I

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
pushing it through the radiator so I

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.330 
pushing it through the radiator so I
just<00:04:59.800> left<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.190> that<00:05:00.340> way<00:05:01.890> whatever<00:05:02.890> works<00:05:03.160> I

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
just left it that way whatever works I

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.020 
just left it that way whatever works I
suppose<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:04.420> pretty<00:05:04.630> much<00:05:04.720> every<00:05:05.080> fan<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:06.030> this

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
suppose so pretty much every fan in this

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.260 
suppose so pretty much every fan in this
case<00:05:07.300> is<00:05:08.160> an<00:05:09.160> inlet<00:05:09.640> fan<00:05:09.910> except<00:05:10.720> for<00:05:10.750> the

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
case is an inlet fan except for the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.930 
case is an inlet fan except for the
push-pull<00:05:13.270> exhausting<00:05:14.110> at<00:05:14.230> the<00:05:14.320> back<00:05:14.470> there

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.340 

when<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:18.970> put<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.180> two<00:05:19.240> graphics<00:05:19.750> card<00:05:19.960> in<00:05:20.140> I'm

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
when I put the two graphics card in I'm

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.890 
when I put the two graphics card in I'm
probably<00:05:20.620> going<00:05:21.040> to<00:05:21.160> cut<00:05:21.400> some<00:05:22.240> holes<00:05:22.450> in<00:05:22.810> the

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
probably going to cut some holes in the

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.250 
probably going to cut some holes in the
side<00:05:23.110> of<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.290> case<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:24.340> put<00:05:24.550> a<00:05:25.090> 120<00:05:25.870> mph<00:05:26.020> and

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
side of the case and put a 120 mph and

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.220 
side of the case and put a 120 mph and
blowing<00:05:26.560> air<00:05:27.430> onto<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:28.050> ones<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.170> the

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
blowing air onto the ones of the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.430 
blowing air onto the ones of the
graphics<00:05:29.620> card<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:31.210> post<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.840> video<00:05:32.020> when<00:05:32.320> i<00:05:32.380> do

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
graphics card so post a video when i do

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.100 
graphics card so post a video when i do
that<00:05:32.560> but<00:05:33.400> on<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.850> that's<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.600> setup<00:05:34.870> i

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
that but on that that's the setup i

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.080 
that but on that that's the setup i
think<00:05:35.320> it<00:05:35.410> is<00:05:35.550> yeah<00:05:36.550> I<00:05:36.670> think<00:05:36.790> I've<00:05:36.970> covered

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
think it is yeah I think I've covered

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.370 
think it is yeah I think I've covered
everything<00:05:37.390> that's<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.720> setup<00:05:37.930> as<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.200> runs

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
everything that's the setup as it runs

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.470 
everything that's the setup as it runs
at<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.650> moment<00:05:40.050> that's<00:05:41.050> all<00:05:41.140> I<00:05:41.260> got
