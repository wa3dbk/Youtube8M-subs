and start pulling here through that way

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.270 
and start pulling here through that way
that's<00:01:02.540> what<00:01:02.660> I<00:01:02.690> normally<00:01:02.810> do<00:01:03.410> right<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:04.100> the

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
that's what I normally do right on the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.490 
that's what I normally do right on the
top<00:01:04.580> here<00:01:05.980> and<00:01:06.980> I<00:01:07.100> clip<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.750> then<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.110> start

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
top here and I clip it and then I start

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.570 
top here and I clip it and then I start
just<00:01:09.710> going<00:01:10.010> around

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
just going around

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.670 
just going around
I<00:01:10.700> have<00:01:11.300> not<00:01:11.479> clipped<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:11.990> in<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.200> back<00:01:12.380> yet

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
I have not clipped it in the back yet

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.020 
I have not clipped it in the back yet
because<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.010> gives<00:01:13.250> me<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.580> freedom<00:01:13.760> to

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
because this gives me the freedom to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.150 
because this gives me the freedom to
just<00:01:14.510> keep<00:01:15.050> pulling<00:01:15.320> my<00:01:15.620> hair<00:01:15.830> through

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
just keep pulling my hair through

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.860 
just keep pulling my hair through
wherever<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.670> go<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.150> see<00:01:17.390> I'm<00:01:17.510> kind<00:01:17.720> of

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
wherever I go you see I'm kind of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.120 
wherever I go you see I'm kind of
cavalier<00:01:18.800> about<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.990> don't<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.470> know<00:01:21.590> really

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
cavalier about it don't you know really

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.330 
cavalier about it don't you know really
rhyme<00:01:22.790> or<00:01:23.000> reason<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.690> just<00:01:23.900> keep<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.229> going

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
rhyme or reason and just keep it going

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.800 
rhyme or reason and just keep it going
so<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.369> think<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.850> have<00:01:26.060> enough<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.600> hair

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
so I think I have enough of the hair

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.290 
so I think I have enough of the hair
pulled<00:01:27.140> out

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:51.010

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:05.700 

and<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.950> brushed<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.370> in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.280 

as<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.400> can<00:02:06.640> see<00:02:06.940> it's<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.570> basic<00:02:08.050> same

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
as you can see it's the basic same

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.390 
as you can see it's the basic same
hairstyle<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:10.119> my<00:02:10.270> hair<00:02:10.509> moves<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.680> can't<00:02:12.040> see

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400

when I'm going to take it off and I wear
mine<00:02:18.220> all<00:02:18.250> day<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:19.500> never<00:02:20.500> leave<00:02:20.920> hope<00:02:21.130> about<00:02:21.460> it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
mine all day I never leave hope about it

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:33.150 
mine all day I never leave hope about it
I'm<00:02:22.120> here<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.570> fall<00:02:26.700> clip<00:02:27.700> here<00:02:28.950> here<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
I'm here in just fall clip here here and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.550 
I'm here in just fall clip here here and
I<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.430> gently<00:02:33.850> pull<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.330> through<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:35.410> was

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
I just gently pull it through that was

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.480 
I just gently pull it through that was
one<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.920> things<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.340> was<00:02:36.460> really

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
one of the things that was really

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.370 
one of the things that was really
important<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.390> me<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:37.690> when<00:02:38.050> we<00:02:38.170> have

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
important to me because when we have

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.190 
important to me because when we have
this<00:02:38.500> thin<00:02:38.800> here<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.100> breaks<00:02:39.310> easy<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.450> this

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
this thin here it breaks easy and this

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.340 
this thin here it breaks easy and this
way<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.470> take<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.980> off<00:02:42.070> very
