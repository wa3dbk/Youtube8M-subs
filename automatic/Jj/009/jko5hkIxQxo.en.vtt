okay<00:00:07.080> today<00:00:07.379> we're<00:00:07.589> talking<00:00:07.710> about<00:00:07.919> aging<00:00:08.490> so

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
okay today we're talking about aging so

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.200 
okay today we're talking about aging so
aging<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.500> lifting<00:00:11.190> one<00:00:11.550> side<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.030> boat

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
aging is lifting one side of the boat

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.110 
aging is lifting one side of the boat
all<00:00:12.780> right<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.139> holding<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> up<00:00:13.940> okay

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
all right and holding it up okay

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.820 
all right and holding it up okay
we<00:00:15.450> need<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.839> out<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.960> edge<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.619> need<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
we need to be out of edge and we need to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.160 
we need to be out of edge and we need to
be<00:00:16.890> able<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.070> hold<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.369> steady<00:00:17.760> edge<00:00:18.180> when<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:19.020> go

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
be able to hold a steady edge when we go

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.080 
be able to hold a steady edge when we go
to<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> river<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.920> look<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.609> doing<00:00:20.820> things

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
to the river and look at doing things

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.870 
to the river and look at doing things
like<00:00:21.240> edy<00:00:21.689> turns<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.320> theory<00:00:22.650> glides<00:00:22.920> okay

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
like edy turns and theory glides okay

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.670 
like edy turns and theory glides okay
edging<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.570> those<00:00:24.660> key<00:00:24.960> skills<00:00:25.199> that

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
edging was one of those key skills that

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.130 
edging was one of those key skills that
everybody<00:00:26.189> needs<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.580> able<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.539> as

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
everybody needs to be able to do and as

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
everybody needs to be able to do and as
students<00:00:28.650> turn<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> grade<00:00:29.730> 2

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
students turn up to the grade 2

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900 
students turn up to the grade 2
certificate<00:00:30.779> course<00:00:31.189> with<00:00:32.189> me<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.759> can

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
certificate course with me and they can

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
certificate course with me and they can
already<00:00:33.180> edge<00:00:33.570> they're<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.590> cuts

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
already edge they're just like cuts

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
already edge they're just like cuts
through<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.610> much<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> learning<00:00:36.270> time<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
through so much of the learning time and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
through so much of the learning time and
we<00:00:37.140> could<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.800> stuff<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> river

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
we could get on with stuff on the river

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
we could get on with stuff on the river
straightaway<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.290> could<00:00:40.440> totally

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
straightaway so you could totally

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.209 
straightaway so you could totally
practice<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.820> flat<00:00:42.059> water<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> here

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
practice this on the flat water so here

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.000 
practice this on the flat water so here
it<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> Yugi<00:00:45.120> what's<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> best<00:00:46.110> way<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> lift

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it is Yugi what's the best way to lift

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.479 
it is Yugi what's the best way to lift
an<00:00:47.340> edge<00:00:47.640> okay<00:00:48.800> initially<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> might<00:00:50.129> think

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
an edge okay initially you might think

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.069 
an edge okay initially you might think
that<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.090> want<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> lean<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.780> one

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that we just want to lean out to one

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.760 
that we just want to lean out to one
side<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.829> yes<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.399> does<00:00:53.430> lift<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> edge

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
side and yes that does lift at the edge

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.299 
side and yes that does lift at the edge
but<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.520> doesn't<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.289> keep<00:00:58.289> us<00:00:58.440> stable<00:00:58.739> all

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
but it doesn't really keep us stable all

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.610 
but it doesn't really keep us stable all
right<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.820> what<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.090> want<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.629> instead<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
right so what we want to do instead is

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.050 
right so what we want to do instead is
think<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:02.820> rotating<00:01:04.159> okay<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.880> we

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
think about actually rotating okay if we

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.740 
think about actually rotating okay if we
can<00:01:06.270> rotate<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.580> knee<00:01:08.850> will<00:01:09.299> naturally

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
can rotate then one knee will naturally

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.630 
can rotate then one knee will naturally
lift<00:01:10.320> okay<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.060> rotate<00:01:12.510> towards<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.640> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
lift okay so if I rotate towards you the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.170 
lift okay so if I rotate towards you the
left<00:01:14.880> knee<00:01:15.090> lifts<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:17.009> aging<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.580> again

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
left knee lifts and I'm aging now again

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.990 
left knee lifts and I'm aging now again
I<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.570> hold<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.960> rotation<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:20.610> long<00:01:20.880> as

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I can just hold this rotation as long as

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.399 
I can just hold this rotation as long as
I<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.960> right

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
I want all right

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.780 
I want all right
another<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.250> doing<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.729> just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
another thing that I'm doing is just

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.240 
another thing that I'm doing is just
crunching<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.509> my<00:01:24.659> left<00:01:24.869> side<00:01:25.110> okay

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
crunching in my left side okay

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.480 
crunching in my left side okay
just<00:01:26.939> helping<00:01:27.630> hold<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.049> left<00:01:28.290> knee<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.680> yeah

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
just helping hold that left knee up yeah

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.910 
just helping hold that left knee up yeah
and<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.180> notice<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.900> turn<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and you notice that if I turn this this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.840 
and you notice that if I turn this this
way<00:01:32.900> okay<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.140> keep<00:01:34.380> aging<00:01:34.670> you'll<00:01:35.670> see

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
way okay and I keep aging you'll see

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
way okay and I keep aging you'll see
that<00:01:35.970> my<00:01:36.119> body<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.630> still<00:01:36.869> centered<00:01:37.350> over<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that my body is still centered over the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.069 
that my body is still centered over the
boat<00:01:37.920> by<00:01:38.189> heaven<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> haven't<00:01:39.329> changed<00:01:39.840> where

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
boat by heaven I haven't changed where

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.100 
boat by heaven I haven't changed where
my<00:01:40.290> head<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.729> or<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> top<00:01:42.180> half<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.689> body<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110

my head is or with a top half my body is
so<00:01:43.290> I'm<00:01:43.380> staying<00:01:43.619> centered<00:01:44.040> over<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> middle

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so I'm staying centered over the middle

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
so I'm staying centered over the middle
of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.060> bottom<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.890> aging

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
of the bottom all right so that's aging

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.950 
of the bottom all right so that's aging
this<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.149> rotate<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> other

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
this way now I just rotate to the other

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.260 
this way now I just rotate to the other
side<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.860> each<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> other<00:01:50.460> way

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
side to each the other way

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.080 
side to each the other way
so<00:01:53.049> you<00:01:53.530> want<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.770> practice<00:01:54.009> eating<00:01:54.759> while

some<00:01:56.770> forward<00:01:57.100> strokes<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.729> I'm<00:01:58.119> gonna

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
some forward strokes and I'm gonna

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:21.080 
some forward strokes and I'm gonna
practice<00:01:58.479> eating

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.170 

so<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:22.239> talked<00:02:22.420> about<00:02:22.450> three<00:02:23.140> levels<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.680> ditch

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
so we talked about three levels of ditch

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.479 
so we talked about three levels of ditch
decoders<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.209> one<00:02:25.690> two<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.170> three<00:02:26.650> okay

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
decoders that one two and three okay

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.199 
decoders that one two and three okay
little<00:02:28.239> one<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:30.040> basically<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.849> little

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
little one it's basically just a little

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.050 
little one it's basically just a little
bitty<00:02:31.390> huge<00:02:31.660> okay<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:32.860> I'm<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.220> slightly

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
bitty huge okay so I'm just slightly

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.860 
bitty huge okay so I'm just slightly
rotating<00:02:34.799> putting<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:35.830> little<00:02:35.950> bit<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.129> huge<00:02:36.310> on

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
rotating putting a little bit of huge on

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.470 
rotating putting a little bit of huge on
level<00:02:37.870> two<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:39.040> where<00:02:39.340> I'm<00:02:40.000> sitting<00:02:40.360> over

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
level two is where I'm sitting over

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.600 
level two is where I'm sitting over
where<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.959> boat<00:02:41.170> naturally<00:02:41.829> wants<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.190> sit<00:02:42.459> on

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
where the boat naturally wants to sit on

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.000 
where the boat naturally wants to sit on
its<00:02:42.760> secondary<00:02:43.329> stability<00:02:43.989> okay<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.739> that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
its secondary stability okay so that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.300 
its secondary stability okay so that
would<00:02:45.099> be<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:45.280> level<00:02:45.640> two<00:02:45.790> there<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:48.130> now

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
would be like level two there and now

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.520 
would be like level two there and now
the<00:02:48.579> level<00:02:48.610> three<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:52.239> way<00:02:52.660> over<00:02:52.959> here<00:02:53.290> right

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
the level three is way over here right

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.479 
the level three is way over here right
on<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.640> edge<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:55.150> tipping<00:02:56.049> over<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.650> what<00:02:57.430> I

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
on the edge of tipping over so what I

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.630 
on the edge of tipping over so what I
want<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.849> do<00:02:58.060> now<00:02:58.299> is<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.950> some<00:03:00.190> aging

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
want you to do now is do some aging

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.780 
want you to do now is do some aging
paddling<00:03:01.599> in<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.750> circle<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.440> try<00:03:03.099> out<00:03:03.370> three

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
paddling in a circle and try out three

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.930 
paddling in a circle and try out three
levels<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.239> edge<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.750> circle<00:03:05.290> with

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
levels of edge and do a circle with

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.360 
levels of edge and do a circle with
level<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.090> edge<00:03:07.299> then<00:03:07.840> try<00:03:08.049> level<00:03:08.379> two<00:03:08.590> then

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
level one edge then try level two then

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.059 
level one edge then try level two then
try<00:03:09.640> level<00:03:09.849> three<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.959> should<00:03:10.989> probably<00:03:11.620> fall

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
try level three you should probably fall

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.740 
try level three you should probably fall
upside<00:03:12.489> down<00:03:12.730> when<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.000> try<00:03:13.180> level<00:03:13.389> three

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
upside down when you try level three

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.599 
upside down when you try level three
okay<00:03:14.350> if<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.590> don't<00:03:14.739> fall<00:03:14.980> upside<00:03:15.400> down

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
okay if you don't fall upside down

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.569 
okay if you don't fall upside down
you're<00:03:16.090> probably<00:03:16.150> not<00:03:16.510> trying<00:03:16.840> hard<00:03:17.049> enough

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
you're probably not trying hard enough

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.180 
you're probably not trying hard enough
or<00:03:18.579> you're<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.819> a<00:03:19.060> mad<00:03:19.450> superstar<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.560> give

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
or you're just a mad superstar so give

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.059 
or you're just a mad superstar so give
it<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.340> go<00:03:21.660> one<00:03:22.660> two<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:22.930> three<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.709> was<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:23.920> bit

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
it a go one two and three it was a bit

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.510 
it a go one two and three it was a bit
check<00:03:24.280> catch<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.359> later
