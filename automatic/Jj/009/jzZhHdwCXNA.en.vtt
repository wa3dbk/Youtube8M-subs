00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 just like that 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.220
 hello dear 1000 ps fans heartily 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.880
 Welcome to another episode of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.340
 star trek walls we test today 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.289
 spaceship the excelsior class the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 honda goldwing f 6 c is new spaceship 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.670
 maybe a bit over the top 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.900
 Above all, we have recently 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.190
 cultus honda tested the looks 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.940
 actually more like a spaceship 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.670
 out but the f 6 c or gold wing f 6 c 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 honda is already a car 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.089
 very close if you just the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.379
 Performance data you would rather hear one 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.479
 car think six-cylinder boxer engine 1.8 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.220
 liter displacement could actually be one 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.040
 subaru may even be a new one 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.600
 porsche a small wheelbase 17 meters 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.900
 that could probably be a smart too 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.240
 his weight 3 141 kilo that's it 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.930
 a very high weight class 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.619
 motorcycles the engine itself 116 ps the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.619
 is now relatively leisurely though 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.940
 torque 167 newton meters at 4000 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.560
 turns so that pushes already 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.220
 really powerful 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.290
 the engine sonorous very gently and I have 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.480
 Remember today on wet 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 underground because that pretty fast that 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.840
 rear wheel does not spin 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.270
 There is traction control 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.610
 obviously not yet for the gold 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.430
 Wing row should be as fast as possible 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.800
 be retrofitted because otherwise it is 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.390
 pretty wet on wet 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.520
 controllable if you have the gas 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.680
 but of course has turned up of course 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.930
 Much fun made mister colleague code like 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.409
 was with you yes So I think once 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.460
 the motorcycle optically a force 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.500
 I think best describes everything 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.880
 very blurry graphically want through 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.720
 those huge cool ones on the left and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.850
 right, I think a bit sad 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.860
 if that would not then you will 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.330
 that six cylinder so gorgeous the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 So it will stand out a bit 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.330
 that is unfortunately the reason it has massive 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.730
 were therefore also installed the footpegs 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.069
 a little further back we noticed 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.260
 So you do not sit like we are from the cruiser 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.409
 or joggers are supposed to capture almost us 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.420
 naked bike very far down super wide 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.260
 seat extremely comfortable and for me too 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.480
 the motor 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.430
 absolute madness so that's still 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 motorcycles me after 45 years 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.569
 the motorcycle editor fascinate 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.360
 I really sat down on it sounded 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 this turbine-like and then the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.329
 shock though the motorcycle like that 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.930
 are incredibly hard are easy 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.590
 really cool 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.040
 yes as I said from the engine hard 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.090
 thrilled this high-powered but 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.200
 in reality also very gentle 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.629
 you have to say you arrive anyway because 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.790
 that's going on hard I was earlier 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.980
 a 30s zone and if the engine is still 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.220
 is cold one is a beautiful 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.680
 Tempomat because my father at 35 to 40 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.109
 km / h in the gas and you can also completely 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.519
 loose with the fifth firstly once 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.620
 drive away what you do not necessarily 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.200
 should make with coupling grind 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.879
 but what do I know from 20 km h the fifth 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.329
 inside we just do not care about madrid 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.659
 to have 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.459
 that just pulls up and yes, that's it 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.129
 Of course it's fun, but I want it 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.730
 has already mentioned when wet have 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.609
 I already drove before this serious 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.560
 a lot of respect and not so 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.599
 but somehow so much 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.000
 respect that I am not there now 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.400
 to give mourning full throttle in the curves 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.160
 how was that with you I have today too 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.690
 if then in the wet or almost 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.579
 So I'm afraid of this 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.660
 it is extended that he essential 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.970
 Affordable 55 hp s3 automatic transmission 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.260
 Although also by also has 200 interests 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.230
 but there is certainly much 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.180
 less mass and if there is something in there 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.169
 then you really have to go awkward 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.419
 also be the hat 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.370
 but the brakes but the suspension 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.909
 actually surprisingly I tighten my 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.919
 The fork is also a monster 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.290
 and that fits everything so that's it 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.239
 not soft or spongy now 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.090
 that's the big advantage so too 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.470
 one has existing health club then has 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.539
 one still has control and, above all, 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.260
 Transparency but as I said when you do that 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.389
 once loses then really something going on 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.690
 and I never want to experience it 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.310
 me not because under 3 141 kilo 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.460
 I did not have to be buried 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.870
 I need help then, unfortunately 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.840
 what else is there to say about the optics 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.490
 the front 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.440
 just as important by the cooler as 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.020
 You already said that is not 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.470
 maybe nice but it is 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.900
 independent so the 6c gold wing is 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.750
 in my opinion of under theirs 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.240
 almost sisters through them 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.180
 nudity the most impression 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.669
 because the engine is the most powerful 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.620
 otherwise windbreak comes out of course 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.520
 Of course hardly given 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.919
 Overall, I want to say this is one 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.430
 Of course, expensive motorcycle and and 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.160
 a very extravagant but you can see 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.860
 bring somebody with it 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.750
 will that be the 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.750
 has taste or that he just 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.750
 extraordinary 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.540
 then on every corner so that's it 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.250
 I think something extraordinary 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.360
 That's why a motorcycle is also used for 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.420
 Of course, too expensive for us 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.610
 far too expensive I think first 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.130
 interesting, I was still commenting that 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.780
 honda started with the late 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.880
 six cylinders also so extraordinary 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.310
 produce derivatives 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.780
 there is also this beta version and 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.410
 so that's actually all relatively late 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.270
 come 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.550
 and then I find a pity if 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.440
 already such a motorcycle then you have to the 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.860
 every corner every millimeter has to fit 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.840
 and if I as the taps me 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.540
 extraordinary or the levers the 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.580
 Hebel and that is for me too 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.540
 still that has to be in the last corner 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.910
 just fit that I think too bad 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.290
 All in all extremely impressive and me 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.220
 I'm also one of course, then 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:18.800
 like to show with something like that if I have 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.700
 I might have found the money then maybe 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.020
 also the fw 6c their rules less something 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.580
 you are not good because that will never be 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.780
 but we have the pleasure that 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.169
 we have a lot of fun 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.240
 made 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.480
 Thanks to Honda and have fun with it 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.480
 the video
