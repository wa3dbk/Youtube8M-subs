00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.639 

this<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.480> create<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.810> clipping<00:00:07.080> mask<00:00:07.200> in

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
this is how to create a clipping mask in

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.270 
this is how to create a clipping mask in
Adobe<00:00:08.099> Illustrator<00:00:08.750> so<00:00:09.750> sometimes<00:00:10.530> when<00:00:11.130> we

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
Adobe Illustrator so sometimes when we

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.549 
Adobe Illustrator so sometimes when we
have<00:00:11.429> artwork<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.420> board<00:00:12.660> we<00:00:13.080> want<00:00:13.349> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
have artwork on the board we want to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.890 
have artwork on the board we want to
make<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> clipping<00:00:14.790> mask<00:00:14.820> essentially<00:00:15.719> what<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
make a clipping mask essentially what a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.900 
make a clipping mask essentially what a
clipping<00:00:16.230> mask<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.820> it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
clipping mask is it's like think of it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.810 
clipping mask is it's like think of it
like<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.240> window<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.779> house<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.520> you<00:00:20.520> want<00:00:20.730> to

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
like a window to a house and you want to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.790 
like a window to a house and you want to
open<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.150> window<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.109> actually<00:00:22.560> see

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
open that window so you can actually see

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800 
open that window so you can actually see
everything<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.340> inside<00:00:23.760> or<00:00:24.090> within<00:00:24.510> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
everything that's inside or within that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.170 
everything that's inside or within that
window<00:00:25.260> frame<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.250> that's<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> clipping

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
window frame so that's what a clipping

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.740 
window frame so that's what a clipping
mask<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.340> let's<00:00:29.340> go<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> our<00:00:30.330> tools<00:00:30.570> panel

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
mask is and let's go to our tools panel

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.130 
mask is and let's go to our tools panel
and<00:00:31.109> we'll<00:00:31.800> draw<00:00:32.130> out<00:00:32.309> some<00:00:32.520> rectangles<00:00:33.140> we

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and we'll draw out some rectangles we

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.450 
and we'll draw out some rectangles we
love<00:00:34.500> rectangles<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.579> happy<00:00:35.880> little<00:00:36.059> trees

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
love rectangles like happy little trees

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:52.959 
love rectangles like happy little trees
rectangles<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:41.180> let's<00:00:42.180> draw<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.079> couple<00:00:43.379> more

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.219 

little<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> make<00:00:54.479> it<00:00:54.510> yellow

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
little one and make it yellow

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.789 
little one and make it yellow
all<00:00:55.739> right<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.899> essentially<00:00:57.899> again<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.769> a

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
all right so essentially again what a

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.680 
all right so essentially again what a
clipping<00:00:59.159> mask<00:00:59.190> does<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.659> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
clipping mask does is it's it's like a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.910 
clipping mask does is it's it's like a
window<00:01:01.679> and<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:03.120> will<00:01:03.479> only<00:01:03.719> show<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
window and it will only show you what is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.609 
window and it will only show you what is
within<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.030> frame<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.750> window<00:01:07.170> itself

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
within the frame of that window itself

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.279 
within the frame of that window itself
so<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> use<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> circle<00:01:09.539> as<00:01:09.689> our

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
so we're going to use a circle as our

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.520 
so we're going to use a circle as our
clipping<00:01:10.680> mask<00:01:11.479> what<00:01:12.479> we'll<00:01:12.630> do<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.140> we'll<00:01:13.380> go

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
clipping mask what we'll do is we'll go

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
clipping mask what we'll do is we'll go
over<00:01:13.679> to<00:01:13.920> our<00:01:14.009> tools<00:01:14.450> we'll<00:01:15.450> click<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
over to our tools we'll click the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
over to our tools we'll click the
rectangle<00:01:15.899> and<00:01:16.229> hold<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> down<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.740> we'll<00:01:17.250> go

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
rectangle and hold it down and we'll go

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.359 
rectangle and hold it down and we'll go
down<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.759> ellipse<00:01:18.119> tool<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:19.190> we<00:01:20.190> can

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
down to the ellipse tool and we can

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
down to the ellipse tool and we can
create<00:01:20.899> let's<00:01:21.899> create<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.380> regular<00:01:22.799> size

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
create let's create a regular size

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.070 
create let's create a regular size
circle<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.690> this<00:01:24.929> circle<00:01:25.229> black

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
circle and let's make this circle black

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.399 
circle and let's make this circle black
all<00:01:28.080> right<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.080> is<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.289> can

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
all right now what we can do is we can

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.529 
all right now what we can do is we can
place<00:01:31.709> this<00:01:31.950> circle<00:01:32.369> anywhere<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.179> want<00:01:33.390> on

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
place this circle anywhere we want on

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.350 
place this circle anywhere we want on
our<00:01:33.690> board<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.610> then<00:01:35.610> we're<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.880> select

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
our board and then we're going to select

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.219 
our board and then we're going to select
all<00:01:36.690> of<00:01:36.929> our<00:01:37.200> art<00:01:37.440> we<00:01:37.649> can<00:01:37.679> either<00:01:37.890> drag<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
all of our art we can either drag a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
all of our art we can either drag a
marquee<00:01:40.229> tool<00:01:40.500> around<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.310> our<00:01:41.490> selection

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
marquee tool around it our selection

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.020 
marquee tool around it our selection
tool<00:01:42.270> around<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.929> or<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.830> just<00:01:44.159> click<00:01:44.880> on

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
tool around it or we can just click on

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.389 
tool around it or we can just click on
the<00:01:45.119> layer<00:01:45.330> itself<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.740> circle<00:01:47.159> icon

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399

the layer itself and the circle icon
over<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.539> once<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.679> do<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
over to the right and once we do that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050 
over to the right and once we do that
you<00:01:52.050> can<00:01:52.080> either<00:01:52.379> hit<00:01:52.590> command<00:01:53.039> 7<00:01:53.459> or<00:01:53.670> control

you can either hit command 7 or control

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.800 
you can either hit command 7 or control
7<00:01:54.390> depending<00:01:55.289> on<00:01:55.440> whether<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.129> run<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> on

7 depending on whether you run it on
Windows<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.319> Mac<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.060> you'll<00:02:00.060> notice<00:02:00.360> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
Windows or Mac and you'll notice that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.410 
Windows or Mac and you'll notice that
you<00:02:00.989> now<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.410> clipping<00:02:01.679> mat<00:02:02.209> now<00:02:03.209> what

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you now have a clipping mat now what

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.350 
you now have a clipping mat now what
that<00:02:03.450> does<00:02:03.599> again<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.769> like<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.099> window<00:02:05.459> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that does again it's like a window that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
that does again it's like a window that
window<00:02:06.599> will<00:02:06.899> only<00:02:07.140> show<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.619> what's<00:02:07.979> inside

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
window will only show you what's inside

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.720 
window will only show you what's inside
that<00:02:08.729> mat<00:02:08.970> all<00:02:09.959> right<00:02:10.019> so<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.310> want<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that mat all right so if you want to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
that mat all right so if you want to
move<00:02:11.970> things<00:02:12.360> around<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.840> are<00:02:13.019> inside<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
move things around that are inside the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.720 
move things around that are inside the
math<00:02:13.680> simple<00:02:14.550> thing<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.720> double<00:02:16.019> click<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.319> it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
math simple thing you double click on it

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.759 
math simple thing you double click on it
you<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:17.879> inside<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.810> click<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.409> items

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
you go inside you can click the items

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.130 
you go inside you can click the items
you<00:02:20.069> can<00:02:20.280> move<00:02:20.640> them<00:02:20.790> around
