00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 and it's friends on the internet we get 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.990
 found for a new pvp guide 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.540
 on the enchantments so this time 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.929
 it's a highly fire-proof thing so 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 of this enchantment there is equivalent 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.330
 in French if these incendiaries of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.609
 to contact someone it catches fire it is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.970
 a disenchantment the most used in 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970
 pvp 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.970
 so we can use it to run away 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.640
 sorry facebook groups we can 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.200
 use it to run away so we type the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.059
 hall to the enemy it will catch fire and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 for a pu sprinter because there will be 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.210
 the jerk off so hurt to run away 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.620
 or precisely to prevent the victim from 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.980
 flee because the carpet for a pure 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.789
 sprinter or just for 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 bully the view because when you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.329
 are in fact you see nothing more of the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.430
 all so I'll show you what that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.070
 we do not see anything anymore 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.460
 so for pvp it's pretty hard to think 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 we have repulsive legs who is guy 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.380
 with on thanks duels and that they have in 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.689
 what is called small fine 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.420
 of ivory conquer or champlain in 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.990
 their screens and it bothers a little 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.180
 so well now we'll put that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.189
 then we will put into practice 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.350
 style a fight against tonight so kind 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.530
 the bike here so we can not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.210
 that it can regenerate the cause of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.460
 fire to show you because that's it 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.900
 what to show you the video and and from 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.210
 soft fire I have the same slab even stuff 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.900
 Older like me, I'm proud of them 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:45.780
 so 3 2 an ego so at the same time 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:47.430
 the enchantment fire the enchantment fire 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.329
 at level 1 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:57.810
 for example, that's me I said 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.570
 frankly fire aspect 1 it is possible 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.350
 to finally see her here we can have raised 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.289
 May 5 or 10 firewire aspect 1 and 2 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.990
 my they are they are the same 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.840
 just do that makes a 5 on 5 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.350
 seconds of fire and fire aspect 2.7 euros 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.390
 8 seconds of fire that's all 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.100
 see when you can see me I 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.819
 carpet like that I can finish 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.310
 quietly and I can even time to 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.110
 do damage and it's too bad 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.120
 to follow me we rely on you too 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.150
 because it's big but now 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.380
 go with the fire make him damage to 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.690
 life him and me here I can 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.850
 to reach it like that easy so that's it 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.489
 friends it's the enchantment almost failed 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.870
 their bastard look and we end up 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.400
