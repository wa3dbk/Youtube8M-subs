00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.649
 good guys that such as scaffolding here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.870
 always faithful in a new video and today 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.120
 I bring you a fifa video of how 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.860
 work here I'm wrong we look good 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.129
 forward center of brazil league 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
 Portuguese for about 21 thousand coins I think 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.200
 which is the most recommended starting from 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.360
 21 thousand currencies is no longer profitable and it 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.890
 call limamos gold we are not interested in the one that 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.340
 we are interested in beige lime that have 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.110
 good statistics and we tried 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.390
 sign for 21,000 coins for later 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.110
 sell them for selling it for about 25 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.180
 a thousand then we can look for defenses 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.890
 Middle Argentinian defenses 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.390
 Argentine left and right media 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.200
 in this same middle left league 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.150
 we have gaitÃ¡n that round round the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.090
 15,000 from 15,000 is profitable 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.550
 buy it to sell it for 17 thousand 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.989
 coins and then middle right too 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.200
 of the Portuguese League and the Benfica 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.120
 we have saved this one round a bit 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.360
 less less than 15,000 although it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 sells for 16 thousand 500 something like this 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.409
 we can sign for 14 13 500 one thing 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.920
 A) Yes 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.579
 and it gets pretty decent profit 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 then we would go to the other player series 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:19.170
 Argentine central defender for about 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.569
 31,000 such a thing 33 at most 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.590
 Napoli Campagnaro better to put the 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:29.399
 Naples because then it will come out 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.810
 walter or whatever this came out 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.819
 player of the year and well we add them the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 pre-selection to those who are still 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.899
 a lot of time to have them have them 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.300
 monitored and not take them too 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.300
 cheap 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.190
 and good while the ones we have in 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.900
 pre-selection we control them because if 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.270
 they do not take them away from us and we do not comply 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.940
 our goal and then we move on to the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.940
 bundesliga nationality German goalkeeper 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.370
 borussia from dortmund about 27,000 and it's 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.900
 wayne de feller the goalkeeper of borussia 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.110
 dormund his first black letter then 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.590
 has another and well then we can 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.140
 sign for about 25 or 26 for later 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.580
 sell it for 33 35 maximum 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.500
 depending on the position then 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.580
 we would go to hamburg which is another 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.230
 goalkeeper is also adler and this is a 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.990
 little bit more but we would have to 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.460
 fix on the in the second black letter 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.170
 because he has in the first black letter 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.930
 which is 82 on average then has the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.430
 gold letter that has 84 and then the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.980
 second black letter that already has 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.370
 85 on average which is what interests us and 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.000
 that one can still be sold 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.610
 by far more than winner feiler 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.590
 I think it's worth 43 or something like that look 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.980
 and we have it 4 12 12 it's also good 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.569
 training and you also get pretty 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.489
 benefits harder to find that 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.349
 letter but good is good 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.549
 I recommend it and while we continue 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.530
 controlling how the pre-selection goes to 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.379
 see which players we take and which 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.209
 we are not going to logically 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.799
 we get bidding if they still meet 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.750
 our expectations of that interval 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.120
 that we have established then we look at 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.980
 the series we are looking for front Italians 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.840
 centers of juventus you see that goes out 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.900
 matrix I really looked for what was the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.510
 second black card that is worth 18 thousand 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.670
 we try to buy it for 16-15 500 a 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.209
 thing like that and good matrix matrix can be 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.940
 sign for everything that is inferior to 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.450
 16,000 to sell it for about 17 thousand us 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.760
 can come well then nothing then 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.849
 Cameroon we return to the Bundesliga 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.849
 schalke 04 I'm dizzy I know 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.720
 matip and it's pretty cheap and you can 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.940
 sell for about 14 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.130
 13,500 depends a lot on the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.780
 training even for 15 I think he sold 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.220
 some but the player itself is cheap and 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.080
 it's quite solvent if you want it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.080
 try I recommend it I liked it 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.240
 while we control again the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.880
 pre-selection you see that we have 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.460
 taken the odd player and 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.960
 We continue to monitor and to die 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.130
 from 16,000 I think that no longer 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.870
 compensate 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.510
 It also goes beyond 16,000 and it's clear that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.250
 compensates but if it also serves to 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.350
 better deal with what was the second letter 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.070
 black then we go back to the series we look for 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.650
 swiss of Naples midcentre inler and 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.290
 around 13 thousand to sell it for 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.150
 15,000 is the price that round that round 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.930
 this good can not be sold for 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.970
 16,500 has two black cards and then 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.890
 disc that these are very cheap and they 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.840
 They sell very well all we can buy 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.900
 for 11,000 direct purchase even by 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.140
 10,500 to then sell them 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.030
 sell them then for 12,000 12,500 even 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.450
 13,000 depending a lot on training 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.280
 also and nothing more with these players 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.020
 Black letters are the ones I work with 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.300
 more than anything 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.690
 and yes you get quite a profit 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.560
 for you with 180,000 coins that I had 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.500
 at the beginning and I ended up with 450 this 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.030
 doing it in several various processes 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.789
 come on, this happened a little on camera 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.819
 quick so you can see the prices for 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.470
 example a lot depends on the training and 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.319
 five defenses do not get too expensive 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.590
 because they are going to buy 4-4-2 and 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:17.940
 4-5-1 also more or less veneers 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:23.699
 is that I do not remember what are 42 22 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.229
 also 4 21 21 I think it's the ones that 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.680
 they have many numbers are also sold 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.060
 pretty good and good then those that 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.900
 less that logically those of three 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.509
 defenses 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.090
 and then those of the five defenses 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.070
 they also seem to cost more to sell 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.380
 the most elementary the most worthwhile 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.120
 those of four defenses then here 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.669
 you see more or less the prices that neither 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.960
 versions put the players 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.449
 I do not know that I have not put it 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.060
 good central Argentine defense of the 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.880
 newcastle barclays premier league of it 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.539
 you can sign for 17 to sell it 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.150
 by 2019 1500 and good here and those who 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.610
 Buy purchase by direct purchase 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.740
 I put good more or less 13,000 then 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.970
 can go down the price a little if 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.000
 you see that they buy us this for 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.560
 example I put it very expensive to matic with a 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.990
 formation of five defenses I had to 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.610
 come down because they did not buy it but 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.580
 good at the end you get to sell all 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.139
 and the benefit is quite noticeable as 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.310
 you will be able to verify good that I teach you to 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.840
 all the players inasmuch as 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.340
 sold you gaitan by 17 for 16 700 more 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.169
 or less good and you see the prices if you 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.639
 they interest some more then you leave it in 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.840
 pause in the fast position because if not 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.380
 the video is very long and there you see 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.390
 the coins that I have 450 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.040
 nothing is that I have only managed with only 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.840
 selling all the players 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.400
 that I have taught you then you take a 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.050
 very very considerable benefit 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.460
 and what have I done with those coins? 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.720
 I still have not worn them the truth 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.820
 I was saving for Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.259
 I'll wait for it to go down a bit more and in 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.040
 summer and I guess I'll buy 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.990
 but now the figure does not touch it much 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.130
 and nothing because there are prices 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:02.410
 hue is also drawn at the end of 521 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.970
 for the price I said nothing because this is 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.570
 everything and see you in the next video 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.570
 kids god
