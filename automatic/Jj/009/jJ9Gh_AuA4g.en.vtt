00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
couple different shapes the open

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.600 
couple different shapes the open
telescope<00:00:18.110> as<00:00:18.380> well<00:00:18.590> as<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:18.860> pinch<00:00:19.130> telescope

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.410 

and<00:00:23.350> begin<00:00:24.350> by<00:00:24.650> pushing<00:00:25.460> that<00:00:25.820> center<00:00:26.210> section

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
and begin by pushing that center section

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.780 
and begin by pushing that center section
down<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:28.540> creating<00:00:29.540> a<00:00:30.290> more<00:00:30.890> or<00:00:31.009> less<00:00:31.070> round

around

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.910 

you<00:01:15.469> can<00:01:15.649> pinch<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.130> edge<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:17.560> create<00:01:18.560> more

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
you can pinch the edge to create more

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.840 
you can pinch the edge to create more
definition<00:01:19.729> with<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.179> shape<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:21.850> creating

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
definition with the shape and creating

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:35.999 
definition with the shape and creating
you<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.060> smoother<00:01:23.450> look

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.719

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
once you get the general oval shape into

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.999 
once you get the general oval shape into
the<00:01:39.850> top<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.270> crown<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.850> then<00:01:44.009> raise

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
the top of the crown you can then raise

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.889 
the top of the crown you can then raise
the<00:01:45.070> center<00:01:45.610> section<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:49.240> make<00:01:49.420> room<00:01:49.659> for<00:01:49.689> your

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
the center section to make room for your

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.200 
the center section to make room for your
head<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.710> Hat<00:01:50.890> does<00:01:51.189> not<00:01:51.340> rest<00:01:51.759> on<00:01:52.000> your

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
head so the Hat does not rest on your

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.389 
head so the Hat does not rest on your
head<00:01:52.420> when<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.750> put<00:01:52.929> it<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.740> I'll<00:01:59.979> use<00:02:00.369> my

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
head when you put it on and I'll use my

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.029 
head when you put it on and I'll use my
hand<00:02:01.210> inside<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.869> Hat<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.439> push<00:02:02.679> up<00:02:02.890> that

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
hand inside the Hat to push up that

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.090 
hand inside the Hat to push up that
center<00:02:03.460> section<00:02:03.969> and<00:02:04.090> use<00:02:04.960> my<00:02:05.259> other<00:02:05.560> hand<00:02:05.679> and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
center section and use my other hand and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.460 
center section and use my other hand and
my<00:02:06.189> thumb<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:07.270> hold<00:02:07.539> down<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.709> inside<00:02:09.190> edge

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
my thumb to hold down that inside edge

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:21.150 
my thumb to hold down that inside edge
to<00:02:11.470> create<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.860> uniform<00:02:12.870> crown<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.890> pinch

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
to create a uniform crown the pinch

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.660 
to create a uniform crown the pinch
telescope<00:02:21.849> is<00:02:22.120> very<00:02:22.360> similar<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:24.280> instead<00:02:24.459> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
telescope is very similar but instead of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.530 
telescope is very similar but instead of
creating<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.239> round<00:02:25.860> shape<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.160> top<00:02:27.540> you'll

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
creating a round shape in the top you'll

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.930 
creating a round shape in the top you'll
start<00:02:28.959> out<00:02:29.140> with<00:02:29.650> more<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.069> a<00:02:30.190> teardrop<00:02:30.819> shape

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
start out with more of a teardrop shape

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.710 
start out with more of a teardrop shape
and<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.590> start<00:02:32.890> out<00:02:33.160> by<00:02:33.970> creating<00:02:34.000> a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
and I like to start out by creating a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.910 
and I like to start out by creating a
center<00:02:35.079> dent<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:37.120> find<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.720> Center<00:02:38.500> for<00:02:38.799> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
center dent to find that Center for the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.650 
center dent to find that Center for the
pinch<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.549> front<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:42.510> widening<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
pinch in front and then widening the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.250 
pinch in front and then widening the
rear<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.739> create<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.280> teardrop<00:02:45.910> shape<00:02:49.260> you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
rear to create that teardrop shape you

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.400 
rear to create that teardrop shape you
typically<00:02:50.709> will<00:02:51.549> leave<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.269> front<00:02:52.810> section

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
typically will leave the front section

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.110 
typically will leave the front section
higher<00:02:53.859> than<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.730> rear<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.819> nice

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
higher than the rear and have a nice

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.740 
higher than the rear and have a nice
even<00:02:58.510> taper<00:02:58.900> towards<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.709> back<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:04.359> again

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
even taper towards the back and again

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.940 
even taper towards the back and again
smooth<00:03:05.260> out<00:03:05.410> any<00:03:05.590> wrinkles<00:03:05.859> as<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> go<00:03:07.950> next

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
smooth out any wrinkles as you go next

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.120 
smooth out any wrinkles as you go next
you'll<00:03:09.100> put<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.370> pinch<00:03:09.639> in<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.810> again<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:11.829> just

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you'll put the pinch in and again I just

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.809 
you'll put the pinch in and again I just
use<00:03:12.280> my<00:03:12.310> thumb's<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.859> put<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:15.069> pinch<00:03:15.430> or<00:03:15.700> the

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
use my thumb's to put the pinch or the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.580 
use my thumb's to put the pinch or the
dents<00:03:16.060> into<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.200> front<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:19.079> like<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.200> leave<00:03:20.349> my

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
dents into the front I like to leave my

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.490 
dents into the front I like to leave my
pinch<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:21.069> little<00:03:21.190> wider<00:03:21.579> but<00:03:22.000> some<00:03:22.989> can<00:03:23.200> put

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
pinch a little wider but some can put

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.400 
pinch a little wider but some can put
the<00:03:23.620> pinch<00:03:23.859> in<00:03:24.069> tighter<00:03:24.430> if<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.700> like<00:03:25.410> just

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
the pinch in tighter if you like just

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:36.670 
the pinch in tighter if you like just
depends<00:03:26.859> on<00:03:26.980> how<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.190> like<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.519> wear<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.730> hat

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680

some<00:03:37.340> felts<00:03:37.670> are<00:03:37.790> stiffer<00:03:38.030> than<00:03:38.239> others<00:03:38.540> and

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
some felts are stiffer than others and

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.660 
some felts are stiffer than others and
you'll<00:03:39.709> need<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.920> work<00:03:40.159> a<00:03:40.310> little<00:03:40.430> bit<00:03:40.610> more

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
you'll need to work a little bit more
