seen<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> lot<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.259> people<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.640> think

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
seen a lot of people do that and I think

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.310 
seen a lot of people do that and I think
that's<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.390> strange<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:25.049> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that's kind of strange now this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
that's kind of strange now this
definitely<00:01:25.619> happened<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.070> mw3<00:01:26.490> people<00:01:27.030> who

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
definitely happened with mw3 people who

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.030 
definitely happened with mw3 people who
didn't<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.930> em<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.229> three<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
didn't like em to be three kind of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
didn't like em to be three kind of
switched<00:01:29.220> back<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.460> black<00:01:29.820> ops<00:01:30.060> 2<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.540> when

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
switched back to black ops 2 when when

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300 
switched back to black ops 2 when when
I'm<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.140> through<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> newest<00:01:31.860> cod<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
I'm to be through was the newest cod and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
I'm to be through was the newest cod and
I<00:01:32.369> guess<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.479> something<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I guess that's just something that the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230 
I guess that's just something that the
people<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.220> guess<00:01:35.549> after<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> few

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
people do I guess after you know a few

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
people do I guess after you know a few
months<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.380> amount<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
months or you know a good amount of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.010 
months or you know a good amount of
being<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.220> eight<00:01:38.400> months<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.810> Dean

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
being like eight months or so the Dean

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
being like eight months or so the Dean
the<00:01:40.320> game<00:01:40.500> definitely<00:01:40.740> does<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.159> boring<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the game definitely does get boring and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.920 
the game definitely does get boring and
you<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> start<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> realize<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> crap

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you kind of start to realize the crap

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
you kind of start to realize the crap
about<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.380> then<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.740> oh<00:01:43.860> wait<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.920 
about it then you're like oh wait I'm to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
be three was awesome let's go plan to be

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
be three was awesome let's go plan to be
three<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.439> um<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.920> guess<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.579> guess<00:01:47.790> that's<00:01:47.970> what

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
three but um I guess I guess that's what

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
three but um I guess I guess that's what
people<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.439> definitely<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.700> right

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
people think and I definitely like right

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.030 
people think and I definitely like right
now<00:01:50.970> I'd<00:01:51.119> probably<00:01:51.420> say<00:01:51.810> nw3<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.530> better<00:01:52.770> than

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
now I'd probably say nw3 is better than

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770 
now I'd probably say nw3 is better than
them<00:01:53.490> black<00:01:53.670> ops<00:01:53.880> 2<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:54.600> black

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
them black ops 2 but you know when black

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.420 
them black ops 2 but you know when black
ops<00:01:54.810> ii<00:01:55.049> would<00:01:55.170> come<00:01:55.320> out<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.649> definitely<00:01:56.159> say

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
ops ii would come out I definitely say

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
ops ii would come out I definitely say
that<00:01:56.460> black<00:01:56.820> ops<00:01:57.000> 2<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.240> better<00:01:57.420> than<00:01:57.509> mw3<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that black ops 2 is better than mw3 you

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.510 
that black ops 2 is better than mw3 you
know<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.439> get<00:01:58.619> sick<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> game<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.460> I

know you just get sick of the game and I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
know you just get sick of the game and I
definitely<00:01:59.820> understand<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.320> know

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409

there is only a year between call of
duties<00:02:03.180> which<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.540> definitely<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.409> good<00:02:04.649> thing

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

you don't really see that with other

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850 
you don't really see that with other
games<00:02:06.210> i<00:02:06.450> mean<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:07.020> most<00:02:07.200> games<00:02:07.469> were<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> come

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
games i mean if most games were to come

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.249 
games i mean if most games were to come
out<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.069> most<00:02:08.729> companies<00:02:09.450> are<00:02:09.750> most<00:02:10.020> game

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
out with most companies are most game

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.350 
out with most companies are most game
developer<00:02:10.770> people<00:02:11.069> where<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> come<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.270> with

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
developer people where to come out with

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.220 
developer people where to come out with
a<00:02:12.420> game<00:02:12.660> every

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
a game every

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.080 
a game every
year<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:14.069> games<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.430> probably<00:02:14.670> wouldn't<00:02:14.970> be

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
year the games we probably wouldn't be

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000 
year the games we probably wouldn't be
that<00:02:15.239> great<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:15.959> that's<00:02:16.170> actually<00:02:16.500> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
that great now that's actually that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.500 
that great now that's actually that
actually<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.430> true<00:02:17.640> with<00:02:17.819> Assassin's<00:02:18.330> Creed

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
actually is true with Assassin's Creed

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.910 
actually is true with Assassin's Creed
but<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.750> games<00:02:18.930> usually<00:02:19.110> are<00:02:19.440> pretty<00:02:19.709> good

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
but the games usually are pretty good

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.890 
but the games usually are pretty good

when<00:03:00.989> do<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.230> think<00:03:01.470> black<00:03:01.680> ops<00:03:01.859> 2<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.069> going<00:03:02.310> to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
when do I think black ops 2 is going to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.309 
when do I think black ops 2 is going to
be<00:03:02.519> kind<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.849> dead<00:03:03.180> or<00:03:03.450> when<00:03:03.959> people<00:03:04.170> are<00:03:04.230> gonna

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
be kind of dead or when people are gonna

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.960 
be kind of dead or when people are gonna
stop<00:03:04.590> posting<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:05.099> now<00:03:05.220> obviously<00:03:05.670> people<00:03:05.849> are

gonna stop posting black ops 2 once cod
ghost<00:03:08.250> comes<00:03:08.549> out<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.660> my<00:03:09.810> opinion

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
ghost comes out but in my opinion

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.660 
ghost comes out but in my opinion
they're<00:03:10.379> gonna<00:03:10.500> go<00:03:10.680> right<00:03:10.920> back<00:03:11.069> to<00:03:11.250> black<00:03:11.459> ops

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
they're gonna go right back to black ops

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.360 
they're gonna go right back to black ops
2<00:03:11.849> probably<00:03:12.569> after<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.530> roughly<00:03:13.859> six<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
2 probably after you know roughly six to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.770 
2 probably after you know roughly six to
eight<00:03:14.519> months<00:03:14.549> kind<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.510> what<00:03:15.660> they

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
eight months kind of like that what they

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.420 
eight months kind of like that what they
did<00:03:15.840> with<00:03:16.109> with<00:03:16.500> black<00:03:16.709> ops<00:03:16.890> 2<00:03:17.040> here<00:03:17.190> going

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.520 
did with with black ops 2 here going
back<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.790> mw3<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.660> definitely<00:03:19.139> think<00:03:19.380> it's

back to mw3 I definitely think it's

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.629 
back to mw3 I definitely think it's
going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> happen<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.040> can't<00:03:20.280> really<00:03:20.489> have

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
going to happen you can't really have

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.670 
going to happen you can't really have
too<00:03:20.819> much<00:03:20.970> fun<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.450> game<00:03:21.690> for<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.200> long<00:03:22.410> you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
like you know nuclear or you know moab

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.240 
like you know nuclear or you know moab
in<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:37.049> cod<00:03:37.410> ghost<00:03:37.709> that's<00:03:37.889> going<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.130> get

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
in in cod ghost that's going to get

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.500 
in in cod ghost that's going to get
people<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.730> know<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.849> be<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> little<00:03:39.269> bit<00:03:39.389> more

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
people you know to be a little bit more

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.970 
people you know to be a little bit more
interested<00:03:39.989> in<00:03:40.109> it<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.500> my<00:03:40.650> opinion<00:03:40.859> that

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
interested in it I in my opinion that

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.140 
interested in it I in my opinion that
makes<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.400> game<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.579> little<00:03:41.669> bit<00:03:41.849> better

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
makes the game a little bit better

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.030 
makes the game a little bit better
because<00:03:42.419> it<00:03:43.200> gives<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.440> kind<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.919> know<00:03:43.950> I

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
think to go for and objective to go for

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.539 
think to go for and objective to go for
so<00:03:46.319> that's<00:03:46.799> basically<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.280> for<00:03:47.370> this

I've done this in the previously in the
past<00:03:52.859> but<00:03:53.190> previously<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.180> past<00:03:54.419> I've
