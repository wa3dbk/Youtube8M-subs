doesn't<00:02:41.269> actually<00:02:41.660> look<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.200> fun<00:02:42.380> although

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
doesn't actually look that fun although

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.610 
doesn't actually look that fun although
the<00:02:42.800> concept<00:02:43.280> could<00:02:43.459> seem<00:02:43.700> very<00:02:44.030> very

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
the concept could seem very very

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.140 
the concept could seem very very
especially<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.549> car<00:02:45.760> customization

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
especially with the car customization

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.460 
especially with the car customization
that<00:02:46.450> seems<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.840> be<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.930> biggest<00:02:47.170> highlight

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
that seems to be the biggest highlight

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.229 
that seems to be the biggest highlight
of<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.590> game<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.010> crew<00:02:48.250> then<00:02:49.000> there's<00:02:49.180> the

hope<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.169> light<00:04:00.660> trials<00:04:01.660> fusion<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.459> trials

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
hope and light trials fusion and trials

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.610 
hope and light trials fusion and trials
something<00:04:04.120> else<00:04:04.299> frontier<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:05.200> basically<00:04:05.500> a

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
something else frontier it's basically a

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.619 
something else frontier it's basically a
mobile<00:04:06.129> version<00:04:06.160> of<00:04:06.760> trials<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.419> then<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
mobile version of trials and then the

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.659 
mobile version of trials and then the
next-gen<00:04:08.109> version<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.590> trials<00:04:09.010> which<00:04:09.220> is<00:04:09.459> cool

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
next-gen version of trials which is cool

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.360 
next-gen version of trials which is cool
apparently<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:10.660> get<00:04:10.870> points<00:04:11.590> for<00:04:11.650> move<00:04:12.040> sets

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
apparently you get points for move sets

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.559 
apparently you get points for move sets
and<00:04:12.579> things<00:04:12.609> like<00:04:12.819> that<00:04:12.879> that's<00:04:13.209> really<00:04:13.359> nice

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
and things like that that's really nice

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.449 
and things like that that's really nice
that's<00:04:13.840> really<00:04:14.109> interesting<00:04:14.769> a<00:04:15.099> little<00:04:15.280> bit

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
that's really interesting a little bit

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.560 
that's really interesting a little bit
innovative<00:04:15.879> it's<00:04:16.030> going<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.239> create<00:04:16.389> more

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
innovative it's going to create more

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.789 
innovative it's going to create more
competition<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.109> can<00:04:17.199> definitely<00:04:17.289> see<00:04:17.620> later

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
competition I can definitely see later

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.800 
competition I can definitely see later
on<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.160> as<00:04:18.789> we<00:04:18.940> can<00:04:19.030> see<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.299> is<00:04:19.449> it<00:04:19.479> moving

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
on and as we can see this is it moving

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.020 
on and as we can see this is it moving
it<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.199> mobile<00:04:20.560> they<00:04:21.039> throw<00:04:21.370> things<00:04:21.639> at<00:04:21.789> phones

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030
