trigger in the backfield and then making
space<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.950> then<00:02:12.189> accelerating<00:02:12.909> it's<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.019> job

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
space and then accelerating it's the job

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.910 
space and then accelerating it's the job
done<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:15.310> don't<00:02:15.939> know<00:02:16.030> how<00:02:16.150> often<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.659> do<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:17.019> but

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
done I don't know how often I do it but

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.620 
done I don't know how often I do it but
it<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:19.480> really<00:02:19.990> helps<00:02:20.500> um<00:02:21.270> now<00:02:22.270> when<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.450> got

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
it it really helps um now when you got

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.059 
it it really helps um now when you got
an<00:02:22.690> open<00:02:22.930> field<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.349> might<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.620> well<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.890> go

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
an open field you might as well just go

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.390 
an open field you might as well just go
for

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.199 
should be faster I feel like
7-speed<00:04:38.349> would<00:04:38.529> be<00:04:38.649> more<00:04:38.919> appropriate<00:04:39.009> I<00:04:39.729> mean

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:40.209 
7-speed would be more appropriate I mean

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:41.699 
7-speed would be more appropriate I mean
even<00:04:40.389> one<00:04:40.749> more<00:04:40.929> speed<00:04:41.229> makes<00:04:41.439> the<00:04:41.559> biggest

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:41.709 
even one more speed makes the biggest

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:43.709 
even one more speed makes the biggest
difference<00:04:41.969> there's<00:04:42.969> gonna<00:04:43.119> be<00:04:43.269> some<00:04:43.449> clips

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:43.719 
difference there's gonna be some clips

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:44.969 
difference there's gonna be some clips
and<00:04:43.899> a<00:04:43.929> little<00:04:44.169> bit<00:04:44.289> of<00:04:44.319> him<00:04:44.709> getting

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
and a little bit of him getting

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.279 
and a little bit of him getting
shoestring<00:04:45.489> tackled<00:04:45.939> where<00:04:46.899> he<00:04:47.019> should<00:04:47.199> have

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
shoestring tackled where he should have

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.569 
shoestring tackled where he should have
been<00:04:47.319> just<00:04:47.619> gone<00:04:48.239> that's<00:04:49.239> okay<00:04:49.569> but<00:04:50.579> that's

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:51.579 
been just gone that's okay but that's

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:57.059 
been just gone that's okay but that's
whatever<00:04:52.799> so<00:04:54.479> that's<00:04:55.479> pretty<00:04:55.809> much<00:04:55.929> all<00:04:56.289> I've

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
whatever so that's pretty much all I've

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.569 
whatever so that's pretty much all I've
got<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.759> say<00:04:57.969> about<00:04:58.239> Barry<00:04:58.899> if<00:04:59.529> you<00:05:00.129> have<00:05:00.369> the

and tosses that gets the job done
especially<00:05:12.610> in<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:12.939> goal-line<00:05:13.149> situations

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
especially in the goal-line situations

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.719

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
stack sometimes it just goes into

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.439 
stack sometimes it just goes into
straight<00:05:23.739> beast<00:05:23.979> mode<00:05:24.249> and<00:05:24.550> he's<00:05:25.239> just

impossible<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.169> stop<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:29.550> something<00:05:30.550> happened

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
impossible to stop so something happened

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.419 
impossible to stop so something happened
with<00:05:31.089> my<00:05:31.539> recording<00:05:32.139> when<00:05:32.409> well<00:05:33.249> I<00:05:33.309> was

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:33.429 
with my recording when well I was

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:35.009 
with my recording when well I was
looking<00:05:33.550> at<00:05:33.849> it<00:05:33.909> and<00:05:34.029> I<00:05:34.179> couldn't<00:05:34.239> really<00:05:34.689> see

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:35.019 
looking at it and I couldn't really see

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:37.409 
looking at it and I couldn't really see
what<00:05:35.139> was<00:05:35.259> going<00:05:35.559> on<00:05:35.709> but<00:05:36.610> anyways<00:05:36.999> look<00:05:37.209> for

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
what was going on but anyways look for

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.789 
what was going on but anyways look for
him<00:05:37.569> look<00:05:37.719> at<00:05:37.959> him<00:05:38.079> fighting<00:05:38.289> for<00:05:38.499> those<00:05:38.589> yards

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:38.799 
him look at him fighting for those yards

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:41.279 
him look at him fighting for those yards
he<00:05:39.639> does<00:05:39.849> that<00:05:40.029> a<00:05:40.089> lot<00:05:40.209> more<00:05:40.689> often<00:05:41.019> than<00:05:41.139> you

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
he does that a lot more often than you

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.969 
he does that a lot more often than you
would<00:05:41.319> think<00:05:41.469> probably<00:05:43.139> like<00:05:44.139> once<00:05:44.469> a<00:05:44.619> game<00:05:44.769> he

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
would think probably like once a game he

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.219 
would think probably like once a game he
could<00:05:45.189> do<00:05:45.369> something<00:05:45.639> insane<00:05:46.059> like<00:05:46.300> that<00:05:46.539> and

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
could do something insane like that and

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.859 
could do something insane like that and
that's<00:05:47.409> why<00:05:47.559> I<00:05:47.589> like<00:05:48.029> well<00:05:49.029> why<00:05:49.449> I<00:05:49.479> like<00:05:49.749> him

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:49.869 
that's why I like well why I like him

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.389 
that's why I like well why I like him
you<00:05:49.989> know<00:05:50.019> he<00:05:50.199> does<00:05:50.349> some<00:05:50.559> crazy<00:05:50.709> things<00:05:51.159> not

only way you could catch him at that

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:09.149 
only way you could catch him at that
point<00:06:04.959> as<00:06:05.259> a<00:06:05.289> deal<00:06:05.559> um<00:06:07.169> now<00:06:08.169> we're<00:06:08.439> here<00:06:08.679> I<00:06:08.919> hit
