 Subtitled: by CesarTkgo69 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.309
 It is compact, it is safe, it is comfortable 

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.010
 everything you expect from a new liver 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.013
 and the price, 756,000 dollars 

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:15.015
 quiet, our credit department 

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.817
 find a plan that fits your lifestyle 

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.018
 will sign 

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.019
 everyone signs 

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.022
 what they do not tell you is that if you fall behind in the payment 

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.523
 a union employee will enter your house 

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:24.925
 and recover your property. 

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.026
 I can pay. 

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.127
 I'm sorry, that does not concern me 

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:31.999
 Liver 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.400
 Anonymous Alcoholics Day 

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.407
 My name is Remy 

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.209
 This is my best friend, Jake 

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.210
 we grew up together 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.012
 and now, we work together 

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:46.013
 because of work 

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:49.016
 Hey, for you, what keeps the world up? 

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:52.019
 The rules 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.521
 People who respect the conditions 

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.024
 of the contracts that they sign. 

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.226
 How is that pancreas going? 

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.028
 I sent the money this morning 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.631
 We are collectors 

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.033
 Is it a hacienda? 

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.435
 Does it bring me a new heart? 

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.037
 No, you could not pay 

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:21.014
 You're lucky you knew 

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.017
 we put you the latest advance in cardiac modules 

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:25.018
 take it from me 

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.020
 Soon you will be like new 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.222
 and you will do it again 

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.025
 You've done it thousands of times 

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.126
 What the hell is wrong with you? 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.131
 I'm delaying payments 

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.033
 You are a collector 

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.035
 they will come for you too 

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.137
 Who do you think Frank would send? 

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:45.739
 Maybe to me. 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.841
 It does not matter where we hide 

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.842
 they will find us the same 

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.346
 You want to do? 

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:54.348
 End this. 

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.059
 Get me out of the system 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.060
 Give me your heart 

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.361
 or we look for a plan that fits ... 

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:11.531
 Now it's yours 

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:15.736
 Finish it Jake 

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.139
 Now 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.941
 I will not let you go 

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.442
 I'm not going to come back.
