00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.770
 so friends all the good time of day 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.830
 I decided to shoot this video about 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.049
 Zid engine view 45 in my marking 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.759
 if i'm not mistaken but that which is all 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.630
 aluminum is shorter in one word with 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.439
 gear transmission output means y 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.760
 I had the presence of an engine of this kind 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.590
 Now I took apart and actually wanted 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720
 would talk about some of the nuances of this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.320
 engine more precisely in the internal 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
 device 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.030
 but most likely I will tell more about 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.250
 grease the motor 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.399
 most of all, we are not like we say well, not 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.500
 liked her device though they say 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.329
 that this engine is very tenacious there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 Soviet times some work but 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.440
 Here I have this engine worked 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 I bought it a week ago 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.390
 put on a circular about a week 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.100
 I worked all throughout the winter stood 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.730
 engine spring brought 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.379
 wanted to work the motor stukanul now 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.780
 I will try to talk briefly about the system 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 engine lubrication 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.790
 then here I stand called the most 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.390
 primitive system here on the connecting rod is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 here is such a scoop through this scoop 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 lubrication is carried out strictly under what he 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.049
 there is such a bath from which the with 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 mask draws us feature 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.310
 the connecting rod is that there are no liners in it 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 it is worth beating 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.829
 rather it was beaten by welding 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.320
 spraying whatever you want to call here 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.430
 such thin were such curly 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.150
 like that shaybochki thick juice a blade there 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.150
 one somewhere left 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 that I don't like it 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.030
 it is without liners here so he 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.130
 primitive engine lubrication system 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.420
 also stood here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.960
 worth something rather in the form of manual 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.539
 pump as I understood how people did not say 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.810
 This is when you do not start the engine for a long time 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.030
 you can pump up the oil here too 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.970
 there was some kind of pump here 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.860
 so he looks here the stock goes into it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.720
 also how there is vacuum there I don’t know how 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.250
 we pump oil and in the end it pumps and 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.930
 all the oil flowing again, that this 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.769
 jar 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.470
 through which lubrication is carried out 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.500
 There is from Moscow there engine roughly 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.760
 sprinkling oil 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.230
 carried I don't like such a system 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.459
 primitive call but such a system 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:43.120
 him such features like this 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:46.920
 piston type engine was new even 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.510
 you can see it for quality more precisely by the very 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.470
 mind of the pistons and the whole system like this 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.250
 looks like a cylinder 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.380
 it has also to adjust Lupanov 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.420
 side there your side here so here 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.880
 ignition ignition looks here too 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.950
 cam simple 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.420
 Well , you can adjust and specify 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.620
 somehow somehow that here 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.940
 turns but ignorance did not penetrate 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.769
 try the engine worked me all 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.290
 a week on circulars and died like this 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.430
 looks camshaft 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:28.859
 camshaft of this engine camshaft 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.120
 that camshaft gear is installed too 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.389
 here this asterisk is the same asterisk 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.280
 gearbox and engine installed 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.049
 reducer 2-speed in my opinion if not 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.170
 wrong well gear in one word 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.170
 installed it was quite problematic 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.120
 disassemble this gear 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.230
 there is something namudri they too well 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.130
 I took it apart but it’s like that 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.780
 a misunderstanding that the motor knocked me 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.660
 in fact, there is an option where to get 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.520
 crankshaft mi su don assembly rather 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.290
 I will not install everything because 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.980
 there are fears that he is again just stupid 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.380
 banging 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.150
 unknown for what reason oil in it 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.140
 was everything was everything was ok well 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.640
 just a tube channel can not understand so 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.640
 here is such an internal friend 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.230
 device zip engines 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.950
 can someone come in handy so here 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:25.760
 looks like a pallet fixed to the suction box 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:28.260
 Here, too, it's worth at the pump regulator 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.620
 this plate is first attached to it 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.450
 mounted gearbox was long enough 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.360
 thought at first turned away completely 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.300
 rendered something else inside the bolts 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.650
 were shorter tormented about an hour 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:47.910
 engine but that's how i disassembled it 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:51.600
 so that friends is such a system that's so 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.750
 Looks like a block I probably won't 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.820
 install the engine most likely 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.770
 just scrapped because grief 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.600
 there are fears that he is just stupid again 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.410
 knock you throw out money on the crank 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.840
 shaft eventually 5 knocks but if 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.720
 collect friends take another video but 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.150
 I will not collect his feeling so 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.750
 friends all thanks for watching hope 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.250
 this video was interesting 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.690
 good luck to all 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.690
 thanks again for watching
