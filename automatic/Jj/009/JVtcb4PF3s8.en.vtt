00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.740 
your filter so you're going to wash your
hands<00:02:07.259> thoroughly<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.420> then<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.599> take

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
hands thoroughly and then you can take

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.080 
hands thoroughly and then you can take
the<00:02:09.840> filter<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> package

the filter out of the package

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.170 
the filter out of the package
and<00:02:11.180> then<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.750> need<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.930> soak<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:13.180> standing

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and then you need to soak it standing

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.589 
and then you need to soak it standing
upright<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:15.110> water<00:02:15.709> for<00:02:16.370> about<00:02:16.459> 15<00:02:17.150> minutes

upright in water for about 15 minutes

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.690 
upright in water for about 15 minutes
and<00:02:17.930> there's<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.770> couple<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.190> things<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.520> are

have all that information for you on the

have all that information for you on the
website<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:14.239> really<00:03:14.480> good<00:03:14.569> filter

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
website and just a really good filter

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.410 
website and just a really good filter
the<00:03:15.049> filter<00:03:15.500> media<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.850> reason<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.269> it's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
the filter media the reason that it's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.720 
the filter media the reason that it's
better<00:03:18.019> than<00:03:18.260> your<00:03:18.470> average<00:03:18.650> carbon<00:03:19.430> filter

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
better than your average carbon filter

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.870 
better than your average carbon filter
is<00:03:19.820> it's<00:03:20.060> not<00:03:20.299> just<00:03:20.600> carbon<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.769> has<00:03:21.880> granular

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
is it's not just carbon it has granular

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.569 
is it's not just carbon it has granular
carbon<00:03:23.120> but<00:03:23.840> then<00:03:23.989> additionally<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.310> it

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
carbon but then additionally to that it

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.610 
carbon but then additionally to that it
has<00:03:25.820> an<00:03:26.319> ion<00:03:27.319> exchange<00:03:28.220> resin<00:03:29.440> that's<00:03:30.440> a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
has an ion exchange resin that's a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.870 
has an ion exchange resin that's a
little<00:03:30.829> bit<00:03:30.920> complicated<00:03:31.280> I'll<00:03:31.640> try<00:03:31.819> to

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
little bit complicated I'll try to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.410 
little bit complicated I'll try to
explain<00:03:32.299> imagine<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:33.049> little<00:03:33.620> little<00:03:34.609> bead<00:03:35.000> and

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
explain imagine a little little bead and

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.460 
explain imagine a little little bead and
that<00:03:35.480> little<00:03:36.290> bead<00:03:36.590> has<00:03:37.130> sodium<00:03:38.200> particles<00:03:39.200> on

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
that little bead has sodium particles on

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.430 
that little bead has sodium particles on
it<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.040> along<00:03:41.000> comes<00:03:41.389> some<00:03:41.540> nasty

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
it and along comes some nasty

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.740 
it and along comes some nasty
contaminant<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.609> attracted<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.600> that

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
contaminant that is attracted to that

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.190 
contaminant that is attracted to that
bead<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:46.190> attaches<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:47.180> then<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.989> little

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
bead and it attaches and then the little

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.650 
bead and it attaches and then the little
sodium<00:03:48.440> particle<00:03:49.130> falls<00:03:49.549> off<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.060> goes<00:03:50.450> into

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
sodium particle falls off and goes into

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.270 
sodium particle falls off and goes into
the<00:03:50.810> water<00:03:51.019> they<00:03:51.230> trade<00:03:51.530> places<00:03:51.859> they

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
the water they trade places they

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.569 
the water they trade places they
exchange<00:03:53.290> ion<00:03:54.290> exchange<00:03:55.190> resin<00:03:56.090> and

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
exchange ion exchange resin and

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.309 
exchange ion exchange resin and
obviously<00:03:58.579> that<00:03:58.700> will<00:03:58.760> wear<00:03:58.970> out<00:03:59.000> over<00:03:59.389> time

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
obviously that will wear out over time

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.080 
obviously that will wear out over time
which<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.920> why<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.130> filter<00:04:01.549> cartridge<00:04:01.910> has<00:04:02.060> a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
which is why the filter cartridge has a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.479 
which is why the filter cartridge has a
two<00:04:02.389> month<00:04:02.600> life<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.889> it<00:04:04.010> removes<00:04:04.280> those

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
two month life and so it removes those

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.550 
two month life and so it removes those
contaminants<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.480> you<00:04:05.569> just<00:04:05.750> chuck<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:06.200> and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
contaminants and you just chuck it and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.550 
contaminants and you just chuck it and
put<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.250> new<00:04:07.400> one<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.670> place<00:04:08.200> it's<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
put a new one it's place it's the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.580 
put a new one it's place it's the
