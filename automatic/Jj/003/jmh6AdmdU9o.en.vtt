00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.099
 hello to you, range, this guide 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.460
 how to shoot and hit pvc and 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.380
 planes want to immediately return to my 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.140
 first guide on the rocket in which 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.300
 said that where is oyster shooting 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.360
 pvc and you need a lot of practice 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.169
 This I just remind one of the main 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.680
 things with regard to the practice of jet under the same 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.950
 First of all, you need to take into account that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.780
 gets 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.539
 have higher maneuverability than 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.650
 maneuverability of your rocket 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.050
 accordingly shoot them the best 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.930
 then when they don't expect it 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.440
 sees and so forth otherwise a good pilot 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.380
 who noticed rocket launch with ease 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.750
 from her will go back and in every way 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.170
 avoid hitting even the possibility of it 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.910
 and most do it easily 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.340
 downed jets it gets exactly not 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.479
 expecting to be shot at 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.759
 pvc is the second thing you need to know 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.820
 that's what color management is 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.520
 so scarlet that most cases are even 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.870
 turns pulling the handle on the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.200
 eat through the back 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.880
 if you follow where my planes 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.280
 back to the right 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.460
 mean downs will unfold in 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.350
 If necessary, such a maneuver 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.830
 consider this the same chance of your 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.869
 hits will increase in the third always 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.060
 watch where the plane is shooting 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.610
 the fact is that an airplane cannon 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.130
 sent strictly forward if you see 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.860
 tracer and you always know exactly where 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.970
 the plane moves even if it went beyond 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.970
 your screen limits 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.700
 4 always use terrain knowledge 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.400
 terrain if the plane hits the target and 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.710
 around a mountain sooner or later like me 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.670
 spoke earlier he will turn away 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.900
 up ie side of your back 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.150
 use this knowledge and you will 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.560
 jet hit which forced 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.899
 make some money 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.640
 in order to get on jett which 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.510
 goes well on you you need a good one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.420
 pilot 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.010
 a good pilot knows what's on the bag 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.450
 raise a little nose up and on the bumper 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.160
 rigor to look at the plane and then 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.190
 you just have to press a button 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.250
 the rocket will go straight and cut the budget itself 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.349
 And now Glama is not a secret that not everyone 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.720
 hit on the jet is recorded then 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.390
 have you see hit a jet flies 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.790
 further it is connected with the curve hitboxes for 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.470
 order to increase the chance of hitting and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.380
 register this hit 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 you need to aim at the cockpit zone 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.150
 cab and no matter which side 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.450
 you come to the jed as you 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.190
 turn the horse ask the sides and so 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.069
 then always try to get into 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.349
 cockpit area then the chance that 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.019
 rocket is not enough what will fall so 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.900
 will register significantly increased 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.110
 by my own observation chances 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.200
 successful registration of hits on the dryers 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.329
 about 70 percent but look like 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.549
 on there only about 30 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.670
 and now i would like to say a few 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.010
 words about what is in reality 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.239
 shoot up and jetta far from 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.840
 always effective 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.760
 the fact is that especially on the clan grief 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 despite the importance of what you can 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.049
 and Jed is often much more profitable to shoot 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.569
 on tank 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.769
 or disable some other 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.590
 target 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.590
 the fact is that the chance of hitting 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.049
 good aircraft is small in particular 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.290
 on the mountain class often zenith or helicopter 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.840
 he will be warned that he is going to have a rocket 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.380
 so shoot only when you 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.470
 confident that it is advisable to 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.359
 publicly you can practice 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.060
 you will have enough opportunity however 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.980
 still will not let your team is 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 same best arrows rarely for 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.550
 break more than 10-15 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.250
 jetta and this time it was possible to kill 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.099
 much more infantry or destroy 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.750
 tanks in one of the following guides I tell you 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.180
 I will definitely tell you how 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.290
 confront this all thanks for 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.290
 viewing with you was a speech good luck so far
