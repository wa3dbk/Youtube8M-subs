00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
crystal focus board in it and it's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
crystal focus board in it and it's
running<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.820> lexion<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.970> darn<00:00:23.970> Brightblade

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
running a lexion be so darn Brightblade

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.920 
running a lexion be so darn Brightblade
and<00:00:24.930> i<00:00:24.990> used<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:26.029> triple<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.090> pack<00:00:27.359> given<00:00:27.779> nine

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
and i used a a triple a pack given nine

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.580 
and i used a a triple a pack given nine
point<00:00:28.230> six<00:00:28.519> volts<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.760> power<00:00:29.880> which<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> more

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
point six volts of power which is more

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.490 
point six volts of power which is more
than<00:00:31.619> enough<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.579> Flexi<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.329> V<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.380> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
than enough for the Flexi on V and I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.100 
than enough for the Flexi on V and I
wanted<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:36.110> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
wanted to do that because the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.690 
wanted to do that because the
lithium-ion<00:00:37.530> packs<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.309> barely<00:00:38.520> enough

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
lithium-ion packs are just barely enough

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.010 
lithium-ion packs are just barely enough
so<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.809> wanted<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so I wanted to do that so here it is I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.529 
so I wanted to do that so here it is I
think<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.530> beautiful<00:00:44.010> saber<00:00:44.420> turned<00:00:45.420> our

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.780 
whole reason people have been laying
down<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.470> top<00:02:33.739> part<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.220> because<00:02:34.489> there's<00:02:34.730> a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
down this top part is because there's a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.430 
down this top part is because there's a
little<00:02:35.120> ring<00:02:35.330> there<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.260> emitter

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
little ring there in the emitter

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.870 
little ring there in the emitter
stopping<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.160> from<00:02:37.190> moving<00:02:37.430> all<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> way

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
stopping it from moving all the way

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.080 
stopping it from moving all the way
through<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.269> like<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.790> took<00:02:40.940> me

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
through and I'm like what so it took me

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.970 
through and I'm like what so it took me
about<00:02:41.269> two<00:02:41.510> minutes<00:02:41.720> with<00:02:42.080> my<00:02:42.230> drill<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
about two minutes with my drill and a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.160 
about two minutes with my drill and a
sanding<00:02:43.400> sanding<00:02:43.940> drum<00:02:44.330> just<00:02:44.900> sitting<00:02:45.140> there

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
sanding sanding drum just sitting there

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.380 
sanding sanding drum just sitting there
reaming<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.890> out<00:02:46.070> until<00:02:46.790> eventually<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.239> could

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
reaming it out until eventually I could

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.000 
reaming it out until eventually I could
push<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.750> stock<00:02:48.019> Darth<00:02:48.320> Maul<00:02:48.530> kit<00:02:48.799> through

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
push the stock Darth Maul kit through

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.380
