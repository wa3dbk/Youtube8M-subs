00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello youtube friends talk to you about 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.730
 new account her friend the green page 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.830
 this time I come with a new tutorial 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.460
 this time it will be about how to create a 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.990
 story either of the medium they want 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.210
 I clarify that my intention is not to offend 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.300
 nobody so it 's better to think well before 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.669
 to comment in addition to what I think 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.489
 the steps of how to make the story and not 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.219
 make it end on facebook clarified that 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.040
 they are only optional tips follow us if 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.120
 they want and if it's not right without more 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.660
 let's start with this video number one the 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.999
 gender for this step can choose the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.160
 gender that you like if you plan to do 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.530
 a story of action or comedy you have 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.499
 the freedom to do it is also valid 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.390
 to people but before uploading it in this 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.609
 case it is better to do it in pages 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.429
 specialized since you can be fined 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.440
 on youtube by adult content that 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.320
 the same can also happen with the bor 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.630
 I do not do it to bother but if you can 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.510
 happen so be very careful with 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.400
 that you can also mix genre 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.200
 for example if you want to make a 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.750
 action story you can also 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.880
 mix it with drama and comedy as 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.770
 do with the ions that most 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.550
 mixed action with the seriousness and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.080
 comedy but if you're going to mix genres 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.420
 make sure the mixture is well made 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.600
 since many people are uncomfortable with some 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.240
 mixes number 2 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.790
 the inspiration if you want to make a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.980
 attractive story to the public seeks 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.020
 always be inspired since one does not 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.140
 think clearly and do all the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.479
 flojera it is best to walk 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.420
 since it clarifies the mind the inspiration 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.880
 it arrives and is healthy you can also 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.610
 listen to music since music helps 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.920
 imagination and entertains you too 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.110
 you can read a novel book so you can 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.900
 help your imagination and you get the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.390
 light but before making your story 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.830
 collects many ideas and will have more 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.010
 quality number 3 characters 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.200
 for this point are the characters the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
 which will be a fundamental role in the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.150
 history you can create the antagonist and 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.700
 the protagonist however so that the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.470
 History is entertaining is recommended 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.110
 that you give prominence to others 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.810
 characters and that the principal does not 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.270
 stay with all the glory you can include 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.880
 as part of the plot the past of the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.520
 characters their insecurities their 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.800
 respective personalities and how they are 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.880
 unfolding pse and evolving 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.450
 while the story progresses number 4 on 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.060
 argument for this point is where you leave 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.520
 aside the sketches notes and where 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.380
 start the script to make a good 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.320
 history has to be taken into account 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.959
 how to make the argument as well as its 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.690
 concept you must make an argument 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.820
 credible and that is not too exaggerated or 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.250
 too stupid or too unoriginal 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.610
 because people get bored they will not see the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.430
 story for this point I recommend you 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.980
 that the origins and events are 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.959
 English and give them answers to what happens 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.819
 in history number 5 originality 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.519
 for this point the most recommended in 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.040
 the events is that you use mechanical and 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.139
 new concepts used so your audience 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.540
 you will see something fresh and you will see it until 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:35.150
 final one advice is not to do to the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.239
 characters clichÃ©s events or situations 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.849
 very watched or create a very seen course to 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.379
 avoid what I said earlier 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:48.109
 you get fresh and new ideas for 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:50.599
 work number 6 start multi-outcome 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.519
 these are the classic steps to make 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.500
 a good story you have to write it 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.900
 from the beginning to the end the duration 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.700
 may be the one they want most they just have 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.579
 to take into account that also 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.739
 worked must be history the past 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.930
 of the principal can serve as a source 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.939
 for the development of the story or a 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.060
 important event in your life as a 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.430
 accident or an encounter for example in 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.739
 the case of knots would be the events that 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.320
 occur throughout history and how 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.359
 everything happened and the ending is the end 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.090
 for this I advise you to do 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.689
 end that leaves no loose ends and that does not 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.990
 it is a clichÃ© number 7 and final the 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:32.629
 format for this can use the format 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.759
 they want when the script is complete 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.039
 is when it comes time to edit and 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.650
 create can use the format they want 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.479
 it depends on your taste if it's a series what 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.639
 more advisable is to seek help 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.219
 possible for the band's animation 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.710
 sound and voices if they do a loquendo 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:52.189
 you can do it just be careful with the 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.189
 spelling did a comic can use 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.379
 the tulsa and like me for photoshop so its 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.300
 drawings will have quality but most 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.639
 recommended for the drawing to be 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.789
 well is to take courses or watch tutorials from 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.039
 how to use the program this would be all 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.650
 my companions and remember that they are 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.090
 optional they can use them if they want and 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.360
 remember that I do not do it with the 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.639
 intention to offend that is all 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.949
 we see each other then my companions the 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.099
 welcomes the green page until then 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.099
 bye
