00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.539
 Welcome, everyone. Everyone's team. 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.359
 welcome to another video 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.310
 good state guys for you a video 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.230
 very interesting, I'm sure 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.830
 you'll like it in the case mills and 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.570
 cover and it's a boxing in more or less ne 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.070
 I hope you like it, I did not do it. 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.629
 nor do I go in during a boxing and 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.680
 then I'm doing here one between 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.000
 more formal 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.489
 I think it will be a video over 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.620
 time it will be the blog if you do not like to 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.280
 damn it does not reach the ball there for 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.559
 video without coiling spoke the point let's 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:55.210
 start a box out of the water tank 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:58.600
 box next door was good 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:04.000
 it's simple they are three objects 4 the truth is 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:09.280
 that the manual in this bag is something that 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.460
 This one does not see that it is I do not know 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:24.370
 here is a microphone for sure but here 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:32.970
 the box has a drawstring 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:36.430
 and that soccer ball is like that too 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.310
 only this one is cheaper and 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.180
 certainty must be lower than the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:55.000
 goalkeeper but he does not stop being bad 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:58.060
 also the ball tripod is in the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.560
 microphone down 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.960
 this tripod 33 bosh not to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.700
 slip in your garden so far already 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.569
 I left everything prepared here is good and this 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.090
 here is 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.780
 what goes on the computer is he who 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.840
 me person here 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.870
 in this part is where it fits 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.239
 I'm not going to see this is the part where 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.489
 fits the microphone 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.799
 So basically this is what I'm going to ride. 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:35.750
 He's going to try to record for me, okay? 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.090
 well I'll show him here I'm going to put 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:49.879
 how speed can mess is so all 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:55.280
 is stop what happened that account 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:58.969
 until the greatest test 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.650
 well then you 'll have the final era is this 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:06.439

 that's good, it's from LG and that's it 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:11.959
 now I'll just ride me how to ride 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.599

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.049
 bit now how you got connected 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:21.660
 it was going to see how the difference will be 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:27.390
 Come on, forget it, I bought it too. 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:30.630

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.990
 She is a fan. It 's very simple. 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.380

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.150
 now 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.560
 in the end even with very good however it is 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.560
 for them and bigger for here 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:06.810
 It looks like a business here but it's a 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.680
 dude does not maybe give a blog with her is 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.740
 very bad face 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.520
 now how I already bought a birthday 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.300
 on the 27th that's why you did not have it on the day 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.820
 26 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.280
 yes but the next day did not have because 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:28.800
 did not produce to visit because 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:31.020
 I was busy with the crowd then 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.380
 personal request of an eye here than what 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:44.640
 I said let's go then the video 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:47.210
 let's see gf 8 and our lady appeared 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:06:05.310
 all around the world 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:06:07.169
 I want to print was my mother going to enter 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.180
 in the room now show how the 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.820
 microphone quality 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.860
 Good people, this is the end result. 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.270
 I really liked the quality of it by the ps 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.770
 that I paid 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.430
 I thought it was a good investment. 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.860
 because when I recorded with what these 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.330
 21 and got denounced and I think 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.770
 this microphone is going to be the best now 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.800
 You will not be more boring you will 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.990
 realize that you've gotten better then 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.580
 I think it was a good investment I 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.660
 I will take now to change from 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.210
 microphone if given an opportunity 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.090
 I do not know, there's a male that I'll go 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.920
 catch a train then maybe maybe not 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.800
 I have a very good kit that is the 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.510

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.550

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.320
 microphone and phone actually 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.990
 so I just hope you have 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.910

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.080
