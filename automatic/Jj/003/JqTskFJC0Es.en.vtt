00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.230
 let's work half points on a 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.360
 chain and here I come working the 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.600
 half points as we learned in the 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.660
 previous classes we are going to work on 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.880
 multiples of 3 we are going to make the row 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.210
 of chains and a row of media points 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.110
 we have 3 points combined here now 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.510
 let's make vareta 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.360
 before performing the varietes we are going to 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.890
 change the color wool we will leave 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.560
 two points on the needle just there we go 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.380
 to incorporate the green side 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.250
 when we're going to put that we're going to change 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.280
 Colored threads 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.920
 the good thing is here I combine because 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.920
 what I want you to see is a very good 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.559
 combination of colors we leave two we 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.210
 we close and with him and what we are going to weave 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:04.869
 is with which we are going to close there 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.580
 we raise a chain of rise and 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.930
 we made in the first point that 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.660
 we base a crowbar let there 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 to make a chain and at the same point 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.100
 of base a bar there we are going to advance 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.550
 let's jump a base point and in the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:29.560
 next let's repeat the same one 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.950
 jimmy a chain a jumper like this all 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.690
 the row with this tone jumped one and 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.780
 I repeat a chain a vareta a chain 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.230
 and in the same place another vareta 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.290
 in this way 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.760
 today back 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.580
 there are chains 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.580
 and baretta let's go over 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.580
 there vareta we jumped 1 base 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.600
 chain 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.250
 and ok it's back 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.790
 once we have this point made 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.890
 let's go back to incorporate another color 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.470
 here we learn a new point in which 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.100
 we have to pay attention exactly 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.330
 the same as before the two points in the 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.430
 needle 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.380
 this is so as not to cut the thread and that 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.780
 fill us the job and then not 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.110
 we know what to do with our centuries what 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.560
 I take double step 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.710
 there I make a chain of your life a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.810
 lazada I go to the center of the chain that 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.700
 I left there and do a close loop 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.480
 another loop 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.340
 and I close the 2 loops I make another one and 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.740
 I close the third this would be a point 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.000
 motta I close all together there 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:04.340
 I make a chain I go next in the other 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 I fan and loop and close 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.270
 lazada step would be the vareta only that in 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.350
 instead of closing it the other time I'm going to 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.350
 leave on the needle there in three times 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.500
 I close again I return there a 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.920
 I come back 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:36.260
 two 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:39.620
 I go back to and the third I close a chain 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.200
 another chain and I go back to the center that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.770
 I left previously made 1 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.770
 two 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.050
 that would be the motta point there can be 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.540
 of 4 can be of 5 can be of 6 can 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.050
 to be with double varetas this is vareta 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.670
 simple is in place and we close the 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.470
 three together in the last one vareta 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.480
 always to be able to upload now 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.269
 we have to come up with the white yarn 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.850
 They see that I have everything here in the same 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.730
 needle I go down with the needle 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.880
 and there I will grab my thread and I will 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.500
 take up with dots 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.620
 hidden by the edge there 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.040
 there I go making a hidden point 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.830
 came here and I close and now I'm going to do 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.840
 back a whole way of means 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.740
 points I'm going to go in I'm going to do 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:45.630
 a half point forgiveness and zabaleta 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:48.569
 there we are going to make a half point another 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.800
 and in the middle 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:56.740
 a half point this separates our point 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.360
 and I make another one there 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.260
 two 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.169
 and one up 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.650
 one 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:10.210
 2 and 1 above this told them separate each 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.659
 capullito leaves like capullito so 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.180
 we see at point allison it does not show at 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.539
 put color there you can see now let's 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.909
 do exactly the same with green 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:24.610
 I'm going to leave the colon on the needle 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:29.020
 I will go sideways bringing the thread 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.870
 green there is one do not short come if I do not start 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.069
 to have a lot of bits of yarn and 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:39.009
 I do not know what to do with them there I upload this 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:42.610
 later when I sew it I concealed it and of that 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.400
 way I'm moving forward and putting another 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.110
 row more 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.820
 in this way the smooth point and the 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.820
 colorful dot
