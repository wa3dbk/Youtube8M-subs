00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello studio with you 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.660
 online marketing conversions and today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.480
 we talk about operators and different 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.759
 word forms to parse 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.679
 exactly which match operators 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.500
 there is a need to start 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.529
 make out how Yandex Direct reacts to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 various word forms of cases and so on 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 We conduct a request to buy a phone from us 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.519
 is broad match ie 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.679
 we are shown in all words for forms and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.640
 for all the additional words to this 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.620
 key phrase 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.010
 We carry for example buy a phone and how we 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 see the number of hits as there were 660 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.680
 thousand impressions per month never 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:54.930
 changed change part of speech for example 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:58.219
 purchased phone number of impressions not 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.649
 changed but now we see that 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.460
 purchased phone must be removed from 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.159
 hits as it doesn't fit and if 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.740
 base reksi we put the phrase buy 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 phone without different operators then 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.820
 get a lot of garbage requests so 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:25.590
 we need to add 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:26.090
 the operator! before the word buy like we 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.969
 see 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.659
 The quality of the show has changed by as much as 30 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.240
 Thousands of impressions per month operator! 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.780
 put then when we want to 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.179
 the right word seemed in the right form in 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.569
 In our case, such forms as buy 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.549
 bought and others are cut off 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.560
 move on to the next statement phrasal 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.560
 compliance to apply it 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.270
 it is necessary to put quotes at the end and in 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.270
 the beginning of our key phrase 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.959
 that we see all the words that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.140
 added to our key phrase 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.979
 word forms are cut off with this 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.319
 conformity 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.750
 may change therefore when 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.849
 need you can also put 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.010
 the operator ! 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:22.280
 inside this statement next 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.220
 operator is the square brackets are put 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.730
 they are also at the beginning and at the end of the key 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.819
 phrases 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.730
 This operator is necessary in order to 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.680
 fix the word order that is our 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.560
 the ad will be shown then 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.959
 when the word phone will follow 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.829
 word buy and under no other 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.130
 circumstances 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:46.660
 there is also an operator for prepositions to 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.720
 Yandex Direct recognized our excuses 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.790
 let's say we keep the key phrase buy for 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:00.950
 the phone so we see yandex direct not 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.200
 noticed that there is an excuse for the same 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.049
 concerns and unions he them just not so 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.139
 recognizes for him to see them 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:13.030
 It is necessary to put the operator plus 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.030
 before our excuses or unions 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.200
 now he noticed that we 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.200
 there is a preposition or union 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.680
 another operator that is not used 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.710
 often even i would say almost not 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.590
 this operator is used parentheses 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.790
 parentheses allow you to make 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.950
 grouping keywords in one phrase 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:56.930
 for example, we introduce the following request to buy 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:59.870
 phone or smartphone as we see now 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.870
 our ad will show by 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:09.590
 two key phrases to buy a phone or 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.630
 buy a smartphone on it all great 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.890
