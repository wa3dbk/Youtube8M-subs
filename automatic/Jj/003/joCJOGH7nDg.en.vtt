00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
nutrients than standard juicing we don't
add<00:01:40.500> any<00:01:40.740> water<00:01:41.010> or<00:01:41.430> sugar<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.940> them<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.450> are

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
add any water or sugar to them they are

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
add any water or sugar to them they are
the<00:01:42.810> real<00:01:43.080> deal<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.620> results<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.220> very

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the real deal and results in a very

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.510 
the real deal and results in a very
nutrient<00:01:45.360> dense<00:01:45.390> green<00:01:45.840> juice<00:01:46.160> and<00:01:47.160> so<00:01:47.340> we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
nutrient dense green juice and so we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.830 
nutrient dense green juice and so we
think<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.300> quite<00:01:48.750> different

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
think that we are really quite different

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.450 
think that we are really quite different
from<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> other<00:01:49.590> juice<00:01:49.860> companies<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.430> there

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
from the other juice companies out there

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.700 
from the other juice companies out there
I<00:01:50.910> would<00:01:51.450> love<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.990> green<00:01:52.200> juice<00:01:52.410> in<00:01:52.620> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
I would love to get a green juice in the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.900 
I would love to get a green juice in the
hands<00:01:53.010> of<00:01:53.070> every<00:01:53.370> American<00:01:53.820> every<00:01:53.940> single<00:01:54.750> day
