00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
packages to bounce off something and

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
packages to bounce off something and
land<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.320> now<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.070> kind<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.519> hard<00:00:23.760> and

land on you now this is kind of hard and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.849 
land on you now this is kind of hard and
it<00:00:24.150> will<00:00:24.300> take<00:00:24.510> quite<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> while<00:00:24.900> yet<00:00:25.320> because

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it will take quite a while yet because

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769 
it will take quite a while yet because
it<00:00:26.340> most<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> time<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> care<00:00:27.390> packages

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it most of the time the care packages

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.720 
it most of the time the care packages
will<00:00:27.960> kill<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.500> land<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.609> you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
will kill you if they land on you so you

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.980 
will kill you if they land on you so you
have<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> make<00:00:30.060> sure<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> bounces<00:00:30.840> off

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
have to make sure that it bounces off

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.479 
have to make sure that it bounces off
something<00:00:31.349> off<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.740> ground<00:00:32.009> or<00:00:32.219> something

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
something off the ground or something
