SMG especially the PDW like the one I'm
using<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.840> it<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:51.989> destroys<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> enemy

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
using here it just destroys the enemy

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
right but it's really nice now for the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
right but it's really nice now for the
perks<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.620> using<00:00:58.800> light<00:00:59.129> weights<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.850> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
perks I was using light weights which is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.510 
perks I was using light weights which is
you<00:01:00.300> know<00:01:00.449> able<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> run<00:01:01.590> faster<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you know able to run faster and all that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.189 
you know able to run faster and all that
if<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.780> played<00:01:03.960> any<00:01:04.140> other

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
if you know if you played any other

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.450 
if you know if you played any other
cause<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
cause you know what that is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310 
cause you know what that is
toughness<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> new<00:01:06.630> perk<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.170> added

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
toughness is a new perk that they added

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.219 
toughness is a new perk that they added
and<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.650> reduces<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> flinch<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.049> if

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and it reduces the flinch so if I if

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
and it reduces the flinch so if I if
some<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.560> enemy<00:01:10.860> shoots<00:01:11.159> me<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.360> won't<00:01:12.750> go

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
some an enemy shoots me then I won't go

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.859 
some an enemy shoots me then I won't go
up<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.799> much<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> lose<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.970> aim<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.720> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
up as much and lose my my aim which is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
up as much and lose my my aim which is
really<00:01:16.140> helpful<00:01:16.439> especially<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.189> SMG<00:01:17.520> if

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
really helpful especially with an SMG if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.399 
really helpful especially with an SMG if
you're<00:01:18.119> inherently<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.990> get<00:01:19.140> shot

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you're inherently going to get shot

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
you're inherently going to get shot
often<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> figured<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.360> was<00:01:21.479> really

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
often so I figured that was really

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.080 
often so I figured that was really
important<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.409> thought<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.920> really

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
important and I thought this out really

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
important and I thought this out really
deeply<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.229> third<00:01:25.409> perk<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.070> actually

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
deeply now the third perk I actually

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.310 
deeply now the third perk I actually
went<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> grabbed<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> greed

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
went with to I grabbed the the greed

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.380 
went with to I grabbed the the greed
card<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> third<00:01:29.520> perk<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
card for the third perk and this the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
which is very cool it's kind of like the

the thing with kill streaks is that you

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.520 
the thing with kill streaks is that you
don't<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.850> many<00:02:51.120> points<00:02:51.530> you

third kill streak is the stealth chopper
which<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.440> I've<00:03:01.740> only<00:03:01.920> tried<00:03:02.220> once<00:03:02.520> but

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
which I I've only tried once but

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.270 
which I I've only tried once but
essentially<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.560> doesn't<00:03:04.800> show<00:03:05.040> up<00:03:05.160> on

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
essentially it doesn't show up on

essentially it doesn't show up on
there's<00:03:05.520> men<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.820> their<00:03:05.970> mini-map<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.480> they

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
there's men on their mini-map so they

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.090 
there's men on their mini-map so they
don't<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> chopper<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.620> shooting<00:03:07.920> at

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
don't know that a chopper is shooting at

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.270 
don't know that a chopper is shooting at
them<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.520> didn't<00:03:09.360> get<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.780> game<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.440> it
