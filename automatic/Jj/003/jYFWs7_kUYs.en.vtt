the<00:01:10.260> coyote<00:01:11.689> my<00:01:12.689> research<00:01:13.140> showed<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
the coyote my research showed that

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
the coyote my research showed that
coyote<00:01:15.150> was<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> closest<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> Magpul<00:01:16.680> FDE

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
coyote was the closest to a Magpul FDE

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.620 
coyote was the closest to a Magpul FDE
but<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.150> there's<00:01:18.360> another<00:01:18.420> color<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
but then there's another color that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.149 
but then there's another color that
brown<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:21.810> sells<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.740> Brownells

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
brown now sells that the Brownells

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
brown now sells that the Brownells
employees<00:01:23.909> were<00:01:24.150> saying<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.780> closer<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.320> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
employees were saying are closer to a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.890 
employees were saying are closer to a
Magpul<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.570> didn't<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.720> take<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
Magpul but I didn't want to take the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.160 
Magpul but I didn't want to take the
chance<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.439> seem<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> major

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
chance to seem like this is the major

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.240 
chance to seem like this is the major
consensus<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> closest<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:35.040> is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
consensus that this is the closest it is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.539 
consensus that this is the closest it is
pretty<00:01:35.520> close<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.500> close<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.369> can

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
pretty close but not that close you can

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
pretty close but not that close you can
really<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> difference<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.600> has<00:01:39.750> more<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really see the difference it has more of

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
really see the difference it has more of
a<00:01:40.140> green<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.790> which<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.150> came<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.390> -<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
a green in it which kind of came out - I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.719 
a green in it which kind of came out - I
kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> contrast<00:01:44.780> not<00:01:45.780> bad

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
kind of like the contrast not bad

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.969 
kind of like the contrast not bad
so<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.479> course<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> Rock<00:01:49.290> Island<00:01:49.530> armory

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470

painted<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.590> but<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:50.860> got<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> little<00:02:51.460> excited

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
painted it but I got a little excited

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
and i reassemble dit a little earlier

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.280 
and i reassemble dit a little earlier
probably<00:02:56.980> than<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.280> should<00:02:57.550> have<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:59.020> I<00:02:59.080> got<00:02:59.260> a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
probably than I should have so I got a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.270 
probably than I should have so I got a
little<00:03:00.210> paint<00:03:01.210> we're<00:03:01.480> off<00:03:01.720> here<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.110> there<00:03:02.350> as

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
little paint we're off here and there as

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.070 
little paint we're off here and there as
far<00:03:03.460> as<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.610> prep<00:03:03.940> goes<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.450> just<00:03:04.660> sanded<00:03:04.960> it

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
far as the prep goes I just sanded it

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.490 
far as the prep goes I just sanded it
with<00:03:05.170> 200<00:03:05.590> grit<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:07.120> ice<00:03:07.420> added<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.140> but<00:03:08.380> I

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
with 200 grit this ice added to but I

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.080 
with 200 grit this ice added to but I
soaked<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.190> vinegar<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.610> stripped<00:03:09.940> all<00:03:10.060> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
soaked in vinegar and stripped all the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.760 
soaked in vinegar and stripped all the
coating<00:03:10.420> off<00:03:10.690> because<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.020> had<00:03:11.200> coating<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.740> it

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
coating off because it had coating on it

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.890 
coating off because it had coating on it
that<00:03:11.980> was<00:03:12.130> pretty<00:03:12.340> messed<00:03:13.120> up<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.690> had

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
that was pretty messed up and it had

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.410 
that was pretty messed up and it had
like<00:03:14.110> high<00:03:14.320> spots<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.550> really<00:03:16.210> took

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
like high spots in it so I really took

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.260 
like high spots in it so I really took
this<00:03:16.600> down<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.960> bare<00:03:17.170> metal<00:03:17.970> I'll<00:03:18.970> probably

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
this down to bare metal I'll probably

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.750 
this down to bare metal I'll probably
throw<00:03:19.810> some<00:03:20.080> pictures<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.680> here<00:03:20.980> for<00:03:21.490> you<00:03:21.580> guys

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
to see spikes billet trigger guard I

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.020 
to see spikes billet trigger guard I
took<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.470> Magpul<00:03:35.980> plastic<00:03:36.430> off<00:03:36.580> at<00:03:36.730> her<00:03:36.820> I

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
took that Magpul plastic off at her I

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.000 
took that Magpul plastic off at her I
put<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.950> also<00:03:38.950> did<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.430> buffer<00:03:39.760> tube<00:03:41.010> you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
put that also did the buffer tube you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.860 
put that also did the buffer tube you
can<00:03:42.160> see<00:03:42.340> where<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.670> kind<00:03:43.210> of<00:03:43.330> scratched<00:03:43.660> it

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
can see where it kind of scratched it

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.910 
can see where it kind of scratched it
we're<00:03:44.020> at<00:03:44.110> nicked<00:03:44.320> it<00:03:44.440> when<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.620> put<00:03:44.800> it<00:03:44.860> back

together<00:03:45.130> little<00:03:45.490> early<00:03:45.820> probably<00:03:46.570> shouldn't

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
together little early probably shouldn't

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.540
