and I absolutely love this bag

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.909 
and I absolutely love this bag
especially<00:06:08.419> since<00:06:08.690> they<00:06:08.930> don't<00:06:09.139> make<00:06:09.409> this

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
especially since they don't make this

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.790 
especially since they don't make this
bag<00:06:10.490> anymore<00:06:11.150> and<00:06:11.599> I<00:06:11.690> love<00:06:11.990> it<00:06:12.169> it's<00:06:12.440> in<00:06:12.620> great

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
bag anymore and I love it it's in great

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.990 
bag anymore and I love it it's in great
condition<00:06:13.120> so<00:06:14.139> that's<00:06:15.139> it<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:15.979> do<00:06:16.430> have<00:06:16.729> another

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
condition so that's it I do have another

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.600 
condition so that's it I do have another
reveal<00:06:17.570> but<00:06:17.990> I'm<00:06:18.259> really<00:06:18.680> busy<00:06:18.919> so<00:06:19.310> I'm<00:06:19.400> just

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
reveal but I'm really busy so I'm just

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.700 
reveal but I'm really busy so I'm just
doing<00:06:19.849> this<00:06:20.030> one<00:06:20.090> really<00:06:20.509> quickly<00:06:20.750> I<00:06:21.229> don't

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
doing this one really quickly I don't

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.879 
doing this one really quickly I don't
think<00:06:21.949> I'll<00:06:22.039> have<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.219> chance<00:06:22.639> to<00:06:22.820> do<00:06:22.969> that<00:06:23.180> one

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
think I'll have a chance to do that one

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.180 
think I'll have a chance to do that one
right<00:06:24.889> now<00:06:25.099> so<00:06:25.490> I'll<00:06:25.820> have<00:06:25.969> to<00:06:26.060> do<00:06:26.150> that
