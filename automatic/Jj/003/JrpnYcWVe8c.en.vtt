00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
thing I will say is that this album

thing I will say is that this album
cover<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> certainly<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.150> bit<00:01:12.390> interesting<00:01:12.960> if

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
cover is certainly a bit interesting if

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.410 
cover is certainly a bit interesting if
not<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.560> simplistic<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.909> consider

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
not a bit simplistic if you consider

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.929 
not a bit simplistic if you consider
their<00:01:15.689> previous<00:01:16.200> couple<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.799> albums<00:01:17.700> such<00:01:17.909> as

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
their previous couple for albums such as

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
their previous couple for albums such as
a<00:01:18.119> matter<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.479> life<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> death<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.439> dance<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
a matter of life and death or dance of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.679 
a matter of life and death or dance of
death<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> final<00:01:20.729> frontier<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
death or the final frontier this is one

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
death or the final frontier this is one
that<00:01:21.810> hardly<00:01:22.110> seems<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.040> much<00:01:23.189> detail

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that hardly seems to have as much detail

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.780 
that hardly seems to have as much detail
really<00:01:24.390> presented<00:01:25.140> within<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.159> really

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
really presented within it but I really

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.340 
really presented within it but I really
think<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.240> something<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.080> should

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
think this is something that we should

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
think this is something that we should
be<00:01:28.380> able<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.829> forgive<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> band<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.850> even

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
be able to forgive the band for even

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
be able to forgive the band for even
though<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> face<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> looks<00:01:32.159> pretty

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
though the face on that looks pretty

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
though the face on that looks pretty
damn<00:01:32.610> cool<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.240> course<00:01:33.509> Eddie<00:01:33.960> always<00:01:34.380> looks

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
damn cool of course Eddie always looks

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.219 
damn cool of course Eddie always looks
pretty<00:01:34.829> damn<00:01:34.979> cool<00:01:35.600> for<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.960> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
pretty damn cool for all we know this is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
pretty damn cool for all we know this is
something<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:37.890> also<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.430> part

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
something that could also just be part

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
something that could also just be part
of<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.820> special<00:01:38.939> edition<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.259> could<00:01:40.409> be

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of a special edition and there could be

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
of a special edition and there could be
something<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:41.009> even<00:01:41.340> cooler<00:01:41.579> artwork

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
something with even cooler artwork

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
something with even cooler artwork
inside<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:43.890> making<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
inside of it really if you're making a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.889 
inside of it really if you're making a
big<00:01:44.520> deal<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.000> artwork<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:45.840> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
big deal of the artwork right now you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
big deal of the artwork right now you
probably<00:01:46.380> should<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.829> chill<00:01:47.280> out

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
probably should just chill out

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
probably should just chill out
considering<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.450> merely<00:01:49.020> an

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200

for<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.350> continue<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:38.340> morph<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
for that to continue to morph and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.840 
for that to continue to morph and
continue<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.690> become<00:02:40.260> an<00:02:40.530> even<00:02:40.830> larger<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
more important facet of their sound but

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.280 
more important facet of their sound but
they're<00:02:45.180> being<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.480> song<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.110> that's

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
about 18 minutes in length I definitely

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.930 
about 18 minutes in length I definitely
would<00:02:49.020> kind<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.130> pin<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:50.910> a

reported that it has a very live feel to
it<00:03:14.820> which<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.270> certainly<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.080> an

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
it which is certainly going to be an

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.350 
it which is certainly going to be an
interesting<00:03:16.620> endeavor<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.790> interesting

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
interesting endeavor and interesting

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.990 
interesting endeavor and interesting
experience<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.350> also<00:03:20.040> think<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.700> based

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
experience I also think that based

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.060 
experience I also think that based
around<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.450> length<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.020> album<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
around the length of this album and the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.590 
around the length of this album and the
length<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.580> some<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.850> these<00:03:23.940> tracks<00:03:24.330> that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
length of some of these tracks that

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.210 
length of some of these tracks that
there's<00:03:24.900> definitely<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.680> concept

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
there's definitely going to be a concept

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.800 
there's definitely going to be a concept
here<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.700> think<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.300> going<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:27.780> a

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
here I think this is going to have a

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.570 
here I think this is going to have a
little<00:03:28.080> bit<00:03:28.260> more<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.620> story<00:03:28.920> arc<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.459> it

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
little bit more of a story arc to it

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.970 
little bit more of a story arc to it
than<00:03:29.760> perhaps<00:03:30.030> was<00:03:30.690> originally<00:03:31.260> intended<00:03:31.800> it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
than perhaps was originally intended it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.860 
than perhaps was originally intended it
may<00:03:32.280> not<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.459> one<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.820> has<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> direct<00:03:33.150> story

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
may not be one that has a direct story

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.290 
may not be one that has a direct story
that<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.380> follow<00:03:34.590> simple<00:03:35.340> similar<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> an

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
that you can follow simple similar to an

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.020 
that you can follow simple similar to an
operation<00:03:36.840> mindcrime<00:03:37.080> or<00:03:37.800> metropolis<00:03:38.520> to

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
operation mindcrime or metropolis to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.699 
operation mindcrime or metropolis to
scenes<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> memory<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.650> is

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
scenes of the memory but I think this is

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.470 
scenes of the memory but I think this is
one<00:03:41.040> where<00:03:41.160> everything<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.760> going<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.030> kind<00:03:42.330> of

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
one where everything is going to kind of

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.780 
one where everything is going to kind of
loosely<00:03:43.170> connect<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.830> one<00:03:43.980> another<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.459> some

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
loosely connect to one another in some

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.810 
loosely connect to one another in some
way<00:03:44.970> shape<00:03:45.239> or<00:03:45.420> form<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:46.140> overall<00:03:46.800> go<00:03:47.430> with

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
way shape or form and overall go with

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.030 
way shape or form and overall go with
the<00:03:48.000> central<00:03:48.420> theme<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.440> book<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.709> souls

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
the central theme of the book of souls

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.070 
the central theme of the book of souls
and<00:03:50.370> really<00:03:51.239> whenever<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.600> consider<00:03:52.020> a

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
and really whenever you consider a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.070 
and really whenever you consider a
concept<00:03:52.680> such<00:03:53.100> as<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.520> one<00:03:53.790> it's<00:03:54.080> definitely

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
concept such as that one it's definitely

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.990 
concept such as that one it's definitely
one<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:55.739> take<00:03:55.920> multiple<00:03:56.790> different

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
one that you can take multiple different

ways multiple different places and you

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.790 
ways multiple different places and you
can<00:03:59.970> easily<00:04:00.209> interconnect<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.200> interweave

can easily interconnect and interweave

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.920 
can easily interconnect and interweave
everything<00:04:02.430> together<00:04:02.640> with<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> little<00:04:03.780> bit

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
everything together with a little bit

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.449 
everything together with a little bit
more<00:04:04.050> simplicity<00:04:04.500> than<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:04.920> could<00:04:05.130> if<00:04:05.310> this

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
more simplicity than you could if this

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.210 
more simplicity than you could if this
was<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.640> dynamic<00:04:05.940> story<00:04:06.630> with<00:04:07.220> multiple
