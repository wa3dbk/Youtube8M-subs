had<00:01:15.429> to<00:01:15.609> put<00:01:15.880> like<00:01:16.030> little<00:01:16.740> dividing<00:01:17.740> wall<00:01:17.859> I

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
had to put like little dividing wall I

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.349 
had to put like little dividing wall I
haven't<00:01:18.159> finished<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.549> dividing<00:01:19.000> wall<00:01:19.030> yet

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
haven't finished the dividing wall yet

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.800 
haven't finished the dividing wall yet
but<00:01:19.630> as<00:01:20.319> you<00:01:20.499> can<00:01:20.590> see<00:01:21.329> it's<00:01:22.329> pretty<00:01:23.049> darn<00:01:23.319> cool

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.940 
except for the lag I think that's
