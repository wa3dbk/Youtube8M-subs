really do out here is um we have a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
really do out here is um we have a
computer<00:01:26.940> lab<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.930> building<00:01:28.200> over<00:01:28.409> here

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
computer lab in the building over here

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
computer lab in the building over here
and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.869> have<00:01:30.869> organized<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.119> instructed<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and I have organized and instructed the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.200 
and I have organized and instructed the
computer<00:01:34.020> classes<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.789> is<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
computer classes there so this is the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
computer classes there so this is the
kind<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> community<00:01:36.600> where<00:01:37.159> there<00:01:38.159> are

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
kind of community where there are

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
kind of community where there are
probably<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.600> anybody<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
probably not really anybody in the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
probably not really anybody in the
entire<00:01:40.890> community<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.670> hasn't<00:01:41.820> seen<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
entire community that hasn't seen a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.040 
entire community that hasn't seen a
computer<00:01:42.780> until<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:45.240> got<00:01:45.869> this

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
computer until I got here so we got this

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.910 
computer until I got here so we got this
set<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:49.380> been<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.679> interesting

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
set up and it's been really interesting

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.969 
set up and it's been really interesting
just<00:01:50.399> trying<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.330> them<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.569> grasp<00:01:52.560> some<00:01:52.890> of

just trying to get them to grasp some of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
just trying to get them to grasp some of
the<00:01:53.039> basic<00:01:53.340> concepts<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.940> like<00:01:54.240> even

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the basic concepts you know like even

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
the basic concepts you know like even
using<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> mouse<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> first<00:01:55.830> time<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.069> lot

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
some ways for the better I think you

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.080

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
like and I don't think you can really

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.420

observe<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.870> without<00:03:06.230> changing<00:03:06.770> at<00:03:07.100> least<00:03:07.340> a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
observe that without changing at least a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.820 
observe that without changing at least a
little<00:03:07.550> bit
