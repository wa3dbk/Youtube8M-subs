you<00:02:10.660> know<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> rollerblade<00:02:11.500> spherically<00:02:12.100> it

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
you know a rollerblade spherically it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.650 
you know a rollerblade spherically it
would<00:02:12.430> work<00:02:12.550> well<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:12.820> them<00:02:13.239> one<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
would work well for them one of the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.470 
would work well for them one of the
spark<00:02:13.959> skates<00:02:14.290> would<00:02:14.500> work<00:02:14.680> really<00:02:14.830> well<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.150> a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
spark skates would work really well so a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.750 
spark skates would work really well so a
person<00:02:17.110> who<00:02:17.260> also<00:02:17.620> may<00:02:18.010> not<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.519> skated

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760

before<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.570> it's<00:02:19.690> really<00:02:19.840> thinking<00:02:20.170> they

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
before but it's really thinking they

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.440 
before but it's really thinking they
want<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.100> for<00:02:21.400> getting<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:21.790> shape<00:02:22.060> or

want to do it for getting in shape or

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.930 
want to do it for getting in shape or
losing<00:02:23.080> weight<00:02:23.110> should<00:02:23.920> they<00:02:24.100> buy<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.580> same

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
losing weight should they buy that same

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.180 
losing weight should they buy that same
publicity<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:26.320> know<00:02:26.410> they<00:02:26.680> could<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:27.160> I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
publicity you know they could but I

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.620 
publicity you know they could but I

they're gonna get involved in it I would

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.890 
they're gonna get involved in it I would
step<00:02:32.709> up<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.980> buy<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> better<00:02:33.970> product<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.750> that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
step up and buy a better product so that

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.660 
step up and buy a better product so that
they<00:02:34.989> could<00:02:35.140> grow<00:02:35.350> into<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.860> people<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.459> more

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
they could grow into it people are more

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.640 
they could grow into it people are more
likely<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.150> continue<00:02:37.510> skating<00:02:38.080> if<00:02:38.500> they've

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
likely to continue skating if they've

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.470 
likely to continue skating if they've
got<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> better<00:02:39.250> fitting<00:02:39.670> food<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.300> better
