00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
those videos and so what I'm trying to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
those videos and so what I'm trying to
say<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.789> video<00:00:51.120> will<00:00:51.329> be<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> very<00:00:51.660> short

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
say is this video will be a very short

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.110 
say is this video will be a very short
one<00:00:52.020> covering<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.620> small<00:00:53.280> optional<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
one covering a very small optional and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
one covering a very small optional and
somewhat<00:00:54.570> unimportant<00:00:55.079> thing<00:00:55.230> meanwhile<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
somewhat unimportant thing meanwhile the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.430 
somewhat unimportant thing meanwhile the
next<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.219> videos<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.850> crammed<00:00:57.629> full<00:00:58.050> they're

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
next two videos are crammed full they're

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
next two videos are crammed full they're
just<00:00:58.739> super<00:00:58.890> long<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.520> stuff<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.000> there

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
just super long and stuff so there

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.490 
just super long and stuff so there
wasn't<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> good<00:01:00.899> way<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> break<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> up

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
wasn't really a good way to break it up

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
wasn't really a good way to break it up
otherwise<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.340> why<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.000> video<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.359> very

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
otherwise that's why this video is very

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210 
otherwise that's why this video is very
short<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> next<00:01:04.229> ones<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.530> super<00:01:04.860> long

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
short but the next ones are super long

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.490 
short but the next ones are super long
so<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> left<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> fire<00:01:07.229> realm

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500

initially<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.890> time<00:01:26.159> consuming<00:01:26.189> but

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
initially and it is time consuming but

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.950 
initially and it is time consuming but
once<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> patterns<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:27.900> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
once you have the patterns kind of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.569 
once you have the patterns kind of
memorized<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.560> make<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.860> serious<00:01:29.220> cash

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
memorized you can make some serious cash

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.069 
memorized you can make some serious cash
here<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.540> interested<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
here if you're not interested in that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.450 
here if you're not interested in that
just<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.799> ahead<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.100> skip<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
just then just go ahead and skip to the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:54.170 
just then just go ahead and skip to the
next<00:01:32.520> video<00:01:52.460> alright<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:53.850> going

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
next video alright so I'm actually going

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.060 
next video alright so I'm actually going
to<00:01:54.299> fast-forward<00:01:54.720> through<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.380> first<00:01:55.680> run

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to fast-forward through this first run

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
to fast-forward through this first run
of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.579> mini<00:01:56.759> game<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.479> will<00:01:57.899> be

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
of the mini game because I will be

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.450 
of the mini game because I will be
explaining<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.560> detail<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> moment

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
explaining it in detail here in a moment

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.219 
explaining it in detail here in a moment
we<00:02:00.090> take<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> map<00:02:00.719> you'll<00:02:00.960> notice

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
we take a look at the map you'll notice

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
we take a look at the map you'll notice
that<00:02:01.380> part<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> track<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.310> grayed<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that part of the track is grayed out and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.340 
that part of the track is grayed out and
this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.320> through

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
this is because they make you go through

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
this is because they make you go through
the<00:02:04.740> easy<00:02:04.860> portion<00:02:05.310> first<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.939> score

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the easy portion first and if you score

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.630 
the easy portion first and if you score
at<00:02:06.329> least<00:02:06.360> 1000<00:02:07.229> points<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.190> unlock

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
at least 1000 points you can then unlock

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.249 
at least 1000 points you can then unlock
the<00:02:08.670> second<00:02:09.300> half<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> tracks<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.140> then

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the second half of the tracks and then

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.260 
the second half of the tracks and then
you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.069> once<00:02:11.220> which<00:02:12.180> is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you can do all of it at once which is

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.510 
you can do all of it at once which is
much<00:02:12.420> more<00:02:12.540> difficult<00:02:12.750> but

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
much more difficult but

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160 
much more difficult but
allows<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.850> get<00:02:13.970> more<00:02:14.030> points<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.750> thus

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
allows you to get more points and thus

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.200 
allows you to get more points and thus
better<00:02:15.500> rewards<00:02:16.070> when<00:02:16.700> you're<00:02:16.820> playing<00:02:17.000> on

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
better rewards when you're playing on

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.150 
better rewards when you're playing on
the<00:02:17.270> harder<00:02:17.690> difficulty<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.770> first<00:02:18.950> part<00:02:19.130> of

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
the harder difficulty the first part of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.470 
the harder difficulty the first part of
the<00:02:19.250> track<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.670> exact<00:02:20.030> same<00:02:20.180> as<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.390> was

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the track is the exact same as it was

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.330 
the track is the exact same as it was
before<00:02:20.800> regardless<00:02:21.800> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.070> score<00:02:22.310> high

enough you will earn a prize and the
higher<00:02:24.080> your<00:02:24.290> score<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.740> better<00:02:24.860> your<00:02:25.070> prize

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
higher your score the better your prize

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.010 
higher your score the better your prize
will<00:02:25.430> be<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> choice<00:02:26.600> between<00:02:26.870> a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
will be you can get a choice between a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.960 
will be you can get a choice between a
large<00:02:27.410> chest<00:02:27.830> which<00:02:28.040> contains<00:02:28.370> rubies<00:02:28.730> or<00:02:28.940> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
large chest which contains rubies or a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.970 
large chest which contains rubies or a
smaller<00:02:29.540> chest<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.470> always<00:02:30.680> has

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
smaller chest but that always has

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.710 
smaller chest but that always has
treasure<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.610> ironically<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.270> treasure<00:02:32.480> can

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
treasure and ironically the treasure can

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.750 
treasure and ironically the treasure can
be<00:02:32.750> sold<00:02:33.020> for<00:02:33.170> much<00:02:33.440> more<00:02:33.740> so<00:02:34.310> unless<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.580> need

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
be sold for much more so unless you need

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.480 
be sold for much more so unless you need
rubies<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.930> keep<00:02:36.530> continue<00:02:36.980> playing<00:02:37.220> it's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
rubies to keep continue playing it's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.100 
rubies to keep continue playing it's
much<00:02:37.760> more<00:02:37.940> beneficial<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.480> always<00:02:38.870> choose

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
much more beneficial to always choose

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.350 
much more beneficial to always choose
the<00:02:39.140> smaller<00:02:39.470> chest<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:39.980> get<00:02:40.070> treasure<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.270> as

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
the smaller chest and get treasure so as

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.730 
the smaller chest and get treasure so as
I<00:02:41.450> mentioned<00:02:41.720> earlier<00:02:42.050> if<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.320> can<00:02:42.440> score<00:02:42.620> at

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
I mentioned earlier if you can score at

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.800 
I mentioned earlier if you can score at
least<00:02:42.980> 1000<00:02:43.640> points<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.120> will<00:02:44.300> unlock<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
least 1000 points this will unlock the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.910 
least 1000 points this will unlock the
rest<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.200> tracks<00:02:45.410> for<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.680> mini<00:02:45.860> game

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
rest of the tracks for this mini game

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.010 
rest of the tracks for this mini game
which<00:02:46.220> takes<00:02:46.730> much<00:02:46.970> longer<00:02:47.150> as<00:02:47.420> much<00:02:47.600> harder

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
which takes much longer as much harder

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.140 
which takes much longer as much harder
but<00:02:48.500> we<00:02:48.680> now<00:02:48.800> have<00:02:48.830> access<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.460> better<00:02:49.610> rewards

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
but we now have access to better rewards

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.790 
but we now have access to better rewards
so<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.810> time<00:02:50.960> I'm<00:02:51.050> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.290> be<00:02:51.350> taking<00:02:51.710> you

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
through step by step and explaining each

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:03.690 
through step by step and explaining each
one<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.540> these<00:02:53.630> sections<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.260> how<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.740> do<00:02:54.950> it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.580 

this<00:03:04.700> first<00:03:04.970> area<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.390> really<00:03:05.810> easy<00:03:06.140> none<00:03:06.500> of

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
this first area is really easy none of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.990 
this first area is really easy none of
the<00:03:06.680> targets<00:03:07.069> are<00:03:07.190> placed<00:03:07.430> funny<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:07.849> just

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
the targets are placed funny but just

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.729 
the targets are placed funny but just
make<00:03:08.120> sure<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.420> hit<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.629> red<00:03:08.900> targets<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.410> full

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
make sure you hit the red targets a full

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:34.050 
make sure you hit the red targets a full
three<00:03:10.340> times<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.849> get<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.420> points

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.330 

as<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:35.349> go<00:03:35.440> down<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.709> hill<00:03:35.890> you'll<00:03:36.099> find

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
as you go down this hill you'll find

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.100 
as you go down this hill you'll find
your<00:03:36.489> first<00:03:36.760> goron<00:03:37.209> target<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.720> try<00:03:37.930> not<00:03:37.959> to

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
your first goron target so I try not to

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.690 
your first goron target so I try not to
hit<00:03:38.260> them<00:03:38.380> obviously<00:03:38.920> because<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.370> will<00:03:39.489> lose

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
hit them obviously because you will lose

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.030 
hit them obviously because you will lose
30<00:03:40.030> points<00:03:40.390> if<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.660> do<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.590> tricky<00:03:41.830> part

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
30 points if you do so the tricky part

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.320 
30 points if you do so the tricky part
here<00:03:42.069> is<00:03:42.280> actually<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.610> make<00:03:42.790> sure<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.120> wait

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
here is actually to make sure you wait

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.930 
here is actually to make sure you wait
long<00:03:43.660> enough<00:03:43.690> before<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.590> shooting<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.670> hit<00:03:45.790> the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
long enough before a shooting to hit the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.339 
long enough before a shooting to hit the
blue<00:03:46.090> targets<00:03:46.360> otherwise<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.050> may<00:03:47.170> actually

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
blue targets otherwise you may actually

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.900 
blue targets otherwise you may actually
hit<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.770> Goron<00:03:48.010> target<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.520> you're<00:03:48.610> just

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
hit the Goron target that you're just

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.640 
hit the Goron target that you're just
passing<00:03:49.120> because<00:03:49.450> if<00:03:50.110> they're<00:03:50.260> keep<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.470> mind

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
passing because if they're keep in mind

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.920 
passing because if they're keep in mind
that<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:51.030> cannon<00:03:52.030> shots<00:03:52.239> travel<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.840> when

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
that the cannon shots travel and when

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.660 
that the cannon shots travel and when
the<00:03:53.080> target<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.440> really<00:03:53.650> close<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.130> it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
the target is really close to you it

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.910 
the target is really close to you it
kind<00:03:54.819> of<00:03:54.940> arcs<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.660> goes<00:03:55.780> up<00:03:55.930> up<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.709> could

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
kind of arcs and goes up up so it could

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.410 
kind of arcs and goes up up so it could
potentially<00:03:57.040> hit<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.580> qhorin<00:03:58.150> partner

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
potentially hit that qhorin partner

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.990 
potentially hit that qhorin partner
instead<00:03:58.980> up<00:03:59.980> ahead<00:04:00.250> we<00:04:00.340> have<00:04:00.459> targets<00:04:00.849> that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
instead up ahead we have targets that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.580 
instead up ahead we have targets that
spin<00:04:01.330> now<00:04:01.569> most<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.840> these<00:04:01.930> have<00:04:02.140> points<00:04:02.470> on

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
spin now most of these have points on

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.990 
spin now most of these have points on
one<00:04:02.800> side<00:04:03.010> but<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> core<00:04:03.400> on<00:04:03.459> face<00:04:03.670> on<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.970> other

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
one side but a core on face on the other

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.309 
one side but a core on face on the other
so<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:04.480> want<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.690> hit<00:04:04.780> them<00:04:04.959> as<00:04:05.110> soon<00:04:05.260> as

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
so you want to hit them as soon as

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.050 
so you want to hit them as soon as
possible<00:04:05.380> when<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.340> correct<00:04:06.580> side<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:06.910> facing

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
possible when the correct side is facing

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.000 
possible when the correct side is facing
you<00:04:07.299> once<00:04:08.019> you've<00:04:08.170> placed<00:04:08.319> enough<00:04:08.620> times<00:04:08.830> you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
you once you've placed enough times you

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.380 
you once you've placed enough times you
will<00:04:09.160> memorize<00:04:09.280> their<00:04:09.610> locations<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.269> can

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
will memorize their locations and can

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.270 
will memorize their locations and can
begin<00:04:10.540> shooting<00:04:10.840> early<00:04:11.290> so<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.769> they'll

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
begin shooting early so that you they'll

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.300 
begin shooting early so that you they'll
get<00:04:12.459> hit<00:04:12.640> as<00:04:12.819> soon<00:04:13.000> as<00:04:13.120> they<00:04:13.239> appear<00:04:14.160> at<00:04:15.160> this

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
get hit as soon as they appear at this

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.469 
get hit as soon as they appear at this
corner<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.760> may<00:04:15.850> want<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.090> wait<00:04:16.299> before

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
corner you may want to wait before

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.629 
corner you may want to wait before
hitting<00:04:16.840> these<00:04:17.049> first<00:04:17.650> two<00:04:17.889> blue<00:04:18.100> targets<00:04:18.310> it

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
hitting these first two blue targets it

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.460 
hitting these first two blue targets it
is<00:04:18.669> possible<00:04:19.150> but<00:04:19.239> very<00:04:19.299> difficult<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:20.290> two

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
is possible but very difficult the two

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.960 
is possible but very difficult the two
after<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:20.979> low<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.549> want<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.790> start

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
after that low you want to start

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.490 
after that low you want to start
shooting<00:04:22.120> as<00:04:22.389> soon<00:04:22.570> as<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.810> Goron<00:04:23.080> side<00:04:23.350> is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
shooting as soon as the Goron side is

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.969 
shooting as soon as the Goron side is
ending<00:04:24.389> okay<00:04:25.419> don't<00:04:25.810> hit<00:04:26.200> this<00:04:26.320> red<00:04:26.530> target<00:04:26.860> it

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
ending okay don't hit this red target it

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.379 
ending okay don't hit this red target it
is<00:04:27.010> really<00:04:27.580> hard<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.760> have<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:27.910> initially

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
is really hard to have that initially

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.969 
is really hard to have that initially
instead<00:04:28.780> it's<00:04:28.930> better<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.229> look<00:04:29.380> behind<00:04:29.590> you

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
instead it's better to look behind you

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.250 
instead it's better to look behind you
and<00:04:30.190> wait<00:04:30.700> for<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.090> rotate<00:04:31.240> quickly<00:04:32.050> hit<00:04:32.169> it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
and wait for it to rotate quickly hit it

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.719 
and wait for it to rotate quickly hit it
three<00:04:32.470> times<00:04:32.710> then<00:04:32.979> turn<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.310> left<00:04:33.520> really

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
three times then turn to the left really

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.310 
three times then turn to the left really
quickly<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.210> hit<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.720> other<00:04:34.750> spinning

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
quickly and hit the other spinning

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.930 
quickly and hit the other spinning
target<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.770> one<00:04:35.979> is<00:04:36.100> red<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.310> both<00:04:36.550> sides<00:04:36.790> so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
target this one is red on both sides so

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.980 
target this one is red on both sides so
don't<00:04:37.090> worry<00:04:37.210> about<00:04:37.419> it<00:04:37.630> turning<00:04:37.900> around

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
don't worry about it turning around

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.170 
don't worry about it turning around
quickly<00:04:38.800> move<00:04:39.070> your<00:04:39.220> camera<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.669> left<00:04:40.030> so

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
quickly move your camera to the left so

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.130 
quickly move your camera to the left so
that<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.450> start<00:04:40.660> hitting<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.930> balloons

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
that you can start hitting the balloons

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.719 
that you can start hitting the balloons
as<00:04:41.320> soon<00:04:41.440> as<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.590> come<00:04:41.740> down<00:04:41.770> here<00:04:42.130> let's<00:04:42.550> hop

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
as soon as you come down here let's hop

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:43.740 
as soon as you come down here let's hop
right<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.120> middle<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.390> them<00:04:43.539> and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
right in the middle of them and

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.990 
right in the middle of them and
obviously<00:04:44.110> avoid<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.800> Goron<00:04:45.070> balloons<00:04:45.430> the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
obviously avoid the Goron balloons the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.460 
obviously avoid the Goron balloons the
position<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.450> these<00:04:46.570> guys<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:46.990> random<00:04:47.380> each

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
position of these guys is random each

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.900 
position of these guys is random each
time<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:47.979> you'll<00:04:48.130> have<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.400> adjust<00:04:48.610> for<00:04:48.820> where

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
time so you'll have to adjust for where

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.400 
time so you'll have to adjust for where
they<00:04:49.030> are<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.419> general<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.930> is<00:04:50.050> smart<00:04:50.320> to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
they are and in general it is smart to

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.440 
they are and in general it is smart to
focus<00:04:50.680> on<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.950> earlier<00:04:51.310> ones<00:04:51.550> because<00:04:52.030> at<00:04:52.270> the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
focus on the earlier ones because at the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.270 
focus on the earlier ones because at the
end<00:04:52.479> you<00:04:52.780> can<00:04:52.870> always<00:04:53.050> turn<00:04:53.320> around<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.800> shoot

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
end you can always turn around and shoot

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
because it spins much too quickly

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.920

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
are the exact same way you'll have to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.330

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.850 

once<00:05:25.540> you<00:05:25.660> get<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.020> blue<00:05:26.260> target<00:05:26.620> quickly

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
once you get to the blue target quickly

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.050 
once you get to the blue target quickly
hit<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.250> then<00:05:27.340> turn<00:05:27.520> your<00:05:27.640> camera<00:05:27.940> around

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
hit it and then turn your camera around

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.640 
hit it and then turn your camera around
to<00:05:28.330> find<00:05:28.600> more<00:05:28.780> balloons<00:05:29.080> again<00:05:29.440> their

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
to find more balloons again their

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.320 
to find more balloons again their
position<00:05:30.010> is<00:05:30.100> random<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.670> they<00:05:30.790> do<00:05:30.850> steadily

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
position is random and they do steadily

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.730 
position is random and they do steadily
move<00:05:31.540> around<00:05:31.780> on<00:05:32.020> their<00:05:32.170> own<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.500> I<00:05:32.560> honestly

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
move around on their own and I honestly

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.710 
move around on their own and I honestly
am<00:05:33.220> really<00:05:33.940> bad<00:05:34.060> at<00:05:34.120> aiming<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.540> balloons

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
am really bad at aiming the balloons

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.930 
am really bad at aiming the balloons
myself<00:05:35.170> and<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.620> it's<00:05:35.800> by<00:05:35.920> far<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.460> area<00:05:36.850> of

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
myself and so it's by far the area of

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.160 
myself and so it's by far the area of
this<00:05:37.000> minigame<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.570> struggle<00:05:37.930> with<00:05:38.050> the

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
this minigame that I struggle with the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.470 
this minigame that I struggle with the
most<00:05:38.200> I<00:05:38.790> always<00:05:39.790> try<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:39.970> hit<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.210> balloons

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
most I always try to hit the balloons

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.030 
most I always try to hit the balloons
closest<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.230> the<00:05:41.290> beginning<00:05:41.530> and<00:05:41.740> leave<00:05:41.920> the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
closest to the beginning and leave the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.890 
closest to the beginning and leave the
ones<00:05:42.190> at<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.370> end<00:05:42.610> for<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.180> last<00:05:43.420> because<00:05:43.810> you

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
ones at the end for the last because you

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.120 
ones at the end for the last because you
could<00:05:44.020> always<00:05:44.140> turn<00:05:44.320> around<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.770> get<00:05:44.920> one

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
could always turn around and get one

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.760 
could always turn around and get one
last<00:05:45.340> chance<00:05:45.880> to<00:05:46.090> hit<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.240> few<00:05:46.420> more<00:05:46.770> quickly

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
last chance to hit a few more quickly

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.440 
last chance to hit a few more quickly
turn<00:05:48.010> around<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.370> prepare<00:05:48.490> for<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.060> final

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
turn around and prepare for the final

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.120 
turn around and prepare for the final
hill<00:05:49.660> we<00:05:49.840> have<00:05:49.990> several<00:05:50.350> blue<00:05:50.500> targets<00:05:50.770> and

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
hill we have several blue targets and

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.130 
hill we have several blue targets and
what<00:05:51.670> we<00:05:51.760> pass<00:05:51.940> them<00:05:52.090> very<00:05:52.330> quickly<00:05:52.510> they're

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
what we pass them very quickly they're

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.010 
what we pass them very quickly they're
pretty<00:05:53.290> easy<00:05:53.440> though<00:05:57.330> at<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.480> very<00:05:58.660> end<00:05:58.900> we

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
pretty easy though at the very end we

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.600 
pretty easy though at the very end we
have<00:05:59.140> a<00:05:59.170> spinning<00:05:59.620> red<00:05:59.800> target<00:06:00.190> with<00:06:00.310> a<00:06:00.340> go<00:06:00.520> on

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
have a spinning red target with a go on

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.460 
have a spinning red target with a go on
face<00:06:00.820> on<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.180> other<00:06:01.300> side<00:06:01.570> I<00:06:01.840> recommend<00:06:02.410> you

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
face on the other side I recommend you

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.080 
face on the other side I recommend you
wait<00:06:02.590> until<00:06:02.890> it's<00:06:03.010> turning<00:06:03.310> back<00:06:03.490> around<00:06:03.520> and

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
wait until it's turning back around and

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.610 
wait until it's turning back around and
have<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.330> shoot<00:06:04.540> it<00:06:04.660> a<00:06:04.780> little<00:06:04.990> early<00:06:05.380> so<00:06:05.590> that

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
have to shoot it a little early so that

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.410 
have to shoot it a little early so that
by<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.860> time<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.400> cannonball<00:06:06.790> hits<00:06:07.030> it<00:06:07.180> it's

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
by the time the cannonball hits it it's

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.210 
by the time the cannonball hits it it's
already<00:06:07.720> turned<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:08.080> the<00:06:08.170> correct<00:06:08.440> side<00:06:08.740> this

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
already turned to the correct side this

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.410 
already turned to the correct side this
may<00:06:09.400> take<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.580> little<00:06:09.670> bit<00:06:09.850> of<00:06:09.910> practice<00:06:10.060> and

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
may take a little bit of practice and

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.180 
may take a little bit of practice and
this<00:06:10.630> one<00:06:10.780> seems<00:06:11.050> to<00:06:11.320> spin<00:06:11.710> around<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:12.100> little

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
this one seems to spin around a little

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.320 
this one seems to spin around a little
bit<00:06:12.370> faster<00:06:12.850> than<00:06:12.940> some<00:06:13.090> of<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.240> previous

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
bit faster than some of the previous

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.810 
bit faster than some of the previous
ones<00:06:13.830> maybe<00:06:14.830> that's<00:06:15.040> just<00:06:15.100> my<00:06:15.250> imagination

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
ones maybe that's just my imagination

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.000 
ones maybe that's just my imagination
but<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.030> sure<00:06:16.150> seems<00:06:16.360> like<00:06:16.570> it<00:06:16.720> but<00:06:16.750> you<00:06:17.440> like

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
but it sure seems like it but you like

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.470 
but it sure seems like it but you like
barely<00:06:18.220> have<00:06:18.430> enough<00:06:18.460> time<00:06:18.730> to<00:06:18.910> get<00:06:19.120> all<00:06:19.180> three

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
barely have enough time to get all three

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.240 
barely have enough time to get all three
hits<00:06:19.840> off<00:06:19.990> before<00:06:20.410> it<00:06:20.590> spins<00:06:20.830> back<00:06:21.040> to<00:06:21.160> the

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
hits off before it spins back to the

hits off before it spins back to the
wrong<00:06:21.400> side<00:06:21.660> alright<00:06:22.660> so<00:06:22.840> that<00:06:22.960> particular

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
wrong side alright so that particular

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.930 
wrong side alright so that particular
recording<00:06:23.710> was<00:06:23.800> one<00:06:23.920> of<00:06:24.010> my<00:06:24.130> better<00:06:24.430> scores

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940

the alchemy stone that I get in this

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.590 
the alchemy stone that I get in this
recording<00:06:33.340> so<00:06:33.880> I<00:06:33.940> stuck<00:06:34.120> around<00:06:34.150> here<00:06:34.480> for

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
recording so I stuck around here for

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.300 
recording so I stuck around here for
almost<00:06:34.750> two<00:06:34.930> hours<00:06:34.960> just<00:06:35.380> practicing<00:06:36.130> and

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
almost two hours just practicing and

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.130 
almost two hours just practicing and
then<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.520> went<00:06:37.120> back<00:06:37.330> through<00:06:37.360> to<00:06:37.870> actually

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
then I went back through to actually

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.570 
then I went back through to actually
record<00:06:38.380> it<00:06:38.560> and<00:06:38.650> I<00:06:38.740> was<00:06:38.860> doing<00:06:39.040> so<00:06:39.190> good<00:06:39.370> that<00:06:39.550> I

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
record it and I was doing so good that I

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.130 
record it and I was doing so good that I
just<00:06:39.820> figured<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.150> might<00:06:40.270> as<00:06:40.390> well<00:06:40.480> just<00:06:40.720> keep

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
just figured I might as well just keep

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.930 
just figured I might as well just keep
going<00:06:41.500> so<00:06:41.800> I<00:06:42.070> actually<00:06:42.340> stuck<00:06:42.640> around<00:06:42.730> here

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
going so I actually stuck around here

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.220 
going so I actually stuck around here
for<00:06:43.090> a<00:06:43.120> while<00:06:43.270> the<00:06:43.510> amount<00:06:43.720> of<00:06:43.750> profit<00:06:44.140> you

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
for a while the amount of profit you

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.050 
for a while the amount of profit you
make<00:06:44.260> here<00:06:44.560> is<00:06:44.650> pretty<00:06:44.920> crazy<00:06:45.160> although<00:06:45.910> time

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
make here is pretty crazy although time

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.790 
make here is pretty crazy although time
consuming<00:06:46.510> so<00:06:47.050> I<00:06:47.080> basically<00:06:47.230> stayed<00:06:47.620> here

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
consuming so I basically stayed here

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.860 
consuming so I basically stayed here
