00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
this tactic where this piston pushes

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.370 
this tactic where this piston pushes
this<00:00:25.170> piston<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:27.090> make<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.750> grab<00:00:28.109> this

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
this piston to make this one grab this

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.529 
this piston to make this one grab this
and<00:00:28.650> when<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> click<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.250> switch<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:30.240> comes

and when you click the switch this comes

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.780 
and when you click the switch this comes
down<00:00:30.720> pulling<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.590> block<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.219> Miss

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
down pulling this block down the Miss

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
down pulling this block down the Miss
block<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.870> piston<00:00:34.290> comes<00:00:34.500> down

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
block because this piston comes down

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.459 
block because this piston comes down
pulling<00:00:35.130> both<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:35.730> down<00:00:36.170> with<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> new

way 1.5 when you click the switch eat

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.310 
way 1.5 when you click the switch eat
this<00:00:45.539> does<00:00:45.840> not<00:00:46.079> pull<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:48.210> block<00:00:48.539> back<00:00:48.870> but

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this does not pull this block back but

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
this does not pull this block back but
if<00:00:49.440> i<00:00:50.600> if<00:00:51.600> i<00:00:51.719> delay<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:53.329> it<00:00:54.329> tried<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> pull

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
if i if i delay that it tried to pull

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.130 
if i if i delay that it tried to pull
this<00:00:55.590> back<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.850> sticky<00:00:57.270> piston<00:00:57.660> did<00:00:57.989> not

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
this back but this sticky piston did not

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.310 
this back but this sticky piston did not
hold<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.010> block<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.660> why<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
hold on to this block so that is why it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
hold on to this block so that is why it
is<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> bad<00:01:03.840> idea<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:05.210> will<00:01:06.210> not

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
is a it is now a bad idea it will not

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.719 
is a it is now a bad idea it will not
work<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> created<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.479> new<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
work like that so I created a new way it

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.929 
work like that so I created a new way it
sort<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.960> works<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.260> works<00:01:13.470> um<00:01:13.979> pulling

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
sort of works it works um pulling

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.570 
sort of works it works um pulling
everything<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.320> need<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.520> some

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
everything in but I need to make some

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.280 
everything in but I need to make some
additions<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.689> order<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> pull<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
additions to know in order to pull it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.510 
additions to know in order to pull it
out<00:01:20.689> now<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.439> didn't<00:01:22.770> include<00:01:23.220> all

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
out now this is it I didn't include all

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.240 
out now this is it I didn't include all
the<00:01:23.549> outsides<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.360> anything<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.100> it's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the outsides or anything but what it's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.810 
the outsides or anything but what it's
supposed<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:28.290> click<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> switch<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
supposed to do is I click the switch it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.200 
supposed to do is I click the switch it
comes<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:31.310> which<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.490> hooked<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
comes to here which is hooked up to this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
comes to here which is hooked up to this
torch<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.700> holds<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.799> then<00:01:37.799> these<00:01:38.100> two

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
torch it holds this in then these two

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.420 
torch it holds this in then these two
Pistons<00:01:38.850> push<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:41.070> gonna

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
Pistons push this in and I was gonna

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.719 
Pistons push this in and I was gonna
have<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.970> other<00:01:42.119> way<00:01:43.130> right<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
have that other way right there that

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
have that other way right there that
would<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:44.970> been<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> perfect<00:01:45.180> idea<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
would have been a perfect idea if it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.870 
would have been a perfect idea if it
would<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.399> would<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.700> sucked

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
would have just this would have sucked

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.639 
would have just this would have sucked
in<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> most<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> second<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.530> then

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
in and the most do it a second but then

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.730 
in and the most do it a second but then
this<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.159> been<00:01:50.189> stuck<00:01:50.670> right<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.740> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
this would have been stuck right here so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.480 
this would have been stuck right here so
then<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.369> these<00:01:54.030> two<00:01:54.329> pistons<00:01:55.490> pulling

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
then I have these two pistons pulling

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.550 
then I have these two pistons pulling
this<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.780> these<00:01:58.079> two

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
this up and then I have these two

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
this up and then I have these two
pistons<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.939> wrist<00:02:00.090> corner

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
pistons that are up your wrist corner

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.109 
pistons that are up your wrist corner
pulling<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> back<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.640> I'm<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.939> give

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
pulling it back in so I'm going to give

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.320 
pulling it back in so I'm going to give
you<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> demonstration<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:04.140> how<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.290> works

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330 

just<00:02:08.330> like<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.080> as<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.740> can<00:02:09.890> see<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.190> got

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
just like that and as you can see it got

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.980 
just like that and as you can see it got
the<00:02:10.520> middle<00:02:10.790> block<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:13.690> hopefully<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:14.840> you

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
the middle block and hopefully if you

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.510 
the middle block and hopefully if you
guys<00:02:15.170> are<00:02:15.500> okay<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.280> not<00:02:16.520> super<00:02:17.060> like

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
guys are okay with it and not super like

what is it called OCD about it you'll be
able<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.970> have<00:02:23.660> all<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.050> open<00:02:24.260> space<00:02:24.440> with<00:02:25.130> a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
able to have all this open space with a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040 
able to have all this open space with a
torch<00:02:25.730> here<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> couple<00:02:26.390> pistons<00:02:26.900> right

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
torch here and a couple pistons right

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.090 
torch here and a couple pistons right
there<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.670> yeah<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:29.060> was<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.110> did

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
there but yeah that was it was I did

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.660 
there but yeah that was it was I did
that<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.910> didn't<00:02:32.330> take<00:02:32.450> me<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:32.600> long<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.670> make

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that it didn't take me that long to make

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.930 
that it didn't take me that long to make
it<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.060> did<00:02:35.450> some<00:02:35.720> timings<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.710> it<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.850> I

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
it I just did some timings to it and I

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.860 
it I just did some timings to it and I
just<00:02:38.240> had<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.570> idea<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:39.520> having<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.820> cold<00:02:41.180> this

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
just had the idea of having it cold this

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.490 
just had the idea of having it cold this
way<00:02:42.050> than<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:42.380> way<00:02:42.440> then<00:02:42.770> back<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:44.600> if<00:02:45.320> I

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
way than this way then back in but if I

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.970 
way than this way then back in but if I
were<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.860> try<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.160> pull<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.820> back<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:48.020> just

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
were to try to pull it back in it just

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.000 
were to try to pull it back in it just
it<00:02:49.160> gets<00:02:49.430> all<00:02:49.550> glitchy<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:54.260> then<00:02:54.470> this<00:02:54.710> block

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
it gets all glitchy and then this block

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.100 
it gets all glitchy and then this block
kind<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:56.030> pokes<00:02:56.510> out<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.330> need<00:03:00.020> to

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
kind of put pokes out so it is I need to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.130 
kind of put pokes out so it is I need to
try<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.350> find<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.710> way<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.940> have<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.090> push<00:03:02.570> back

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
try to find a way to have it push back

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.240 
try to find a way to have it push back
in<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:08.450> other<00:03:08.600> than<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.680> very

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
in but other than that this is a very

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.180 
in but other than that this is a very
effective<00:03:10.730> way<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.090> think<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.959> order<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.590> do

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
effective way I think in order to do

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:21.550 
effective way I think in order to do
that<00:03:16.000> we'll<00:03:17.000> just<00:03:17.030> reset<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:21.260> yeah<00:03:21.440> if

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
that we'll just reset this so yeah if

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.479 
that we'll just reset this so yeah if
you<00:03:21.739> were<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:21.950> put<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.430> Pistons<00:03:22.940> down<00:03:23.360> here

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.910 

and<00:03:28.489> hook<00:03:29.270> them<00:03:29.480> up<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.320> would<00:03:30.560> most

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
and hook them up to it it would most

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.100 
and hook them up to it it would most
likely<00:03:31.220> work<00:03:31.550> here<00:03:32.330> I'll<00:03:32.480> come<00:03:32.720> back<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.050> you

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
likely work here I'll come back to you

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.000 
likely work here I'll come back to you

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
created a free by four piston door that

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.650 
created a free by four piston door that
works<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:51.020> is<00:03:51.290> all<00:03:51.470> this<00:03:51.860> right<00:03:52.070> here<00:03:52.520> it<00:03:53.090> it

back in there still is this little bug
where<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.320> need<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.709> just<00:04:00.920> get<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.459> middle

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
where I need to just get the middle

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.910 
where I need to just get the middle
block<00:04:01.970> back<00:04:02.239> in<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.320> let's<00:04:03.470> just<00:04:03.680> see<00:04:03.800> what

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
block back in so let's just see what

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.060 
block back in so let's just see what
this<00:04:04.040> thing<00:04:04.250> does<00:04:07.570> there<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:08.720> go<00:04:08.930> there's<00:04:09.800> the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
this thing does there you go there's the

this thing does there you go there's the
three<00:04:10.340> by<00:04:10.459> three<00:04:10.760> piston<00:04:11.180> door

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.150 

again<00:04:14.310> with<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:15.020> torch<00:04:16.020> there<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.980> couple

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
again with the torch there and a couple

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.410 
again with the torch there and a couple
pistons<00:04:17.700> there<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.620> again<00:04:19.920> if<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.550> try<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:20.970> put

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
pistons there but again if I try to put

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.470 
pistons there but again if I try to put
this<00:04:21.570> back<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:22.940> everything<00:04:23.940> will<00:04:24.090> be<00:04:24.210> fine

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
this back in everything will be fine

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.850 
this back in everything will be fine
except<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.470> middle<00:04:25.800> block<00:04:26.040> which<00:04:27.530> these<00:04:28.530> two

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
except the middle block which these two

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:39.050 
except the middle block which these two
right<00:04:29.040> there<00:04:33.860> so<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:37.040> might<00:04:38.040> do<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.520> I'm

hour<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.750> make<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.670> which<00:04:56.670> is<00:04:56.850> weird<00:04:57.120> because

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
hour to make this which is weird because

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.690 
hour to make this which is weird because
i<00:04:57.570> usually<00:04:57.870> go<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.710> difficult<00:04:59.220> way<00:04:59.370> and

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
i usually go the difficult way and

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.640 
i usually go the difficult way and
judging<00:05:00.360> by<00:05:00.390> this<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:01.020> it's<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.380> little

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
judging by this this it's a little

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.270 
judging by this this it's a little
complicated<00:05:02.010> but<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.570> pretty<00:05:04.080> compact<00:05:04.830> i

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
complicated but it is pretty compact i

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.210 
complicated but it is pretty compact i
was<00:05:05.520> surprised<00:05:06.410> um<00:05:08.870> but<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:10.080> could<00:05:10.440> like<00:05:10.920> just

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
was surprised um but you could like just

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.570 
was surprised um but you could like just
expand<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.390> up<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.050> here<00:05:16.160> make<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.430> this

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
expand this up to here make it so this

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:27.010 
expand this up to here make it so this
is<00:05:17.790> here<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:22.220> need<00:05:23.220> a<00:05:23.250> little<00:05:23.550> bit<00:05:23.760> of<00:05:23.820> redstone

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:35.240 

Bam<00:05:28.020> Bam<00:05:28.050> Bam<00:05:28.640> Bam<00:05:33.290> there<00:05:34.290> we<00:05:34.440> go<00:05:34.620> three<00:05:35.100> by

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
Bam Bam Bam Bam there we go three by

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.620 
Bam Bam Bam Bam there we go three by
three<00:05:35.580> piston<00:05:36.090> door<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.960> finally<00:05:37.530> works

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
three piston door that finally works

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.650 
three piston door that finally works
because<00:05:39.630> this<00:05:40.110> does<00:05:40.770> not<00:05:40.980> work<00:05:41.490> let<00:05:42.270> me<00:05:42.420> just

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
because this does not work let me just

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:51.940 
because this does not work let me just
died<00:05:49.130> repeat<00:05:50.130> it<00:05:50.250> repeat<00:05:50.280> it<00:05:50.700> repeat<00:05:50.730> it

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
died repeat it repeat it repeat it

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.740 
died repeat it repeat it repeat it
alright<00:05:52.950> and<00:05:53.430> then<00:05:53.790> just<00:05:54.270> delay<00:05:54.660> it<00:05:56.150> so<00:05:57.150> again

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
alright and then just delay it so again

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.290 
alright and then just delay it so again
it<00:05:58.050> doesn't<00:05:58.320> pull<00:05:58.740> this<00:05:59.010> block<00:05:59.370> in<00:05:59.670> which

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
it doesn't pull this block in which

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.060 
it doesn't pull this block in which
makes<00:06:00.600> it<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.900> really<00:06:01.530> really<00:06:02.070> bad<00:06:03.020> floor

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
makes it a really really bad floor

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.980 
makes it a really really bad floor
because<00:06:05.070> just<00:06:05.610> imagine<00:06:08.510> this<00:06:09.510> being<00:06:09.570> your

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
because just imagine this being your

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.740 
because just imagine this being your
floor<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.890> probably<00:06:11.460> won't<00:06:11.640> be<00:06:11.730> that<00:06:12.240> big<00:06:12.480> of<00:06:12.540> a

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
floor it probably won't be that big of a

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.640 
floor it probably won't be that big of a
deal<00:06:13.250> but<00:06:14.250> it<00:06:14.610> would<00:06:15.030> bother<00:06:15.480> most<00:06:15.990> people

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
deal but it would bother most people

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.140 
deal but it would bother most people
that<00:06:16.860> there<00:06:17.100> isn't<00:06:17.760> a<00:06:18.080> complete<00:06:19.080> ah

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.350 

flat<00:06:23.020> surface<00:06:23.830> kind<00:06:24.220> of<00:06:24.250> like<00:06:24.400> this<00:06:24.640> and<00:06:25.210> you

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
flat surface kind of like this and you

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.690 
flat surface kind of like this and you
don't<00:06:25.570> have<00:06:25.660> to<00:06:25.780> hop<00:06:25.960> over<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.260> block<00:06:26.560> so<00:06:27.520> I'm

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
don't have to hop over the block so I'm

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.690 
don't have to hop over the block so I'm
really<00:06:28.300> proud<00:06:28.630> of<00:06:28.690> this<00:06:28.960> I<00:06:29.260> hope<00:06:29.670> hopefully<00:06:30.670> I

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
really proud of this I hope hopefully I

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.910 
really proud of this I hope hopefully I
can<00:06:30.880> do<00:06:31.660> little<00:06:31.900> touch-ups<00:06:34.350> so<00:06:35.350> that<00:06:35.650> these

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
can do little touch-ups so that these

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.490 
can do little touch-ups so that these
Pistons<00:06:36.640> will<00:06:37.090> go<00:06:37.450> back<00:06:37.720> in<00:06:37.930> order<00:06:38.290> so<00:06:38.470> that

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
Pistons will go back in order so that

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.720 
Pistons will go back in order so that
it'll<00:06:38.800> actually<00:06:39.600> push<00:06:40.830> this<00:06:41.830> piston<00:06:42.340> back<00:06:42.490> in

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
it'll actually push this piston back in

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.370 
it'll actually push this piston back in
so<00:06:42.940> that<00:06:42.970> it's<00:06:43.210> powered<00:06:43.600> by<00:06:43.630> this<00:06:44.020> so<00:06:44.260> we<00:06:44.350> can

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
so that it's powered by this so we can

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.820 
so that it's powered by this so we can
push<00:06:44.740> it<00:06:44.920> back<00:06:45.100> in<00:06:45.370> and<00:06:45.520> be<00:06:45.700> all<00:06:45.990> all<00:06:46.990> nice<00:06:49.830> so

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
push it back in and be all all nice so

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
push it back in and be all all nice so
yeah<00:06:51.280> that's<00:06:51.580> it<00:06:52.030> for<00:06:52.420> this<00:06:52.540> episode<00:06:53.850> thank
