camo I think it's been in every Call of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.679 
camo I think it's been in every Call of
Duty<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:10.260> simple<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.460> next<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> caustic

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a little bit purple light purple a lot

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.580 
a little bit purple light purple a lot
of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> girls<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.170> probably<00:01:16.259> gonna<00:01:16.500> be

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
of the girls are probably gonna be

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.740

a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:18.960> bit<00:01:19.080> nicer<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.439> guess<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.460> also<00:01:20.820> now

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
a little bit nicer I guess and also now

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
a little bit nicer I guess and also now
there's<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> green<00:01:21.659> camo<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.350> instead<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
there's the green camo so instead of the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.700 
there's the green camo so instead of the
reptile<00:01:23.460> camo<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.240> little<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:24.869> darker<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
reptile camo a little bit darker a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.520 
reptile camo a little bit darker a
little<00:01:25.950> bit

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
little bit

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.510 
little bit
a<00:01:26.590> forest<00:01:27.430> camo<00:01:27.909> which<00:01:28.600> isn't<00:01:28.780> bad<00:01:28.930> looking

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a forest camo which isn't bad looking

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.280

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
I think the crocodile camel actually is

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.080
