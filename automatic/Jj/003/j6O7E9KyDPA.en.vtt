00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
plastic one with the little tiny rubber

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.770 
plastic one with the little tiny rubber
I<00:03:33.680> don't<00:03:34.519> know<00:03:34.579> what<00:03:34.730> those<00:03:34.910> are<00:03:34.940> called<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:35.540> I

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
I don't know what those are called but I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.020 
I don't know what those are called but I
really<00:03:36.350> like<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.680> for<00:03:36.920> bottom<00:03:37.370> lashes<00:03:37.610> it

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
really like this for bottom lashes it

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.180 
really like this for bottom lashes it
seems<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:38.630> really<00:03:38.870> grab<00:03:39.170> onto<00:03:39.440> those<00:03:39.799> and

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
seems to just really grab onto those and

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.030 
seems to just really grab onto those and
the<00:03:40.730> brush<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.209> small<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.200> don't<00:03:42.440> get<00:03:42.680> stuff

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
the brush is small so I don't get stuff

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.740 
the brush is small so I don't get stuff
all<00:03:43.250> over<00:03:43.280> underneath<00:03:43.880> my<00:03:44.030> eyes<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.450> feel<00:03:44.630> like

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
it really just gets in there and just

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.090 
it really just gets in there and just
places<00:03:47.030> product<00:03:47.420> on<00:03:47.570> my<00:03:47.600> bottom<00:03:47.900> lashes<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:49.070> i
