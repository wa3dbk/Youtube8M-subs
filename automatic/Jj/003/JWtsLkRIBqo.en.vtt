lower your auto siphon down into your

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.420 
lower your auto siphon down into your
your<00:02:10.080> primary<00:02:11.080> fermentation<00:02:11.350> vessel<00:02:12.220> very

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
your primary fermentation vessel very

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.340 
your primary fermentation vessel very
carefully<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.269> don't<00:02:13.390> disturb<00:02:13.870> too<00:02:14.140> much

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
carefully so you don't disturb too much

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.229 
carefully so you don't disturb too much
East<00:02:14.650> now<00:02:15.370> you're<00:02:15.519> going<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.700> suck<00:02:15.940> up<00:02:16.120> a

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
East now you're going to suck up a

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.790 
East now you're going to suck up a
little<00:02:16.510> bit<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.780> yeast<00:02:16.959> but<00:02:17.319> that's<00:02:17.560> just

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
little bit of yeast but that's just

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.290 
little bit of yeast but that's just
natural<00:02:20.010> it'll<00:02:21.010> clear<00:02:21.250> up<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
natural it'll clear up and then the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.780 
natural it'll clear up and then the
secondary<00:02:22.810> fermentation<00:02:23.140> vessel<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.280> lot<00:02:24.640> of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
secondary fermentation vessel a lot of

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.790 
secondary fermentation vessel a lot of
that<00:02:24.940> beast<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.600> settle<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.769> I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
that beast is going to settle out so I

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.350 
that beast is going to settle out so I
wouldn't<00:02:27.160> worry<00:02:27.310> too<00:02:27.400> much<00:02:27.580> about<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.180> at

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
wouldn't worry too much about that at

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.880 
wouldn't worry too much about that at
all<00:02:28.480> now<00:02:29.110> at<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.410> point<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.860> process

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
all now at this point in the process

what I'm going to do is I'm going to
sanitize<00:02:34.090> my<00:02:34.830> hydrometer<00:02:35.830> jar<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.819> test<00:02:37.090> jar

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
sanitize my hydrometer jar my test jar

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.430 
sanitize my hydrometer jar my test jar
and<00:02:39.060> we're<00:02:40.060> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.209> take<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.450> gravity

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
and we're going to take a gravity

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.750 
and we're going to take a gravity
reading<00:02:41.769> here<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.260> all<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.769> I'll<00:02:45.579> just

reading here and all I do is I'll just

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.330 
reading here and all I do is I'll just
pull<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:46.360> here<00:02:46.690> Philippe

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:02.210 

kink<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.490> hose

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:13.790 

fill<00:03:03.220> up<00:03:03.370> my<00:03:03.400> door

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.080 

now<00:03:15.020> good<00:03:16.020> example<00:03:16.680> right<00:03:16.890> there<00:03:17.490> you<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.060> see

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
now good example right there you can see

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.300 
now good example right there you can see
how<00:03:18.480> much<00:03:18.720> gas<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.980> wine<00:03:22.160> there's<00:03:23.160> all

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
how much gas is in this wine there's all

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.740 
how much gas is in this wine there's all
those<00:03:23.490> little<00:03:23.730> bubbles<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.330> there<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.660> are

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
those little bubbles in there that are

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.210 
those little bubbles in there that are
floating<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.290> top<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.830> there's<00:03:25.980> actually

a<00:03:26.460> little<00:03:26.580> bit<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.000> head<00:03:27.180> right<00:03:27.390> there

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
a little bit of a head right there

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.450 
a little bit of a head right there

one or below one right now it is hitting
perfectly<00:03:48.240> at<00:03:48.390> one<00:03:49.190> that's<00:03:50.190> what<00:03:50.370> we<00:03:50.490> want<00:03:50.700> to

residual sugars in there and that it's

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:07.180 
residual sugars in there and that it's
been<00:03:54.960> completely<00:03:55.350> fermented<00:03:56.010> out
