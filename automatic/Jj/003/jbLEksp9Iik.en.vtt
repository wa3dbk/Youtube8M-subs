00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.110
 there are good secular state commenting 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.420
 I distract white gameplay 2 and like 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.690
 you are watching is a video more than 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.280
 news that they have released a while ago and 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.900
 Well just finished uploading a 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.759
 video in which he explained the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.550
 news of the new creation that has 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.930
 been in xbox play 3 and I imagine that 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.670
 I started also in which they have touched 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.520
 weapons some weapons that are now 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.750
 better and others are worse some weapons 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.090
 as they have increased the recoil 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.560
 so that they present us good and others and 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.710
 They also announced that tomorrow 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.899
 Wednesday they will start making changes 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.350
 they had never done any other color 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:41.289
 beauty and let's say the news is 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.140
 here and says thus says that from 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.289
 tomorrow they will start to put in as a micro 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.350
 items or let's say a kind of monkey 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.620
 good advantages of ways to design or 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.199
 customize our character based on 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.179
 micro items or microcredits or as 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.549
 You want to call him, that is, he's going to see the 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.620
 possibility of maybe buying 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:04.750
 small or say packs that are going to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.830
 give the best with different flashes that 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 they are going to give different things 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.240
 buying that has nothing to do with 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.830
 the game is to say not have it not then 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.740
 maybe they will take out camouflages have 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.540
 said that they are going to take out bacon which 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.170
 just be a bacon camouflage and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.150
 let's have 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.520
 he knows to download them if you want 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.840
 no one forces you but let's say they go 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.040
 to stuff me things like they are 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.689
 the best in free to play if in a 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.820
 lots of games in which to what 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.740
 better as I choose players in the team 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.689
 fortress in a lot of games in the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.789
 what if someone wants to lead, let's say 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.920
 that his character and in a way 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.259
 different or let's say spend more 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 money or small amounts this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.000
 I think it 's a euro or two euros each 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 pack will be able to include a flash is a 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.530
 the best a future me that they put more 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.869
 things are going to have at the moment a few 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.819
 packs the first of all is going to be one 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.039
 that is called extra slots the fourth the 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.259
 which all allow to have 10 more classes 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.940
 to create a class is to say when 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.380
 start creating a class only 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.000
 you can have five if you get to about 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.340
 prestigious and go explaining things 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.530
 you can get to ten, well, they 're going 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 to make you add ten holes 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.799
 more to tourist classes are also going to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.830
 allow having 20 more emblems and also 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.840
 they will allow you to have 32 more titles and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.069
 plus 40 40 images that I do not know 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.090
 exactly what they are but I imagine that 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.450
 are 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.800
 customize as your signature good let's say 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.860
 that your profile you can see an image 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 Well, if you can have 40 more, they have also 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.090
 confirmed that the map will give you in 2025 the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.599
 which only gave it to you in a way 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.940
 well if I had ordered said 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.069
 order reserved the game before 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.410
 come out they call you the mourning map in 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.349
 2025 Well, well, it's going to be free for 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.670
 everybody tomorrow then this yes 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.410
 what it means means that they are going to 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.269
 included in the list of departure is 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.709
 normal is to say you are going to be playing and 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.660
 maybe I'll saro map like this by 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.190
 example carrier leaves being and of 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.080
 suddenly puts you to vote the map of 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.000
 knock down or we're going to start 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.299
 have a lot of gameplays more in 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.319
 maps like cnooc town and similar thing 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.940
 that I do not but I think I think 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.860
 quite good because before to play 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.599
 with you had to put a game of 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.940
 pit that touches you, you have to be a mode of 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.470
 game that was and if I was lucky then 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.630
 this as well as the route map I do not know 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.190
 that now more will be say that the 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.060
 list of normal games the map of 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.890
 2025 cores free for everyone 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.750
 it will also be allowed that 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.209
 people can pay to unlock 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.370
 simply the knock down map of 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.810
 zombies that is something like 400 points 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.000
 I do not know how many were 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.580
 three or four euros if I 'm not wrong 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.349
 I know exactly the change but it 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.000
 they scored four or five euros for the 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.739
 nok map where zombies 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 all those pack are totally 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.250
 optional new you win nothing if the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.690
 you have or if they are not going to influence anything 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.580
 in the game that is to say you will not be better 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.349
 for having a bacon camouflage not that 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.370
 is what we have been put there the truth 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.890
 is that oysters look good more than 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.150
 nothing because it does not take anything away from anyone or 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.709
 but they will simply give people who 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.849
 want to spend more money then maybe 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.739
 can spend a euro on having a 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.810
 more camouflage or maybe it can do 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.590
 a thousand more things to me personally I 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.450
 it seems good idea 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.560
 I would love for you to be able to customize 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.810
 your doll in terms of how 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.920
 ramming I know it would seem a point 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.810
 makes imagine that many more people the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.489
 would buy instead of a camouflage but 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.959
 well I'll see if it really comes out and if 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.729
 really cool because maybe some me 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.840
 designing the new camouflage so 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.120
 I hope you liked the video vote what 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.290
 you have to imagine description the video 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.000
 with all the authorization that there was 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.950
 got into the seer and why has it 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.760
 commented nothing especially if you do not 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.760
 approximate goodbye
