of<00:02:33.880> these<00:02:34.000> with<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.269> quad<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.840> I'm<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:36.160> if

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
of these with a quad so I'm going if

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.820 
of these with a quad so I'm going if
they<00:02:37.000> do<00:02:37.060> well<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.900> suggested<00:02:38.380> they<00:02:38.590> put<00:02:38.739> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
they do well I suggested they put the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.400 
they do well I suggested they put the
engine<00:02:39.130> from<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.519> one<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.630> one<00:02:40.840> that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
engine from this one in that one that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.690 
engine from this one in that one that
one's<00:02:41.590> got<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.769> better<00:02:41.950> transmission<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.610> it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
one's got a better transmission in it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.430 
one's got a better transmission in it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
couple of weeks to leak out Oh Glen

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.340 
couple of weeks to leak out Oh Glen
wants<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.990> know<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:14.520> engine<00:04:14.810> mile<00:04:15.810> codes<00:04:16.109> not

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
wants to know this engine mile codes not

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.840 
wants to know this engine mile codes not
on<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.560> side<00:04:18.530> here's<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.620> code<00:04:20.750> from<00:04:22.850> 1999

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
on that side here's the code from 1999

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.080 
on that side here's the code from 1999
so<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.330> only<00:04:24.540> ten<00:04:25.170> years<00:04:25.380> old<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.680> engine

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
so it's only ten years old this engine

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.790 
so it's only ten years old this engine
and<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.270> got<00:04:27.480> less<00:04:27.930> hours<00:04:28.290> on<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.650> mud

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
and it's got less hours on it the mud

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.430 
and it's got less hours on it the mud

Briggs it's like so got brilliant

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.970 
Briggs it's like so got brilliant
pressure<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:40.100> it's<00:04:41.100> got<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.430> oh<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:43.050> broke

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
pressure so it's got it oh and I broke

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.470 
pressure so it's got it oh and I broke
the<00:04:44.360> cold<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.660> battery<00:04:46.050> charger<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:47.480> got
