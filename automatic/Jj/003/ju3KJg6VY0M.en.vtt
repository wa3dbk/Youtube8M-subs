the back-to-back double spray and the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.160 
the back-to-back double spray and the
reason<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.600> liked<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.899> clip<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
reason I really liked this clip is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.130 
reason I really liked this clip is
because<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> teamwork<00:01:02.629> no<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
because of the teamwork no that is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.329 
because of the teamwork no that is
actually<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.680> why<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.890> liked<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.159> clip

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
actually not why I liked this clip

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.730 
actually not why I liked this clip
because<00:01:05.610> he<00:01:05.880> gets<00:01:06.060> an<00:01:06.150> ace<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.470> real

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
because he gets an ace so the real

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
because he gets an ace so the real
reason<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> liked<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.700> clip<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> fact

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
reason I liked this clip is the fact

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.310 
reason I liked this clip is the fact
that<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.689> completely<00:01:10.070> embarrasses<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.250> team

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
that he completely embarrasses this team

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.490 
that he completely embarrasses this team
because<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> fact<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.840> 3-3<00:01:15.840> tie<00:01:15.869> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
because of the fact that is a 3-3 tie in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
because of the fact that is a 3-3 tie in
Search<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> Destroy<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.700> he's<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.000> nah

we've had our fun I think I'm gonna win
this<00:01:20.670> round<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.270> he<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.509> destroys<00:01:21.990> him

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this round and he just destroys him

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.710 
this round and he just destroys him
right<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.860> airstrike<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
right here with the airstrike and that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600 
right here with the airstrike and that
ends<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.439> i<00:01:25.740> also<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.460> actually

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
ends around i also like that he actually

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.789 
ends around i also like that he actually
went<00:01:26.820> 14<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.360> 3<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> wasn't<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.200> good

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
went 14 in 3 and it wasn't just one good

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.399 
went 14 in 3 and it wasn't just one good
round<00:01:29.729> he<00:01:30.000> had<00:01:30.119> many<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.630> number<00:01:30.900> four<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.290> have

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
round he had many so number four we have

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.010 
round he had many so number four we have
friend<00:01:32.040> Shay<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.829> that<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.430> his<00:01:35.880> new<00:01:36.420> gamertag

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
friend Shay and that is his new gamertag

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870 
friend Shay and that is his new gamertag
is<00:01:37.229> old<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.680> his<00:01:37.799> ex<00:01:38.009> Frenchie<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.640> see

is old on his ex Frenchie which you see

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
is old on his ex Frenchie which you see
here<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> reason<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
here so that's the reason for that and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039 
here so that's the reason for that and
the<00:01:41.700> reason<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.000> liked<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.390> clip<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.659> because

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the reason I liked this clip is because

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
the reason I liked this clip is because
not<00:01:43.200> only<00:01:43.229> does<00:01:43.530> he<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.979> quad<00:01:44.430> spray<00:01:45.030> right

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
not only does he get a quad spray right

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.630 
not only does he get a quad spray right
there<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:46.049> two<00:01:46.229> head<00:01:46.470> shots<00:01:46.500> he<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.159> got<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
there with two head shots he also got a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.730 
there with two head shots he also got a
claymore<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> grenade<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> only

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
claymore and the grenade now the only

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.039 
claymore and the grenade now the only
thing<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> wish<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.030> been<00:01:51.750> more

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
thing is I wish you would have been more

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.200

aggressive<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.430> stage<00:01:53.670> you're<00:01:53.970> seeing

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
aggressive in the stage you're seeing

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.340 
aggressive in the stage you're seeing
right<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.899> continued<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> streak<00:01:56.100> but

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
right here and continued the streak but

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.499 
right here and continued the streak but
whatever<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.619> number<00:01:58.979> three<00:01:59.340> we<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> nice

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
whatever at number three we have a nice

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.959 
whatever at number three we have a nice
360<00:02:01.380> throwing<00:02:01.979> knife<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> see<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.939> and

360 throwing knife as you see here and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.300 
360 throwing knife as you see here and
the<00:02:03.210> reason<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.600> put<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.409> number<00:02:05.040> three

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the reason I put this in as number three

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.670 
the reason I put this in as number three
is<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.119> week<00:02:06.570> has<00:02:06.600> been<00:02:06.869> mostly

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
is because this week has been mostly

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.620 
is because this week has been mostly
based<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.160> killfeeds<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
based on killfeeds and

whereas<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.470> other<00:03:47.500> ones<00:03:47.830> i<00:03:48.130> have<00:03:49.090> to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
whereas the other ones i have to

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.630 
whereas the other ones i have to
download<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.690> before<00:03:50.110> i<00:03:50.140> can<00:03:50.410> watch<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.830> and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
download it before i can watch it and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.980 
download it before i can watch it and
then<00:03:51.730> just<00:03:51.940> leave<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> little<00:03:52.300> description<00:03:52.720> of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
then just leave a little description of

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.660 
then just leave a little description of
what<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.709> it's<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.220> little<00:03:54.250> bit<00:03:54.459> easier

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
what it is so it's a little bit easier

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.740 
what it is so it's a little bit easier
for<00:03:55.030> me<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.590> realize<00:03:56.590> what<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:58.090> top<00:03:58.300> five<00:03:58.510> play

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
for me to realize what the top five play

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.580 
for me to realize what the top five play
actually<00:03:59.140> is<00:03:59.290> in<00:04:00.040> case<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:00.370> miss<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.590> what

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
actually is in case I miss it and what

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.250 
actually is in case I miss it and what
else<00:04:02.709> is<00:04:03.100> there<00:04:03.310> oh<00:04:03.550> um<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.810> was<00:04:05.050> going

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
else is there oh um so I was going

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.220 
else is there oh um so I was going
through<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.590> email<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:07.600> last<00:04:07.780> couple<00:04:07.959> days

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
through the email the last couple days

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.560 
through the email the last couple days
and<00:04:08.590> it's<00:04:09.520> really<00:04:09.760> hard<00:04:10.090> for<00:04:10.180> me<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.450> go

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
and it's really hard for me to go

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.800 
and it's really hard for me to go
through<00:04:10.840> 150<00:04:11.740> emails<00:04:11.980> where<00:04:12.910> when<00:04:13.540> some<00:04:13.780> of

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
through 150 emails where when some of

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.270 
through 150 emails where when some of
them<00:04:13.990> I<00:04:14.110> try<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.380> click<00:04:14.560> on<00:04:14.590> them<00:04:14.830> they<00:04:15.130> don't

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
them I try and click on them they don't

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.699 
them I try and click on them they don't
download<00:04:15.580> or<00:04:15.970> they're<00:04:16.180> not<00:04:16.709> available

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
download or they're not available

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.920 
download or they're not available
anymore<00:04:17.920> so<00:04:18.700> i<00:04:18.729> think<00:04:18.880> what<00:04:19.510> i'm<00:04:19.600> going<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.780> do

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
anymore so i think what i'm going to do

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.540 
anymore so i think what i'm going to do
is<00:04:19.960> delete<00:04:20.590> all<00:04:20.859> submissions<00:04:21.820> up

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
is delete all submissions up

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.480 
is delete all submissions up
now<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:24.470> unless<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.919> guys<00:04:25.039> completely

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490

and<00:04:27.319> I'll<00:04:27.979> wait<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> couple<00:04:28.550> days<00:04:28.699> before<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.150> do

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
and I'll wait a couple days before I do

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.200 
and I'll wait a couple days before I do
it<00:04:29.360> but<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.800> would<00:04:30.889> be<00:04:30.949> so<00:04:31.039> much<00:04:31.460> easier<00:04:31.699> for<00:04:32.000> me
