00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.810 
question I posed is is Diablo 3 finally
good<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.290> know<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.950> loaded<00:00:11.160> question<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
good I know it's a loaded question and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.789 
good I know it's a loaded question and
some<00:00:12.570> would<00:00:12.719> argue<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.139> fact<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.500> may<00:00:13.769> even

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
some would argue in fact I may even

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.829 
some would argue in fact I may even
argue<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.639> don't<00:00:14.880> ever<00:00:15.000> think<00:00:15.089> Diablo<00:00:15.599> 3

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
argue that I don't ever think Diablo 3

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.560 
argue that I don't ever think Diablo 3
was<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> bad<00:00:16.650> game<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> suppose<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.390> real

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
was a bad game but I suppose the real

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.660 
was a bad game but I suppose the real
question<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.020> has<00:00:19.350> Diablo<00:00:19.890> 3<00:00:20.130> gotten<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
question is has Diablo 3 gotten to the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.630 
question is has Diablo 3 gotten to the
point<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:22.020> originally<00:00:22.949> hoped<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.430> was

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
point that you originally hoped it was

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.990 
point that you originally hoped it was
when<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> first<00:00:24.600> launched<00:00:25.170> those<00:00:25.410> years<00:00:25.800> ago<00:00:26.000> so

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
when I first launched those years ago so

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
when I first launched those years ago so
let's<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.330> talk<00:00:27.510> about<00:00:27.539> Diablo<00:00:28.380> 3<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.859> the

brand new thing going on every single

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.310 
brand new thing going on every single

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
month where you start from scratch and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260 
month where you start from scratch and
you<00:00:43.350> level<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.670> compete<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.090> these

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you level up and you compete in these

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.029 
you level up and you compete in these
leaderboards<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.079> access<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.739> gear

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
leaderboards you get access to this gear

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.680 
leaderboards you get access to this gear
before<00:00:47.430> anyone<00:00:47.700> else<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:48.030> access<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
before anyone else has access to the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330 
before anyone else has access to the
gear<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.500> guess<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:49.800> will<00:00:49.890> happen<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
gear and I guess what will happen is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.889 
gear and I guess what will happen is
that<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.579> every<00:00:50.760> new<00:00:50.940> season<00:00:51.390> there's<00:00:51.780> gonna

that with every new season there's gonna

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.139 
that with every new season there's gonna
be<00:00:52.110> new<00:00:52.289> gear<00:00:52.530> introduced<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.340> only<00:00:53.579> season

be new gear introduced that only season
players<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.230> start<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.800> scratch<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
players that start from scratch for that

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
players that start from scratch for that
month<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.480> access<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.829> once

that<00:00:59.280> season<00:00:59.699> ends<00:00:59.969> it'll<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.329> sort<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that season ends it'll get sort of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.840 
that season ends it'll get sort of
rolled<00:01:00.899> into<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.530> regular<00:01:01.920> game<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.760> that's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
rolled into the regular game but that's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.270 
rolled into the regular game but that's
just<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.379> ladder<00:01:04.589> system<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just one thing the the ladder system I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
just one thing the the ladder system I
guess<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> big<00:01:06.570> part<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> Diablo

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
guess you know it's a big part of Diablo

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
guess you know it's a big part of Diablo
2<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.890> something<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.310> actually<00:01:08.580> really

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
2 was something that I actually really

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
2 was something that I actually really
didn't<00:01:09.270> participate<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.990> my<00:01:10.200> enjoyment<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
didn't participate in my enjoyment of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.670 
didn't participate in my enjoyment of
Diablo<00:01:11.280> 2<00:01:11.460> came<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.450> my<00:01:12.659> solo<00:01:13.320> play

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
Diablo 2 came from my solo play

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
Diablo 2 came from my solo play
experience<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.670> experience<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.720> had

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
experience and the experience that I had

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
experience and the experience that I had
with<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.200> close<00:01:16.439> friends<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.130> never<00:01:17.310> really

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
with my close friends I was never really

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
with my close friends I was never really
into<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.270> competitive<00:01:18.869> ladder<00:01:19.409> resetting

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
into the competitive ladder resetting

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
into the competitive ladder resetting
part<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> mainly<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> time

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
part of that mainly because at the time

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.640 
part of that mainly because at the time
I<00:01:22.619> wasn't<00:01:23.070> much<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.030> PC<00:01:24.420> gamer<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I wasn't much of a PC gamer but the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
I wasn't much of a PC gamer but the
point<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.460> we're<00:01:26.850> gonna<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.030> this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
point is you know we're gonna have this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.640 
point is you know we're gonna have this
and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> something<00:01:28.619> that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and I know that this is something that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
and I know that this is something that
people<00:01:28.890> are<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.220> excited<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
people are really excited for and the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
people are really excited for and the
game<00:01:30.900> launched<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.220> missing<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
game launched it and it was missing a

things that I feel like it's missing so
yes<00:02:44.200> Diablo<00:02:44.590> 3<00:02:44.830> first<00:02:45.519> launched<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.090> I

yes Diablo 3 first launched and I

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.259 
yes Diablo 3 first launched and I
thought<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.599> is<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> fun<00:02:47.260> game<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.620> play<00:02:48.269> but

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
thought this is a fun game to play but

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.240 
thought this is a fun game to play but
there<00:02:49.420> are<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.569> lot<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.900> things<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.590> think

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
there are a lot of things that I think

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.120

its launched over the year it's been
drastically<00:02:58.030> improved<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.260> think<00:02:59.470> that's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
drastically improved and I think that's

it but I didn't stick with it for very
long<00:03:20.680> since<00:03:21.489> its<00:03:21.700> launch<00:03:21.910> I've<00:03:22.269> gone<00:03:22.510> back<00:03:22.840> I'd

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
long since its launch I've gone back I'd

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.470 
long since its launch I've gone back I'd
say<00:03:23.470> every<00:03:24.040> couple<00:03:24.579> of<00:03:24.639> months<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.209> played

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
have been i guess following it much more

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.930 
have been i guess following it much more
closely<00:03:46.660> than<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.109> have<00:03:47.349> since<00:03:47.709> its<00:03:47.919> launch<00:03:48.160> do

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.460 
closely than I have since its launch do
you<00:03:49.060> think<00:03:49.299> we're<00:03:49.450> at<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.660> point<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.169> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
you think we're at the point that the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.520 
you think we're at the point that the
game<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:52.209> good<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:52.720> where<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.049> want<00:03:53.410> it

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
game is it's good it's where you want it

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.920 
game is it's good it's where you want it
to<00:03:53.680> be<00:03:53.889> I<00:03:54.099> feel<00:03:54.549> like<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.269> general<00:03:55.540> sentiment

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
to be I feel like the general sentiment

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.740 
to be I feel like the general sentiment
is<00:03:56.109> yes<00:03:56.380> we<00:03:56.650> are<00:03:56.799> at<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.130> point<00:03:57.430> finally<00:03:57.760> even

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
is yes we are at that point finally even

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.509 
is yes we are at that point finally even
just<00:03:58.959> with<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.169> inclusion<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.650> Luke<00:03:59.859> 2.0

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
just with the inclusion of Luke 2.0

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.490 
just with the inclusion of Luke 2.0
which<00:04:00.730> happened<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.150> little<00:04:01.510> while<00:04:01.690> back<00:04:02.200> I

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
which happened a little while back I

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.229 
which happened a little while back I
think<00:04:02.680> people<00:04:03.190> felt<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.760> game<00:04:03.940> was<00:04:04.060> at

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
think people felt like the game was at

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.150 
think people felt like the game was at
that<00:04:04.389> point<00:04:04.630> I'm<00:04:05.079> gonna<00:04:05.260> say<00:04:05.500> my<00:04:05.680> one

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
that point I'm gonna say my one

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.440 
that point I'm gonna say my one
grievance<00:04:06.639> though<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.090> one<00:04:07.239> thing<00:04:07.389> that

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
grievance though and the one thing that

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.259 
grievance though and the one thing that
I'm<00:04:07.660> still<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.260> guess<00:04:09.220> really<00:04:09.459> disappointed

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
I'm still I guess really disappointed

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.159 
I'm still I guess really disappointed
about<00:04:10.359> is<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.440> lack<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.849> PvP<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.959> we

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
about is the lack of that PvP that we

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.849 
about is the lack of that PvP that we
got<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:15.040> taste<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.730> at<00:04:16.060> Blizzcon<00:04:16.630> oh<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.650> long

got a taste of at Blizzcon oh so long

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.770 
got a taste of at Blizzcon oh so long

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
ago before the official launch of Diablo

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.930 
ago before the official launch of Diablo
3<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.260> was<00:04:20.680> really<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.220> excited<00:04:21.700> for<00:04:21.849> those

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
3 I was really so excited for those

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.040 
3 I was really so excited for those
arena<00:04:22.270> PvP<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:24.310> action<00:04:24.969> I<00:04:25.180> had<00:04:25.539> so<00:04:25.840> much<00:04:25.990> fun

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
arena PvP that action I had so much fun

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.180 
arena PvP that action I had so much fun
doing<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.860> I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
doing it and I

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.010 
doing it and I
something<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.700> they<00:04:27.820> still<00:04:28.180> have<00:04:28.660> yet<00:04:28.960> to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
something that they still have yet to

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.480 
something that they still have yet to
bring<00:04:29.290> back<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.830> game<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.370> almost

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
bring back to the game and it almost

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.950 
bring back to the game and it almost
feels<00:04:30.820> like<00:04:30.910> at<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.210> point<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:31.630> it's<00:04:31.780> never

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
feels like at this point that it's never

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.850 
feels like at this point that it's never
going<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.290> happen

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
going to happen

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.110 
going to happen
honestly<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.490> was<00:04:33.520> one<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.850> things<00:04:33.970> I

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
honestly that was one of the things I

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.970 
honestly that was one of the things I
was<00:04:34.240> most<00:04:34.270> looking<00:04:34.720> forward<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:35.200> when<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:35.860> came

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
was most looking forward to when it came

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.190 
was most looking forward to when it came
