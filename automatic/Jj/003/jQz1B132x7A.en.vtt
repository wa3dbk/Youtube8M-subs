00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.870 
one and I thought that it was really
cute<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.100> sort<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.460> much<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.760> one

that she had and I liked it so I think

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
that she had and I liked it so I think

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
to that so it's just sort of like that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.180 
to that so it's just sort of like that
sort<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.830> bronzy<00:01:33.530> cuteness<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.010> oh<00:01:35.130> I
