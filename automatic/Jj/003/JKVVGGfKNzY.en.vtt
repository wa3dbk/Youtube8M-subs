was going to need an external BTC and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.050 
was going to need an external BTC and
then<00:00:27.000> I'd<00:00:27.689> gotten<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.109> message<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.830> Edie<00:00:29.369> from

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
then I'd gotten a message from Edie from

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.290 
then I'd gotten a message from Edie from
experimental<00:00:30.720> Airlines<00:00:31.850> telling<00:00:32.850> me<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> look

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
experimental Airlines telling me to look

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
experimental Airlines telling me to look
at<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:35.390> specs<00:00:36.469> on<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:41.780> here<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.550> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
at the specs on that and here on the I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
at the specs on that and here on the I
printed<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.809> from<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> hobbyking

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
printed this out from the hobbyking

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.279 
printed this out from the hobbyking
website<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> bottom<00:00:48.149> says<00:00:48.390> B<00:00:48.899> EC

website here at the bottom says B EC

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.680 
website here at the bottom says B EC
opto<00:00:50.039> only<00:00:51.320> therefore<00:00:52.320> meaning<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
opto only therefore meaning that at this

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
opto only therefore meaning that at this
speed<00:00:55.680> control<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> does<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
speed control that does not have the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.250 
speed control that does not have the
internal<00:00:57.930> BC<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.670> other<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.000> does<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.780 

then<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.040> part<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.400> there<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
then we that that part right there is a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.620 
then we that that part right there is a
lesson<00:01:06.090> learned

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
lesson learned

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.910 
lesson learned
I'll<00:01:06.720> definitely<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.290> paying<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.890> attention

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
I'll definitely be paying more attention

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.469 
I'll definitely be paying more attention
to<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> when<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> order<00:01:09.930> parts<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.860> future

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
to that when I order parts in the future

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.710 
to that when I order parts in the future
I<00:01:12.860> got<00:01:13.860> talking<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> guy<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.270> local

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
I got talking with the guy at the local

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.890 
I got talking with the guy at the local
hobby<00:01:15.840> shop<00:01:16.670> yes<00:01:17.670> yesterday<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.280> he<00:01:20.280> had<00:01:20.900> he

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
hobby shop yes yesterday and he had he

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.609 
hobby shop yes yesterday and he had he
had<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> couple<00:01:22.259> becs<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.590> work

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
had a couple becs that that would work

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
had a couple becs that that would work
with<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.000> speed<00:01:27.720> control<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.270> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
with with this speed control and so I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
with with this speed control and so I
wouldn't<00:01:30.509> went<00:01:30.689> ahead<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> picked<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.409> two<00:01:31.619> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
wouldn't went ahead and picked up two of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.569 
wouldn't went ahead and picked up two of
them<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:33.570> way<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.490> get

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
them that way I can you know I can get

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.719 
them that way I can you know I can get
going<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:38.220> new<00:01:38.400> planes

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
going on going on like my new planes

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.249 
going on going on like my new planes
that<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> fly<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.680> certainly<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
that I want to fly and certainly and the

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.090 
that I want to fly and certainly and the
benefits<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.680> wouldn't<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
benefits of that is I wouldn't have to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.310 
benefits of that is I wouldn't have to
wait<00:01:44.220> two<00:01:44.430> three<00:01:44.670> weeks<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> parts<00:01:46.200> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
wait two three weeks to get the parts in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.700 
wait two three weeks to get the parts in
from<00:01:46.470> hobbyking<00:01:49.490> when<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.880> got<00:01:51.590> when<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> got
