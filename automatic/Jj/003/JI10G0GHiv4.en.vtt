00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hi there today I'm going to show you how

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.690 
hi there today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.810> delete<00:00:04.080> duplicates<00:00:04.859> from<00:00:04.980> your<00:00:05.190> iPhoto

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
to delete duplicates from your iPhoto

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.970 
to delete duplicates from your iPhoto
library<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.600> increase<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.319> applications

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
library and increase the applications

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.879 
library and increase the applications
performance<00:00:08.840> when<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.870> saw<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.620> library

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
performance when I saw that my library

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.490 
performance when I saw that my library
was<00:00:11.460> clogged<00:00:11.790> with<00:00:12.030> duplicates<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.840> tried

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
was clogged with duplicates I tried

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.589 
was clogged with duplicates I tried
using<00:00:13.710> several<00:00:14.219> applications<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.240> clean<00:00:15.450> it

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
using several applications to clean it

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.650 
using several applications to clean it
up<00:00:15.770> the<00:00:16.770> most<00:00:16.980> complete<00:00:17.460> application<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.210> found

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
up the most complete application I found

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.849 
up the most complete application I found
was<00:00:19.140> tidy-up

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
was tidy-up

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.640 
was tidy-up
it<00:00:20.130> provides<00:00:21.119> lots<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.779> different<00:00:22.199> types<00:00:22.410> of

it provides lots of different types of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.250 
it provides lots of different types of
search<00:00:22.890> options<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.640> different<00:00:24.029> tasks<00:00:24.600> such

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
search options for different tasks such

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.730 
search options for different tasks such
as<00:00:25.289> cleaning<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.039> iPhoto<00:00:26.779> aperture<00:00:27.779> iTunes

as cleaning the iPhoto aperture iTunes
and<00:00:29.130> mail<00:00:29.730> libraries<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> will<00:00:32.369> go

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and mail libraries so now I will go

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.790 
and mail libraries so now I will go
through<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> search<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.390> iPhoto<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.170> show<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
