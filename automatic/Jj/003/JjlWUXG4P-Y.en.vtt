that are the decay products of the
ranking<00:00:13.650> but<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.330> simply<00:00:15.929> than

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
ranking but it's it's just simply than

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.189 
ranking but it's it's just simply than
the<00:00:16.490> disturbance<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.300> option<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.900> itself

and the results of that I mean whether
this<00:00:21.869> has<00:00:22.109> gotten<00:00:22.380> uranium<00:00:22.859> rated<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.400> not

are<00:00:51.989> trying<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.409> filter<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:54.540> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
are trying to filter this out and use it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.710 
are trying to filter this out and use it
any<00:00:55.519> domestically<00:00:56.519> for<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.909> drink<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.690> to

any domestically for to drink and to

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.630 
any domestically for to drink and to
cook<00:00:58.019> we<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.769> a<00:00:58.800> test<00:00:59.040> where<00:00:59.220> did<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.430> water

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
cook we got a test where did this water

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.859 
cook we got a test where did this water
come<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.030> starting<00:01:00.659> probably<00:01:01.230> back<00:01:02.869> like

march of 2008 of there was there was
extensive<00:01:08.040> exploration<00:01:08.670> drilling<00:01:09.200> just<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
extensive exploration drilling just to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
extensive exploration drilling just to
the<00:01:10.799> south<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.790> well<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.180> long<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.570> no

look<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.740> filter<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.549> came<00:01:15.000> out

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
look at this filter that just came out

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.109 
look at this filter that just came out
roses<00:01:16.860> rooms<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.970> algae<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:20.119> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
roses rooms that's algae that's out this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
roses rooms that's algae that's out this
is<00:01:21.390> another<00:01:21.689> filter<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.409> been<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is another filter that's been in just a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.050 
is another filter that's been in just a
short<00:01:23.549> period<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.060> time<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.680> see

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
short period of time and you can see

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.069 
short period of time and you can see
this<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.979> well<00:01:28.979> he<00:01:29.280> could<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.840> lack<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
this is really well he could for lack of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
this is really well he could for lack of
a<00:01:31.439> half<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:34.220> statistical<00:01:35.220> analysis<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> just

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
a half a statistical analysis it just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.680 
a half a statistical analysis it just
mud<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.370> pretty<00:01:38.670> pretty<00:01:39.120> money<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
mud it's just pretty pretty money and

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.330 
mud it's just pretty pretty money and
that<00:01:40.050> filter<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:42.440> two<00:01:43.440> months<00:01:43.850> and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
that filter was in two months and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.830 
that filter was in two months and
previously<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:48.000> seen<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.479> kind

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
previously they have not seen this kind

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.950 
previously they have not seen this kind
of<00:01:49.370> deterioration<00:01:50.370> in<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.120> of<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.630> type<00:01:51.930> in
