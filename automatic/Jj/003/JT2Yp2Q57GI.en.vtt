00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.560
 in this video I want to talk bow 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.260
 in implementation 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.260
 mail client to client for 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.669
 in text messaging as well 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.669
 in saying that he 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.480
 here is reporting 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.689
 this part 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.010
 Bari operetka go to the main screen 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.699
 because 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.880
 I can not be as I found out 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.679
 does not look optimal 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.739
 like mail 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.290
 mail client 1 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.240
 so why on this background because it 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.680
 acceptable but also email clients 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.510
 there are standard for 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.380
 work with the same time account 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.340
 extra for working with the rest 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.420
 teams 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.570
 if it's worth taping and so we can 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.910
 consider the topic 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.250
 national inhospitable 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.120
 flyers year 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.030
 Unian Modes 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.290
 as an option to him 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.290
 open I will release 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.460
 another box 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.460
 entrance ashore crowd 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.690
 they themselves 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.050
 there are several screens here 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.049
 all letters are not calculated 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.049
 flagged 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.880
 and 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 as a child 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.480
 now a little more 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.490
 and krams the main reason incidentally can be 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 getting over the fact that after all 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.260
 the participant by these screens reveal where 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.670
 actually ends the cycle 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.650
 injured girl is unclear 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.200
 since all the messages they protest with 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.270
 humble 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.770
 on the screen itself 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.960
 message lists select for each 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.430
 messages 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.910
 the representatives 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.159
 they could them 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.200
 literally one line 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.179
 urgently 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.679
 m that affects the depths of the soul is something 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:56.660
 what 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.620
 unlike other 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.670
 operating systems and general logic 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.240
 interface probably 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.390
 old i mean quality letters 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.929
 unread meet 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.409
 exactly one line 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.209
 look how you look 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.639
 the letter has become read 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.739
 now see 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.159
 three letters 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.459
 respectively 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.099
 they all have a sender base 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.899
 in bold 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.989
 all they have vein leaflets indicated 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.659
 simple small movie 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.019
 the only difference is in the color of the middle line 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.169
 that is, the subject of the letter 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:33.569
 by color 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.879
 these lines 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.489
 need to reply calculated letter 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.489
 from unread but in my opinion it is 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.329
 very comfortably 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.150
 I personally need to get used to it 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.850
 I see here is a list of acceptable 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.139
 look i 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.529
 marked in states read 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.719
 so on my screen 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.479
 hardly read the letter ask them 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.879
 scientists part of a big score nothing 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.289
 and one more 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.869
 a slight flaw in ob and taz 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.339
 committee 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.799
 icon 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.699
 the fact is that the position icon 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.109
 hindu fund mail not only listed there 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.659
 but only for those letters that have 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.959
 position many for peasants and letters then 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:12.849
 there is 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.139
 any picture that has its own 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.279
 she automatically makes judicial 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:17.970
 systems 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.559
 on conditions 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.449
 here again it is very convenient if you get 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:22.659
 nostalgic cross 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.739
 of war 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.739
 except that for some reason have developed 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 that is, it was a long time ago 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.909
 easy hand gesture 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.899
 not so much 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:39.309
 in general attack 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.319
 can 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.299
 the monolith highlighted reported bassargin was 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.189
 what is still played 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.189
 old people 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.039
 wish and can highlight reported to 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.249
 Unfortunately in Egypt, I can not be told at once 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:57.019
 because everyone has already allocated informed 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.649
 Andrei Stratan 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.779
 in principle, it is useful 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.619
 have palkin 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:04.880
 but 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.230
 last year as a world crisis but was 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.820
 such a work of this system can 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.780
 function 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.409
 Ie one and a half 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.730
 nothing will happen even if i have 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.139
 data attempt there is a message 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.289
 dated 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.529
 two hours ago 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.809
 I don't see here 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.809
 why so i don't know 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.490
 go ahead 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.759
 some kind of temple 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.490
 I am very secret letter well, let's say 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.120
 one of many inviting 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.120
 visit divided countries 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.669
 she is in congress 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.669
 so sure 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.080
 can immediately see how 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.529
 looks like a position 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.399
 but here they appear lower than 

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:49.019
 letters brightly the attachment icon begins 

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:51.189
 during loading render dimensions 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.089
 partisan displayed 6 here in 

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:54.439
 this construction 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.439
 and here the point over i happy new year 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.979
 letter itself in letter 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.759
 expressing attitude of cranes when you 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.189
 open poland 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.080
 double click it is just in Kiev 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.740
 accounts for the most leveling 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.200
 if i'm blind 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.669
 and this swede 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:14.979
 unable to do 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.900
 I just want a letter 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.650
 I am increasing his legs unfortunately text 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.520
 will not level off 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.270
 pushkarev granozan ie 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.879
 such a function 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.909
 in this system now we are basically their 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.969
 upcoming updates 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.789
 as far as I myself like to combine this wall 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.159
 in a personal increase back to the street 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.710
 if you don’t see the year 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.860
 officials say favor with 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.749
 horizontal modestly either 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.180
 to read 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.559
 authorities, too, by the way is not an option 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:47.339
 such a mode 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.309
 as there is still no much bigger for me 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.439
 becomes 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.949
 in my opinion this year 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.059
 in these currencies 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:57.619
 they will forgive me 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:59.869
 the reader is surely defeated 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:00.930
 and because 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.520
 functions are now very popular 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.869
 but it’s understandable about smartphones 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:07.380
 people check mail 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.439
 reads some texts 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.300
 no lack of function 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.500
 text alignment soil hemp 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.479
 scaling 5 million tons 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.800
 what else can you say for postal 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.509
 accounts can be configured 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.080
 several parameters 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.830
 name frankfurt 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.830
 rules for receiving new messages 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.249
 Pushkova in this case 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.379
 correspondence club for the days that 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.300
 take 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.860
 for some accounts, well, let's say 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.419
 he 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:42.860
 in this case, what else 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.199
 I can configure to ban those types 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.789
 data to be synchronized 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.379
 special mail 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.169
 contacts calendar 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:52.930
 in this way produced on 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.960
 construction site 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.089
 You can also make a signature for 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:58.300
 your posts 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.930
 the letter is signed 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.419
 here is in flat 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.520
 hard to answer 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.330
 her but here will be displayed 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.120
 prerequisites of important messages that 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.610
 came with this sign 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.710
 to the end works correctly and even if 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.930
 they are scrofulous 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.960
 then we'll see what else 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.399
 marked but important 

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:27.399
 it is in this box 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.719
 there is still time 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.599
 text messaging 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:36.729
 what text messages look like 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:38.979
 misery will not come 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:41.979
 text messages 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:47.229
 let's face it 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:49.110
 in the following form because in this form 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.410
 street 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.920
 unfortunately the cows set us up 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.640
 currency fund
