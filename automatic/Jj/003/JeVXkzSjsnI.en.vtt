00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
where my hand goes that's going to about

wrap it pretty tight should go around

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.710 
wrap it pretty tight should go around
there<00:05:00.800> two<00:05:00.979> or<00:05:01.099> three<00:05:01.280> times<00:05:01.490> you<00:05:01.880> can<00:05:02.510> see

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
there two or three times you can see

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.450 
there two or three times you can see
this<00:05:02.870> little<00:05:03.139> piece<00:05:03.320> left<00:05:03.650> over<00:05:04.039> what's<00:05:04.400> a

this little piece left over what's a

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.420 
this little piece left over what's a
swivel<00:05:04.820> on<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:05.650> we'll<00:05:06.650> just<00:05:06.680> pull<00:05:07.039> those<00:05:07.159> loops

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
swivel on it we'll just pull those loops

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.969 
swivel on it we'll just pull those loops
off<00:05:07.610> our<00:05:07.760> fingertips<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.479> wrap<00:05:09.440> this<00:05:09.650> level

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
off our fingertips and wrap this level

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.980 
off our fingertips and wrap this level
through<00:05:10.159> there<00:05:10.280> two<00:05:10.520> or<00:05:10.610> three<00:05:10.639> times

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
through there two or three times

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.719 
through there two or three times
once<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:13.620> drive<00:05:13.800> through<00:05:14.280> two<00:05:14.490> or<00:05:14.580> three

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
once you drive through two or three

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.180 
once you drive through two or three
times<00:05:15.000> it'll<00:05:15.900> stay<00:05:16.110> in<00:05:16.139> place<00:05:16.289> quite<00:05:16.949> nicely

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
times it'll stay in place quite nicely

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.040 
times it'll stay in place quite nicely
for<00:05:17.550> yet<00:05:17.729> it<00:05:17.880> just<00:05:17.910> stays<00:05:18.240> bringing<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:18.870> nice

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
for yet it just stays bringing that nice

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.230 
for yet it just stays bringing that nice
little<00:05:19.350> loop<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:20.490> see<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:20.820> swivel<00:05:21.150> right

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
little loop and see the swivel right

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.379 
little loop and see the swivel right
there<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:23.490> now<00:05:23.610> you've<00:05:23.759> got<00:05:23.910> this<00:05:24.030> hook<00:05:24.240> down

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
there and now you've got this hook down

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.570 
there and now you've got this hook down
on<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.840> other<00:05:24.960> end<00:05:25.169> same<00:05:26.039> deal<00:05:26.190> with<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.400> hook

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
on the other end same deal with a hook

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.010 
on the other end same deal with a hook
just<00:05:26.610> bring<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.360> up<00:05:27.539> to<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.690> loop<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.990> just

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
just bring that up to the loop you just

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.950 
just bring that up to the loop you just
made<00:05:28.610> pull<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.759> through<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.030> loop<00:05:30.090> two<00:05:30.840> or

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
made pull that through the loop two or

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.640 
made pull that through the loop two or
three<00:05:31.139> times<00:05:32.479> it's<00:05:33.479> two<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:36.560> here's<00:05:37.560> number

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
three times it's two and here's number

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.920 
three times it's two and here's number
three<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:38.820> there's<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.419> hook<00:05:39.600> that's<00:05:39.750> through

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
three so there's the hook that's through

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.629 
three so there's the hook that's through
that<00:05:40.080> loop<00:05:40.229> and<00:05:40.470> that's<00:05:41.100> what<00:05:41.340> it's<00:05:41.460> going<00:05:41.580> to

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
that loop and that's what it's going to

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.150 
that loop and that's what it's going to
look<00:05:41.699> like<00:05:41.880> when<00:05:42.090> it's<00:05:42.240> finished

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.350 

that's<00:05:47.160> all<00:05:47.430> there<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.090> that's<00:05:48.240> how<00:05:48.330> you

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
that's all there is to it that's how you

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.340 
that's all there is to it that's how you
make<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:48.660> key<00:05:48.870> macro<00:05:49.229> leader<00:05:49.440> good<00:05:50.099> luck
