here 7 of the t-34 I'm going to apply a

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.759 
here 7 of the t-34 I'm going to apply a
damage<00:02:36.880> card<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.389> apply<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> vehicle<00:02:38.350> effect

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
damage card and apply the vehicle effect

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.910 
damage card and apply the vehicle effect
by<00:02:39.489> tucking<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.090> underneath<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.230> t-34

by tucking it underneath the t-34

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.650 
by tucking it underneath the t-34
there's<00:02:42.100> four<00:02:42.310> effects<00:02:42.609> per<00:02:42.819> damage<00:02:43.150> card<00:02:43.420> and

there's four effects per damage card and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.809 
there's four effects per damage card and
this<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:44.380> an<00:02:44.950> effect<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.310> will<00:02:45.489> immobilize

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
this is an effect that will immobilize

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.720 
this is an effect that will immobilize
the<00:02:46.569> t-34<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.319> make<00:02:47.709> him<00:02:47.859> less<00:02:48.099> effective<00:02:48.579> in

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the t-34 and make him less effective in

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.229 
the t-34 and make him less effective in
combat<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.250> we're<00:02:51.549> going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> go<00:02:51.940> ahead<00:02:52.030> and

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
combat so we're going to go ahead and

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.960 
combat so we're going to go ahead and
put<00:02:52.750> these<00:02:52.870> back<00:02:53.079> on<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.319> table<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.970> resolve

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
put these back on the table and resolve

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.970 
put these back on the table and resolve
some<00:02:55.060> other<00:02:55.299> attacks<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.870> tiger<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.500> complete

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
some other attacks the tiger is complete

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.870 
some other attacks the tiger is complete
and<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.510> t-34<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.470> now<00:02:59.650> immobilized<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.819> you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
and the t-34 is now immobilized so you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.670 
and the t-34 is now immobilized so you
alternate<00:03:01.540> resolving<00:03:02.049> all<00:03:02.260> remaining

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
alternate resolving all remaining

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.069 
alternate resolving all remaining
attacks<00:03:03.099> using<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.549> same<00:03:03.730> basic<00:03:04.000> steps<00:03:04.389> in

attacks using the same basic steps in

attacks using the same basic steps in
this<00:03:05.230> case<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.590> Russian<00:03:05.980> chooses<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.700> fires

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
this case the Russian chooses to fires

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.819 
this case the Russian chooses to fires
rifles<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.660> takes<00:03:08.019> out<00:03:08.200> one<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.530> German

the reserves deck is shuffled by the way
so<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.310> don't<00:04:13.340> really<00:04:13.790> know<00:04:14.060> what<00:04:14.270> you're

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
so you don't really know what you're

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.479 
so you don't really know what you're
going<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.570> get<00:04:14.810> as<00:04:15.739> far<00:04:15.950> as<00:04:16.040> what's<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.459> to

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
going to get as far as what's going to

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.539 
going to get as far as what's going to
be<00:04:16.640> ready<00:04:16.880> for<00:04:17.739> commitment<00:04:18.739> or<00:04:18.980> not<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.489> you

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
be ready for commitment or not so you

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.909 
be ready for commitment or not so you
may<00:04:19.669> draw<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:19.880> pilot<00:04:20.419> without<00:04:20.570> an<00:04:21.049> aircraft<00:04:21.650> or

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
may draw a pilot without an aircraft or

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.159 
may draw a pilot without an aircraft or
a<00:04:21.980> tank<00:04:22.400> without<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.730> tank<00:04:23.030> crew<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.600> that's

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
a tank without a tank crew and that's

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.540 
a tank without a tank crew and that's
part<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.560> reason<00:04:24.770> crews<00:04:25.010> are<00:04:25.190> separate

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
part of the reason crews are separate

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.040 
part of the reason crews are separate
from<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.820> tanks<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.390> represents<00:04:26.900> what's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
from the tanks it represents what's

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.260 
from the tanks it represents what's
ready<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.590> come<00:04:27.770> into<00:04:27.919> combat<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:29.120> in<00:04:29.210> this

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
ready to come into combat so in this

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.890 
ready to come into combat so in this
case<00:04:29.480> we<00:04:29.660> show<00:04:29.840> what<00:04:30.350> has<00:04:31.160> been<00:04:31.340> drawn<00:04:31.669> by<00:04:31.970> both

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900
