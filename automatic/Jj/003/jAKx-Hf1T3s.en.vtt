00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello friends and youtube subscribers 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.740
 Today I bring you a tutorial to develop 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.990
 a paper shaped thunderstorm 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.340
 right triangle let's see how it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.920
 makes 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.800
 to make this troubadour what 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.279
 we need is a sheet can be size 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.849
 letter to 4 or just a sheet of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.260
 notebook or notebook well already having 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.170
 our sheet what we are going to do is 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.100
 Bend 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.100
 in half 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.350
 thus 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.390
 we mark the folds very well 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.390
 we unfold and now we will double 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.020
 towards this direction 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.980
 well we unfolded and then what 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.059
 Let's do is put these shores 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.059
 towards the center bend 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.200
 in this way and we will perform in a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.880
 procedure with the other three tips 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 already finished the three points we will have left 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.620
 this figure and then what 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.250
 let's do is fold in half 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.820
 taking the lower side to the upper 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.190
 and we mark well the folds well 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.540
 now we are going to fold carrying this tip 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.540
 with this tip 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.820
 it is important to mark very well the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.450
 folds 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.850
 well now what we are going to do is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.720
 take this side on this side 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.720
 bending 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.420
 and matching very well 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.979
 in this way we turn and do what 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.979
 same with this tip 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.450
 well and as you can see we have already 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.489
 finished our tronador 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.239
 to make it work what we have 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.020
 what to do is take it this way and 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.410
 be putting your index finger 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.100
 to support yourself or just taking with 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.770
 the index finger and thumb the two tips and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.060
 what we are going to do is do it with 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.060
 much force down 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.900
 well how can you see this way hello 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.000
 friends I hope you liked it 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.280
