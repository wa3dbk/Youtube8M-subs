like I've lost a few subscribers and the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.139 
like I've lost a few subscribers and the
last<00:00:49.590> few<00:00:49.829> days<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.670> matters<00:00:51.030> or

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
last few days not that it matters or

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700
