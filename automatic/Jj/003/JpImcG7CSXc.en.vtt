00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 during pregnancy many women have 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.130
 doubts about when they should address the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.240
 rule is not general and varies from pregnant 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.730
 for the pregnant woman 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.490
 but it is good to know that in this period there 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.890
 other issues involving the steering wheel 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.940
 and the future mother before she begins to think 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.560
 going out with the car 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.720
 We have to have authorization from your 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.699
 midwife and midwife will determine if 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.099
 you can drive can not conditions 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.590
 that you may can not is it that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.630
 determines why he knows you lisa 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.520
 first thing she usually leaves the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.380
 bank well back because it goes 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.930
 make it easier for you to enter and exit 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.640
 car seize everything the car has 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.530
 this car has height adjustment of the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 flywheel depth 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 so you have to use this here 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.640
 because he kept one of the restrictions 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.390
 if you have the vehicular direction of the pregnant woman 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.460
 It's the Horberg Hostel it's meant to protect. 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.399
 but he's not supposed to take the abdomen 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.859
 what is the position of the steering wheel 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.289
 position in height of the abutment head 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.260
 if you are feeling good first 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.020
 according to what you have visibility 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.570
 adjust the rearview mirrors so that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 the less difficult it is to move . 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.490
 You nauseate, it feels good, you're with everyone. 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.759
 the commands at hand how to remember what 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.670
 simple safety seat belt 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.580
 He has to stay what leaving this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.540
 bag looks how beautiful it looks 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.000
 take a look and that's enough 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 the height of the paper but in this bone that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.170
 go put your body on 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.790
 we are already well positioned taking advantage 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.790
 every car now let's drive 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.490
 the equipment that is very functional and 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.550
 this car here unfortunately does not 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.800
 function of the sunroof is that handle that 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.720
 when leaving the pregnant woman with 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.150
 six months of pregnancy she has already 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.490
 start to lose some of the mobility and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.440
 when to get in and out of the car 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.100
 it's always good to have a support first thing 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.640
 we can have a better car 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.310
 second, try to program your direction 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.040
 schedule where you go the times 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.640
 because the less you brake and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.050
 accelerate - you will get tired less goes 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.660
 get irritated 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.030
 we see these turtles right here 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.060
 saw the vent on the accelerator before 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.670
 brake just a little bit and try to pass the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.860
 more sweaty takes the foot off the brake and 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.140
 accelerated so that your area of 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.290
 preferably one wheel at a time 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.330
 if you distribute the weight of the car has a 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.090
 lower bump the car with steering 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.490
 assisted by electric auricchio will te 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.230
 help in maneuvers like this one that you 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.530
 You have to test the steering wheel almost 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.959
 equated with this you will do - 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.300
 course a moment may come that the 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.580
 distance is very close to 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.130
 of the steering wheel and you will not have 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.070
 neither distance in the legs nor distance 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.070
 of the arm there reached the limit to direct 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.130
 in the absence that it can cause is the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.440
 distraction 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.520
 the concern with yourself is that you have 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.040
 that you really do not 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.410
 there with her abdomen has no right 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.500
 some things that can change the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.990
 animal behavior they can and do 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.370
 should run in the second quarter has 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.450
 been more aggravating in feeling an accident 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.390
 of traffic 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.980
 it is clear that the last quarter is due 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.370
 avoid at least 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.280
 in fact the last month s avoided even ne 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.710
 because of the abdomen tape of these things 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.950
 That 's serious, I lived with it too. 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.650
 if she is not driving it is more 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.610
 comfortable and safer rear seat 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.570
 and but also with that due 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.970
 and safety nÃ© by belts tyverb 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.280
 also the back seat is safer 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.710
 mainly in the middle ne 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.390
 in a clip that normally taxi driver 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.510
 I usually use it to leave a little. 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.549
 looser this part is recommended 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.760
 was not whether or not we have to always 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:27.360
 make it fit because I feel bad 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.360
 used it's like you have no belt 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:35.709
 eff it is driving in tic 

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:39.609
 broke the girl, right? 

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:42.369
 We would rather she find a way 

00:04:39.609 --> 00:04:47.489
 stop the car, your husband's situation 

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:47.489
 and ask for help right
