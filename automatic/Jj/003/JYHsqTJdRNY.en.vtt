00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.429
 well backpack matrix of the people of me already 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:17.210
 that is the prestigious French brand 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.460
 mogollÃ³n maker of material 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.949
 mountain in the last 75 years 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960
 specifically that I come to present 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 I present you this backpack is a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.570
 backpack that as I said is called 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.180
 matrix are 26 liters weigh 900 grams and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.950
 What I would emphasize about her is that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.690
 time to transport our equipment 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.629
 mountain skiing we do it from a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.840
 tremendously versatile way thanks to 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.300
 that thanks to our skis 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.340
 they are crossed the backpack is built 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.739
 in such a way so that it is asymmetrical 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.560
 what does it mean asymmetry is to say that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.059
 one part is not the same as the other 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.880
 particularity is that we can open and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.940
 close our backpack even if we arrive 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.510
 on the mounted skis that also 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.430
 we can observe the tail and the most 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.470
 High ski when down 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.030
 complicated terrains in the middle of a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.250
 forest for example we can see that no 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.890
 we are hooked no side and downhill 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.990
 very clearly we do not hit with the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 feet on the tails of our skis 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.400
 and also the tails of our skis 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.620
 both hit on the ground more details 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.290
 well a very interesting detail brought 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.960
 by tasio let's technical or random is 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.020
 the idea is basically that we can 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.240
 adjust very comfortably enter 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.729
 the two ice axes the leaves of the ice axes 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.250
 they are always looking out my 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.190
 recommendation is that you also protect them 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.950
 jce with one with a toe cap with a 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 defense so as not to hurt anyone or 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.350
 hurt you you more details has 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.280
 a camelback out and has a 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.740
 adjustment system through its tapes 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.869
 very ergonomic strike so very 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.810
 clear the backpack on top of the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.210
 thorax that makes for hip and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.240
 let's walk a lot more loose 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.000
 because we're going to thank you last 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.430
 a detail as it could not be of 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.850
 another way a backpack made in a 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.400
 very elastic mesh that is also 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.100
 we would say perforated and that when we put 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.709
 here our material as not the skins 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.500
 of seals that are often wet or 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.140
 wet through these holes is going to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.660
 to be able to get the water out of that snow that 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.480
 has been able to accumulate and also perspire 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.820
 very very easily so that it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.330
 we are going to dry in agreement nothing 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.400
 matrix backpack I would say that excellent is 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.830
 new this year and I think it's worth 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.070
 it's worth it, that look good until 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.070
 other
