00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480
 so that such come to the examination by 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.240
 computer and welcome to this video 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.619
 of color theory let's see today some 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.680
 examples to understand what is the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.390
 triad of colors in a combination and 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.790
 let's explain it by means of a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.579
 triangle have followed what are the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.020
 videos but I invite you to take this 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.600
 section we are using what is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 this chromatic circle and we are 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.020
 using some some figures to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.809
 to be able to combine what colors are 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.870
 some methods in this case and what 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.879
 consists what is the triad of colors 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 consist of placing what is a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.109
 equilateral triangle or imagine it and how 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.070
 we have been doing it and we are going to go 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:02.070
 rotating it this way and the colors 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.890
 stay on your tip or close to your 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.409
 tip will go combining why I say 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 close because as such in this circle 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.420
 chromatic in which I have screams so I 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.690
 it takes a lot of colors 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.220
 solid colors throughout this part in 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.310
 where should I carry what is a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.310
 complete degraded then in this case 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.040
 of this chromatic circle we can 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.640
 consider the color that we have of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.860
 filling 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.560
 we can not consider a color that is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.479
 it seems that it is not very distant 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.050
 although it should not be very far away 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.580
 let's start with this for the first 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.380
 combination that would be the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.759
 primary colors what is yellow 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.670
 the blue and what is the red then yes 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.940
 we are turning we can find some 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.110
 combinations like it would not be the purple and 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.450
 the orange the green as it would be 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.020
 magenta the blue the orange or the yellow 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.880
 and so we can rotate and go to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.649
 guarantee this that your compositions 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 they will be in harmony and they were 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.789
 said both in industrial design and in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.410
 graphic design and let's see in this 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.910
 occasion some examples and good the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.930
 first of them I have here what is a 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.730
 doll 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.670
 well I have what is the green color 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.980
 I have what is the color in orange or 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.390
 red I have some blue tones sticking 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.549
 to what is a purple we also have 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.129
 some shades here purple well 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.430
 defined let's see if they combine and 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.349
 we have what is the purple some 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.629
 let's say blue and what is two tones 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.120
 reddish in this case I'm turning what 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.620
 which is the circle and we can place it 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.959
 by this law through this 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.670
 composition in these three tones no longer 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.400
 I had told them that we can use 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.819
 also what are some variants he 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.850
 It also has good in terms of 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.270
 composition other 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.490
 another color that is being yellow 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.860
 and we have right away what it is as a basis 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.530
 a blue the next color that 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.120
 immediately notices or theory 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.000
 I would say the first because the first color 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.920
 that perceives the human eye is red 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.580
 it's been here, we're not going to 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.500
 see if the primary colors combine 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.780
 and here we have it was the first 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.750
 combination that I mentioned to them we're going to 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.990
 see another example we have the case here 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.060
 of the duck donald then we have what is 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.030
 as a base also the blue we have the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.770
 yellow and we have a detail in red 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.440
 has been making the same composition as 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.320
 I was mentioning all these 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.910
 characters that see any well 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.860
 any character of any series 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.420
 of any caricature for something have 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.050
 the combination 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.180
 who have not say they said so 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.930
 I want to put a green color with a 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.580
 red color they were made I dare to 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.380
 say what they sing one of them is 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.819
 they did tests of how it would look like 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.050
 combined to which market to have directed and 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.459
 all that 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.300
 you go with the following example here I want 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.380
 highlight what this shirt is 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.300
 also in this case it has another variant 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.360
 of these tones have what is a cyan 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.360
 a yellow and an agent and more or less 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.500
 would fall on these lathes we do not have the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.830
 yellow more or less around here 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.439
 aica 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.810
 in yellow the cyan equal more or less and 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:30.509
 the magenta here well defined then 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.909
 are using what that is that 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.759
 composition we have this other tennis 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.740
 good in this case presented very 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.259
 repetitive this combination of what is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.090
 the red the yellow and the blue is not the 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.889
 only though you can repeat a lot 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.240
 because because the primary colors are 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.580
 the first ones go first 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.289
 they perceive what is the human eye 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.689
 precisely for that reason it's because 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.849
 are too busy we have here a 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.639
 tennis 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.470
 has what is red the yellow and the 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:04.160
 blue and it's also in balance 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.900
 we have this other tennis that has good 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.950
 also what is the two colors already 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.990
 of magenta and yellow 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.850
 You will see this reflected a lot in the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.240
 that toys are also toys for 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.240
 children 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.270
 because because as such the colors 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.190
 let's say that cigars or colors more 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.440
 elementals are the colors that are going to 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.020
 bring a lot of attention to children 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.750
 quite saturated colors precisely 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.449
 that's why we use is used rather 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.100
 as a base those three colors and good and 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.620
 here they have what is a complement 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.650
 like green here a little delayed but 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.300
 that already comes say that depends on 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.430
 where are you going to put it in this case the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.510
 purple is incorporated into what is the 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.510
 yellow and in this case 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.220
 as a complementary color we have the 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.020
 red its complementary color comes 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.360
 being green not then is not putting 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.110
 the color wherever it is always going to have 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.110
 A because 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.010
 well up here the video today I hope 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.890
 that have pleased you I hope that you 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.260
 I have served, I hope you have had 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.610
 the examples if you liked the video 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.230
 they can just click on the ads 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.450
 they will be appearing on the right 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.070
 down before each video and so they're going to 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.090
 be supporting design by computer 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.280
 here on youtube 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.650
 check what is the facebook page 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.570
 there are exclusive material or contests there 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.070
 you can contact for any job 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.050
 that requires this gas and can get you 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.340
 quote and until today's video 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.080
 my name is guillermo urbina el 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.730
 industrial designer and graphic and we 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.730
 we see in the next see you later
