 hello guys how are we still in summer sure many of you 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.750
 you are on vacation a vacation that has many hours free to 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.400
 that you can do little for that time we bring you, like every Tuesday, a series of 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.610
 Game applications that creamy can like many will entertain 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.110
 saying this we started 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.220
 we start 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.699
 the hot week of August with a dynamic and then in the football peter 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.060
 parham your android phones changing the typical funds of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.050
 animated screen for the platform the proposal that we bring ap of your 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.879
 aesthetic conditions as well as productive since it not only offers a 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.400
 Argentina's minimalist interface requires that the aforementioned abstract backgrounds 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.539
 that also shows them at all times communal contacts 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.200
 the time as the battery status in percentage points both he and all 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.840
 animated backgrounds we can configure certain parameters like the color of the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.270
 background 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.490
 change it by an image modify the size of the elements choose which 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.940
 show was even mark an exhibition for them after 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.009
 almost intact nothing better than a good animated fund to squeeze the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.009
 maximum customization possibilities 13 Andean 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.820
 keeping panama intact 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.590
 I love to sing we continue with an application designed for more moments 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 dark we talked about drugs made it a complete 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.240
 kit of lights that we can use in different situations and that we can 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.069
 get out of a good cigar 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:56.009
 in the application that we find several light systems we have a flashlight that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.469
 controls the light of the camera flash a button to put the screen on 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.509
 white to the maximum of trillo an emergency light for situations of 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.969
 caution an ambient lighting system in which we can modify 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.569
 for example the intensity 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.099
 color of light and even a policeman avalanche that change the colors 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.799
 quickly to simulate that the effect patrol cars do 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.560
 they are also important 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.900
 also as you can imagine using this type of applications you can leave 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.670
 our phone without batteries quickly but as I said have this 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.539
 installed application can get us out of more than one hurry 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.859
 in adverse situations 2 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:49.049
 soon 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:56.549
 now we have something entertaining today we bring you some of those that have been 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.159
 designed to test reflexes and nerves 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.749
 of the juveniles plus aviles supersÃ³nica is a racing game 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.900
 three of them set in a galactic environment where we will have to demonstrate 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.729
 our expertise to carry a ball at the end of a tunnel that modifies its 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.079
 Constant curvature direction 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.709
 two 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.199
 I love not only do we have to avoid playing the chords of the tunnel but 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.539
 we must also recognize all the elements that we find along the way 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.539
 at the same time we must avoid the obstacles 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.599
 as I said supersonics is a game for aviles humans who want 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.859
 get some sleep graphics get hooked to anybody that does 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.599
 I warn you that the gameplay that requires some reflexes asks for a 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.799
 dilates the controls that I for example do not also have percent up 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.799
 achieve environmental goals 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:02.819
 we ended up with another super entertaining game that uses the same 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.889
 concept that his character luis rollÃ¡n interest of tunisia wait 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.699
 it's like we said another racing game three of them have the one we use 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.449
 of the mobile accelerometer to control the environment 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.180
 in this case it is our goal that is to reach this little doll until the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.460
 end of the tunnel 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.039
 We can not only control the doll's direction but we can also 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:33.340
 make him jump wink luso or change the floor a couple 2 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.830
 two 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.680
 the traps that in this case are games designed to make us lose ourselves in 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.360
 the space if we fall into one of them we will lose 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.650
 so we will have to be very aware and provide reflections for 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.550
 complete the level scenes we'll have to pass 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.949
 good guys after having seen these applications and these games 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.779
 we hope that our free time that is now more occupied that is more 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.969
 entertaining said this a greeting
