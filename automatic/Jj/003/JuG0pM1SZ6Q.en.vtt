00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
which is building city also you should

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.119 
which is building city also you should
have<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.280> type<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.610> MX<00:00:54.379> tube<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.770> this

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
premature so as you can c minus s

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.500 
premature so as you can c minus s
