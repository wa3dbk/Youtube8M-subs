terms<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.029> mashina<00:00:27.480> meeting<00:00:27.840> if<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.230> wanted

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
terms of mashina meeting if you wanted

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
terms of mashina meeting if you wanted
to<00:00:28.680> lower<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.070> weapon<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.730> only<00:00:29.970> do

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to lower your weapon you can only do

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630 
to lower your weapon you can only do
that<00:00:30.330> off<00:00:30.750> line<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.099> imagine<00:00:32.219> how

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that off line so you can imagine how

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
that off line so you can imagine how
frustrating<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.260> only<00:00:34.440> have

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
frustrating that would be to only have

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
frustrating that would be to only have
four<00:00:35.040> players<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> screen<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.480> once<00:00:36.750> have

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
four players on the screen at once have

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.780 
four players on the screen at once have
their<00:00:37.500> weapons<00:00:37.829> lowered<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> were<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.670> do

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
their weapons lowered if you were to do

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.930 
their weapons lowered if you were to do
it<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.030> split<00:00:39.420> screen<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.280> 16

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it on split screen so now we can have 16

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
it on split screen so now we can have 16
players<00:00:42.300> i'm<00:00:42.570> assuming<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.620> weapons

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
players i'm assuming have the weapons

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920 
players i'm assuming have the weapons
lowered<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.700> would<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.450> much<00:00:45.690> better

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
lowered and that would be so much better

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.080 
lowered and that would be so much better
in<00:00:46.320> terms<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.620> animating<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.940> would

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
in terms of animating and it would

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.569 
in terms of animating and it would
really<00:00:48.120> cast<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.079> more<00:00:49.289> serious<00:00:49.590> mood<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
really cast a more serious mood to the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.389 
really cast a more serious mood to the
environment<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.600> recording<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
environment that you're recording it

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.819 
environment that you're recording it

the first episode of the web series will

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.249 
the first episode of the web series will

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.789 
air now the web series will be five
episodes<00:01:20.040> long<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.110> terms<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
episodes long so I was right in terms of

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.780 
episodes long so I was right in terms of
it<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.490> lead<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.960> release<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.920> halo<00:01:26.310> 4

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it will lead up to the release of halo 4

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.990 
it will lead up to the release of halo 4
so<00:01:27.479> each<00:01:27.840> episode<00:01:28.470> will<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.710> roughly<00:01:29.310> 15

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
so each episode will be roughly 15

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.840 
so each episode will be roughly 15
minutes<00:01:30.299> long<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> multiply<00:01:31.350> 5<00:01:31.890> 15<00:01:32.670> you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
minutes long so if you multiply 5 15 you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.960 
minutes long so if you multiply 5 15 you
get<00:01:33.060> 75<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:34.950> hour<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.490> 15<00:01:35.790> minutes

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
get 75 so that's an hour and 15 minutes

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.469 
get 75 so that's an hour and 15 minutes
of<00:01:36.180> Awesome<00:01:36.810> live<00:01:37.170> action<00:01:37.439> Halo<00:01:37.979> epicness<00:01:38.700> so
