00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
okay this is my 1941 monarch tin ii ii

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.250 
okay this is my 1941 monarch tin ii ii
lathe<00:00:07.680> we'll<00:00:08.400> see<00:00:08.550> if<00:00:08.639> i<00:00:08.730> can<00:00:08.990> do<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> little

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
lathe we'll see if i can do a little

drive<00:00:15.210> conversion<00:00:16.160> go<00:00:17.160> ahead<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.369> start<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
drive conversion go ahead and start it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.670 
drive conversion go ahead and start it
up<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:19.580> speed<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:20.820> higher

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
up and speed it up higher

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.859 
up and speed it up higher
now<00:00:23.029> lower<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.600> down

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.610 

and<00:00:30.019> it<00:00:30.140> still<00:00:30.439> maintains<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.160> factory<00:00:32.620> speed

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
and it still maintains the factory speed

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.980 
and it still maintains the factory speed
control<00:00:34.160> knob<00:00:36.970> you<00:00:37.970> see<00:00:38.150> right<00:00:38.390> now

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:48.790 

we're<00:00:41.410> running<00:00:41.710> a<00:00:41.880> 1.2<00:00:42.880> amps

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
stop it okay I have the hitachi drive

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.540 
stop it okay I have the hitachi drive
kind<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.560> gotta<00:01:26.710> use<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.890> little<00:01:27.130> flashlight

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
kind of gotta use a little flashlight

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.880 
kind of gotta use a little flashlight

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
potentiometer is right in here this is

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.690 
potentiometer is right in here this is
the<00:01:49.870> control<00:01:50.160> potentiometer<00:01:51.160> for<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.460> speed

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
the control potentiometer for the speed

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.950 
the control potentiometer for the speed
control<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.500> even<00:01:53.740> uses<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.340> original<00:01:54.960> chain

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
control it even uses the original chain

control it even uses the original chain
drive<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:57.940> sprocket<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:59.170> control<00:01:59.650> that<00:01:59.920> and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
drive in sprocket to control that and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.800 
drive in sprocket to control that and
then<00:02:01.840> this<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.980> AC<00:02:05.980> motor<00:02:06.630> where<00:02:07.630> I've

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
then this is the AC motor where I've

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.530 
then this is the AC motor where I've
connected<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.740> original<00:02:10.200> gearbox

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
connected it to the original gearbox

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.860 
connected it to the original gearbox
this<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.750> connected<00:02:14.320> using<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.870> Lovejoy

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
this is connected using a Lovejoy

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.850 
this is connected using a Lovejoy
coupling<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.640> there's<00:02:19.420> no<00:02:19.860> modifications

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
coupling so there's no modifications

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.660 
coupling so there's no modifications
done<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.430> motor<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:23.020> be<00:02:23.310> unbolted<00:02:24.310> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
done to the motor it can be unbolted and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.260 
done to the motor it can be unbolted and
bolted<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.709> with<00:02:26.709> whatever<00:02:27.489> replacement

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
bolted in with whatever replacement

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.250 
bolted in with whatever replacement
motor<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.660> want<00:02:31.500> now<00:02:32.500> as<00:02:32.920> far<00:02:33.160> as<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:34.260> gearbox

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
motor you want now as far as the gearbox

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.090 
motor you want now as far as the gearbox
is<00:02:35.500> concerned<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:37.260> did<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.590> do<00:02:38.709> quite<00:02:39.070> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
is concerned I did have to do quite a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.949 
is concerned I did have to do quite a
bit<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.310> modifications<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.300> see<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:40.870> you

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
bit of modifications to that see if you

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.830 
bit of modifications to that see if you
can<00:02:41.080> show<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.970> back<00:02:42.970> plate<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.780> plate

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
can show that back plate this plate

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.729 
can show that back plate this plate
right<00:02:47.290> here<00:02:47.350> was<00:02:47.770> manufactured<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.739> there's

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
right here was manufactured and there's

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.090 
right here was manufactured and there's
anis<00:02:51.330> adapter<00:02:52.330> plate<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.900> there<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.530> Center<00:02:54.010> it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
anis adapter plate in there to Center it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.470 
anis adapter plate in there to Center it
up<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.630> then<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:56.040> new<00:02:57.040> shaft<00:02:57.430> was<00:02:57.820> made<00:02:58.090> for

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
up and then a new shaft was made for

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:10.050 
up and then a new shaft was made for
that<00:02:58.720> gearbox

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.120 

now<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.390> course<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:12.050> an<00:03:12.140> old<00:03:12.290> flat<00:03:12.770> belt

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.400 

monarch<00:03:16.130> lathe<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:17.720> did<00:03:17.990> what<00:03:18.170> everybody

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
monarch lathe and I did what everybody

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.970 
monarch lathe and I did what everybody
suggested<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.310> just<00:03:19.490> bought<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.820> regular

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
suggested and just bought a regular

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.520 
suggested and just bought a regular
automotive<00:03:22.540> flat<00:03:23.540> belt<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.990> turned<00:03:24.350> it

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
automotive flat belt and turned it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.610 
automotive flat belt and turned it
inside<00:03:24.950> out<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:28.840> seems<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.140> have<00:03:30.410> worked

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
inside out and that seems to have worked

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:45.810 
inside out and that seems to have worked
out<00:03:30.920> real<00:03:31.220> well

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.940 

can't<00:03:46.820> get<00:03:46.970> enough<00:03:48.940> 1941
