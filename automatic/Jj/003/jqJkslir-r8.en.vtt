00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
but they'll just get it right back on

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.140 
but they'll just get it right back on
their<00:04:59.770> stick<00:05:00.070> so<00:05:00.370> it's<00:05:00.490> like<00:05:00.610> completely

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
their stick so it's like completely

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.570 
their stick so it's like completely
unrealistic<00:05:01.630> it's<00:05:02.080> super<00:05:02.440> overpowered<00:05:03.070> you

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
unrealistic it's super overpowered you

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.490 
unrealistic it's super overpowered you
hardly<00:05:03.850> even<00:05:04.000> see<00:05:04.270> body<00:05:04.540> checks<00:05:04.930> anymore<00:05:05.350> just

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
hardly even see body checks anymore just

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.500 
hardly even see body checks anymore just
because<00:05:05.620> people<00:05:05.860> can<00:05:06.280> poke<00:05:06.520> check<00:05:06.550> so<00:05:07.210> easily

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
because people can poke check so easily

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.660 
because people can poke check so easily
in<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:07.960> game<00:05:08.200> now<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:09.250> hopefully<00:05:09.520> they

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
in this game now so hopefully they

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.460 
in this game now so hopefully they
figure<00:05:10.000> some<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.420> stuff<00:05:10.720> out<00:05:10.900> in<00:05:11.140> a<00:05:11.260> patch

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
figure some of that stuff out in a patch

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.190 
figure some of that stuff out in a patch
because<00:05:11.980> it's<00:05:12.850> just<00:05:13.030> way<00:05:13.300> too<00:05:13.330> overpowered

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
because it's just way too overpowered

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.050 
because it's just way too overpowered
but<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.860> can<00:05:15.070> see<00:05:15.190> my<00:05:15.340> stats<00:05:15.610> I'm<00:05:15.850> still
