that I don't have to get up and keep

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.510

going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> dock<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:51.750> plan<00:00:52.110> on

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.160 

you<00:02:56.860> can<00:02:57.040> definitely<00:02:57.190> taste<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.819> honey<00:02:58.030> in<00:02:58.270> it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
goes it's it's not like overwhelming

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.820

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.410 
they're strong or anything like that and
I'm<00:03:08.950> not<00:03:09.130> real<00:03:09.340> familiar<00:03:09.489> with<00:03:09.790> green<00:03:10.150> teas

I'm not real familiar with green teas

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.910 
I'm not real familiar with green teas
but<00:03:11.380> it's<00:03:11.530> got<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.709> good<00:03:11.920> reflect<00:03:12.510> refreshing

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
but it's got a good reflect refreshing

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.699 
but it's got a good reflect refreshing
good<00:03:14.920> refreshing<00:03:15.580> flavor<00:03:16.440> doesn't<00:03:17.440> really

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
good refreshing flavor doesn't really

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.589 
good refreshing flavor doesn't really
leave<00:03:17.950> much<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.519> an<00:03:18.610> aftertaste<00:03:18.940> but<00:03:19.420> there's

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
leave much of an aftertaste but there's

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.390 
leave much of an aftertaste but there's
a<00:03:19.660> little<00:03:19.900> bit<00:03:20.019> of<00:03:20.200> one<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.980> other<00:03:24.130> thing

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
a little bit of one and the other thing

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.550 
a little bit of one and the other thing
they<00:03:24.910> claim<00:03:25.180> has<00:03:25.959> something<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.410> do<00:03:26.530> with

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
they claim has something to do with

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.670 
they claim has something to do with
energy<00:03:27.180> now<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.480> can't<00:03:28.810> attest<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.350> one

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
energy now I can't attest to that one

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.479 
energy now I can't attest to that one
way<00:03:29.830> or<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.069> other

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
way or the other

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.390 
way or the other
but<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.510> know<00:03:31.630> I'm<00:03:31.930> not<00:03:32.110> feeling<00:03:32.350> worn<00:03:33.069> out<00:03:33.250> and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
but I know I'm not feeling worn out and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.380 
but I know I'm not feeling worn out and
drawn<00:03:33.670> down<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.390> do<00:03:34.989> feel<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:36.790> energetic

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
drawn down I do feel that as energetic

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.740 
drawn down I do feel that as energetic
as<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.660> usually<00:03:37.870> feel<00:03:39.150> probably<00:03:40.150> more<00:03:40.420> than<00:03:40.630> I

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
as I usually feel probably more than I

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.080 
as I usually feel probably more than I
feel<00:03:40.959> sometimes<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.430> I'm<00:03:42.730> going<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.910> keep

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
feel sometimes so I'm going to keep

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.970 
feel sometimes so I'm going to keep
trying<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.569> and<00:03:43.780> see<00:03:43.959> how<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.290> works<00:03:44.500> out<00:03:44.739> I

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
trying this and see how that works out I

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.180 
trying this and see how that works out I
may<00:03:45.220> also<00:03:45.400> try<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.049> diet<00:03:47.049> or<00:03:47.440> sugar<00:03:47.680> free<00:03:48.010> or

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
may also try the diet or sugar free or

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.870 
may also try the diet or sugar free or
whatever<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.750> as<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.200> said<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.580> essentially<00:03:51.580> got

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
whatever but as I said I essentially got

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.880 
whatever but as I said I essentially got
this<00:03:52.060> for<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.480> container<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.650> this

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
this for the container and this

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.729 
this for the container and this
container<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:55.060> downright<00:03:55.870> nearly

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
container is downright nearly

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.160 
container is downright nearly
bulletproof<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.549> actually<00:03:58.030> had<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.510> half-full

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
bulletproof I actually had it half-full

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.860 
bulletproof I actually had it half-full
and<00:03:59.920> dropped<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.609> just<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.000> check<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.359> out<00:04:01.480> and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
and dropped it just to check it out and

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.009 
and dropped it just to check it out and
it<00:04:01.959> didn't<00:04:02.260> do<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.350> thing<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.070> thing<00:04:04.019> this

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
it didn't do a thing so this thing this

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.930 
it didn't do a thing so this thing this
will<00:04:05.200> survive<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.590> lot<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.010> bouncing<00:04:06.459> around<00:04:06.549> if

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
will survive a lot of bouncing around if

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.210 
will survive a lot of bouncing around if
that<00:04:06.970> that's<00:04:07.510> what's<00:04:07.750> happening<00:04:08.230> stuff<00:04:09.040> like

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
that that's what's happening stuff like

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.509 
that that's what's happening stuff like
that<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:10.239> again<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.660> isn't<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:11.019> jug<00:04:12.010> review

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
that then again this isn't a jug review

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.170 
that then again this isn't a jug review
even<00:04:13.120> though<00:04:13.239> that's<00:04:13.450> why<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.780> bought<00:04:14.170> this<00:04:15.180> but

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
even though that's why I bought this but

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.210 
even though that's why I bought this but
it<00:04:16.329> does<00:04:16.930> kind<00:04:17.200> of<00:04:17.350> say<00:04:17.530> something<00:04:17.829> about<00:04:18.070> a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
it does kind of say something about a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.699 
it does kind of say something about a
company<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:19.450> they<00:04:19.479> will<00:04:19.870> put<00:04:20.109> their<00:04:20.260> product

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
company that they will put their product

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.060 
company that they will put their product
in<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.979> quality<00:04:21.519> container<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.870> it's<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.950> good

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
in a quality container and it's a good

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.100 
in a quality container and it's a good
quality<00:04:24.400> product<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:26.039> I'd<00:04:27.039> have<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.880> know

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.520 
quality product so I'd have to you know
on<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.139> scale<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.620> 1<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.830> 5<00:04:31.020> I'd<00:04:32.020> have<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.380> give

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
on a scale of 1 to 5 I'd have to give

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.460 
on a scale of 1 to 5 I'd have to give
this<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.070> know<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.490> solid<00:04:34.360> for<00:04:34.660> maybe<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.169> 5

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
this you know a solid for maybe a 5

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.050 
this you know a solid for maybe a 5
actually<00:04:36.070> there's<00:04:36.250> nothing<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.789> would<00:04:36.910> keep

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
actually there's nothing that would keep
