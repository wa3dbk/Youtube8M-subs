there's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.620> lever<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.520> push

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
there's a little lever that you push

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.819 
there's a little lever that you push
down<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:55.020> J<00:00:55.170> lever<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.620> push

that<00:00:56.010> down<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:57.149> comes<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:57.989> there's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that down that comes up and then there's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.819 
that down that comes up and then there's
a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.469> hinged<00:00:58.890> thing<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.579> comes<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.910> here

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
a little hinged thing that comes up here

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
a little hinged thing that comes up here
and<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.070> carefully<00:01:02.460> remove<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> old<00:01:03.030> CPU<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and you carefully remove the old CPU and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
and you carefully remove the old CPU and
carefully<00:01:04.140> install<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> new<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.979> zero

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
carefully install the new one zero

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.570 
carefully install the new one zero
insertion<00:01:05.880> force<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.010> heatsink

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
insertion force so this is the heatsink

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340

heatsink<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.430> had<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.790> loosen<00:02:29.060> those<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
heatsink I had to loosen those and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.650 
heatsink I had to loosen those and
actually<00:02:30.260> had<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.590> wedge<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.820> screwdriver<00:02:32.360> in

actually had to wedge the screwdriver in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.600 
actually had to wedge the screwdriver in
there<00:02:32.930> because<00:02:33.860> there<00:02:34.070> wasn't<00:02:34.220> really<00:02:34.520> you

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.460 
there because there wasn't really you
couldn't<00:02:34.850> really<00:02:34.970> see<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.450> screws<00:02:35.720> because

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
couldn't really see the screws because

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.210 
couldn't really see the screws because
they<00:02:36.709> were<00:02:36.770> obstructed<00:02:37.520> by<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.770> back<00:02:39.770> part<00:02:40.160> of
