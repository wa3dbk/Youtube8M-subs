00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
most of the time when yours are

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.329 
most of the time when yours are
adjusting<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.720> height<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.920> your<00:00:05.040> cutting

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
adjusting the height of your cutting

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.860 
adjusting the height of your cutting
tool<00:00:05.700> or<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> cutting<00:00:06.299> plate<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.839> your

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
tool or the cutting plate on your

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.530 
tool or the cutting plate on your
machine<00:00:07.379> late<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:08.429> want<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.150> be<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
machine late you want this to be the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.150 
machine late you want this to be the
cutting<00:00:09.870> edge<00:00:10.019> oh<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.290> should<00:00:10.469> be<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.889> line

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
cutting edge oh it should be in line

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.879 
cutting edge oh it should be in line
with<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> centerline<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.900> truck<00:00:13.320> or<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
with the centerline of the truck or the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.550 
with the centerline of the truck or the
or<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.219> basically<00:00:15.030> part<00:00:15.660> here<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.320> fit

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
or the basically part here that you fit

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.250 
or the basically part here that you fit
in<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.609> rare<00:00:18.029> occasions<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.020> want

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
in in the rare occasions that you want

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.349 
in in the rare occasions that you want
it<00:00:19.410> slightly<00:00:19.710> below<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.760> really<00:00:20.970> doesn't<00:00:21.300> make

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
it slightly below it really doesn't make

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.779 
it slightly below it really doesn't make
a<00:00:21.420> lot<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.630> difference<00:00:22.109> even<00:00:22.289> then<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
a lot of difference even then to have it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.050 
a lot of difference even then to have it
on<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> centerline<00:00:24.539> because<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> mean<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> just

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
on the centerline because I mean it just

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
on the centerline because I mean it just
makes<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> minor<00:00:27.390> difference<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.769> this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
makes a minor difference to do this

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.350 
makes a minor difference to do this
quickly<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:31.019> know<00:00:31.340> accurately<00:00:32.360> first

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
quickly and you know accurately first

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
quickly and you know accurately first
thing<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> need<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.260> find<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.280> rod

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
thing you need to do is find the rod

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180 
thing you need to do is find the rod
that's<00:00:36.239> straight<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.469> you're<00:00:37.680> confident

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
that's straight that you're confident

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.150 
that's straight that you're confident
it's<00:00:38.399> straight<00:00:39.170> put<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.379> install<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it's straight put that install that in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's straight put that install that in
the<00:00:41.280> truck<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.670> then<00:00:47.670> take<00:00:48.390> something<00:00:48.570> flat<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the truck and then take something flat I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.010 
the truck and then take something flat I
use<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.550> thread<00:00:50.879> gauge<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.809> mean

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
use this thread gauge but I mean

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.979 
use this thread gauge but I mean
actually<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.550> probably<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.180> most<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
actually you probably want most of you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
actually you probably want most of you
will<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.129> about<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
will not have that but how about one of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790 
will not have that but how about one of
these<00:00:56.699> blades<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.649> actually

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
these blades so I'm going to actually

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
these blades so I'm going to actually
use<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.030> simple

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
use this it's it's simple

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
use this it's it's simple
anything<00:01:01.140> anything<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.739> flat<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
anything anything that's flat and you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.899 
anything anything that's flat and you
know<00:01:03.359> theme<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.989> somewhat<00:01:04.559> rigid<00:01:04.799> should<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
know theme but somewhat rigid should be

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.649 
know theme but somewhat rigid should be
fine<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.630> actually<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
fine so what you do is and actually I

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.070 
fine so what you do is and actually I
have<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.200> adjustable<00:01:11.420> quick<00:01:12.420> change<00:01:12.810> tool

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
have an adjustable quick change tool

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
have an adjustable quick change tool
post<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.580> move<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.090> up

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
post here so I can move this thing up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.969 
post here so I can move this thing up
and<00:01:15.509> down<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> difference

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and down you can see what the difference

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.940 
and down you can see what the difference
is<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.700> right<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.710> just

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
is but right now what you do is you just

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
is but right now what you do is you just
move<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.490> tool<00:01:21.110> close<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.640> rod<00:01:23.930> put

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
move your tool close to your rod put

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.370 
move your tool close to your rod put
this<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> middle<00:01:25.619> unlikely<00:01:26.460> likely<00:01:27.380> fit

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
this in the middle unlikely likely fit

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.940 
this in the middle unlikely likely fit
in<00:01:28.909> until<00:01:29.909> you're<00:01:30.090> basically<00:01:30.570> touching<00:01:31.820> and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
in until you're basically touching and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.030 
in until you're basically touching and
grabbing<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:37.290> look<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.890> will

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
grabbing this thing if you look you will

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.580 
grabbing this thing if you look you will
now<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.670> basically<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.350> an

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
now see that basically this I have an

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
now see that basically this I have an
almost<00:01:41.070> vertical<00:01:42.860> line<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.509> lady's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
almost vertical line or this lady's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
almost vertical line or this lady's
standing<00:01:46.020> vertically<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:47.220> basically<00:01:47.790> tells

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
standing vertically this basically tells

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.350 
standing vertically this basically tells
me<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.049> centerline

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
me that you know I'm on the centerline

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.450 
me that you know I'm on the centerline
I'm<00:01:51.360> gonna<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.869> back<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.770> gonna<00:01:53.040> take

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna take

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.660 
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna take
this<00:01:53.899> blade<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.170> slightly<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.460> see

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
this blade up slightly and you will see

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.670 
this blade up slightly and you will see
what<00:01:57.030> happens<00:01:57.360> there

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.630 

not<00:02:02.370> much<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.270> whatever<00:02:03.690> so<00:02:04.130> I'm<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.340> again

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
not much but whatever so I'm gonna again

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.990 
not much but whatever so I'm gonna again
go<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.120> grab<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> look<00:02:08.880> at

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
go in and grab it and have a look at

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.020 
go in and grab it and have a look at
that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.130 
that
it's<00:02:12.030> silting<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.690> way

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
it's silting that way

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.230 
it's silting that way
basically<00:02:13.920> tells<00:02:14.310> me<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.970> blade<00:02:15.210> is

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
basically tells me that the blade is

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.170 
basically tells me that the blade is
above<00:02:15.900> central<00:02:16.230> line<00:02:16.500> I'm<00:02:17.370> gonna<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
above central line I'm gonna do the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000 
above central line I'm gonna do the
total<00:02:18.570> opposite<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.350> I'm<00:02:19.500> gonna<00:02:19.710> drop

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
total opposite of that I'm gonna drop

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.970 
total opposite of that I'm gonna drop
the<00:02:20.130> blade<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:27.140> now<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.200> should<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.560> this

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the blade and now we should have this

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.280 
the blade and now we should have this
incline<00:02:29.460> towards<00:02:29.850> me<00:02:30.090> again<00:02:32.780> well<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> didn't

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
incline towards me again well I didn't

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.530 
incline towards me again well I didn't
do<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> enough<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.490> almost<00:02:35.880> vertical<00:02:36.360> so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
do it enough so it's almost vertical so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.570 
do it enough so it's almost vertical so
it's<00:02:36.690> almost<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.140> center<00:02:37.620> line<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.280> let's

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
it's almost like center line so let's

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.210 
it's almost like center line so let's
let<00:02:38.850> me<00:02:38.970> take<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> down<00:02:39.330> more<00:02:42.770> now<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:43.950> first

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
let me take it down more now I'm first

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.900 
let me take it down more now I'm first
perfectly<00:02:45.210> certain<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.910> okay

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
perfectly certain that I have it okay

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.880 
perfectly certain that I have it okay
you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.570> now<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.780> blade<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.260> well<00:02:49.620> below

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you can see now the blade is well below

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.800 
you can see now the blade is well below
the<00:02:50.040> center<00:02:50.490> line<00:02:51.170> not<00:02:52.370> not<00:02:53.370> ideal<00:02:54.090> situation

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the center line not not ideal situation

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.950 
the center line not not ideal situation
as<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.680> said<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.070> really<00:02:56.370> want<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.820> spot<00:02:57.630> on<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
as I said you really want it spot on the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.380 
as I said you really want it spot on the
center<00:02:58.320> line<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.750> quickly<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.870> checking<00:03:01.320> it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
center line so quickly of checking it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.940 
center line so quickly of checking it
obviously<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.480> could<00:03:03.720> put<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> dead<00:03:04.530> center

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
obviously you could put a dead center

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.479 
obviously you could put a dead center
here<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.400> try<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.850> align<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.450> edges<00:03:07.489> you

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
here and try and align the edges you

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.640 
here and try and align the edges you
could<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.209> test<00:03:09.480> stock<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:10.380> as

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
could do it on the test stock not as

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.250 
could do it on the test stock not as
accurate<00:03:11.130> as<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.510> basically<00:03:13.080> with

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
accurate as this is this basically with

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.430 
accurate as this is this basically with
a<00:03:13.290> straight<00:03:13.650> rod<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.640> your<00:03:14.820> blade<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.989> and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
a straight rod and your blade you and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.449 
a straight rod and your blade you and
then<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.610> might<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:19.430> tool<00:03:20.430> like

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
then you know you might have a tool like

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.320 
then you know you might have a tool like
this<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.150> curved<00:03:22.730> say<00:03:23.730> sometimes<00:03:24.150> it's

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
this that's curved say sometimes it's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.060 
this that's curved say sometimes it's
difficult<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.959> see<00:03:25.140> which<00:03:25.350> part<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:26.010> is

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
difficult to see which part of this is

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.790 
difficult to see which part of this is
actually<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.910> cutting<00:03:27.270> part<00:03:27.480> when<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.590> hits

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
actually the cutting part when it hits
