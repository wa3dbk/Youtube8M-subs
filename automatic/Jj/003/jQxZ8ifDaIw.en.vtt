00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello you know the differences between the blu 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.220
 ray or dvd 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.010
 if the answer was no wen said that I 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.410
 I really mean you blu ray dvd owns 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.360
 quite different characteristics 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.789
 although they serve the same 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.310
 purpose is to produce films and other 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.680
 multimedia formats and if you think of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.260
 exchange or purchase a new 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.910
 tip is to analyze every detail choose the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.310
 option that most suits your needs 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.859
 from day to day we go there 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.380
 the two main differences are the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.200
 technology used to record and read 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 data and the storage capacity of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.559
 each media while a dvd media has 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.230
 maximum capacity up to 8.5 gigabytes 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.640
 an ordinary Blu-ray disc can store 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 25 to 50 giga in some cases up to six 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 gigabytes with this they support 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.860
 much larger files like movies in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.289
 full hd 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.840
 so if you are looking for high definition 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.910
 Blu ray players are the most 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 and do not think you have to discard the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.470
 your collection of dvds as they will 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.299
 to work normally on blu ray player 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.490
 You can continue to enjoy your 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.189
 discs while updating your 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.920
 video library for new discs and more 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.990
 attention to enjoy HD technology 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.930
 and watch movies in high definition 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.689

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.140
 images and sounds that are played back 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.680
 with this technology and I can say that the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 result is incredible people exist until 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.119
