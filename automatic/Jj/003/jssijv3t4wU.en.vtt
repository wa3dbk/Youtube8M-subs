hundred and ten speed and that's where I
got<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.400> 20%<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.509> than

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
got about 20% so a little bit more than

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
got about 20% so a little bit more than
20%<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.740> than<00:01:25.890> 40%<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
20% a little bit more than 40% of the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
20% a little bit more than 40% of the
original<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.049> significantly

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
original one but it is significantly

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.530 
original one but it is significantly
faster<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> fact<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.390> you're

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
faster as well as the fact that you're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390 
faster as well as the fact that you're
able<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.840> use<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> left<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:31.770> bumper<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
able to use the left and right bumper to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
able to use the left and right bumper to
actually<00:01:32.850> gain<00:01:33.090> those<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:33.630> bounces<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
actually gain those little bounces to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
actually gain those little bounces to
the<00:01:34.170> side<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.860> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.280> guys<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.610> seen

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

the side and a lot of you guys have seen
the<00:01:36.150> thing<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> pike<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.140> hit<00:01:37.259> left

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the thing on the pike we can hit left

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.719 
the thing on the pike we can hit left
and<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:37.650> bumper<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.070> dodge<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> side

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and right bumper and dodge to the side

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
and right bumper and dodge to the side
you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:40.170> barrel<00:01:40.500> which<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you can do it on this barrel which is

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
you can do it on this barrel which is
actually<00:01:40.979> kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> cool<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:41.850> kind

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909

of<00:01:42.030> getting<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> doorways<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.810> find<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
of getting in doorways I find it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.600 
of getting in doorways I find it
actually<00:01:43.530> quite<00:01:43.740> useful<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.430> you're

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
actually quite useful when you're

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.859 
actually quite useful when you're
indoors<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.750> around

indoors and you have to get around
things<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> you're<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> crashing<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
things and you're kind of crashing it a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.710 
things and you're kind of crashing it a
lot<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.700> things<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.299> useful<00:01:48.689> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
lot of things that is really useful to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
lot of things that is really useful to
just<00:01:48.840> can't<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.350> nudge<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.979> over<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
just can't like nudge you over to the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.740 
just can't like nudge you over to the
side<00:01:50.460> gets<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> doorway<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.570> be

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
side gets you right in the doorway to be

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050 
side gets you right in the doorway to be

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
able to boost as far as avoiding things

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
able to boost as far as avoiding things
it's<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.290> big<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> thing
