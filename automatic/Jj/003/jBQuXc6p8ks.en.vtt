00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this one actually is just

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
this one actually is just
straightforward<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.740> oh<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.220> have<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
straightforward it's not oh you have a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.090 
straightforward it's not oh you have a
big<00:01:56.790> long<00:01:57.090> stay<00:01:57.689> connected<00:01:58.320> yeah

say it's a looks like a SUV just smaller
the<00:02:16.230> thing<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.470> practically<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.100> really

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
the thing I practically don't really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.190 
the thing I practically don't really
like<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.730> how<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.940> windshield<00:02:18.540> extends<00:02:18.989> all

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
like is how the windshield extends all

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.569 
like is how the windshield extends all
the<00:02:19.230> way<00:02:19.380> up<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.829> doesn't<00:02:20.010> really<00:02:20.160> look<00:02:20.400> right

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
the way up it doesn't really look right

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.860 
the way up it doesn't really look right
that<00:02:20.790> way<00:02:20.940> doesn't<00:02:21.239> mean<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.750> go

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that way doesn't mean it's like go

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.630 
that way doesn't mean it's like go
straight<00:02:22.170> up<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.560> was<00:02:22.680> later<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.250> look<00:02:23.430> it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
it makes it paint this is actually

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.090 
it makes it paint this is actually

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
smaller this the second smallest to the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.820 
smaller this the second smallest to the
red<00:03:12.310> vehicle<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.450> many<00:03:14.290> much<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.590> fun<00:03:14.680> with

red vehicle and many much of fun with

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.650 
red vehicle and many much of fun with
the<00:03:14.890> arms<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.310> can't<00:03:15.490> split<00:03:15.610> now<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.450> only

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
the arms you can't split now the only

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.050 
the arms you can't split now the only
thing<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.840> don't<00:03:16.900> like<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.230> there<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.740> no

terrible<00:06:21.250> series<00:06:21.610> but<00:06:22.060> I<00:06:22.090> will<00:06:22.240> say<00:06:22.390> that<00:06:22.420> it's

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
terrible series but I will say that it's

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.940 
terrible series but I will say that it's
really<00:06:22.810> really<00:06:23.170> hugging<00:06:23.440> a<00:06:23.470> complete<00:06:23.830> one

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
really really hugging a complete one

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.410 
really really hugging a complete one
because<00:06:24.250> things<00:06:24.580> are<00:06:24.730> always<00:06:24.940> getting<00:06:25.300> lost

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
because things are always getting lost

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.660 
because things are always getting lost
like<00:06:25.600> these<00:06:25.990> two<00:06:26.440> things<00:06:26.650> are<00:06:26.770> always<00:06:26.920> or

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
like these two things are always or

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.480 
like these two things are always or
people<00:06:28.510> lose<00:06:28.690> the<00:06:29.260> little<00:06:29.980> chess<00:06:30.250> piece

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
people lose the little chess piece

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.940 
people lose the little chess piece
because<00:06:30.760> it<00:06:30.850> can't<00:06:31.000> pop<00:06:31.150> off<00:06:31.330> oh<00:06:31.720> I<00:06:32.620> really

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
because it can't pop off oh I really

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.270 
because it can't pop off oh I really
really<00:06:33.070> like<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.870> way<00:06:34.870> it<00:06:35.020> looks<00:06:35.200> and<00:06:35.440> if<00:06:36.130> you

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
really like the way it looks and if you

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.310 
really like the way it looks and if you
can<00:06:36.490> get<00:06:37.120> it<00:06:37.270> but<00:06:37.510> it<00:06:37.690> will<00:06:37.780> cost<00:06:38.020> you<00:06:38.200> a<00:06:38.230> lot

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
can get it but it will cost you a lot

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.050 
can get it but it will cost you a lot
just<00:06:39.130> hopefully<00:06:39.520> you<00:06:39.580> can<00:06:39.670> find<00:06:39.790> a<00:06:39.880> complete

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
just hopefully you can find a complete

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.400 
just hopefully you can find a complete
one<00:06:40.330> or<00:06:40.600> at<00:06:40.720> least<00:06:40.840> a<00:06:40.900> loose<00:06:41.080> one<00:06:41.230> that's

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
one or at least a loose one that's

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.410 
one or at least a loose one that's
complete<00:06:41.710> because<00:06:42.070> they<00:06:42.550> were<00:06:42.610> it<00:06:43.240> looks

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
complete because they were it looks

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.240 
complete because they were it looks
really<00:06:43.720> nice<00:06:43.840> when<00:06:44.050> it's<00:06:44.200> completed<00:06:44.500> throwing

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
really nice when it's completed throwing

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.890 
really nice when it's completed throwing
bad<00:06:45.460> part<00:06:45.670> is<00:06:45.730> is<00:06:45.910> that<00:06:46.090> it's<00:06:46.480> just<00:06:46.630> gonna<00:06:46.780> be

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
bad part is is that it's just gonna be

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.330 
bad part is is that it's just gonna be
too<00:06:47.050> expensive<00:06:47.230> because<00:06:47.470> turbo<00:06:47.890> was<00:06:48.100> one<00:06:48.220> of

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
too expensive because turbo was one of

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.800 
too expensive because turbo was one of
those<00:06:48.460> series<00:06:48.610> I<00:06:48.850> know<00:06:48.910> most<00:06:49.180> people<00:06:49.270> didn't
