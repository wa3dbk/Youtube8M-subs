 the hospitals that are surgeons with 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.080
 doctorates take into account that this is 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.180
 an exact average 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.710
 is absolutely right for the services in 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 transport graduates of the polytechnic 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.820
 national and transportation engineering 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.530
 there are about 9 thousand graduates of the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.710
 which its occupancy rate is guess 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.259
 how much payment 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.149
 99 so if you almost get out of it 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.939
 you have assured work and you are gaining

 around 16 thousand 800 pesos in the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.619
 last place is at 19 thousand 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.990
 physical graduates of which 100 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.509
 percent you heard more than 100 per 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.340
 hundred percent all 100 percent exerts its 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.920
 profession since here in Mexico it 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.129
 they require a lot of physicists and they win 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.080
 approximately about 16 thousand pesitos 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.879
 iway I thought that if I studied physics 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.410
 I could finish only as a teacher 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:24.300
 secondary all 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.040
 and what bad and bad but now we go with 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.510
 the worst races paid here in 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.880
 mexico now we go the other way around the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.430
 better paid worst towards the worst 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.320
 those that almost nobody hires the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.150
 best quote of the worst paid is 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.340
 communication and journalism of which 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.860
 220 thousand students return per year 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.660
 having an occupational rate of 92 per 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.370
 cent and on average guess how much 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.910
 they win how much we are going to win if we do not miss 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.330
 desire 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.980
 and mexican 50 please good so I 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.460
 For rent you get 8 thousand pesos 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.460
 monthly 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.950
 but it is the best of the best 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.900
 worst paid imagine how much they are going to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.090
 win of this art they will see the number 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.099
 one at number one in the post 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.379
 number four is the training 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.569
 teacher of specific subjects is 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.870
 say secondary school teacher where there 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.780
 approximately 60 thousand graduates and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.069
 an occupancy rate of 99 percent 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.930
 and they earn more or less how much do you think 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.960
 be a teacher for what is going to be good 15 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.980
 A thousand pesos 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.980
 Well, I would be a teacher 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.190
 third, we have the people 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.180
 who study the preschool level which 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.120
 It is one of the most demanded careers 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.490
 with 207 thousand people graduated a year 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.490
 having a 96 percent occupancy 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.890
 guess how much you earn more or less 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:49.350
 and I'm afraid to say hi quality 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.060
 7200 pesos per month in number 2 is 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.730
 find work and social attention 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.130
 where there are about 84 thousand graduates 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.860
 and an occupancy rate of 95 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.390
 cent and earn approximately 7 thousand 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.890
 weights of the races from which 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.930
 related to the fine arts there 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.300
 around 22 thousand graduates a year 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.010
 having an occupational rate of 95 per 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.470
 cent has a how much you earn in these 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.660
 due to the average tell me that a lot 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.070
 please said that being an actress but the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.670
 break your heart again when you say 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.910
 how much they earn on average 6 thousand pesos or 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.350
 even in the case at hand in the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.200
 chest a Chilean back be neither for the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.690
 rent in public in oaxaca not for 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.790
 that I do not have to get a husband that 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.460
 lend me the American mastercard 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.650
 express 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.750
 I told him yes, what do you think? 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.520
 for good I think the most important thing 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.590
 is that you do not pay attention to what the salary is 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.020
 If you want to study this race 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.180
 that dream do not do what I do 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.919
 I want to be an actress but the truth is not 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.720
 I'm going to surrender then I'll 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.910
 I recommend that you do the same if 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.699
 take into account maybe a little if there 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.680
 occupancy rate have good this 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.629
 salary but more than anything if you like 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.430
 you go for that dream are 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.860
 saying two people who changed from 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.470

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.430
 it 's not my thing they said rachel I'm 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.259
