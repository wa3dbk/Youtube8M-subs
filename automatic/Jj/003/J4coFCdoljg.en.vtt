00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.950 
there are things in this movie you've
never<00:02:40.010> seen<00:02:40.310> before<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.850> mean<00:02:41.060> there's<00:02:41.210> some<00:02:41.900> of

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
never seen before I mean there's some of

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.060 
never seen before I mean there's some of
the<00:02:42.020> technology<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.710> what<00:02:42.890> they're<00:02:43.040> doing

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the technology and what they're doing

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.100 
the technology and what they're doing
has<00:02:43.640> never<00:02:43.880> been<00:02:44.030> done<00:02:44.330> before<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.960> I<00:02:44.990> think

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
has never been done before so I think

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.270 
has never been done before so I think
that's<00:02:45.470> going<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.770> be<00:02:45.950> really<00:02:46.100> striking<00:02:46.880> but

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
that's going to be really striking but

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.950 
that's going to be really striking but
what<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:50.530> hope<00:02:51.530> will<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.690> thing<00:02:53.930> that

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
what I hope will be the thing that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960 
what I hope will be the thing that
people<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.710> really<00:02:54.830> resonates<00:02:55.310> with<00:02:55.940> people

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
people that really resonates with people

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.020 
people that really resonates with people

creating<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.800> character<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.520> because<00:04:47.150> you

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
creating the character it because you

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.910 
creating the character it because you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
differently and especially with that

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.670 
differently and especially with that
because<00:04:53.450> it's<00:04:53.780> like<00:04:53.930> all<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.230> a<00:04:54.350> sudden

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
because it's like all of a sudden

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.270

everything<00:04:54.860> kind<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.610> posture<00:04:56.390> changes

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
everything kind of the posture changes

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.260 
everything kind of the posture changes
and<00:04:58.930> I<00:05:00.550> just<00:05:01.630> got<00:05:02.920> giddy<00:05:03.920> when<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.640> first

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270
