00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.680
 this happened about two years ago 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.719
 when I was a quiet guy with a 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.670
 very routine office work and very 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.039
 lonely with a very normal life and 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.690
 I had my girlfriend a perfect woman with 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.640
 everything a normal person and 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.100
 current she likes her was called 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 natasha one day with the rate we thought 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.210
 our lives were so boring that 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.430
 we decided to do something different and that 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.710
 better than going to a circus, we thought 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.230
 then we agreed that the day 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.690
 so much we would go to the circus after about 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.480
 how many days we went to that circus laughs 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.460
 everywhere lights animal colors and 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.220
 clowns everything was going very well in the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.380
 show but when the clown came 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.630
 that I remember very well his face a laugh 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.340
 very big eyes somewhat disturbing and 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.710
 with his suit as horrifying as 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.110
 can be the clowns did his act with 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.120
 grace and joy to me something I felt in that 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.640
 moment was something out of the ordinary 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.040
 When I looked at him carefully I felt that 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 he despised his work he did not like 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.899
 what he did in a moment a child abused 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.810
 and the clown was still doing his routine and 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.340
 started to abuse the most people 'the child does not 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.900
 I kept until abu charlo 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.600
 He got up from the chair and threw a 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.910
 candy the worst mistake I think I could 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.250
 have committed that young man at that time 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.590
 everything was silent when the clown 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.540
 He took off his wig and stood still 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.730
 looking at the child with macabre eyes 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.710
 as somewhat distorted I do not think that 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.750
 many people would have noticed 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.460
 that but I was staring at it and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.150
 for some reason he looked at me in that 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.100
 moment 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.050
 after that the clown retired with 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.910
 a face of hatred and resentment and the young 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.980
 he laughed out loud because he had 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.770
 knocked down the show to the poor clown 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.900
 or I believed that then at the end of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.180
 function I kept thinking about the clown and 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.310
 in the boy then I said to my girlfriend 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.200
 that we left she waited for me in the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 car and asked me to buy him some 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.090
 cigarettes in what I went to buy vi 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.100
 the tent where the clown was 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.320
 he heard some heartbreaking whining 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.360
 of the clown as if he were 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.670
 mutilating or something like that but it was 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.679
 something like a crying and laughing looking at 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.990
 fixedly in the mirror to a dress of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.120
 clown with his red wig his face pale 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.940
 his bulging eyes and broken lips 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.920
 as if he had bitten himself then not 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.110
 I could keep looking at him and I left something 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.500
 I managed to record but it was very short to 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.570
 reverse 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.460
 the car my wife told me about the journey 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.680
 home that was a mother looking for 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.600
 his son desperately and showed him a 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.360
 photo similar to the young man who booed 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.460
 clown that day as long as I liked 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.620
 so much the function that I went back to 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.510
 circus but now it was different 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.700
 the clown did not attend the function and 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.040
 I went to the show to see 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.020
 that clown something creepy but something 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.209
 I was attracted to go again to see him when 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.700
 we came out I found it weird and while 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.590
 they were all in the show I decided to go 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.600
 to the clown tent to see if he could 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.970
 make him reconsider so that he came out 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.190
 your number then when entering the tent 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.080
 the clown was not there was his wig 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.500
 shattered and makeup all over the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.540
 ground 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.910
 when I realized that, he gave me a 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.100
 chill then I heard a little 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.530
 noise like a laugh but it was something very 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.450
 brief in that I tried to investigate near 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.060
 the tent and I came to a forest that was 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.100
 near the circus something very risky with 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.350
 so I kept hearing a giggle 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.780
 disturbing I followed the noise and could not see 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.580
 nothing just turned on my listener to 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.830
 guide me in that when I realize that 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.020
 there was nothing I started to go back and I saw something 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.450
 on the floor were treats 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.670
 I looked at them closely and I began to feel 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.890
 fear then suddenly I heard a 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.750
 shout very brief and heartbreaking and to the no 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.550
 see a lot and be so into the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.620
 forest did not have much choice and I went 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.780
 running towards the scream was like a 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.550
 cry of a child then upon reaching 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.830
 a part that was like a lake I saw that 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.930
 there was a kind of giant doll in 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.000
 the dark with lots of goodies in their 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.010
 hands and next to a person covered in 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.690
 a blanket when approaching me I was left 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.940
 recorded image that to this day 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.040
 I could not forget the doll was the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.720
 young man who booed the clown the clown 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.240
 had mutilated and put parts of 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.430
 dolls like those realistic dolls with 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.740
 his mouth full of sweets his eyes 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.810
 marbles with their mutilated hands and with a 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.820
 dressed and next was the clown 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.770
 such dress had a cut on his 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.600
 short neck I'm not too sure how 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.910
 it is called that cut but they die at 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.250
 instant and had engraved in his head my 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.350
 last function thank you for being here 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.080
 present and thanks for paying attention 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.780
 in that the last thing was his smile 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.090
 of the clown with his happy eyes and 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.640
 sick what I did I went back to my car and 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.680
 I took my wife out of there after 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.080
 from that day my life changed radically 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.090
 and my girlfriend did not believe me later when 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.130
 He saw that I started to dress as a clown 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.380
 making clown masks 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.630
 pictures of clowns in my room are 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.940
 He walked away from me and left but still 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.949
 after that day I remember every day of 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.919
 my life as a clown and how was his last 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.139
 function after months I went back to 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.729
 that circus and I talked to the boss and he told me 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.949
 that there is never a clown of 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.960
 descriptions here I gave them and nobody but 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.210
 nobody told me that he saw it or existed and I 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.930
 they thought crazy but if a young man died of 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.639
 a horrible way that's the story 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.949
 after that day I dedicate myself looking 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.810
 sad clowns with spooky aspect 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:16.009
 I can help them and they can help me 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.009
