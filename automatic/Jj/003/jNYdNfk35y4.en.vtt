00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi to all friends of reverse android and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.940
 welcome to this new video tutorial 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.179
 where I will explain how to download the apps 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.670
 for free android terminals via 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.370
 another very simple application e 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 very functional called app store 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.310
 naturally I will put them healing 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.470
 description why on play history is not 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
 present since they have eliminated it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.930
 once downloaded to the pk why not 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.230
 had the pk the installation file of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.380
 any app to terminate android 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 done this as already said writes from the pk 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.510
 they click will ask you to install 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.280
 to cancel in this case you click 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.570
 installs and finishes the process 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.489
 installation you will find it already 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 the app among the programs 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.239
 so now let's go and see a little 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.760
 how the app is composed that practically 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.700
 this here ap todd 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 once opened naturally vi 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.739
 you will find a real market 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.750
 I must say done very well compared to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.309
 other markets that are not details of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 as for this in fact here you will find 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.129
 of the apps that are the most downloaded 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.290
 the apps available anyway all the apps 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.049
 also install various updates for 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.000
 all the apps you see installed now 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.830
 we try to look for a fulfillment like this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.640
 I'll show you also how to download 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 any app 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 we are now looking for a game a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.430
 payment for the minecraft minecraft 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.180
 pm at this point we click the button 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.000
 to search and here is where the appears 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.420
 screen then you will find or gods 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.700
 results that life just bolide then 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 in the application itself or if not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.939
 are among these results as in the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.939
 our case 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.380
 click here the site look for minecraft that 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.350
 in this case it is in other stores 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 click and me now anyway 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.759
 various browsers will appear but in this 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.280
 case I click the internet and you too must 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.070
 do it because it's the best to download 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.930
 this types of are waiting for the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.840
 loading 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.210
 I tell you right away that the download takes place 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 always via the app 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.530
 it will always take the installation of the pk 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.270
 then as soon as it is downloaded it will open 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.970
 installing the application does not 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.030
 automatically installs the game then 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.980
 you have to save it yourself manually but it will give 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.900
 the time that the page loads unfortunately 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.900
 a connection that is not the best 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.700
 what is beginning to load 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.610
 shots that are already here and we will meet again 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.230
 all the apps in front of us now we will have to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.940
 go and download this one in this case 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.519
 minecraft pocket edition 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.650
 then if you find yourself so many 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.630
 results of the same app downloaded 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.950
 the one that has more downloads than in itself for 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.690
 example there is an app that has a thousand is 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.280
 another that has a hundred thousand dumped 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.560
 those who have a hundred thousand because it is 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.910
 surely that my this point 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.700
 we click the app that interests us at 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.030
 usually a connection is not a 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:05.030
 the best and the menex turbo in this 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:07.920
 period is having a tantrum ok 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.829
 fast puts the turbo 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.910
 ok so this is the screen 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.430
 app 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.620
 here you can find some 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.430
 screenshot of the real one 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.519
 application and here you find the votes i like 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.530
 but above all find also some 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.530
 file information in this case the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.400
 size of 10 megabytes 50 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.489
 the version is 0.8.0 so it's the last one 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.640
 version is therefore done that you can also 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.930
 vote by putting a non-like layman 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.190
 to the application and at this point if 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.940
 do you want to note by now to install it 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.940
 click install 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.750
 if you see browser it will prompt you with 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.500
 which browser continues in the action is me 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.500
 in this case I use the internet 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:01.320
 as soon as a mini load of a will end 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.510
 page 6 mian ex turbo si sbriga vi 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.489
 then this selection will appear 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.989
 download with internet or with a limb 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.910
 of course click aptosid because with 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.269
 internet would only download one 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.280
 loading an excuse a link 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.030
 which then will make you go to the real 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.000
 download however would be all one 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.440
 useless here that replies can install 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.570
 minecraft pocket edition 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.000
 unfortunately with the Roma that I have, you don't 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.260
 see if that 's what's written here to do 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.660
 speak read the notification bar 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.080
 said that appears ok or nothing 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.490
 epochs do ok it started to download 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.410
 add to the store so can 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.240
 add this story to your list if 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.160
 you want it click ok i'm this 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.290
 case I do nothing and in the bar 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.930
 notifications here that opto appeared 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.270
 and it is in download and here is what it is 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.280
 download started 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.419
 application this case I stop it 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.490
 because I honestly don't care 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.040
 also because minecraft is not compatible 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.630
 but with our terminals I should have 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.669
 make a video where I will leave you one 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.560
 minecraft version made by me that 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.260
 works on our terminals and also 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.640
 very pretty ok said this as already 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.600
 said as soon as the download will end 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.910
 the application will open the installation 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.919
 so what falls into the stables the work is 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.190
 been quietly can be 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.169
 therefore this can be easily used 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.150
 store is really very rich they are 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.990
 present most of the asp's 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.910
 play store is a fee that is not if 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.729
 can not find any app can be 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.770
 normal anyway at home or look up 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.020
 internet always something is found 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.220
 however, it is still a good one 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.229
 application that can be easily 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.510
 therefore used guys for this 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.220
 video is all i hope i was on 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.510
 as clear as possible sign up 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.360
