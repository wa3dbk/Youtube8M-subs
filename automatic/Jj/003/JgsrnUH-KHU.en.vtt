00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.879
 We arrived early it's seven thirty in the morning. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.500
 it's a team that arrives and another that leaves 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.280
 the firemen prepare for one more 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 work day 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.330
 a quiet morning 9 hours and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.850
 while no requests for help but 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.789
 in corporation they do not stop men 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.140
 are guided on how to make a ransom 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.600
 This is a simulation of a person who 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 fell on the course of difficult access everything is 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.050
 planned 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.920
 the staff always interesting to be in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 carabiner inguinal carabiner in the leg 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 always have to be stuck firmly in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 conditions not now the company of the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.040
 accident with that which after the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.289
 building when it comes to carrying 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 victim further guidance that turns the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:56.430
 the victim to be careful to always keep the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 cervical spine and that positions 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.120
 making it secure in the chest stays 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.120
 awaiting the mark 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.180
 at all times talked to the victim 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.220
 among the rescuers is also so 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 calmly reassure the victim by trying to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 whether you are a team or the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.850
 people who are down here doing 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.990
 for personal pre-hospital care 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.270
 up there is responsible for the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.490
 security and all three down here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.170
 so it has a very tuned tuning 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.970
 between them the fireman must be 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.220
 prepared to prevent accidents and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.979
 to help those who need the pressure 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.330
 psychological the work of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.300
 military firefighter is always under pressure 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.030
 when the pressure time pressure of the 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.220
 procedures even their own risk 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.420
 firefighter then he flees some of the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.830
 usual jobs 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.470
 so what we have to do 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.630
 I was working well on the job. 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.280
 own training school as now 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.190
 but for the training of first responders 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.770
 they are being simulated and trained 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.229
 in valleys various types of environments to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.119
 arriving at the real moment is being 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.990
 able to handle any type of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 of service 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.250
 the first fire brigade was created 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.860
 on July 2, 1856 by Dom Pedro II 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.630
 at that time the body was instituted 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.959
 temporary fire department for the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.150
 fire fighting but from there to here 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.100
 a lot has changed 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.519
 today men are qualified to 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.690
 any kind of occurrence the rule here 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.690
 is to save lives 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.170
 so it takes a lot of dedication a lot 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.939
 training the adversities in the occurrence are 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.579
 too big we have to be 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.349
 prepared for any event to 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.420
 any situation and so the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.980
 trainings are constant and people 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.650
 You have to trust the team in the equipment 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.139
 it is this preparation that makes the difference in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.150
 Help time is in the radio room. 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.799
 where by means of the 193 are made the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.019
 emergency calls 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.829
 it's ten thirty in the morning the phone rings 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.900
 emergency fire 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.319
 thick-tipped traffic made yet another 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.519
 victim hit the bike is aware and 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.150
 already accepted seeing some injury 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.799
 of the victim to get my leg 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.299
 so stay calm sir ambulance 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.769
 arrived at the place with the address 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.769
 agility, the rescuers were 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:31.079
 everything is monitored a victim 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.220
 I leave the corporation ambulance to 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.220
 downtown 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.580
 it's a pride 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07.040
 It has long since ensures fills 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.850
 just come slowly june look consensus 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.050
 important 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.350
 I do not know how filomena coast 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.890
 the modern one and this new report there stay 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.890
 okay 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.780
 no matter if it is on land or water by 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.060
 example 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.980
 much less the time nor the place they 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.760
 always ready to rescue whoever 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.500
 need 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.270
 but to arrive at the scene of the accident or 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.920
 fire is not always easy 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.110
 these images made by a fireman 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.460
 shows a difficulty to have passage 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.460
 the vehicle has to stop 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.580
 this other moment a truck disturbs 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.800
 agility can make the difference in time 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.900
 of the rescue while the firefighters 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.740
 trapped in traffic the flames devour 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.740
 everything ahead of time without pity or opel 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:04.210
 the agent's death has occurrences 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.080
 I believe it is the curiosity of the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.280
 citizen 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.770
 so when to enter the competition 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.990
 we are attending and need the 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.800
 their support and any support to keep 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.990
 away and even through requests to people 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.400
 requests some help from the citizen 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.710
 so I believe that if you stay away 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.569
 out of the risk area outside the area 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.650
 in the security area then I believe that 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:29.169
 be the biggest damn we have in the region 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.639
 general fields are 342 firefighters in 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.439
 40 municipalities 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.330
 here in thick point are about 100 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.430
 professionals who attend on average 15 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.310
 occurrences per day as accidents 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.389
 clinical or trauma care 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.090
 pre-hospital care and prevention and 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:48.250
 fire but it does not have under one man 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:51.659
 woman in the culture now with the shout 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.659
 out of shape 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.939
 burnout performs the function without 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.800
 no problem 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.839
 what even exists giving corporation 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.240
 professionalism is a military posture 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:06.400
 who has to be taken seriously for everything 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.719
 the type of work to be carried out in a 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.270
 work that involves the rescue of 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:12.639
 lives then you have to have a profession 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.439
 differentiated approach and admits evidence 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:22.240
 that the firemen all do even 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:26.490
 any function upon 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.490
 named him 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.670
 the 2013 race in the hands
