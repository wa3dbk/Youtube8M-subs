00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.539
 getting three titles is already percent is already a huge task what easy 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.680
 It can be so fast all over it is not forgotten 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.610
 if you go to the dfb cup quarter final now 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.700
 For the first 60 of them, it's printed. That's it again 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.740
 the title has already been eliminated 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.740
 m 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.520
 the federation of the world 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.330
 the city of DÃ¼lmen 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.220
 Dr 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.240
 as the best actor 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.910
 if I mean for me 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.010
 I am busy now 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 not so extreme anymore because of course I'm trying the time 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.790
 "Good finish" to have percent 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 Attempt to win titles Bayern is not so much my topic 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.890
 not anymore Â» 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.950
 my endeavor but I currently think to this day 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770
 the time and me here 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.950
 Frank Rost, I believe he plays at the very top of a very very constant order 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.110
 of course, too 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.160
 brings the necessary experience 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.230
 but of course the eternally young 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.490
 at Rene Adler Dr percent in his old age makes very good games that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 very consistent plays indeed responsible for that Leverkusen 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
 Currently check shows very successfully 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.070
 No, Tim Wiese always played the regular international champions at Bremen 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.000
 League uefa cup shaped 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.130
 he also has his share in that of course Bremen percent 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.220
 The pursuers are the ones that are currently the goal again 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.440
 so far the board of tests
