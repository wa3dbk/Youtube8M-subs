that's<00:04:26.220> not<00:04:26.310> too<00:04:26.460> bad<00:04:26.750> now<00:04:27.750> let's<00:04:27.930> check<00:04:28.110> out

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
that's not too bad now let's check out

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.750 
that's not too bad now let's check out
the<00:04:28.290> rare<00:04:28.710> which<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:28.950> put<00:04:29.130> down<00:04:29.810> it's<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.900> ride<00:04:31.080> to

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
the rare which I put down it's a ride to

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.600 
the rare which I put down it's a ride to
non<00:04:32.760> hover<00:04:33.860> from<00:04:34.860> there<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.130> go<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.400> didn't

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
non hover from there you go and didn't

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.100 
non hover from there you go and didn't
really<00:04:35.730> expect<00:04:36.060> much<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:36.540> they're<00:04:36.720> all<00:04:36.840> res

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110
