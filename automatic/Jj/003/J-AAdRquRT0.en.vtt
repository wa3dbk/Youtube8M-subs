00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.940
 on names like today that makes us too 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.380
 weird fun we are easy 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.820
 easy and that's why it may fall 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.630
 to take such an appointment and so on 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 implement 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:35.940
 it is nice variety to everyday who 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.440
 our own head had what fashion and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.760
 so on and yes always 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.960
 so full it is sausage I implemented 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.879
 think so with the fashion goes a bit 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.940
 you automatically go the way I am 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.559
 easy for that is at least always good 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.559
 dressed in it is definitely fact 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.680
 I have happy times online 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.450
 Of course, finding a bit is natural 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.250
 difficult because then comes the stuff and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.479
 looking forward to it and this style fits 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.159
 not quite ready to move back 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.840
 a stressful one for next one already 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.880
 a little bit of those portals or everything 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.200
 okay that's my style the good things 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.549
 then confesses eventually even 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.440
 ever the sizes says the pants 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.030
 from the company whose size fits in 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.920
 The rule back is also live 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.039
 I'm actually still so whether before 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 place to take with you a good feeling 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.320
 have christmas and zurich 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.340
 earlier more the whole everyday life 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.509
 spent together it was whole 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.979
 important that we I think we sometimes 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.390
 we can have separated today 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.159
 certainly other talks lead than 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.990
 We may lead if you can 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.700
 all those years together 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.780
 had 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.250
 you may already have one 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.990
 bit apart because you 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.610
 just have to be self-employed because one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.440
 just not that often does not look that way 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.909
 often meets and if you have that 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.580
 then appreciate that its why so much more 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.789
 This way was just both directions 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.789
 Well
