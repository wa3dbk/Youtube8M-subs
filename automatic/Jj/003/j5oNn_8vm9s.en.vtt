00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.120
 general posture to play with play more 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.280
 the correct grip of the cave with the 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.490
 right hand the general culture for 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 touching with a pick is in the same as for 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.140
 touch 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.330
 with your free hand 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.720
 Straight back the guitar well against the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.920
 body 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.530
 We put the arm to four fingers 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.039
 the apex of life to four fingers of 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.059
 the elbow joint 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.440
 of shoulders at the same height but in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.760
 this time my hand is floating 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.860
 over the ropes with the pick 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.320
 pointing towards the guitar now we're going 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.440
 to see right away the grip of the EU and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.340
 how and how 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.500
 we have to approach the guitar a 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.649
 which is important in the technique of 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.140
 cube is that the more parallel in the 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.030
 arm to the strings my strikes towards 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.909
 above they will have a little more 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.789
 weight a little more 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.899
 the blow is unbalanced 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.560
 down that for us is very 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.329
 natural 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.060
 repercussions down for us 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.179
 It is very natural with which he has served if 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.179
 I 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.460
 with the arm very perpendicular to the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.950
 ropes the edge down makes me 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.300
 very easy question up I have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.990
 do a whole movement of elbows 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.670
 shoulders 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.010
 to touch upwards therefore 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.660
 we live are going to be fluid funds 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:39.140
 then the general posture of the hand 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.259
 in diagonal is functional serves me but 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.840
 If I want to help her a little bit I can 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.180
 create the arm a little bit lower and 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.610
 fall out 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.980
 a little more for the ice on the ropes 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.830
 when it touches you with your right hand or 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.830
 play here and with the Cuba I can play 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.900
 four centimeters lower 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.910
 in the outline of the aita 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.250
 all the technique of gripping the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.060
 cost that we're going to see now is 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.590
 based on my own experience as 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 inhabitant of my own experience as 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.980
 teacher what we are going to establish is a 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.520
 average technique that works to the common 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.890
 of people but everyone is going to have to 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.160
 adapt the technique a bit 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.750
 to his own hands 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.070
 the popular guitar is an instrument 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.230
 relatively modern does not have the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.490
 400-year development as it may have 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.500
 violin that already has a technique 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.780
 established but that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.750
 we are in full development therefore 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.540
 each one is going to contribute a little bit more 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.489
 to the development of our instruments 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.170
 to hold the barb what we 're going to 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.350
 do is 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.480
 I have my hands extended 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.230
 flexes the index finger on itself 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.490
 I do not close but flexes on itself and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.690
 there I place the barb pointing with the tip 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.790
 pointing towards the nail and I put the thumb 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.040
 over I'm like drawing a kind 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.750
 of a circle between the thumb and the finger 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.110
 index of this form the water is very 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.000
 anchored on on a lot of surface 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.070
 fingers therefore it will be more difficult 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.190
 that I fall is very common that if I 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.430
 I hold it with the tip of my finger 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.810
 do not have support go flying in some 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.340
 then I place the prong on my finger 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.570
 flexed it is not necessary to close it much 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.960
 actually what I want is to draw a 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.000
 kind of circle with the thumb not 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.910
 making contact with the tip of the finger 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.160
 index but making contact with all 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.960
 the last finger phalanx 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.830
 and I can see it in the middle 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.970
 you may have to be firm but not 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.500
 I have to be squeezing is given in each 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:14.160
 in each stroke of the barb is given 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.980
 a struggle between the attention of the rope 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.730
 and the attention of Cuba without any of 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.730
 the two cds 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.940
 can it get stuck then 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.470
 what I have to do and the rope 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.820
 probably will not give up the rope 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.020
 it's a little flexible but the rest 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.620
 you have to sedate it then I can 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.630
 I have to do is make sure the barb 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.060
 because there is a lot of surface of the barb in 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.610
 contact him with fingers not me 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.700
 fall but it has to have certain 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.070
 flexibility then 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.920
 when I make contact with the rope the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.250
 rope yields a little and the tine yields another 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.180
 then I just left this position I 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.300
 can help very much measure 22 place it 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.620
 above the index finger my middle finger 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.270
 place it a little on top of the finger 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.490
 index changes me a little bit that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.020
 change the angle of the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.710
 right hand that leaves my right hand 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.860
 in a position a little bit more 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.200
 more comfortable to relax works also 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.890
 without doing this process 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.890
 then I have left 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.400
 if we see well 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.250
 the tine yields a bit I'm not hitting 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.330
 I'm not embedding the barb in 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.120
 strings but it is another way of 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.610
 avoid that conflict is that I do not 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.569
 Excel a lot of Cuba's fingers 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.569
 but it is just as one as a 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.339
 a long 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.339
 we see the grip from another angle 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.509
 and 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.569
 if we can see what 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.379
 and the angle of the hand changes a little 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:02.659
 rotate your hand a little bit simply by 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.259
 the resistance that opposed the ropes 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.259
 step of the point 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:15.130
 so I try to have a good hand 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:16.270
 straight but the strings delay me a 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.389
 little movement of the quill 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.790
 then the hand draws like a small 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.990
 rotation with a small 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.990
 a small brushstroke
