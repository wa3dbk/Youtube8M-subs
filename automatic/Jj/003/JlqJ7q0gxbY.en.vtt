kind of almost a cat bug kind of bluesy
fan<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:13.250> let's<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.630> that's<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> good

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
fan going on let's go that's got a good

fan going on let's go that's got a good
tone<00:01:16.350> let's<00:01:16.620> let's<00:01:16.980> try<00:01:17.160> something<00:01:17.610> else<00:01:17.880> up

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
tone let's let's try something else up

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.540 
tone let's let's try something else up
with<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:19.110> distortion<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.430> our

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
with some distortion so that's what our

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.690 
with some distortion so that's what our
fans<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> hear<00:01:21.650> ok<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.370> for<00:01:23.550> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
fans want to hear ok so we go for that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.400 
fans want to hear ok so we go for that

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
yeah I'm just trying to sit up for that

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.270 
yeah I'm just trying to sit up for that
ok<00:01:26.310> I've<00:01:26.430> got<00:01:26.670> both<00:01:27.020> volume<00:01:28.020> controls<00:01:28.410> on<00:01:28.680> 6

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
ok I've got both volume controls on 6

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.180 
ok I've got both volume controls on 6
and<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.690> break<00:01:30.990> channel<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> count

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
and I'm in a break channel for a count

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.990 
and I'm in a break channel for a count
and<00:01:32.490> we've<00:01:32.760> got<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.650> VBR<00:01:34.850> variable<00:01:35.850> voltage

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and we've got a VBR variable voltage

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.660 
and we've got a VBR variable voltage
regulator<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.410> we<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.710> dial<00:01:38.010> in<00:01:38.190> our<00:01:38.310> sound

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
regulator so we can dial in our sound

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.870 
regulator so we can dial in our sound
and<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.600> blast<00:01:39.990> everybody<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.100> we've

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and not blast everybody out but we've

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
and not blast everybody out but we've
got<00:01:42.120> that<00:01:42.360> high<00:01:42.540> voltage<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.200> tap<00:01:43.500> whenever<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
got that high voltage on tap whenever we

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.820 
got that high voltage on tap whenever we
need<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.240> VTR<00:01:45.720> control<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.650> right

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
need it with that VTR control but right

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.810 
need it with that VTR control but right
now<00:01:47.010> we're<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.370> give<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> some

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
now we're going to give you some

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
now we're going to give you some
distortion<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.230> not<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.800> super<00:01:50.370> high

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
distortion but not with the super high

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:14.170 
distortion but not with the super high
boss

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
can why don't we give them a soft jazzy

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.480 
can why don't we give them a soft jazzy
flavors<00:02:50.700> if<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.860> okay<00:02:52.860> I'm

flavors if you can do that okay I'm
going<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.670> set<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.060> tone<00:02:54.360> here<00:02:54.920> only<00:02:55.920> now<00:02:56.250> oh

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
going to set the tone here only now oh

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
going to set the tone here only now oh
yeah

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
yeah

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.260 
yeah
and<00:02:57.840> as<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.140> know<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.440> am<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.490> volume<00:02:59.970> on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
and as I know I am and the volume on

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.230 
and as I know I am and the volume on
channel<00:03:01.220> channel<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.610> going<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.880> be<00:03:03.030> on

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
channel channel one is going to be on

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.270 
channel channel one is going to be on
the<00:03:03.480> floor<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.140> now<00:03:04.860> we're<00:03:04.980> going<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.130> run

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the floor and now we're going to run

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.760 
the floor and now we're going to run
shell<00:03:05.550> two<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.150> nine<00:03:06.810> because<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.350> channels

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
shell two on nine because the channels

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.800 
shell two on nine because the channels
are<00:03:07.890> interactive<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.790> volume<00:03:09.150> controls<00:03:09.480> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
are interactive the volume controls and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.890 
are interactive the volume controls and
you're<00:03:10.350> in<00:03:10.470> channel<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:12.120> normal<00:03:12.510> channel

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
you're in channel one the normal channel

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:48.780 
you're in channel one the normal channel
okay<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:14.310> bit

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.580 

all<00:03:49.790> right<00:03:49.970> we're<00:03:50.390> gonna<00:03:50.540> go<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:51.110> next<00:03:51.500> to

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
all right we're gonna go for next to

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.740 
all right we're gonna go for next to
some<00:03:51.800> just<00:03:52.040> straight<00:03:52.340> on<00:03:52.519> balls<00:03:52.849> can't<00:03:53.330> drive

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
some just straight on balls can't drive
