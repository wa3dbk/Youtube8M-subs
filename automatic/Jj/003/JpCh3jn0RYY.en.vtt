00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
password it's going to be the same

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.300 
password it's going to be the same
password<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.540> their<00:02:43.750> screen<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:45.130> going<00:02:45.280> to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
password on their screen it's going to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.880

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
be the same password that's right there

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.949 
be the same password that's right there
so<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:49.000> going<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.269> ask<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.570> for<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.810> password

display name you can set a predetermined

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.320 
display name you can set a predetermined
password<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:05.310> let's<00:03:05.520> say<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.700> wanted<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.120> make

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
password so let's say I wanted to make

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.510 
password so let's say I wanted to make
my<00:03:06.480> password<00:03:06.930> always<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.830> wanted<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.310> one

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
my password always I wanted to be one

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.130 
my password always I wanted to be one
two<00:03:08.700> three<00:03:08.970> four<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.360> i<00:03:09.420> type<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:09.990> two

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
two three four so i type in one two

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.530 
two three four so i type in one two
three<00:03:10.350> four<00:03:10.580> 1234<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:12.240> then<00:03:12.660> i<00:03:12.780> take<00:03:12.930> ok<00:03:13.230> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
three four 1234 and then i take ok and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.860 
three four 1234 and then i take ok and
it<00:03:15.540> would<00:03:15.950> make<00:03:16.950> my<00:03:17.160> password<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.540> whole

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
it would make my password the whole

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.260 
it would make my password the whole
entire<00:03:19.050> time<00:03:19.790> whenever<00:03:20.790> i'm<00:03:20.940> trying<00:03:21.209> to
