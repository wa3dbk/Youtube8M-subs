if you play fifa 14 you'll know that

if you play fifa 14 you'll know that
tripping<00:00:25.410> has<00:00:25.500> been<00:00:25.619> nerfed<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
tripping has been nerfed a lot and you

tripping has been nerfed a lot and you
can't<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.000> glide<00:00:27.150> past<00:00:27.330> people<00:00:27.660> anymore<00:00:27.869> so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
can't just glide past people anymore so

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.439 
can't just glide past people anymore so
the<00:00:28.859> use<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> l1<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.519> L<00:00:29.760> beads<00:00:30.029> keep<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> ball

of<00:00:33.660> space<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.829> especially<00:00:35.130> useful<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.610> types

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
of space it's especially useful in types

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it may sound obvious we need to simply

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.180 
it may sound obvious we need to simply
sprint<00:00:51.480> less<00:00:51.719> early<00:00:52.500> sprint<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:52.920> using<00:00:53.100> an
