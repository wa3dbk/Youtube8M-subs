00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.609
 but not 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.919
 the four seasons are due to the 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.610
 rotation of the earth around the sun 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.470
 as you can see in this mural of 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.829
 illustrations your work for class 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.690
 will be creating our own mural with 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.940
 illustrations of the station you choose 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.230
 and explain to me why you think it 's the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.680
 more important 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 frank and javi vida and you will do the job 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.320
 in a group 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 Doing work at home seems to me 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.809
 great well on the go 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.670
 I knew if I kept all the numbers 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 of brabo monsters someday they would come 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 of fear what season we choose 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 the spring the season in which everything 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.380
 it blooms and springs and love breathes 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.440
 in the air an air also have pollen 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.170
 have allergy best bierno time for 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.830
 silence and reflection without pollen there was no 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.990
 flowers without winter no snow no snow no 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.840
 snowy landscape because we said the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.180
 summer is not in spring you can leave 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 to the street no better than night next to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.070
 chimney are you telling me that the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.010
 Winter is better than spring 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.570
 I'm tested and if we do it in the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.340
 winter against noise in thriller and 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.640
 woods and can sing ladybugs 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.280
 school thank you catch margarita 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.080
 the doll to arm for him 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.210
 I believe that the two seasons have their 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.230
 own charm look how pretty this is 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.050

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.050
 average is which 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.870
 you do not realize that there will not be 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.300
 Spring without winter or winter without 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.300
 spring wait I already have it 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.270
 life and I understood that it is a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.360
 winter there would be no prime life 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.610
 the stations pass one after the other and what 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
