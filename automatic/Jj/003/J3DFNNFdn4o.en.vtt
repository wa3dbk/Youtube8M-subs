no<00:00:26.220> internal<00:00:26.789> storage<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.480> will<00:00:27.900> use

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
no internal storage and will use

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.519 
no internal storage and will use
cloud-based<00:00:28.529> storage<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> concept

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
cloud-based storage so here is a concept

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.440 
cloud-based storage so here is a concept
image<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.219> I've<00:00:32.399> drawn<00:00:32.759> inside<00:00:33.270> of

nano<00:00:42.180> rumors<00:00:42.629> well<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.340> including<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.030> in

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
nano rumors well now I'm including it in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
nano rumors well now I'm including it in
this<00:00:45.570> because<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
this because as you can see there is the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.119 
this because as you can see there is the
mobileme<00:00:48.120> cloud<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.780> there<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.860> thought

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
mobileme cloud right there and I thought

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.490 
mobileme cloud right there and I thought
that<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.760> worked<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.449> again<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that it just worked because again it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.580 
that it just worked because again it
will<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.949> feature<00:00:53.399> any<00:00:53.670> internal<00:00:54.629> storage<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
will not feature any internal storage it

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
will not feature any internal storage it
will<00:00:55.890> basically<00:00:56.190> sync<00:00:56.760> everything<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
will basically sync everything to the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.139 
will basically sync everything to the
mobile<00:00:58.109> meet<00:00:58.440> cloud<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.000> go

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
mobile meet cloud so I'm going to go

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
mobile meet cloud so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.600> read<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> guys<00:01:01.440> again

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
ahead and just read it to you guys again

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.219 
ahead and just read it to you guys again
word<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.370> word<00:01:02.520> basically<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
word for word basically because it is a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.460 
word for word basically because it is a
short<00:01:04.739> article<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.970> sources<00:01:06.450> close<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> cult

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
short article so sources close to cult

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
short article so sources close to cult
of<00:01:07.619> mac<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.220> informed<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
of mac have informed them that the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.920 
of mac have informed them that the
iphone<00:01:10.080> 5<00:01:10.409> nano<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.670> apple<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> rumored<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
iphone 5 nano which apple is rumored to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020 
iphone 5 nano which apple is rumored to
be<00:01:13.080> working<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:14.040> eliminate<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.640> need<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
be working on will eliminate the need of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.020 
be working on will eliminate the need of
internal<00:01:15.900> storage<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:17.159> instead<00:01:17.340> rely

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
internal storage and will instead rely

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630 
internal storage and will instead rely
on<00:01:18.240> cloud-based<00:01:18.590> content<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
on cloud-based content so here is a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.210 
on cloud-based content so here is a
quote<00:01:21.090> Apple<00:01:21.990> had<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> figure<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.159> to

strip out some of the components to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.460 
strip out some of the components to
reduce<00:01:25.890> both<00:01:26.130> size<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.549> cost<00:01:27.330> Apple<00:01:27.960> decided

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.810 
this new sort of cloud-based mobileme
service<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.960> Apple<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.790> estimated<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
service that Apple is estimated to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.320 
service that Apple is estimated to
launch<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:24.480> pretty<00:02:24.780> soon<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:26.550> might<00:02:27.300> be

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
launch here pretty soon so that might be

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.120 
launch here pretty soon so that might be
one<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> new<00:02:28.020> features<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.100> that

streaming content which is basically
what<00:02:45.900> i<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.200> said<00:02:46.920> there<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.000> here<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
what i just said there so here is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.380 
what i just said there so here is
another<00:02:48.720> quote<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.920> device<00:02:50.280> cannot<00:02:50.940> surely

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
another quote the device cannot surely

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.990 
another quote the device cannot surely
come<00:02:51.840> without<00:02:52.020> any<00:02:52.530> memory<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.520> about<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
come without any memory what about the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.690 
come without any memory what about the
operating<00:02:54.570> system<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.350> crucial<00:02:55.950> system<00:02:56.430> data

operating system and crucial system data

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.230 
operating system and crucial system data
and<00:02:57.060> what<00:02:57.990> about<00:02:58.230> pictures<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.250> movies<00:02:59.460> taken

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
and what about pictures and movies taken

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.450 
and what about pictures and movies taken
by<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.480> iphone<00:03:01.110> assuming<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.740> iphone<00:03:02.190> has<00:03:02.430> a

by the iphone assuming the iphone has a
camera<00:03:02.910> no<00:03:03.630> onboard<00:03:03.930> memory<00:03:04.530> means<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
camera no onboard memory means that the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.570 
camera no onboard memory means that the
photos<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.360> video<00:03:07.080> will<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.460> be

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
photos and video will have to be

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.390 
photos and video will have to be
streamed<00:03:09.150> up<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> cloud<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.440> presumably

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
streamed up to the cloud and presumably

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.150 
streamed up to the cloud and presumably
in<00:03:11.760> real<00:03:12.090> time<00:03:12.480> which<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.260> again<00:03:13.560> what<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:13.830> said

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
in real time which is again what I said

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.390 
in real time which is again what I said
before<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:16.050> basically<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:16.740> go<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.070> to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
before so and basically I just go on to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.430 
before so and basically I just go on to
say<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:18.000> sure<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.330> bookmark<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.870> website
