that's<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.600> i<00:01:09.659> would<00:01:09.869> suggest<00:01:09.990> using

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.220 

i<00:01:17.320> also<00:01:18.010> have<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.880> very<00:01:19.240> small<00:01:19.360> dotting<00:01:19.840> tool

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
i also have a very small dotting tool

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.960 
i also have a very small dotting tool
here<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.800> i'm<00:01:20.890> going<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.130> use<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.550> draw<00:01:21.760> my

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
here that i'm going to use to draw my

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.130 
here that i'm going to use to draw my
design<00:01:22.410> you<00:01:23.410> can<00:01:23.590> use<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.830> toothpick<00:01:24.460> or<00:01:25.180> an

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
design you can use a toothpick or an

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.220 
design you can use a toothpick or an
orange<00:01:26.920> wood<00:01:27.310> stick<00:01:27.340> or<00:01:28.120> anything<00:01:28.930> with<00:01:29.200> a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
orange wood stick or anything with a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.460 
orange wood stick or anything with a
fine<00:01:29.530> point<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.560> i<00:01:32.830> prefer<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:34.260> dotting<00:01:35.260> tool

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
fine point but i prefer the dotting tool

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.230 
fine point but i prefer the dotting tool
because<00:01:35.770> it's<00:01:35.950> metal<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:36.520> it's<00:01:36.670> easy<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:36.970> clean

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
because it's metal so it's easy to clean

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
because it's metal so it's easy to clean
off<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.480> reuse<00:01:37.990> for<00:01:38.700> multiple<00:01:39.700> times<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:44.080> now

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
off and reuse for multiple times so now

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.430 
off and reuse for multiple times so now
that<00:01:44.470> my<00:01:44.500> bullseye<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.400> complete<00:01:46.290> i'm<00:01:47.290> going
