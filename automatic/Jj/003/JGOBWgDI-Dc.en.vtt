obviously<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:54.980> seat<00:02:55.220> wouldn't<00:02:55.520> be<00:02:55.640> used<00:02:56.170> but

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
obviously this seat wouldn't be used but

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.300 
obviously this seat wouldn't be used but
the<00:02:57.260> passenger<00:02:57.680> seat<00:02:57.860> has<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.280> a

the passenger seat has to be a
consideration<00:02:58.610> as<00:02:59.120> well<00:02:59.239> because<00:02:59.600> obviously

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
consideration as well because obviously

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.870 
consideration as well because obviously
there<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.530> set<00:03:00.830> zone<00:03:01.070> for<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> passenger

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
there is a set zone for the passenger

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.180 
there is a set zone for the passenger
and<00:03:02.030> all<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.140> those<00:03:03.230> considerations<00:03:03.530> are<00:03:04.010> put

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
and all of those considerations are put

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.420

actually<00:04:04.790> helped<00:04:05.060> tremendously<00:04:05.409> with<00:04:06.409> being

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
actually helped tremendously with being

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.349 
actually helped tremendously with being
a<00:04:06.650> Brutus<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.010> response<00:04:07.730> time<00:04:07.939> to<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.180> mother

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
a Brutus the response time to the mother

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.720 
a Brutus the response time to the mother
and<00:04:09.230> that's<00:04:09.379> fine<00:04:09.680> um<00:04:09.829> we<00:04:10.159> will<00:04:10.370> get<00:04:10.489> someone

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
and that's fine um we will get someone

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.710 
and that's fine um we will get someone

the company that runs this SSE is

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.110 
the company that runs this SSE is
seriously<00:04:45.860> good<00:04:46.159> at<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.460> it's<00:04:46.729> their<00:04:46.909> core

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
seriously good at this it's their core

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.490 
seriously good at this it's their core
business<00:04:47.330> it's<00:04:47.720> what<00:04:47.870> they<00:04:47.990> do<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.320> they<00:04:48.440> do

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
it very very well one of the reasons for

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.170 
it very very well one of the reasons for
that<00:04:50.960> it's<00:04:51.560> not<00:04:51.650> just<00:04:51.770> their<00:04:52.400> ability<00:04:52.520> to<00:04:52.849> use

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
that it's not just their ability to use

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.670 
that it's not just their ability to use
technology<00:04:53.449> but<00:04:54.080> their<00:04:54.229> ability<00:04:54.650> to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
technology but their ability to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.189 
technology but their ability to
understand<00:04:55.190> how<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.490> use<00:04:55.729> it<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.240> how<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:56.870> get

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
understand how to use it and how to get

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.240 
understand how to use it and how to get
the<00:04:57.320> best<00:04:57.500> out<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.770> it

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
the best out of it

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.430 
the best out of it
and<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:58.669> can<00:04:58.820> tell<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.180> that<00:04:59.330> SSC<00:04:59.780> executives

and I can tell you that SSC executives

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.159 
and I can tell you that SSC executives
are<00:05:00.740> looking<00:05:01.460> at<00:05:01.669> technology<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:02.659> like<00:05:02.750> this

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
are looking at technology just like this

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.379 
are looking at technology just like this
and<00:05:03.470> figuring<00:05:04.039> out<00:05:04.250> how<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:04.789> make<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.120> work

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
and figuring out how to make it work

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.920 
and figuring out how to make it work
even<00:05:06.110> harder<00:05:06.139> and<00:05:06.979> it's<00:05:07.580> all<00:05:07.729> about<00:05:07.930> keeping

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
even harder and it's all about keeping

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.700 
even harder and it's all about keeping
the<00:05:09.199> lights<00:05:09.380> on

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710
