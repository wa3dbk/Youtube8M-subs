which<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.390> material<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.109> it's

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
which is also a good material but it's

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.520 
which is also a good material but it's
actually<00:00:58.590> artificial<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.899> won't<00:01:01.170> break<00:01:01.469> that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
actually artificial it won't break that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
actually artificial it won't break that
easily<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.699> app<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.969> good<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> filler

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
easily and the app is good as a filler

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
easily and the app is good as a filler
for<00:01:04.619> various<00:01:05.040> things<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.580> yeah<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:07.200> also

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
kind of file a bit of a rounded bit at

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.910 
kind of file a bit of a rounded bit at
the<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.239> tip<00:02:12.510> after<00:02:13.019> all<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> whittling<00:02:13.769> you

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the very tip after all the whittling you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.960 
the very tip after all the whittling you
should<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.190> something<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.549> looks<00:02:14.700> like

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
should have something that looks like

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.569 
should have something that looks like
this<00:02:15.120> now<00:02:16.609> you<00:02:17.609> move<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.420> other<00:02:18.540> side

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
this now you move on to the other side

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.700 
this now you move on to the other side
after<00:02:20.579> you've<00:02:20.700> had<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.910> metal<00:02:21.510> piece<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.810> your

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
after you've had a metal piece of your

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.790 
after you've had a metal piece of your
you're<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> piece<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.210> this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
you're going to have a piece like this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.310 
you're going to have a piece like this
you<00:02:25.800> glue<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.790> another<00:02:27.660> piece<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.140> wood

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
you glue it on to another piece of wood

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.890 
you glue it on to another piece of wood
and<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.340> cut<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.700> out<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.660> should

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and then you cut it out and it should

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.670 
and then you cut it out and it should
look<00:02:31.080> like<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:33.960> your<00:02:33.990> blade<00:02:34.410> in

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
look like this you can put your blade in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.730 
look like this you can put your blade in
just<00:02:35.070> test<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.580> fit<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.630> may<00:02:36.780> need<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.200> file

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
just test the fit you may need to file

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.100 
just test the fit you may need to file
it<00:02:38.070> down<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.790> bit<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.540> looks<00:02:39.720> like

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
it down just a bit this one looks like

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.620 
it down just a bit this one looks like
it<00:02:40.320> may<00:02:40.620> need<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> bit<00:02:40.980> more<00:02:41.310> filing<00:02:41.970> because

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
it may need a bit more filing because

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.770 
it may need a bit more filing because
it's<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:43.830> really<00:02:44.490> really<00:02:44.730> tight<00:02:45.030> fit<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
it's a really really tight fit and that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's a really really tight fit and that
won't<00:02:45.990> really<00:02:46.110> work<00:02:46.440> when<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.010> being<00:02:47.340> glued

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
won't really work when it's being glued

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.510 
won't really work when it's being glued
now<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.780> glue<00:02:48.990> your<00:02:49.020> piece<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:50.040> end

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
now you have to glue your piece you end

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.910 
now you have to glue your piece you end
up<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.570> putting<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.200> little<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.620> glue

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
up just putting a little bit of glue

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.230 
up just putting a little bit of glue
right<00:02:53.100> here<00:02:54.920> take<00:02:55.920> your<00:02:56.070> finger<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.670> just

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
right here take your finger and just

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.320 
right here take your finger and just
smudge<00:02:58.020> all<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.830> glue<00:02:59.070> across<00:02:59.730> all<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
smudge all the glue across all the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.850 
smudge all the glue across all the
surfaces<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:02.900> make<00:03:03.900> sure<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.740> won't

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
surfaces and make sure that it won't

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.670 
surfaces and make sure that it won't
actually<00:03:05.220> leaked<00:03:06.030> into<00:03:06.750> where<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.140> handle<00:03:07.620> is

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
actually leaked into where the handle is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.650 
actually leaked into where the handle is
going<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.920> fit<00:03:08.130> because<00:03:08.640> then<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.300> won't<00:03:09.450> fit

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
going to fit because then it won't fit

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.350 
going to fit because then it won't fit
take<00:03:10.260> your<00:03:10.470> other<00:03:10.590> piece<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.340> stick<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.090> on

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
take your other piece and stick it on

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.020 
take your other piece and stick it on
now<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.380> just<00:03:13.590> wait<00:03:13.770> about<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.040> half<00:03:14.310> hour<00:03:14.490> so

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
now you just wait about a half hour so

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.610 
now you just wait about a half hour so
now<00:03:15.570> we're<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.870> move<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.410> guard

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
