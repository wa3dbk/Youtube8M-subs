perhaps<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.720> summer<00:04:56.410> solstice<00:04:57.090> also<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:58.150> can

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
perhaps the summer solstice also you can

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.860 
perhaps the summer solstice also you can
see<00:04:58.539> up<00:04:58.630> there<00:04:58.889> that<00:04:59.889> white<00:05:00.160> blob<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:01.270> actually

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870
