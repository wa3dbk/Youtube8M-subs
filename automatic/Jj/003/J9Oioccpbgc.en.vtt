00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.770
 and today i'm visiting mary new land and 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.789
 today we will tell you which books we 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.759
 recommend reading 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.949
 in the fall, rightfully, guests are the first person 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.650
 who will start talking about the soup to them 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.890
 Masha will I squeezed out of two autumn books 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.689
 and this is harry potter i think i'm all 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.570
 never read and in school but me 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.879
 it seems they always went out in the fall 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.580
 at least yes and in my opinion this is the most 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.850
 general autumn school that you can 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:49.159
 come up with a general description of England 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.790
 fall, I personally have not read Harry Potter 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.879
 in Russian 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.210
 I listened to audiobooks but I went to 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.909
 English and it seems to me that even if 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.830
 have already passed in Russian read again in 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.720
 original because language is 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.740
 moments that may not be clear 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.270
 in general, everything is quite accessible to me 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.700
 it seems much more interesting to read 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.650
 just at times as you know if 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.690
 have long been watching my channel very 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.120
 difficult to make a choice when it comes to 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.800
 books and and therefore the first book which 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.200
 I'll tell you this will be a category that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.270
 like jane austin all about 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.030
 jane austin or creates such an atmosphere 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.590
 as the author creates in your books you 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.090
 can find a large quantity 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.890
 various works of jane austin but 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.210
 if you like something more 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.170
 modern then you can for example 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.820
 read comics or some 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.659
 adaptations of jane austin's books as for example 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.580
 Austinland 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.130
 which tells about thematic 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.140
 jane austin book park or book 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.580
 jane austin club both of these books are transferred 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.770
 in Russian so you can them 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.460
 read and by the way we do not each other 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.520
 talked 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.030
 my lists of books so for me this 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.040
 All times a surprise and I really want 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.210
 now novoshibe 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.610
 my second a little can not you 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.620
 show because i drowned my 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.140
 the last copy in greece but it 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.060
 jane air charlotte bronte 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.810
 I read this book for 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.250
 true 5 years every summer and every axis 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.530
 can say here august-september i 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.730
 always loved reread precisely jane 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.280
 true all the atmosphere of england and wasteland and 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.920
 forests it pour autumn on me 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.310
 mood, and it seems to me it seems to me in 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.630
 all videos when they ask me 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.870
 advise the book 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.730
 something to read the girls then I always 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.069
 advise energy seems like a classic 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.660
 which here's the top 10 if we talk about 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.239
 other books that I love very much 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.650
 read in the fall then this is something stressful 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.930
 like detectives or some 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.170
 paranormal stories so again 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.390
 I will show you not one but two books 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 unbecoming mara milks the third book 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.650
 part of a series that just comes out 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.349
 yet in November of this year and another 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.160
 book missing Gillian Flynn 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.510
 screen version which you can see 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.380
 already this week 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.989
 and the last book I have not read it yet 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.819
 but I specifically took her Ulyana 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.340
 weeks ago I decided a whole week 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.769
 the reason I just say that literally 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.329
 I read it today but no, I still have to 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.480
 probably two weeks 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.530
 active reading and this is a mysterious garden 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.130
 Francis Bernet 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.010
 and I think this is a book from the category 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.459
 Such children more or more likely 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.430
 I say I can not overpower more 1 2 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.680
 chapters and all i read for a day 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.319
 rate but here I am also present this 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.510
 the atmosphere of the English wasteland is exactly 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.299
 description of the weather and nature and in like 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.400
 books makes me read them though 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.269
 in the fall because you want you 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.670
 you read that the wind moves the trees and 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.720
 it's very cold outside and the main character 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.760
 locked up 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.100
 I also want to have these at home by the fireplace 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.959
 you are so wild on tour 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.660
 the last book we show you 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.519
 today in this video it will be a book like 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.220
 be interesting mann ivanov publishers 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.139
 and ferber for me autumn is the beginning of a new 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.319
 life in some way new season all 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.209
 trees change grass anything 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.410
 changes in general and I think it 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.180
 great time 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.220
 some self-cultivation something 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.019
 new learn interesting and in this book 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.210
 you for example learn how to relate to 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.740
 criticizing or telling people 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.120
 some interesting things that you 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.820
 found and want to share 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.500
 so if you don't know how to do 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.930
 some of the above are required 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.380
 read the book how to be interesting 10 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.380
 simple steps 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.850
 I wanted to show she was 4 but since you are so 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.390
 breaking the rules continues the case 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.330
 self-improvement and 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.160
 the fact that autumn is true as I have 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.320
 spoke with them saw a sip of fresh 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.990
 air and I always want to do that 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.870
 then new sense to feel skay scourge 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.870
 the role of Friedman and Kim does not matter 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.810
 this witty story is not here 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.470
 clear advice how to say tehniche public 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.440
 in contact with 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.330
 it's just like a story and they are all 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.460
 explain why it explains the benefits 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.140
 some food or harm and why 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.930
 something needs to be done why not and 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.720
 it seems like even recipes have an element 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.160
 I may be wrong I have not read it yet, but 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.400
 I really like for some reason 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.260
 I advise everyone to reread the first chapters 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.810
 and if you have any knowledge 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.490
 English, take the original I'm 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.250

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.910

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.620
