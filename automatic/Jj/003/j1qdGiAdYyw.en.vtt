00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.530 
mean with the soul they're way more pop
better<00:03:48.040> than<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.340> sniper<00:03:48.579> sorry<00:03:48.970> before<00:03:49.510> I

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
better than the sniper sorry before I

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.110 
better than the sniper sorry before I
would<00:03:49.810> agree<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.199> snipers<00:03:50.829> were<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.340> tad<00:03:51.729> bit

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
would agree that snipers were a tad bit

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.180 
would agree that snipers were a tad bit
you<00:03:52.510> know<00:03:52.540> easier<00:03:53.109> not<00:03:53.409> easier<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.889> use<00:03:53.979> but

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
you know easier not easier to use but

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.640 
you know easier not easier to use but
they're<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.609> lot<00:03:55.030> more<00:03:55.090> efficient<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.409> if<00:03:56.530> you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
they're a lot more efficient so if you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.830 
they're a lot more efficient so if you
look<00:03:56.739> at<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.889> freakin<00:03:57.370> hitmarker<00:03:57.939> but<00:03:58.540> that's

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
look at a freakin hitmarker but that's

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.479 
look at a freakin hitmarker but that's
because<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.109> didn't<00:03:59.260> have<00:03:59.349> idea<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.739> FMJ<00:04:00.189> one

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
because I didn't have idea of FMJ one

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.830 
because I didn't have idea of FMJ one
thing<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.669> like<00:04:00.849> but<00:04:01.000> this<00:04:01.090> gun<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.449> that<00:04:01.720> his
