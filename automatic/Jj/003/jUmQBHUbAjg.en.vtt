mr.<00:00:11.670> Emoto<00:00:11.970> became<00:00:12.480> terribly<00:00:12.960> interested<00:00:13.860> in

mr. Emoto became terribly interested in
the<00:00:14.370> molecular<00:00:14.730> structure<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.540> water<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the molecular structure of water and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.820 
the molecular structure of water and
what<00:00:17.279> effects<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.900> water<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> most

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
what effects it now water is the most

thought<00:00:24.000> perhaps<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.869> would<00:00:25.050> respond<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.859> non

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400

thought perhaps it would respond to non
physical<00:00:26.880> events<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.230> he<00:00:28.410> set<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.980> series<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
physical events so he set up a series of

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.299 
physical events so he set up a series of
studies<00:00:29.850> applied<00:00:30.779> mental<00:00:31.380> stimuli<00:00:31.980> and

the 50 water drops individually you

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:15.440 
the 50 water drops individually you
first<00:01:13.770> take<00:01:13.950> photographs<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.759> water<00:01:15.029> that<00:01:15.299> we

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
first take photographs of water that we

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
first take photographs of water that we
did<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.749> put<00:01:15.990> any<00:01:16.170> information<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.819> we<00:01:18.450> take

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
did not put any information then we take

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.449 
did not put any information then we take
the<00:01:18.899> water<00:01:19.109> with<00:01:19.409> information<00:01:20.099> you<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
the water with information you do the

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:24.349 
the water with information you do the
same<00:01:20.670> procedure<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.450> described<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:24.149> take

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
same procedure just described you take

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.749 
same procedure just described you take
those<00:01:24.569> before<00:01:25.109> and<00:01:25.319> after<00:01:25.920> photographs<00:01:26.159> and

those before and after photographs and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.740 
those before and after photographs and
compare<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.539> differences

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.120 

I<00:01:36.510> when<00:01:37.510> we<00:01:37.630> projected<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.290> feeling<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.830> love

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
I when we projected the feeling of love

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.890 
I when we projected the feeling of love
and<00:01:39.280> thanks<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.760> water<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.210> made<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.720> most

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
and thanks to water it made the most

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.090 
and thanks to water it made the most
beautiful<00:01:41.410> crystal<00:01:43.320> times<00:01:44.320> like<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.800> I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
beautiful crystal times like this I

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.640 
beautiful crystal times like this I
