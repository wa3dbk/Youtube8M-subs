diamond and redstone down there and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630 
diamond and redstone down there and
another<00:01:54.869> thing<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.219> cave

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
another thing is when you are in a cave

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.899 
another thing is when you are in a cave
let's<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.689> get<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
let's just get in a

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.870 
let's just get in a
and<00:01:59.420> make<00:02:00.079> sure<00:02:00.109> it<00:02:00.439> is<00:02:00.469> darker<00:02:00.979> over<00:02:01.189> here<00:02:01.399> you

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
and make sure it is darker over here you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.139 
and make sure it is darker over here you
can<00:02:02.090> actually<00:02:02.560> hit<00:02:03.560> L<00:02:03.859> on<00:02:04.310> your<00:02:04.609> keyboard<00:02:04.850> and

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
can actually hit L on your keyboard and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.580 
can actually hit L on your keyboard and
change<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.909> remove<00:02:07.909> lighting<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.410> can

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
change it to remove lighting so you can

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.309 
change it to remove lighting so you can
see<00:02:09.860> perfectly<00:02:10.099> without<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:11.239> torch<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.959> this

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
see perfectly without a torch and this

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.350 
see perfectly without a torch and this
does<00:02:12.530> work<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.920> servers<00:02:13.310> by<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.519> way<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.180> let's

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
does work on servers by the way so let's

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.460 
does work on servers by the way so let's
get<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.750> next<00:02:15.440> mod<00:02:15.890> number<00:02:16.549> three<00:02:17.299> is<00:02:18.019> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
get to the next mod number three is the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.740 
get to the next mod number three is the
