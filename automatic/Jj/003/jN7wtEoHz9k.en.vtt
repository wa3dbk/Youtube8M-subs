00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.830
 good these attached to a new video 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.170
 well finally we have new details of 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.600
 come overdrive and well you know come 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.880
 of the magazine that has given the first 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.800
 details about the title as you know 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.570
 it will be a game of insomniac games and it will be 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.559
 exclusive for xbox which we see by 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.480
 first time 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.779
 in e3 last year you have the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.730
 trailer that was seen in the description and 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.270
 now we will go on to give more details and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.520
 good basically because this was a game 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.590
 pressed for some to run and 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.120
 shoot we could say let's give the 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.520
 first details and good follow 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.110
 insomniac games have finally started 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.790
 to understand what they like and that 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.940
 it is basically reflected in the development 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.239
 of the title sunset overdrive mix to 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.950
 platforms and shot we will have the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.600
 same skills equally 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.540
 we could say it's not the perfect mix 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.650
 between both according to the magazine explains 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.650
 firearms are completely 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.360
 different from each other I guess that 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.000
 that will mean that we have a variety 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.530
 incredible and you will notice the change of one to 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.840
 the other will not be the typical game that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.360
 we have many weapons but that all 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.460
 work in the same way you have to 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.770
 accumulate style before fighting against 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.710
 some more difficult bosses basically 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.259
 for being a game of very very accumulate 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.570
 style not so much running around walls and 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.090
 such that we will have parkour 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.380
 firing without any fear the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.750
 players will be rewarded like me 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.880
 for playing fast dynamically and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.860
 without stopping basically because it will be a 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.280
 game that is very fast a style of 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.110
 very very simple game and what a good 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.610
 that is fun between 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.710
 and fast I think it 's a game that's going to 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.420
 work quite well enough has 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.510
 a very good pint for everything that is 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 is also commenting on the player 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.060
 can slide by wires both towards 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.010
 up as down then the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.570
 Japanese-inspired architecture of 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.890
 little tokyo involves a lot of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 short runs down the walls and 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.540
 buildings with strange angles 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.630
 the world will be transformed at night and 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.920
 Well, basically, we already have several 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.360
 zombie games we could say of 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.700
 monsters that by game night it 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.650
 Transforms completely and enemies 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.880
 or more dangerous or we will have a 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.709
 different game both for the day as 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.730
 at night they also say insomnia I think 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 that the players of the last 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.270
 generation have been trained to 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.340
 seek refuge and wait outside 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.610
 combat to recover and that they are 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.200
 I make you see driver 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.030
 will reward you for doing everything 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.460
 opposite and think differently a good 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.920
 attack is the best defense we could 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.300
 say it as indicated by the attack on 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.600
 attack the new defense runs by the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.940
 wall is the new system to cover and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.950
 other microsoft of absolute freedom 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.400
 insomniac to do what they want 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.680
 they also indicate that and good that they want 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.260
 bring elements like jet c3 of games 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.300
 like me this radio and toni house so that 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.070
 the experience is modern and so on 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.860
 adding depth history and 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.540
 complexity to the title are also 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.230
 plotting to make a good arcade game 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.370
 it is fun to play and 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.530
 regardless of the time you play 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.640
 it's not basically what you have 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.290
 always what but games what you 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.060
 have fun playing what you play 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.110
 if you play five minutes or five hours in 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.790
 bahrain are the next generation they 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.500
 try to jump off the screen not 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.860
 basically, we have some effects of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.720
 lighting colors and others very good and 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.209
 graphically, it will look very 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.680
 rewarded the title we could say it 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.870
 in the community you can also give your 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.879
 opinion about the future game 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.310
 the future of the game I basically want 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.049
 that has a kind of television 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.190
 we could say inside the inside of 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.920
 title in which people can 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.870
 share certain little things in bonds 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.150
 basically they want to convert the game 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.700
 in a saga or open if this game 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.159
 triumph we will have second part 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.019
 surely even third 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.190
 insomniac believes that in addition to the first 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.909
 the second year of the generation is 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.709
 when more the risk takes in the 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.810
 next generation consoles and or 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.030
 truth is the best we get a title 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.609
 new a new ip for next time 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.180
 generation is always the ideal always 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.180
 are more 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.970
 more opportunities to succeed and others not 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.940
 then, well, yes, all the games 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.680
 of fifth sixth seventh installment and it's already 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.840
 very difficult so good nothing more 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.060
 I suppose that during this June 3 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.100
 we will have more details of the game even 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.870
 a gameplay and we can see more 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
 possibilities of the title as well as not 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.810
 nothing more kids in the next video 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.810
 until the next ciao
