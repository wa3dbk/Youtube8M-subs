00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and I went down to 4.5 caster just to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.150 
and I went down to 4.5 caster just to
slow<00:01:16.440> down<00:01:17.960> slow<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.020> transitions<00:01:19.710> because

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
slow down slow down transitions because

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.670 
slow down slow down transitions because
the<00:01:20.460> whole<00:01:20.640> point<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.150> front<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.050> setup

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the whole point of this front this setup

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.650 
the whole point of this front this setup
is<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.160> to<00:01:23.280> figure<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> front<00:01:24.540> end

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
is just to figure out how the front end

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.910 
is just to figure out how the front end
work<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.230> sliding<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> car<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
work so it's like sliding the car is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
work so it's like sliding the car is
easy<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:26.880> transitioning

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
easy it's just you know transitioning

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
easy it's just you know transitioning
and<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.930> sliding<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.800> that<00:01:29.010> way<00:01:29.190> that's<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and like sliding it that way that's the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.250 
and like sliding it that way that's the
difficult<00:01:30.060> part<00:01:30.090> um<00:01:31.670> yeah<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.970> basically<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
difficult part um yeah so basically that

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.730 
difficult part um yeah so basically that
is<00:01:34.610> what<00:01:35.610> has<00:01:35.820> changed<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.170> setup<00:01:37.410> wise

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
is what has changed in the setup wise

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.970 
is what has changed in the setup wise
and<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.490> driving<00:01:38.940> wise<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.870> much<00:01:40.440> has
