00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420

on but we haven't had time to sight it
in<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.390> took<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.810> scope<00:01:37.770> covers<00:01:37.979> off<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
in and I took the scope covers off of it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.950 
in and I took the scope covers off of it
and<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.990> went<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:41.189> off<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> scope<00:01:42.540> covers

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and it went way off so the scope covers

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.310 
and it went way off so the scope covers
was<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> problem<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.070> entire<00:01:44.909> thing

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320
