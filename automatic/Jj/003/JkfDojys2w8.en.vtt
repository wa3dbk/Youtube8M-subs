00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
we had a little bit of static I figured

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.589 
we had a little bit of static I figured
out<00:00:13.230> why<00:00:13.380> when<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.070> USB<00:00:14.639> ports<00:00:14.969> wasn't<00:00:15.240> working

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
out why when my USB ports wasn't working

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.560 
out why when my USB ports wasn't working
so<00:00:16.070> there's<00:00:17.070> some<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:18.119> stuff

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
tutorial that I'll I've uploaded to my

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.720 
tutorial that I'll I've uploaded to my
channel<00:00:28.830> um<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.929> basic

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
channel um this one will be on basic

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.810 
channel um this one will be on basic
movement<00:00:32.870> basic<00:00:33.870> key<00:00:34.440> framing<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.430> basically

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
movement basic key framing so basically

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
movement basic key framing so basically
how<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> make<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.420> object<00:00:36.570> move<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.950> be

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
how to make an object move this can be

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.229 
how to make an object move this can be
done<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.370> any<00:00:38.399> object<00:00:39.000> really<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> first<00:00:41.940> we

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
done with any object really so first we

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.940 
done with any object really so first we
could<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.660> guess<00:00:42.870> good<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> start<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
could I guess good to start out with a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.240 
could I guess good to start out with a
sphere<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.480> drat<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.200> create<00:00:46.530> any<00:00:46.770> object

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sphere so just drat or create any object

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.979 
sphere so just drat or create any object
just<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> square<00:00:48.180> sphere<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> doesn't

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
just do a square sphere it doesn't

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
just do a square sphere it doesn't
matter<00:00:49.140> whatever<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.039> want<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> make<00:00:50.370> move<00:00:50.840> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
matter whatever you want to make move it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
matter whatever you want to make move it
doesn't<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.170> matter<00:00:52.320> where<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> but

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
doesn't really matter where it is but

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
doesn't really matter where it is but
down<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.539> will<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.050> main<00:00:55.469> tools

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
down here this will be the main tools

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.119 
down here this will be the main tools
that<00:00:55.949> we'll<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.070> using<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:57.090> movement<00:00:58.129> these

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
that we'll be using to do movement these

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.630 
that we'll be using to do movement these
are<00:00:59.629> these<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.870> time<00:01:01.170> frame<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.770> change<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
are these are a time frame to change the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
are these are a time frame to change the
time<00:01:02.820> usually<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.359> starts<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.899> at<00:01:04.080> 90<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.559> i

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
time usually it starts out at 90 but i

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
time usually it starts out at 90 but i
think<00:01:04.799> i<00:01:04.860> change<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> already<00:01:05.640> usually<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
think i change it already usually it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
think i change it already usually it
starts<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.140> 90<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
starts out as 90 but if you want to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.450 
starts out as 90 but if you want to
change<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.270> length<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.950> project

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
change the length of your your project

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
change the length of your your project
you<00:01:11.610> could<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.909> double<00:01:12.840> click<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you could just double click this and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
you could just double click this and
type<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.540> for<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.170> making

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
type in here for like when I'm making

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
type in here for like when I'm making
intros<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.890> usually<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.430> 300<00:01:18.390> frames

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
intros I usually just do 300 frames

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.109 
intros I usually just do 300 frames
because<00:01:19.350> 300<00:01:19.920> frames<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.340> 10<00:01:20.580> seconds<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
because 300 frames is 10 seconds and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.539 
because 300 frames is 10 seconds and
that's<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.390> pretty<00:01:22.020> good<00:01:22.170> decent<00:01:22.650> amount<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that's a pretty good decent amount of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.090 
that's a pretty good decent amount of
time<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.030> intro<00:01:24.380> mmm<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.680> um<00:01:26.659> alright<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
time for an intro mmm but um alright so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
time for an intro mmm but um alright so
what<00:01:29.100> you're<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> basic

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
what you're going to do for a basic

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.499 
what you're going to do for a basic
movement<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> basic<00:01:32.159> key<00:01:32.280> framing<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:33.299> are

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
movement and basic key framing these are

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
movement and basic key framing these are
the<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.979> my<00:01:35.009> saying<00:01:35.280> these<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.119> buttons

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the one my saying these are the buttons

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.890 
the one my saying these are the buttons
that<00:01:36.689> you'll<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.960> using<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:38.750> four<00:01:39.750> key

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
that you'll be using for four key

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
that you'll be using for four key
framing<00:01:40.140> right<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.560> nothing<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.400> happening

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
framing right now nothing is happening

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.969 
framing right now nothing is happening
in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> timeline<00:01:42.210> nothing<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.290> going<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.710> in

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
in the timeline nothing is going on in

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.990 
in the timeline nothing is going on in
the<00:01:44.100> project<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.500> nothing<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:47.040> so

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the project it's just nothing really so

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.020 
the project it's just nothing really so
if<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.070> sphere<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.340> say

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
if you want to get this sphere to say

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
if you want to get this sphere to say
move<00:01:51.299> over<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.439> during<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
move over to here like during the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.609 
move over to here like during the
project<00:01:53.310> um<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.350> at<00:01:55.590> zero

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
project um so right now we are at zero

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.490 
project um so right now we are at zero
frames<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> make<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> marker

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
frames so you have to make a marker

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.410 
frames so you have to make a marker
right<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.939> keyframe<00:02:00.390> ER

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
right here with the the keyframe ER

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.240 
right here with the the keyframe ER
that's<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> automatic<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> mean<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.189> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that's the automatic or I mean this is a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.190 
that's the automatic or I mean this is a
manual<00:02:02.520> keyframe<00:02:02.969> ER<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> automatic

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
manual keyframe ER this is the automatic

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.609 
manual keyframe ER this is the automatic
one<00:02:04.590> I'll<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.820> over<00:02:05.850> both<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> these<00:02:06.619> alright

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
one I'll go over both of these alright

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.580 
one I'll go over both of these alright
so<00:02:08.330> what<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.929> set<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> point<00:02:10.440> right

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so what you do is you set a point right

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.920 
so what you do is you set a point right
here<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.220> set<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> keyframe<00:02:11.610> right<00:02:12.000> here

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
here you set a keyframe right here

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.110 
here you set a keyframe right here
and<00:02:13.019> then<00:02:13.170> let's<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.620> move<00:02:13.859> to<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.219> 60

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and then let's just move to like 60

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.399 
and then let's just move to like 60
frames<00:02:15.359> it<00:02:15.510> doesn't<00:02:15.719> really<00:02:15.810> matter<00:02:15.989> i'm<00:02:16.260> just

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
frames it doesn't really matter i'm just

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.520 
frames it doesn't really matter i'm just
showing<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.680> how<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:16.859> do<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
showing you how to do it and then you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.940 
showing you how to do it and then you
can<00:02:19.680> drag<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.980> down<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:21.180> drag<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.950> drag

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
can drag it down just drag it to drag

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.880 
can drag it down just drag it to drag
the<00:02:23.069> sphere<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.870> right<00:02:24.870> there<00:02:25.079> and<00:02:25.349> set

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
the sphere to right there and set

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.039 
the sphere to right there and set
another<00:02:25.980> point<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.480> right<00:02:27.689> here<00:02:27.719> is<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
another point and this right here is the

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.500 
another point and this right here is the
motion<00:02:28.379> path<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.939> the<00:02:30.030> sphere<00:02:30.299> will<00:02:30.420> be

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
motion path that that the sphere will be

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.470 
motion path that that the sphere will be
moving<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.739> if<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.040> hit<00:02:32.189> a<00:02:32.219> go<00:02:33.150> all<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.359> way<00:02:33.389> to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
moving so if you hit a go all the way to

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.649 
moving so if you hit a go all the way to
the<00:02:33.719> back<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:34.560> press<00:02:35.219> play<00:02:35.450> your<00:02:36.450> speed

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
the back and then press play your speed

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.530 
the back and then press play your speed
will<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:36.930> basic<00:02:37.560> movement<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.269> set

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
will have basic movement you can set

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360 
will have basic movement you can set
more<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.900> these<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.439> can<00:02:40.560> go<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:41.040> over<00:02:41.219> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
more of these so it can go all over the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.970 
more of these so it can go all over the
 place<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.109> useful<00:02:43.530> for

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
 place this is really useful for

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.039 
 place this is really useful for
basically<00:02:44.639> anything<00:02:44.849> tutorial<00:02:45.569> or<00:02:45.750> not

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
basically anything tutorial or not

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.399 
basically anything tutorial or not
tutorials<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.919> like<00:02:47.340> intros<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:48.290> any<00:02:49.290> of

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
tutorials for like intros for any of

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.000 
tutorials for like intros for any of
that<00:02:49.530> crap<00:02:49.739> basically<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.859> want

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
that crap basically so like if you want

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.379 
that crap basically so like if you want
to<00:02:53.099> do<00:02:53.189> more<00:02:53.400> than<00:02:53.579> one<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.849> these<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.209> could

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
to do more than one of these you could

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.990 
to do more than one of these you could
set<00:02:55.200> another<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.919> 80<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.639> then<00:02:56.760> have<00:02:56.970> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
set another one at 80 and then have it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.409 
set another one at 80 and then have it
go<00:02:57.290> down<00:02:58.290> after<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.849> so<00:02:59.849> then<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:00.269> will<00:03:00.359> be

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
go down after that so then there will be

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.059 
go down after that so then there will be
sort<00:03:00.689> of<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:01.049> arc<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.620> guess<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:01.950> could

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
sort of like an arc I guess you could

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.759 
sort of like an arc I guess you could
say<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:03.510> after<00:03:03.719> that<00:03:03.989> your<00:03:04.230> your

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
say so then after that your your

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.530 
say so then after that your your
animation<00:03:05.310> will<00:03:05.579> be<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:07.159> so<00:03:08.159> on

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
animation will be like that so on

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.390 
animation will be like that so on
alright<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:09.900> i'm<00:03:09.989> going<00:03:10.169> to<00:03:10.290> delete<00:03:11.129> all

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
alright and now i'm going to delete all

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.649 
alright and now i'm going to delete all
these<00:03:11.669> keyframes<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.389> show<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.629> how<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.840> do

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
these keyframes and show you how to do

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.800 
these keyframes and show you how to do
to<00:03:15.659> do<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.959> automatic<00:03:16.709> key<00:03:16.829> framing<00:03:17.659> for<00:03:18.659> this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
to do the automatic key framing for this

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.699 
to do the automatic key framing for this
one<00:03:19.069> it<00:03:20.069> really<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.549> charts<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.000> movement

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
one it really just charts the movement

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.990 
one it really just charts the movement
on<00:03:22.709> its<00:03:22.919> own<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:24.440> like<00:03:26.150> what<00:03:27.150> am<00:03:27.269> i<00:03:27.329> doing<00:03:27.359> um<00:03:29.000> if

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
on its own so like what am i doing um if

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.199 
on its own so like what am i doing um if
you<00:03:30.120> wanted<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:31.340> start<00:03:32.340> right<00:03:32.939> here<00:03:33.169> then<00:03:34.169> um

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
you wanted to start right here then um

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.449 
you wanted to start right here then um
you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.329> drag<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.599> down<00:03:37.129> and<00:03:38.129> then<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.340> have

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
you can drag it down and then you have

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.569 
you can drag it down and then you have
your<00:03:38.489> next<00:03:38.819> point<00:03:39.030> right<00:03:39.209> here<00:03:39.239> arm<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:41.220> don't

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
your next point right here arm I don't

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.679 
your next point right here arm I don't
really<00:03:41.699> like<00:03:41.819> this<00:03:42.030> one<00:03:42.150> at<00:03:42.269> all<00:03:42.419> it's

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
really like this one at all it's

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.050 
really like this one at all it's
sometimes<00:03:43.169> inaccurate<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.949> use<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:44.340> manual

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
sometimes inaccurate I use the manual

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.849 
sometimes inaccurate I use the manual
one<00:03:45.419> but<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.109> one<00:03:46.169> is<00:03:46.409> basically<00:03:46.829> just

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
one but this one is basically just

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.679 
one but this one is basically just
sharted<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.609> its<00:03:47.819> own<00:03:47.909> like<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.329> wanted<00:03:48.569> to

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
sharted on its own like if you wanted to

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.839 
sharted on its own like if you wanted to
start<00:03:49.379> at<00:03:49.500> zero<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:49.889> basically<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:50.519> start

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
start at zero you basically just start

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.999 
start at zero you basically just start
here<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.239> then<00:03:51.299> when<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.109> move<00:03:52.259> to<00:03:52.409> here<00:03:52.680> like

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
here and then when you move to here like

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.039 
here and then when you move to here like
say<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.459> want<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.699> have<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.329> move<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.689> 60

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
say you want to have it move at 60

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.229 
say you want to have it move at 60
frames<00:03:55.079> which<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:55.979> two<00:03:56.129> seconds<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.759> then

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
frames which is two seconds you then

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.360 
frames which is two seconds you then
drag<00:03:57.509> it<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.689> where<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.989> want<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.290> move<00:03:58.439> to<00:03:58.709> so

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
drag it to where you want to move to so

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.869 
drag it to where you want to move to so
that's<00:03:59.759> your<00:03:59.879> path<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:01.489> then<00:04:02.489> after<00:04:02.790> that

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
that's your path really then after that

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.009 
that's your path really then after that
you<00:04:03.030> could<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.299> move<00:04:03.509> it<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.870> 90<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
you could like move it to like 90 and

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.129 
you could like move it to like 90 and
then<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.139> could<00:04:07.290> have<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.560> move<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:07.889> way<00:04:08.099> so

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
then you could have it move this way so

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.899 
then you could have it move this way so
then<00:04:10.139> what<00:04:10.349> you<00:04:10.439> have<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:11.400> know<00:04:11.549> another

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
then what you have is you know another

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.259 
then what you have is you know another
arc<00:04:13.159> so<00:04:14.159> that's<00:04:14.340> how<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.519> use<00:04:14.639> manual<00:04:14.909> key

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
arc so that's how to use manual key

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.089 
arc so that's how to use manual key
