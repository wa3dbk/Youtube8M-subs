00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
well played by OGJ I really like the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.680 
well played by OGJ I really like the
wrist<00:04:18.070> movements<00:04:18.489> on<00:04:18.610> her<00:04:18.730> again<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.330> thought

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
wrist movements on her again I thought

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.830 
wrist movements on her again I thought
they<00:04:20.020> they<00:04:20.980> sort<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.340> faded<00:04:21.640> out<00:04:21.730> some<00:04:22.030> TPS<00:04:22.450> and

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
they they sort of faded out some TPS and

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.050 
they they sort of faded out some TPS and
then<00:04:23.020> we're<00:04:23.200> just<00:04:23.350> able<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.680> it's<00:04:24.670> almost<00:04:24.850> like

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
then we're just able to it's almost like

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.670 
then we're just able to it's almost like
they<00:04:25.270> were<00:04:25.330> split<00:04:25.750> pushing<00:04:25.960> in<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.350> sense

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
they were split pushing in a sense

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.550 
they were split pushing in a sense
because<00:04:27.220> they<00:04:27.970> constantly<00:04:28.450> had<00:04:28.960> their<00:04:29.170> three

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
because they constantly had their three

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.440 
because they constantly had their three
course<00:04:29.890> in<00:04:30.220> three<00:04:30.520> separate<00:04:30.850> lanes<00:04:31.030> at<00:04:31.300> all

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
course in three separate lanes at all

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.200 
course in three separate lanes at all
times<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.580> they<00:04:33.580> would<00:04:33.730> just<00:04:33.880> go<00:04:34.090> around

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
times and they would just go around

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.140 
times and they would just go around
baiting<00:04:34.750> teepees<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.260> then<00:04:35.730> whichever<00:04:36.730> core

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
baiting teepees and then whichever core

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.540 
baiting teepees and then whichever core
was<00:04:37.330> left
