Locker doors that actually hinge
downwards<00:03:02.080> which<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.410> unusual<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.130> as<00:03:03.280> you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
downwards which is unusual but as you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.440 
downwards which is unusual but as you
can<00:03:03.520> see<00:03:03.670> it<00:03:03.790> makes<00:03:03.940> things<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.240> much<00:03:04.390> easier

can see it makes things so much easier
to<00:03:04.870> get<00:03:04.990> at<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:06.580> might<00:03:06.700> be<00:03:06.790> expecting<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.270> full

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
to get at you might be expecting a full

to get at you might be expecting a full
washroom<00:03:07.990> but<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.560> think<00:03:08.950> well<00:03:09.100> I've<00:03:09.220> actually

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
washroom but I think well I've actually

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.220 
washroom but I think well I've actually
been<00:03:09.580> quite<00:03:09.730> sensible<00:03:10.240> here<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.990> just<00:03:11.170> a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
been quite sensible here this is just a

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.460 
been quite sensible here this is just a
toilet<00:03:11.590> room<00:03:11.770> so<00:03:12.210> there's<00:03:13.210> a<00:03:13.300> Dometic<00:03:13.900> ceramic

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
toilet room so there's a Dometic ceramic

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.950 
toilet room so there's a Dometic ceramic
bowl<00:03:14.650> toilet<00:03:15.130> here<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:16.480> little<00:03:16.750> bit<00:03:16.870> of

bowl toilet here and a little bit of

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.380 
bowl toilet here and a little bit of
storage<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.220> space<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.700> use<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:19.120> without

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
storage but the space to use it without

storage but the space to use it without
trying<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.990> add<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.530> sink<00:03:21.190> or<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.460> shower<00:03:21.850> or
