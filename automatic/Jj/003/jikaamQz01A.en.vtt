00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.676
 (bright music) 

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:05.544
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:07.371
 These are potatoes 

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:11.564
 We will use these potatoes to make delicious Korean dishes. 

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:16.042
 This side dish is called Korean braised potato (algamja-jorim) 

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.778
 No one likes a lot of wrinkles, except on this side dish 

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:22.501
 When I saw someone doing this braised potato 

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.085
 I judge whether this person will do this dish. 

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:30.677
 Is "how many wrinkles on the potato" 

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.627
 (laughs) "Well, there are not many lines on it" 

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:37.412
 Today, I want to make a braised potato with a lot of lines and chewy. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.283
 There are many lines on the skin and sauces stewed with soy sauce. 

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:42.580
 Very soft inside 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.642
 We will make this dish using very simple materials. 

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:49.902
 The first is the potato (baby potato) 

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:53.242
 Ok, here is a pound, a pound. 

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:56.654
 I usually use two pounds, but today I will show you for demonstration. 

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.936
 I only use one pound. 

00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:04.990
 Ok, anything like this, the broken part 

00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:20.369
 Rinse it 

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:34.619
 This is my pan, 11-inch pan is better with a thicker pan. 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.544
 Add some vegetable oil to the medium heat 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.506
 Then add the potato 

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.642
 Then cover the lid 

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.933
 This recipe is very simple 

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:53.198
 In addition, these days, many of my Korean subscribers 

00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:54.426
 Watching my videos 

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:56.614
 I have Korean/English subtitles 

00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:59.006
 I hope my Korean friend 

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:00.392
 Can look over 

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:03.644
 Learn how to make delicious Korean food (laugh) 

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:08.571
 (Korean) I hope Korean subtitles can help you make delicious Korean food. 

00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:17.345
 After five minutes, I want to shake them a little 

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:24.414
 I will cook for 20 minutes in total. 

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:26.855
 So every five minutes, I will stir them once. 

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.992
 Every part will become very crisp 

00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:48.898
 Soon, the potatoes will be fully cooked 

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:53.667
 I will use a big garlic clove 

00:02:55.216 --> 00:03:00.188
 You can smash it, or you can slice it like me. 

00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:02.587
 a sheet like this 

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:06.540
 Next, let's take a look at these already cooked potatoes. 

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.761
 We use large potatoes to test if they are cooked. 

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.668
 It’s good to poke in with a toothpick, it’s easy to go through 

00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:15.967
 Have you already cooked to see their skin? 

00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:18.021
 Looks crisp 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.203
 We need to add some salty stuff 

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:24.008
 I will use soy sauce 

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:29.011
 one two Three 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.511
 Then lower the temperature of the fire 

00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:37.659
 I use soy sauce and this rice syrup (mulyeot) 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.986
 If you don't have rice syrup, you can use brown sugar. 

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:45.272
 Or white sugar but syrup will increase his luster 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.193
 Three tablespoons 

00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:49.375
 Then add garlic 

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.461
 When we enter all the soy sauce 

00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:01.196
 You will see more lines appearing 

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:05.659
 We will cook it with medium heat 

00:04:21.023 --> 00:04:22.598
 Become more shiny 

00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:24.618
 Use a small fire to cook 

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:29.257
 Tian Ah, beautiful and shiny! Turn off the fire 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.573
 Next, I want to add a drop of sesame oil. 

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:35.062
 May I? (laugh) 

00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:48.830
 Sprinkle with some sesame seeds 

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.202
 If you want to hold a Korean party 

00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:08.988
 You can prepare this as an appetizer 

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:13.210
 Really, I can demonstrate to you a very nice idea. 

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:18.009
 Look at this beautiful, right? 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.803
 I have done this before, everyone likes it. 

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:23.583
 "What is this?" I replied: "This is a potato!" 

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:27.126
 Korean braised potato everyone said: "Wow, it's really beautiful!" 

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.717
 Everyone likes it very much. 

00:05:28.717 --> 00:05:30.830
 This is just a side dish 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.559
 How do you use these sauces? 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.053
 You don't have to throw them away 

00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:37.629
 You can cut some kimchi and add some warm rice. 

00:05:37.632 --> 00:05:41.071
 Put it on the stove and stir it with hot sauce 

00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:42.348
 Made into Korean bibimbap 

00:05:42.348 --> 00:05:43.866
 very perfect 

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:47.052
 Once again, there are many lines 

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:49.526
 Look, aren't you? 

00:05:49.526 --> 00:05:53.541
 Yes, you look a lot like a turtle shell (laugh) 

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:56.496
 It reminds me of the tortoise shell (laugh) 

00:05:56.496 --> 00:05:59.180
 Ok, so hot 

00:06:02.323 --> 00:06:03.834
 Ok 

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:09.363
 I like this dish very much. If I like this dish, you will like it too. (laugh) 

00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:14.017
 The taste of the skin is irresistible 

00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:20.168
 Well, I used to make this lunch as a child. 

00:06:20.168 --> 00:06:23.641
 When I make a lunch box, I will make this braised potato (algamja-jorim) 

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:28.088
 My child likes to shine before lunch time. 

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:30.511
 The potato is still shining when they open the lunch box. 

00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:34.921
 Today, we made a braised potato (algamja-jorim), I hope you like my recipe. 

00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:38.078
 See you next time! Hey!
