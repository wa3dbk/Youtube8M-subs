00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
all right now let's learn the Jason

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
all right now let's learn the Jason
Williams<00:00:36.420> elbow<00:00:36.989> pass<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.920> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
Williams elbow pass all right so this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.560 
Williams elbow pass all right so this
move<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> pretty<00:00:38.700> dangerous<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:39.390> day<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
move is pretty dangerous in one day you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.970 
move is pretty dangerous in one day you
might<00:00:39.780> not<00:00:39.960> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> try<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.530> actual<00:00:40.829> game

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
might not want to try in an actual game

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.530 
might not want to try in an actual game
because<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.489> coach<00:00:41.700> might<00:00:41.910> bench<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> for

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
because your coach might bench you for

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.910 
because your coach might bench you for
it<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.840> works<00:00:42.989> best<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.350> transition<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it and it works best in transition and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.500 
it and it works best in transition and
that's<00:00:43.980> where<00:00:44.190> Jason<00:00:44.340> Williams<00:00:44.640> uses<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.329> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that's where Jason Williams uses it so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.670 
that's where Jason Williams uses it so

number<00:00:54.390> two<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.110> wrap<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> ball

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
number two you want to wrap the ball

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
number two you want to wrap the ball
around<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.100> back<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.550> elbow<00:00:56.850> height<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
around your back at elbow height and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
around your back at elbow height and
look<00:00:57.780> off<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> opposite<00:00:58.680> direction<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
look off in the opposite direction the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
look off in the opposite direction the
look<00:00:59.579> off<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.149> important<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
look off is really important because it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
look off is really important because it
gets<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> defender<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.500> slide<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.070> open<00:01:02.430> a

lane<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.000> trailer<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> last<00:01:03.960> really

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
lane for the trailer and the last really

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170 
lane for the trailer and the last really
important<00:01:04.650> key<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> palm<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.640> hand

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
important key is the palm of your hand

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
facing forward towards the basket this

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.969 
facing forward towards the basket this
ensures<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> ball<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.500> hit<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> hard

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
direction and this also increases

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.679
