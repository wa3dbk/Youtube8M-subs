00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:13.139
 Just order them retro and who loves technology Gothic 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.809
 4 is protected should not shut down now anyway 

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:20.010
 Opposite because behind Super Meat Boy hides in the mishmash pearl 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.329
 special kind 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.189
 First released on Biggs Box Live Arcade, there is that 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.459
 Crazy 2d jump 'n' run the train to red the slimy contract 

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:31.699
 For the renter now wanted to go via Steam for the PC and for just 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.079
 for ten euros 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.909
 And this investment is worthwhile why we give the answer 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.699
 This shows the story of Super Meat Boy is quickly told 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.460
 Meat Boy remained his player and if the player never loves wanted 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.330
 but then there is still Doctor Fetus somehow none of the dearest what the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.330
 Of course not so great 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.770
 Meat Boy beaten badly and a door abducted 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.900
 that is as straightforward as gloriously clichÃ©d and sprayed through the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530
 idiosyncratic look a very special charm 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 Also that there is no voice disturbs me the pantomime like / Iko 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 Mohr more than makes up for this shortcoming 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.270
 SC 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.630
 In its basic structure, Super Meat Boy is a classic jump 'n' run of the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.920
 Brand Super Mario 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 just with a little refinement 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.850
 the little hero can stick to walls and slide down 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.880
 jump off and son perform such acrobatic performance that the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.619
 Fighter Mario of Envy pale is likely to use the Kiev properties 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.049
 the game for countless hopping and knobby shots one of which is cool 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.600
 is the other, for example, we have to pass through obstacles 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 start to crumble first and then slip through 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.490
 or we have to transport us by conveyor belts but have to 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.510
 look out hellishly 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.490
 Elsewhere, readers are dealing with Neat Boll 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.380
 Just touch the ball 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.830
 It gets even trickier when the things even move and our heroes 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.829
 on step and step and jump 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.680
 Community also the steering rockets in the mid project under no circumstances stop 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.739
 may 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.170
 and even by Werz grandiose Knobel classic Portel have become the 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.509
 Developers borrowed so many ideas year ago 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:29.489
 but no matter what it takes to master in the game are some and good reflexes the a 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.749
 and o 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.509
 For example, here we have to overcome all obstacles as quickly as possible 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.959
 Crumble around in time on the bottom of the platform 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.599
 to be able to land 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.879
 in another level, our game gradually steals the solid one 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.769
 Underground therefore try to climb up as fast as possible without 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.029
 slipping sledding fatally to land the tops 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.139
 Unfortunately, Super Meat Boy is only partially expanding 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.699
 Simple tasks like this one in turn are constantly going on with Bock heavy off it 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:01.019
 definitely not a shame a level 50 times more expensive so do not give it a try 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.209
 You have to master it before you master it until you feel it all the more 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 great 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:15.979
 Especially as the hilarious Replay function shows with countless Meat Boy Klose 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.099
 how many times and how much in our felt three dozen try to go wrong 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.349
 has gone 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.409
 Also motivating are the countless grounds distributed 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.499
 Secrets the hidden mission, for example, along with new characters 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.499
 unlock 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.229
 once mastered 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.319
 we can own the guys by the way own properties also in 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.519
 campaign and solve Pretzl in a different way 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.249
 this increases the replay value of the already around 50 levels already enormously 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:43.360
 successful game 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 by a multiple 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.950
 the controls work well with both the keyboard and the keyboard 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.239
 However, we still had some of the latter on the stick like gold on his sticks 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.339
 Tack more precisely than with digital fasting 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.789
 and that is also necessary because as I said at the time the game no mistakes and 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:05.389
 Often places us before tasks the Binger reflexes and a lot of frustration assistance 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:06.569
 require 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.949
 Graphically, Super Meat Boy presents little spectacular but stands 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:10.739
 coherent 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.029
 Although the levels have details lighting or modern effects 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.609
 miss but the overall picture convinces nevertheless 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.069
 especially when playing things optics is very varied and often through 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.180
 cool ideas like these surprised 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.620
 Even the bosses are lovingly decorated spraying Chamber preserve 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.499
 advises Roufflair pure 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.269
 With such a technique, I do not even have to mention that 

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.840
 previously with Boll running on a calculator 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.070
 for liquid play further 1-format computer as processor and 512 megabyte 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.070
 random access memory 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.699
 sorry fans com to this consistent, the Klever presented the page super 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.230
 Meat boy not around and even beginners should try the small one 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.430
 at least when they have strong nerves and to get away from the philosopher 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.569
 let his software be taken care of alone 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.469
 14 euros have not been so good for a long time and so much fun has been invested
