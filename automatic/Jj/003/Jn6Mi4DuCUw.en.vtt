00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.590
 a driverless truck is developing 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.029
 Belarus using space 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.339
 drone technology 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.170
 dump truck as calculated as 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.580
 designers to press 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.830
 competitors in the global market today 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.439
 Alexey was on the BelAZ 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.139
 for the gate of the plant here first 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.390
 then it is not enough even before the beginning of autumn 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.789
 the idea of ​​designers 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.120
 you can manage it without leaving 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.590
 and in offices to control 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.670
 the miner's car will be using a unique 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.240
 laser technology it will allow not to work 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 only in conditions of poor visibility but also 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.290
 smoke while she's in the office 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.440
 driver special control panel 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.730
 there will be a pen and a pedal all as 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.800
 real cabinet only deleted 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.320
 new dump truck will show on 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.510
 international exhibition in Hannover 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.430
 after which the mass will begin 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.079
 production interest in the new product is already in 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.989
 quarries of northern Yakutia, Kuzbass 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.659
 Bosnia and Herzegovina mining truck with 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.070
 autonomous control before 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.930
 in the world created only once 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 so the Belarusian car in its own way 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.530
 will create an American equivalent 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.110
 decent competition 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.590
 sample we are planning to manufacture to our 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.530
 estimated based on our marital 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.809
 130 dump trucks 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:05.710
 tons 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.880
 due to the fact that it will be possible only three 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.340
 campanella in order to more 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.060
 rationally conduct it 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.280
 loading 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.940
 we hope to raise it 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.660
 load capacity 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.170
 know it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.010
 yes about a thousand tons 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.040
 BelAZ is just over a third of the career market 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.580
 dump trucks in the world 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 to keep a high place not 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.260
 lose market advantage 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.730
 design bureau is constantly updating 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.800
 model range last tested 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.590
 new models of dump trucks are passing 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.270

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.250
 no limit 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 12 steps 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.990
 this giant payload 320 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.180

 plans from designers on 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 next year a car that can take 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 onboard listen payload payload 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550
