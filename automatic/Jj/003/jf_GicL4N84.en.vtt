light<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.719> medium<00:00:40.870> light<00:00:41.320> would<00:00:41.559> be<00:00:41.710> best<00:00:41.920> for

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
light to medium light would be best for

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.940 
light to medium light would be best for
this<00:00:42.730> because<00:00:43.510> it's<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.870> lot<00:00:44.079> lighter<00:00:44.469> so<00:00:44.890> you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
this because it's a lot lighter so you

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.080 
this because it's a lot lighter so you
if<00:00:45.280> you're<00:00:45.629> african-american<00:00:46.629> or<00:00:47.559> Latino<00:00:48.520> or

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
some Asians who are a little darker then

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.950 
some Asians who are a little darker then
this<00:00:53.320> will<00:00:53.559> not<00:00:53.590> work<00:00:53.770> good<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.210> that's<00:00:55.629> kind

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960

of<00:07:22.280> an<00:07:22.550> ashy<00:07:23.680> color<00:07:24.680> to<00:07:25.100> it<00:07:25.280> so<00:07:26.210> I<00:07:26.920> think<00:07:27.920> I<00:07:28.760> mean

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 
of an ashy color to it so I think I mean

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.180 
of an ashy color to it so I think I mean
it's<00:07:29.720> good<00:07:30.140> if<00:07:30.290> you<00:07:30.380> have<00:07:30.500> a<00:07:30.530> little<00:07:30.710> effort

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.190 
it's good if you have a little effort

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.670 
it's good if you have a little effort
and<00:07:31.400> a<00:07:31.460> little<00:07:31.550> time<00:07:31.880> to<00:07:32.120> mix<00:07:32.360> it<00:07:32.600> and<00:07:32.780> whatever

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
and a little time to mix it and whatever

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.140 
and a little time to mix it and whatever
but<00:07:34.400> I<00:07:34.430> think<00:07:34.550> it's<00:07:34.820> worth<00:07:34.970> your<00:07:35.000> money

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
but I think it's worth your money

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150 
but I think it's worth your money
because<00:07:35.540> if<00:07:35.960> it's<00:07:36.140> gonna<00:07:36.290> improve<00:07:36.650> your<00:07:36.710> skin

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 
because if it's gonna improve your skin

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.100 
because if it's gonna improve your skin
and<00:07:37.930> I<00:07:39.220> don't<00:07:40.220> know<00:07:40.520> I<00:07:40.850> mean<00:07:41.060> I<00:07:41.390> guess<00:07:41.960> it

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
and I don't know I mean I guess it

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.640 
and I don't know I mean I guess it
