00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
for me I think Tiger exceeded all of our

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.750 
for me I think Tiger exceeded all of our
expectations<00:00:54.920> kabir<00:00:55.920> worked<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.280> hard<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.449> film<00:00:57.840> working<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.040> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
I think film working to that kind of a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.770 
I think film working to that kind of a
magnitude<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.790> not<00:01:00.120> even<00:01:00.270> something<00:01:00.510> we

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
magnitude was not even something we

thought would happen

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640
