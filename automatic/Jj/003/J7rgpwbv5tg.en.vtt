00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi to all the players who follow me on 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 Today's video has a bit strange because me 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.389
 I invented it in essence I want 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.389
 give you the reasoning method that you will have to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.860
 hold a game when analyzing network 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.109
 through a replay or even during the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.320
 game to figure out if it is 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 good or bad is because this 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 triad I want to talk about is the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.570
 link due to development effect we mean 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 as the reason that leads us to cause 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.009
 get a kill a goal or 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 any form of advantage o 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.620
 quantifiable disadvantage in gold as 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.620
 effect we will mean the direct result 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.649
 of this cause and as a development instead 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.410
 its continued during the game 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.469
 for example it causes me already angler gambuto 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.300
 plain effect my you plain air trend 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.370
 and the development kill 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.379
 my plain air smooth bubble lane and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 gets tower and other advantage for the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.780
 my team 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.520
 from now on when you analyze a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 your replay to see what you have 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.789
 wrong or when climbing watching 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.159
 a stream 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.810
 keep in mind what happens and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.479
 try to find this logical connection 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.400
 cause developmental effect 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.560
 ignoring the effect that directly 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.049
 the easiest part to distinguish 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.060
 like those who take a target of kg 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.869
 is immediately announced by 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.549
 game 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 from now on and I want you to watch i 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.799
 your replays every now and then 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.119
 analyzed with this critical eye 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.650
 identified the effect that created them 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.600
 a situation of advantage of 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.030
 disadvantage go deeper and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.100
 analyzed in the causes and make a case has 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.680
 how good this has the effect 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.689
 brought an actual result seems 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.939
 ridiculous but there are games where you can 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.930
 be sure of eighty percent of the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.540
 winner 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.310
 instead, from the minute 5 or 6 they are instead 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.649
 matches where the chance of victory 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.390
 continues to fluctuate around 50 per 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.750
 one hundred 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.180
 and immediately after a badly arranged file or 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.340
 goal called bad the match is 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.470
 definitely closed even if maybe 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.510
 the nexus he will have only ten minutes later 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.670
 one of the things I like best about 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.950
 league of legends is that unlike 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.350
 how luck is commonly thought 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.270
 it really matters little when we can't 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.290
 to get a church for a few hp 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.420
 missing 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.920
 we must not attribute it to the whole case 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.530
 this depends on miss errors 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.430
 calculation or as you would say now of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.260
 judgment 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.690
 to complicate this criterion of yours 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 examining a game from now on you are 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.489
 more critical also on the factor and of the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.920
 objects because it is an object is done 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.230
 first because it is done after why 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.489
 now he is deciding to bet defense is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.100
 rather than for years 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.260
 be objective and try to understand what 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.100
 would have changed if you had chosen one 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.019
 other object 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.660
 if you had made a bar on instead of an i 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.760
 tar and give yourself the answers have nests 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.769
 a guardian angel or not really changes the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 result all this will serve to improve 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.000
 your efficiency and yours 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.790
 avoiding calls during the game 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.329
 so I find the end of this useless 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 torture 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.579
 this last video of the series is 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.590
 already the penultimate was very theoretical 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.900
 I am less aware, however, sooner or later I had to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.600
 do it learned to analyze yours 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.269
 replay be critical and trust is a 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.040
 exercise that you need a lot to see again 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.440
 play a game and maybe it is 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.090
 more important than the game itself 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.220
 the results of this exercise there 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.290
 will put a little but will come out of the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.590
 I guarantee and as always good genoa 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.590
 all
