00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
be for the camera flash because it does

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.890

two are just one for video which is just

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.340 
two are just one for video which is just

on the regular component cables just the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.890 
on the regular component cables just the
yellow<00:04:37.500> one<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.520> you've<00:04:38.910> seen<00:04:39.180> all<00:04:39.570> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
yellow one so you've seen all the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.570 
yellow one so you've seen all the
shenanigans<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.860> goes<00:04:41.070> with<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.280> we<00:04:41.460> took

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
shenanigans that goes with it we took

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.939 
shenanigans that goes with it we took
out<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.789> battery<00:04:42.120> michaelis<00:04:42.900> be<00:04:43.110> got<00:04:43.860> the

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
out the battery michaelis be got the

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.360 
out the battery michaelis be got the
remote<00:04:44.100> here<00:04:45.500> let's<00:04:46.500> dig<00:04:46.830> in<00:04:46.979> this<00:04:47.130> some<00:04:47.340> of

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
remote here let's dig in this some of

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:55.300 
remote here let's dig in this some of
this<00:04:47.520> packaging<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.300> guess<00:04:49.520> slice<00:04:50.520> into<00:04:50.729> that

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.550 

ok<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:57.150> is<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.419> thickest<00:04:57.870> instruction

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
ok this is the thickest instruction

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.260 
ok this is the thickest instruction
manual<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.190> have<00:04:59.610> ever<00:04:59.910> seen<00:05:00.410> check<00:05:01.410> this<00:05:01.530> out<00:05:01.710> I

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
manual I have ever seen check this out I

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.610 
manual I have ever seen check this out I
don't<00:05:03.270> think<00:05:03.360> I<00:05:03.750> will<00:05:03.810> ever<00:05:04.050> get<00:05:04.320> around<00:05:04.500> to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
don't think I will ever get around to

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
reading that but that is the heat that

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.200 
reading that but that is the heat that
is<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.270> huge<00:05:06.630> instruction<00:05:07.440> manual<00:05:07.880> this<00:05:08.880> is<00:05:09.030> for
