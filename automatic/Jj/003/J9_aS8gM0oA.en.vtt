00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.410
 breaks through 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.860
 I can easily prove it to you 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.820
 lest she break through together we 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.700
 Together we decide what we will do 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.810

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.810

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.050
 Tomorrow we could break through again. 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.050
