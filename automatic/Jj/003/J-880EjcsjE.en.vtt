instead<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> long<00:00:50.969> ones<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:51.989> um

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
instead of the long ones because then um

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
instead of the long ones because then um
you<00:00:53.250> go<00:00:53.399> through<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> faster<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
mean like if you have a full size one

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
mean like if you have a full size one
you<00:00:56.820> don't<00:00:56.879> go<00:00:57.090> through<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.510> fast<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> got
