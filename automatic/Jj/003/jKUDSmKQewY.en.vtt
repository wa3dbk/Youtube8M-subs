going to do is we're going to take our

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.369 
going to do is we're going to take our
clipper<00:00:09.789> column<00:00:10.119> and<00:00:10.450> we're<00:00:10.990> going<00:00:11.110> to<00:00:11.139> take

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
clipper column and we're going to take

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.379 
clipper column and we're going to take
our<00:00:11.530> large<00:00:11.680> scissor<00:00:12.370> and<00:00:12.969> we're<00:00:13.240> going<00:00:13.360> to

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
our large scissor and we're going to

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.249 
our large scissor and we're going to
blend<00:00:13.690> the<00:00:13.870> bangs<00:00:14.110> into<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:14.799> back<00:00:15.119> so<00:00:16.119> as<00:00:16.570> we

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
blend the bangs into the back so as we

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.839 
blend the bangs into the back so as we
learned<00:00:17.500> in<00:00:17.710> the<00:00:17.770> basic<00:00:18.130> techniques<00:00:18.520> video

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
learned in the basic techniques video

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.050 
learned in the basic techniques video
for<00:00:19.270> scissor<00:00:19.509> over<00:00:19.599> comb<00:00:20.220> we're<00:00:21.220> going<00:00:21.369> to<00:00:21.430> use

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
for scissor over comb we're going to use

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.310 
for scissor over comb we're going to use
the<00:00:22.210> front<00:00:22.480> portion<00:00:22.750> of<00:00:22.930> that<00:00:23.080> scissor<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
the front portion of that scissor and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.689 
the front portion of that scissor and
we're<00:00:26.500> going<00:00:26.619> to<00:00:26.710> blend<00:00:26.920> that<00:00:27.130> hair<00:00:27.340> from<00:00:27.519> the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
we're going to blend that hair from the

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.390 
we're going to blend that hair from the
front<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.570> back<00:00:28.720> we're<00:00:29.710> going<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:29.949> hit<00:00:30.279> it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
front to the back we're going to hit it

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.130 
front to the back we're going to hit it
in<00:00:30.490> two<00:00:30.640> different<00:00:30.759> directions<00:00:31.019> we're<00:00:32.019> going

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
in two different directions we're going

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.860 
in two different directions we're going
to<00:00:32.199> come<00:00:32.320> in<00:00:32.559> this<00:00:32.680> direction<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.750> we're

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
to come in this direction and then we're

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.310 
to come in this direction and then we're
going<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.080> come<00:00:35.290> from<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.620> front<00:00:35.769> forward

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
going to come from the front forward

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.810 
going to come from the front forward
okay<00:00:38.320> now<00:00:39.010> we're<00:00:39.190> going<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.339> switch<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.640> our

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
okay now we're going to switch to our

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.880 
okay now we're going to switch to our
one<00:00:40.089> blade<00:00:40.360> which<00:00:40.870> is<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.199> next<00:00:41.409> size<00:00:41.589> down

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
one blade which is the next size down

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.460 
one blade which is the next size down
from<00:00:42.159> the<00:00:42.280> 1a<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.989> we're<00:00:44.110> going<00:00:44.229> to<00:00:44.260> do<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
from the 1a and we're going to do the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.890 
from the 1a and we're going to do the
same<00:00:44.680> thing<00:00:44.979> what<00:00:45.970> you<00:00:46.089> want<00:00:46.330> remembers

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
same thing what you want remembers

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.840 
same thing what you want remembers
between<00:00:47.290> each<00:00:47.530> blade<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.250> want<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> little<00:00:48.699> bit

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
between each blade you want a little bit

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.820 
between each blade you want a little bit
of<00:00:48.909> separation<00:00:49.299> a<00:00:49.750> quarter<00:00:50.140> of<00:00:50.229> an<00:00:50.320> inch<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.799> a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
of separation a quarter of an inch to a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.520 
of separation a quarter of an inch to a
half<00:00:51.100> an<00:00:51.280> inch<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:52.629> you<00:00:52.839> work<00:00:52.989> down<00:00:53.199> through

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
half an inch if you work down through

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.530 
half an inch if you work down through
all<00:00:53.619> your<00:00:53.799> blades<00:00:54.100> but<00:00:54.400> you<00:00:54.519> keep<00:00:54.699> going<00:00:55.000> up<00:00:55.119> up

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
all your blades but you keep going up up

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.450 
all your blades but you keep going up up
just<00:00:55.989> as<00:00:56.140> high<00:00:56.320> you're<00:00:56.890> still<00:00:57.100> going<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.250> wind

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
just as high you're still going to wind

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.579 
just as high you're still going to wind
up<00:00:57.610> with<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.790> line<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:59.019> now<00:00:59.170> we're<00:00:59.379> going<00:00:59.530> to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
up with a line so now we're going to

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.859 
up with a line so now we're going to
drop<00:00:59.769> down<00:00:59.830> our<00:01:00.280> next<00:01:00.519> blade<00:01:00.760> size<00:01:01.089> we're

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869 
drop down our next blade size we're

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:07.460 
drop down our next blade size we're
doing<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.290> same<00:01:02.500> fading<00:01:02.979> motion

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960 

you<00:01:07.980> want<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.280> make<00:01:08.430> sure<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.790> you're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you want to make sure that you're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.670 
you want to make sure that you're
leaving<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.450> quarter<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.080> inch<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> half

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
leaving that quarter of an inch to half

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.290 
leaving that quarter of an inch to half
an<00:01:10.800> inch<00:01:10.950> between<00:01:11.160> blaze<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.910> you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
an inch between blaze so you have that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.020 
an inch between blaze so you have that
separation<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.890> separation<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.820> what

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
separation and that separation is what

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
separation and that separation is what
causes<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.320> tapering<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.040> fading<00:01:17.490> effect<00:01:19.070> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
causes the tapering or fading effect so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
causes the tapering or fading effect so
at<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.310> very<00:01:20.340> end<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
at the very end when you get about a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.550 
at the very end when you get about a
quarter<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:21.930> inch<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.230> half<00:01:22.350> an<00:01:22.470> inch

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
quarter of an inch or a half an inch

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
quarter of an inch or a half an inch
away<00:01:22.830> very<00:01:23.040> slowly<00:01:23.520> pull<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.850> teeth<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
away very slowly pull the teeth of that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.640 
away very slowly pull the teeth of that
blade<00:01:24.630> away<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.840> how<00:01:27.960> slow<00:01:28.230> I<00:01:28.260> do<00:01:28.410> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
blade away and this is how slow I do it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
blade away and this is how slow I do it
in<00:01:28.740> real<00:01:28.890> life<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.670> talked<00:01:29.940> about<00:01:30.060> before

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
in real life as we talked about before

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.850 
in real life as we talked about before
and<00:01:30.840> we'll<00:01:30.960> talk<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.290> throughout<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and we'll talk about throughout the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
and we'll talk about throughout the
series<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.430> haircut<00:01:32.760> lessons<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.960> slower<00:01:34.260> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
series of haircut lessons the slower you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340 
series of haircut lessons the slower you
work<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> easier<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.030> work<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.630> faster<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
work and easier your work the faster and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
work and easier your work the faster and
more<00:01:37.380> accurate<00:01:37.920> you're<00:01:38.070> working<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> final

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
more accurate you're working a final

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
more accurate you're working a final
step<00:01:39.060> we're<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.050> use<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.560> beard<00:01:41.100> trimmer

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
step we're going to use a beard trimmer

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.040 
step we're going to use a beard trimmer
this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.119> how<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.420> call<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> super

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
this is how they call this a super

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.840 
this is how they call this a super
shaver<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:44.160> is<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.550> gets

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
shaver and what this does is this gets

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719 
shaver and what this does is this gets
it<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:46.020> close<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> straight<00:01:46.950> razor<00:01:47.190> so

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it just as close as a straight razor so

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.859
