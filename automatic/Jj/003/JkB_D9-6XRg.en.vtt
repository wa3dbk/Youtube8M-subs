00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
dinner plate for most people I think

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.419 
dinner plate for most people I think
that<00:00:25.539> with<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.990> factory<00:00:26.470> food<00:00:26.650> industry<00:00:27.160> the

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:27.429 
that with the factory food industry the

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.359 
that with the factory food industry the
butchery<00:00:27.880> has<00:00:28.300> almost<00:00:29.169> become<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:29.740> factory<00:00:30.339> job

and<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:31.239> think<00:00:31.539> that<00:00:31.720> there's<00:00:31.929> been<00:00:31.989> a<00:00:32.140> backlash

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
and I think that there's been a backlash

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.130 
and I think that there's been a backlash
to<00:00:33.010> that<00:00:33.040> and<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.670> think<00:00:34.000> that<00:00:34.150> there<00:00:34.300> are<00:00:34.330> some

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
to that and I think that there are some

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.230 
to that and I think that there are some
really<00:00:35.320> great<00:00:35.530> artisan<00:00:36.040> butchers<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.820> are
