running<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.420> collect<00:03:42.720> data<00:03:42.930> which<00:03:43.470> was<00:03:44.160> very

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
running to collect data which was very

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.610

useful<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:45.120> me<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.660> understand<00:03:46.380> more<00:03:46.560> about

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
useful for me to understand more about

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.780 
useful for me to understand more about
engines<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.550> also<00:03:47.820> for<00:03:48.420> data<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.550> analysis<00:03:50.550> I

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
engines and also for data and analysis I

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.440 
engines and also for data and analysis I
did<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.810> couple<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.290> lesson<00:03:52.800> with<00:03:52.950> Lloyd<00:03:53.190> on

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450

did a couple of lesson with Lloyd on
boots<00:03:54.450> pharmacy<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.590> I've<00:03:55.860> already<00:03:56.160> seen<00:03:56.400> the

boots pharmacy and I've already seen the
achievement<00:03:57.120> because<00:03:57.240> I<00:03:57.630> got<00:03:58.020> my<00:03:58.230> employment

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
achievement because I got my employment

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.199 
achievement because I got my employment
a<00:03:59.959> year<00:04:00.959> before<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.320> graduate<00:04:01.920> I'm<00:04:02.670> going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.060> do

a year before I graduate I'm going to do

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.140 
a year before I graduate I'm going to do
a<00:04:03.240> master's<00:04:03.810> degree<00:04:03.840> next<00:04:04.680> year<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.880> think

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
a master's degree next year and I think

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.290 
a master's degree next year and I think
this<00:04:06.360> course<00:04:06.720> has<00:04:06.930> given<00:04:07.290> me<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.440> very<00:04:08.300> great
