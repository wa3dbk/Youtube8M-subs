00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
made for me so as you can tell this one

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.740 
made for me so as you can tell this one
is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.560> Cayenne<00:00:26.130> ish<00:00:26.519> color<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.150> guess<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.599> can

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
is a Cayenne ish color I guess you can

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.380 
is a Cayenne ish color I guess you can
call<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:29.039> i'll<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.340> using<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.760> for

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
call it and so i'll be using that for

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
call it and so i'll be using that for
the<00:00:31.070> obviously<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> Cayenne<00:00:32.610> backgrounds

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.319 
everybody I've explained who and so what
I'm<00:01:51.479> thinking<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.869> doing<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.320> having<00:01:52.560> two<00:01:53.520> per

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329

I'm thinking of doing is having two per
week<00:01:54.600> two<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.520> two<00:01:56.520> rounds<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.969> guess<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
week two of two rounds I guess so I

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.520 
week two of two rounds I guess so I
don't<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:01.710> will<00:02:01.950> judge<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.869> but<00:02:03.869> uh<00:02:03.899> yeah

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
don't know we will judge it but uh yeah

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
work out well and what I'm thinking for

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.660

the<00:02:30.659> second<00:02:31.170> round<00:02:31.319> since<00:02:32.010> they're<00:02:32.189> only<00:02:32.340> be

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the second round since they're only be

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.589 
the second round since they're only be
what<00:02:33.239> does<00:02:33.359> that<00:02:33.510> should<00:02:33.959> be<00:02:34.049> like<00:02:35.269> 14<00:02:36.269> people

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
what does that should be like 14 people

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.080 
what does that should be like 14 people
i<00:02:36.689> don't<00:02:36.750> know<00:02:36.930> i'm<00:02:37.109> i<00:02:37.469> don't<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.579> so<00:02:38.609> it's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
i don't know i'm i don't think so it's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.629 
i don't know i'm i don't think so it's
something<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.750> can't<00:02:40.109> count<00:02:40.290> obviously<00:02:40.859> but<00:02:41.370> I

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
something I can't count obviously but I

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.459 
something I can't count obviously but I
think<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.359> would<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:42.629> good<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.870> whoever's

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
think it would be good if whoever's

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.920 
think it would be good if whoever's
playing<00:02:43.620> who<00:02:43.889> bowls<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.819> shortly<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
playing who bowls and shortly is that a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.129 
playing who bowls and shortly is that a
maid<00:02:46.620> commentary<00:02:47.189> specific<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> topic<00:02:48.930> on

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
each round is I just think that it would

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.289 
each round is I just think that it would
be<00:02:51.750> good<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.319> see<00:02:52.769> other<00:02:53.340> people's<00:02:53.730> takes<00:02:54.030> on

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980

stuff I would recommend going and seeing
it<00:03:11.250> Sansa<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.329> me<00:03:12.449> I<00:03:12.719> went<00:03:13.379> it<00:03:13.469> like<00:03:13.650> 11<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.099> the

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
it Sansa for me I went it like 11 in the

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.159 
it Sansa for me I went it like 11 in the
morning<00:03:14.219> or<00:03:14.669> whatever<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.359> it<00:03:15.480> only<00:03:15.569> cost<00:03:15.900> six

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
morning or whatever so it only cost six

morning or whatever so it only cost six
bucks<00:03:16.290> per<00:03:16.680> ticket<00:03:16.919> so<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> thought<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.579> was<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
bucks per ticket so I thought that was a

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.449 
bucks per ticket so I thought that was a
really<00:03:17.849> good<00:03:18.180> deal<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:19.009> yeah<00:03:20.009> so<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.430> was

really good deal and yeah so that was

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.640 
really good deal and yeah so that was
kind<00:03:20.699> of<00:03:20.729> just<00:03:20.939> a<00:03:21.090> random<00:03:21.419> but<00:03:21.930> throw<00:03:22.379> in<00:03:22.530> there
