there<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.110> breathtaking<00:01:25.909> ability

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
there this is a breathtaking ability

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
there this is a breathtaking ability
with<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> ability<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.600> spend<00:01:27.900> focus<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.740> make

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
with the ability to spend focus to make

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.940 
with the ability to spend focus to make
all<00:01:29.100> his<00:01:29.340> hits<00:01:29.630> become<00:01:30.630> critical<00:01:31.079> hits<00:01:31.290> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
all his hits become critical hits so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399 
all his hits become critical hits so
what's<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> application<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.409> obviously

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
what's the application of this obviously

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.590 
what's the application of this obviously
we<00:01:34.650> need<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.460> keep<00:01:35.610> our<00:01:35.790> focus<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> ready

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
we need to keep our focus at the ready

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.100 
we need to keep our focus at the ready
to<00:01:36.840> make<00:01:37.020> make<00:01:37.710> 100%<00:01:38.549> use<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.880> disability<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to make make 100% use of disability so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.690 
to make make 100% use of disability so
unless<00:01:40.439> our<00:01:40.590> target<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.100> shielded<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
unless our target is shielded and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
unless our target is shielded and
obviously<00:01:42.420> need<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.229> dice

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
obviously need to get as much dice

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
obviously need to get as much dice
against<00:01:44.159> our<00:01:44.280> foe<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.790> possible<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
against our foe as possible with the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.139 
against our foe as possible with the
ability<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> use<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> target<00:01:46.890> lock<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.759> how<00:01:48.090> do

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
ability to use a target lock so how do

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.120 
ability to use a target lock so how do
we<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> target<00:01:48.780> lock<00:01:49.079> when<00:01:49.649> we're<00:01:49.799> forced

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
we get a target lock when we're forced

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.609 
we get a target lock when we're forced
to<00:01:50.220> take<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> focus<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> how<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.350> four

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to take the focus and how do we get four

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
to take the focus and how do we get four
dices<00:01:53.119> dice<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:55.110> dices<00:01:55.560> I've<00:01:56.070> learned<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
dices dice not dices I've learned so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.590 
dices dice not dices I've learned so
anyway<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.649> simple<00:01:59.159> our<00:01:59.390> first<00:02:00.390> upgrade

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
anyway it's simple our first upgrade

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.920 
anyway it's simple our first upgrade

late heavy laser
and<00:04:26.180> is<00:04:26.449> very<00:04:26.750> devastating<00:04:27.470> against<00:04:27.710> shield

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
and is very devastating against shield

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.120 
and is very devastating against shield
opponents<00:04:28.639> so<00:04:29.210> use<00:04:29.389> that<00:04:29.630> focus<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.320> that

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
opponents so use that focus on that

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.400

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.280 
instead of excellence ability which
doesn't<00:04:33.740> work<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:34.010> shields<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.520> course<00:04:35.110> so<00:04:36.110> let
