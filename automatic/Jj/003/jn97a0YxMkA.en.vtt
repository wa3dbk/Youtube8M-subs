00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.460
 it is 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 bush 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.270
 chinaglia also suspended 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.790
 and it was not my third title later to the ecclesia agency 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 who in turn used it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.840
 São Paulo - the reaction 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 it's six or seven nights 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.280
 are the course aimed at was this show how 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.080
 hugo santos 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.540
 thinking precisely because of addiction that did not mark the behavior of millions 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.860
 citizens 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.670
 disappointing 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.720
 in a row 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.990
 the result in melbourne park all over the world 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.640
 is the impact of misuse 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 is worsened by climate change 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 the water shortage is increasing in Europe 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.770
 at least 12% of the territory of the European Union 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.239
 and 11 percent of its population 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.719
 were affected by this problem 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.329
 2003 we show this 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.939
 one of the most intense years the ctt 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.079
 hundred million people and a third of the territory of the European Union were 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.389
 affected 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.489
 damage to the European economy 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.549
 is to reach 1 8 200 billion euros 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.619
 in the last 30 years in this same comment 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.109
 aesthetics have dramatically increased in a wall intensity 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.259
 million euros was the value of the total losses in this period 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.779
 four times more than three decades ago 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:53.379
 I'm sure this extends now has impacts on natural resources 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.689
 was also the subject of active Libyans visited 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.959
 of water quality production 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.329
 the increased risk of forest fires 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.409
 the impoverishment of fools 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.549
 are consequences of these two serious problems 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:15.279
 we do not think of seven strategies to combat and minimize the incident 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.439
 freshwater species 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.649
 and with the growth of climate change the picture now needs nothing 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.489
 is there any problem to solve on the last day of the year 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.599
 the challenge is global 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.899
 investment in the country is still necessary for the development of 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:35.569
 sustainable 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.429
 and then Russia 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.300
 I always introduce the concepts of efficiency savings 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.100
 and storage of this vital resource 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.799
 in all sectors of tactical activity 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.379
 it is imminent to minimize the demand pressure I interrupted in the future 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.499
 because I will take care of the water so a constancy is fundamental for the 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.629
 the quality of life of citizens and the development of economies of 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:10.869
 study is not a southern problem 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:11.899
 the goal of macaé 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.989
 the only one of the poor 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.069
 developed or underdeveloped countries 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.890
 a mistery 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.859
 It is a problem I think of the union 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.859
 nobody can ignore 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.980
 the countries of the European Union and the citizens in general 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.850
 was also twice as significant in the adoption of policies for the management of 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.289
 sustainable energy 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.520
 of washington the organization counted collective 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.539
 water management 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.599
 international organizations and experts involved in 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.479
 should concentrate political will and financial aid 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.779
 in solving this global crisis 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.710
 caused by 70 species of water 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.670
 the event is being implemented good water management 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.789
 and aquatic ecosystems 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.809
 It is today very change the scenario 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.650
 We're still going on time. 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.650
 if we are 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.900
 in inter the blue planet 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.900
 it's in our hands 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:09.410
 ens 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.830
