00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.019 

I'm<00:00:01.860> making<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.340> rolling<00:00:03.650> texture<00:00:04.759> piece<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
I'm making a rolling texture piece and

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.120 
I'm making a rolling texture piece and
what<00:00:06.720> I've<00:00:06.810> done<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:06.990> I've<00:00:07.319> taken<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.740> ball<00:00:07.950> of

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
what I've done is I've taken a ball of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.270 
what I've done is I've taken a ball of
clay<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.730> flattened<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.960> little<00:00:10.139> bit<00:00:10.380> I'm

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
clay and flattened it a little bit I'm

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.480 
clay and flattened it a little bit I'm
pinching<00:00:11.639> out<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.240> outside<00:00:12.660> edge<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:16.490> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
pinching out the outside edge and this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.480 
pinching out the outside edge and this
outside<00:00:17.910> edge<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.539> create<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> surface<00:00:19.650> pinch

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
outside edge will create a surface pinch

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.359 
outside edge will create a surface pinch
my<00:00:20.640> finger<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:22.350> piece<00:00:22.710> will

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
my finger in here and this piece will

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.390 
my finger in here and this piece will
then<00:00:23.550> roll<00:00:24.050> between<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> fingers<00:00:25.560> once<00:00:26.220> it's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
then roll between the fingers once it's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
then roll between the fingers once it's
fired<00:00:26.640> it'll<00:00:27.269> leave<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:27.840> impression<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
fired it'll leave an impression in the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.220 
fired it'll leave an impression in the
clay<00:00:29.150> this<00:00:30.150> piece<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.810> create<00:00:30.990> kind

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
clay this piece I'm going to create kind

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.560 
clay this piece I'm going to create kind
of<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.439> wiggle<00:00:31.619> texture<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.910> outside<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
of a wiggle texture on the outside and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.639 
of a wiggle texture on the outside and
how<00:00:34.260> big<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.739> make<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.960> wheel<00:00:36.960> will

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
how big you make the the wheel will

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.740 
how big you make the the wheel will
affect<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.910> decoration<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
affect the the decoration that you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.860 
affect the the decoration that you
create<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> surface<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> also<00:00:41.250> how<00:00:41.870> thick

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
create on the surface and also how thick

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
create on the surface and also how thick
what<00:00:43.620> sort<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.980> surface<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.579> leave<00:00:44.820> those

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
what sort of surface if I leave those

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
what sort of surface if I leave those
cracks<00:00:45.420> it'll<00:00:46.170> give<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> cracked<00:00:46.829> egg

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
cracks it'll give me a cracked egg

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.279 
cracks it'll give me a cracked egg
surface<00:00:47.789> if<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.329> don't<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> cracks<00:00:49.140> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
surface if you don't like the cracks you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.799 
surface if you don't like the cracks you
can<00:00:49.379> take<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> wet<00:00:49.860> chamois<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.579> smooth<00:00:51.420> over

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
can take a wet chamois and smooth over

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.889 
can take a wet chamois and smooth over
the<00:00:51.840> surface<00:00:52.430> just<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.629> rim

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the surface just like you would on a rim

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.459 
the surface just like you would on a rim
of<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> pot<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.480> I've<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:00.809> ended<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.230> with

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of a pot so what I've then ended up with

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.460 
of a pot so what I've then ended up with
is<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> shape<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.489> piece<00:01:03.000> once<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.750> clean<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
is a shape a piece once I clean it up a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
is a shape a piece once I clean it up a
little<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.830> that'll<00:01:05.100> create<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.519> irregular

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
little bit that'll create this irregular

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
little bit that'll create this irregular
texture<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.780> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:07.500> this

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
texture you can kind of see there this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.420 
texture you can kind of see there this
one<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.610> rings<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.470> push<00:01:10.740> into<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
one has rings that will push into the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.660 
one has rings that will push into the
the<00:01:11.820> surface<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> piece<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.520> can<00:01:14.520> also

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the surface of the piece you can also

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.320 
the surface of the piece you can also
create<00:01:15.150> pieces<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.580> that<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.640> stamps

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
create pieces that have that are stamps

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870 
create pieces that have that are stamps
themselves<00:01:18.869> rather<00:01:19.020> than<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> rolling

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
themselves rather than the rolling

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.630 
themselves rather than the rolling
pieces<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:22.110> varying<00:01:22.710> thicknesses<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
pieces with varying thicknesses on the

pieces with varying thicknesses on the
end<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.900> push<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.460> clay

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
end here if I push into this clay

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.690 
end here if I push into this clay
surface<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> push<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.979> raised

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.319 
surface it's going to push a raised
texture<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:31.100> even<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.640> seemed<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:32.939> kind

texture there even what seemed like kind
of<00:01:33.390> minimal<00:01:33.810> textures<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.829> will<00:01:35.490> leave

of minimal textures like this will leave

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.840 
of minimal textures like this will leave
will<00:01:36.270> affect<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.200> surface<00:01:37.640> lots<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.700> times

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
will affect the surface lots of times

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.100 
will affect the surface lots of times
people<00:01:38.939> push<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> texture<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.939> material

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
people push see a texture on material

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
people push see a texture on material
something<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.350> find<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
something they find and they want to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.120 
something they find and they want to
recreate<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> surface<00:01:46.079> that'll<00:01:46.740> work<00:01:46.920> as

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
recreate that surface that'll work as

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.420 
recreate that surface that'll work as
well

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.950 

you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.610> also<00:01:53.759> create<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.240> stamp<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.659> has<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you can also create a stamp that has a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
you can also create a stamp that has a
raised<00:01:55.320> surface<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.939> piece<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
raised surface this is a just a piece of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.760 
raised surface this is a just a piece of
clay<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.570> I've<00:01:57.689> flattened<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.619> bit

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
clay that I've flattened a little bit

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.219 
clay that I've flattened a little bit
and<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.520> want<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> add<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.750> clay

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and if you want to add on to that clay

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.100 
and if you want to add on to that clay
the<00:02:01.860> same<00:02:02.159> rules<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.720> adding

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the same rules that you use for adding

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.190 
the same rules that you use for adding
texture<00:02:04.560> would<00:02:04.979> apply<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:06.479> might<00:02:06.720> score

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
texture would apply here you might score

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
texture would apply here you might score
up<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.590> surface<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.310> each<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> pieces

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
up the surface of each of the pieces

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.590 
up the surface of each of the pieces
that<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.630> add<00:02:09.840> together<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:11.039> then<00:02:11.580> add<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
that you add together and then add a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.920 
that you add together and then add a
little<00:02:12.840> bit<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.260> slip<00:02:14.130> or<00:02:14.340> water<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.930> press
