00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
can gently pull it out I've just had to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.790 
can gently pull it out I've just had to
work<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.660> by<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
work it little by little because like I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
work it little by little because like I
say<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> damage<00:00:59.940> any<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
then you just have to like gently work
the<00:01:09.600> plant<00:01:10.110> apart<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.760> takes<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the plant apart and it just takes a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.640 
the plant apart and it just takes a
little<00:01:12.299> muscle<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:15.259> I<00:01:16.259> just

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.550 
little muscle to get in there and I just
might<00:01:16.830> need<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.430> chop<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.750> stab<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
might need to just chop it or stab it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.749 
might need to just chop it or stab it
just<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:21.210> break<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.869> here

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759
