00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
of a classroom base which I'm I much

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.620 
of a classroom base which I'm I much
prefer<00:02:00.009> as<00:02:00.220> well<00:02:00.400> because<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:00.910> can<00:02:01.150> focus<00:02:01.360> on

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
prefer as well because I can focus on

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.180 
prefer as well because I can focus on
what<00:02:01.750> I'm<00:02:01.869> doing<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.259> try<00:02:02.860> not<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.040> be

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
what I'm doing and try not to be

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.560 
what I'm doing and try not to be
distracted<00:02:03.490> by<00:02:03.820> what's<00:02:04.000> going<00:02:04.119> on<00:02:04.270> around<00:02:04.360> me

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
distracted by what's going on around me

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.330 
distracted by what's going on around me
so<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:07.830> people<00:02:08.830> say<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.160> we're<00:02:09.310> very

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
so I think people say that we're very

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.830 
so I think people say that we're very
kind<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.350> sheltered<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:13.420> whether<00:02:13.630> or<00:02:13.720> not

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
kind of sheltered but whether or not

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.449 
kind of sheltered but whether or not
that's<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.170> good<00:02:14.200> thing<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.709> guess<00:02:14.890> that's<00:02:15.130> up<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
that's a good thing I guess that's up to

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.550 
that's a good thing I guess that's up to
them<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.730> determine<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:17.320> less

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
them to determine but like it's less

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.220 
them to determine but like it's less
exposure<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:20.769> things<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.459> maybe<00:02:22.330> would

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
exposure to to things that maybe would

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.780 
exposure to to things that maybe would
harm<00:02:23.470> you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
harm you

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.420 
harm you

church<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.299> community<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.930> there's

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
church and in the community and there's

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.349 
church and in the community and there's
a<00:02:29.170> lot<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.400> 11<00:02:30.400> year<00:02:30.519> olds<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.939> 10<00:02:31.090> year<00:02:31.209> olds

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
a lot of 11 year olds and 10 year olds

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.550 
a lot of 11 year olds and 10 year olds
they're<00:02:31.510> just<00:02:31.780> talking<00:02:31.900> about<00:02:32.140> things<00:02:32.439> that

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
they're just talking about things that

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.619 
they're just talking about things that
just<00:02:32.680> are<00:02:33.129> not<00:02:33.400> appropriate<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.909> be<00:02:34.030> talking

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
just are not appropriate to be talking

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.599 
just are not appropriate to be talking
about<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.079> I<00:02:35.290> guess<00:02:35.680> especially<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.310> younger

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
about and I guess especially for younger

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.089 
about and I guess especially for younger
ones<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:37.060> really<00:02:37.359> kind<00:02:37.599> of<00:02:37.659> does<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.500> shouts<00:02:38.950> us

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
ones it really kind of does it shouts us

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.559 
ones it really kind of does it shouts us
them<00:02:39.280> from<00:02:39.579> from<00:02:39.879> all<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.150> then<00:02:40.359> when<00:02:40.480> you

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
them from from all of this then when you

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.479 
them from from all of this then when you
get<00:02:40.659> older<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.530> begin<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:41.920> realize<00:02:42.040> there

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
get older you you begin to realize there

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.819 
get older you you begin to realize there
are<00:02:42.579> things<00:02:43.170> things<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.709> world

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
are things things like that in the world

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.539 
are things things like that in the world
and<00:02:46.349> you're<00:02:47.349> still<00:02:47.620> sheltered<00:02:48.069> away<00:02:48.340> from

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
and you're still sheltered away from

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.800 
and you're still sheltered away from
them<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.150> an<00:02:49.209> understanding<00:02:49.450> of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
them but you have an understanding of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.199 
them but you have an understanding of
them<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:51.280> you're<00:02:51.400> just<00:02:51.549> not<00:02:51.579> immersed<00:02:51.970> in

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
them and but you're just not immersed in

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.479 
them and but you're just not immersed in
them<00:02:52.359> I<00:02:52.540> think<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:53.709> such<00:02:53.859> a<00:02:53.889> small<00:02:54.189> school

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.210 

ever<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.690> know<00:03:23.870> everyone<00:03:24.260> everyone<00:03:25.069> knows

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
ever you know everyone everyone knows

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.250 
ever you know everyone everyone knows
you<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.060> say<00:03:26.180> hi<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.420> anyone<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.080> I

you and you can say hi to anyone and I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.449

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
guess that's different from other

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.550 
guess that's different from other
schools<00:03:28.549> as<00:03:28.760> well<00:03:28.940> because<00:03:29.269> I'm<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.750> guess<00:03:30.409> you

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
schools as well because I'm I guess you

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.539 
schools as well because I'm I guess you
