00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.250
 if the game wouldn't be so tense 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:11.880
 it could have been at least every day 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.559
 let's say so play on stream or 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.960
 somehow if many things would be done 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.010
 automatically 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.029
 but let's say this is the departing dude 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.430
 suppose if the ammunition explodes 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.170
 so he took off well and stuff 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.009
 the spirit 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.140
 or if something cool happens 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.509
 outside the box and interesting and going beyond 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.720
 usual customary frames too 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.000
 the corresponding picture would pop up 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.820
 theoretically theoretically it 's somehow 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.309
 you can register let's say so 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.790
 changing pictures to script 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.289
 tracked relevant parameters 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.940
 values ​​and on request gave well as it 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.940
 realize here hell knows 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.760
 but look and have already arrived 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.380
 we give him there he platoon 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.369
 platoon frequent airplay icon 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.369
 from 8 arrived 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.799
 our competition is already doing nipple 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.670
 that accuracy 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.740
 conveyors also need to be able to play with him 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.109
 there you need a tower left-right jackets 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.729
 there are generally so many nuances of the tower 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.729
 Generally cardboard sewn in shock 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:47.040
 so from the exact 103 already witnessed 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.040
 we have to remember it and he settled 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:09.009
