00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.380 

we've<00:00:04.740> got<00:00:04.890> some<00:00:05.069> questions<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.730> how<00:00:06.060> much

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
we've got some questions about how much

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.379 
we've got some questions about how much
up<00:00:06.570> can<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:06.810> used<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.770> manually<00:00:08.430> register<00:00:09.090> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
up can be used to manually register and

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.359 
up can be used to manually register and
stitch<00:00:09.930> together<00:00:10.139> scans<00:00:10.709> that<00:00:10.889> come<00:00:11.070> from<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:11.369 
stitch together scans that come from the

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.789 
stitch together scans that come from the
fuel<00:00:11.549> 3d<00:00:11.940> scanners<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:13.289> I<00:00:13.320> want<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.619> do

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
fuel 3d scanners so what I want to do

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.770 
fuel 3d scanners so what I want to do
today<00:00:14.010> is<00:00:14.129> walk<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.580> through<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.270> workflow

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
today is walk you through that workflow

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.689 
today is walk you through that workflow
what<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.590> looks<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:16.949> because<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
what that looks like because it is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.000 
what that looks like because it is
possible<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.480> mesh<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.170> you've<00:00:19.710> been<00:00:19.740> on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
possible with mesh up if you've been on

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.770 
possible with mesh up if you've been on
the<00:00:20.100> Kickstarter<00:00:20.640> campaign<00:00:20.670> recently<00:00:21.570> for

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
the Kickstarter campaign recently for

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.080 
the Kickstarter campaign recently for
fuel<00:00:21.990> 3d<00:00:22.440> you've<00:00:23.010> noticed<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.550> added<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> really

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
fuel 3d you've noticed we added a really

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.960 
fuel 3d you've noticed we added a really
interesting<00:00:24.540> stretch<00:00:25.080> goal<00:00:25.410> if<00:00:25.860> we<00:00:26.610> can<00:00:26.790> reach

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
interesting stretch goal if we can reach

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.110 
interesting stretch goal if we can reach
a<00:00:27.120> total<00:00:27.450> of<00:00:27.650> 350<00:00:28.650> units<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.700> bundled

able to commit to delivering a special
version<00:00:37.589> of<00:00:37.920> Mesha<00:00:38.249> for<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:38.940> fuel<00:00:39.149> 3d<00:00:39.510> scanner

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
version of Mesha for the fuel 3d scanner

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.779 
version of Mesha for the fuel 3d scanner
that<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.589> allow<00:00:40.859> for<00:00:40.920> automatic

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
that will allow for automatic

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.779 
that will allow for automatic
registration<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.690> stitching<00:00:43.429> but<00:00:44.429> while<00:00:44.640> we

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
registration and stitching but while we

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.239 
registration and stitching but while we
wait<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:44.999> that<00:00:45.239> goal<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.870> achieved<00:00:46.129> let<00:00:47.129> me

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
wait for that goal to be achieved let me

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.840 
wait for that goal to be achieved let me
show<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> how<00:00:47.819> to<00:00:47.879> manually<00:00:49.039> use<00:00:50.039> mesh<00:00:50.339> up<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
show you how to manually use mesh up to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.770 
show you how to manually use mesh up to
register<00:00:51.359> and<00:00:51.569> stitch<00:00:51.809> together<00:00:52.079> your<00:00:52.859> scans

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
register and stitch together your scans

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.229 
register and stitch together your scans
so<00:00:54.780> we're<00:00:55.139> gonna<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.409> using<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.920> Greek<00:00:56.909> head

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
so we're gonna be using the Greek head

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.309 
so we're gonna be using the Greek head
and<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:58.530> am<00:00:59.690> we're<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.809> gonna<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.079> stitching

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
and I am we're just gonna be stitching

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:09.289 
and I am we're just gonna be stitching
together<00:01:01.710> three<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.399> images

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.830 

so<00:01:10.079> these<00:01:10.170> scans<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.680> exactly<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.539> as<00:01:12.539> you'll

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so these scans are exactly as as you'll

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.240 
so these scans are exactly as as you'll
receive<00:01:13.140> from<00:01:13.259> your<00:01:13.469> fuel<00:01:13.770> 3d<00:01:14.130> scanner<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
receive from your fuel 3d scanner so

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.450 
receive from your fuel 3d scanner so
they<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:18.060> need<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.329> be<00:01:18.539> rotated<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
they just now need to be rotated and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
they just now need to be rotated and
aligned<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> use<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.719> middle

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
aligned I'm going to use this middle

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.980 
aligned I'm going to use this middle
scan<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.009> stationary<00:01:23.520> scan<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.630> will<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
scan as the stationary scan that will I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.090 
scan as the stationary scan that will I
will<00:01:25.170> align<00:01:25.469> the<00:01:25.649> other<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:26.340> scans<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.659> meet

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
will align the other two scans to meet

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.340 
will align the other two scans to meet
so<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.459> can<00:01:30.119> understand<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:31.110> process

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
so you can understand that the process

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.709 
so you can understand that the process
is<00:01:31.679> pretty<00:01:31.860> simple<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.200> matter<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
is pretty simple it is just a matter of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.669 
is pretty simple it is just a matter of
moving<00:01:36.719> and<00:01:37.170> rotating<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.869> scans<00:01:40.229> until<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
moving and rotating the scans until you

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.419 
moving and rotating the scans until you
get<00:01:40.890> them<00:01:41.069> approximately<00:01:41.610> into<00:01:42.390> place<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.429> I

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
get them approximately into place and I

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.699 
get them approximately into place and I
won't<00:01:45.090> lie<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.439> time-consuming

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
won't lie this is a bit time-consuming

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.870 
won't lie this is a bit time-consuming
and<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.849> must<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.299> very<00:01:48.599> patient<00:01:49.700> but<00:01:50.700> it's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and you must be very patient but it's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:08.969 
and you must be very patient but it's
possible<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.770> keep<00:01:59.099> tweaking

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.770 

and<00:02:09.489> rotating<00:02:10.179> like<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:12.840> until<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and rotating like this until we get the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.479 
and rotating like this until we get the
skins<00:02:17.110> position<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.069> want<00:02:22.470> okay<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.980> there

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
skins position as we want okay and there

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.759 
skins position as we want okay and there
we<00:02:24.640> are<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:26.430> have<00:02:27.430> done<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> pretty<00:02:28.000> good<00:02:28.239> job<00:02:28.769> of

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
we are I have done a pretty good job of

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.620 
we are I have done a pretty good job of
lining<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.519> scans<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.060> not<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> hundred

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
lining the scans it's not a hundred

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.729 
lining the scans it's not a hundred
percent<00:02:31.780> perfect<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.930> especially<00:02:35.230> for<00:02:35.680> a

stitching<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.190> together<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:49.269> want<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.630> first

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
stitching it together you want to first

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.960 
stitching it together you want to first
pay<00:02:50.319> attention<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.890> how<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.069> crop<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.519> in<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
pay attention to how you crop it in the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.620 
pay attention to how you crop it in the
fuel<00:02:52.180> 3d<00:02:52.540> software<00:02:53.079> so<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:54.579> I<00:02:55.120> were<00:02:55.299> going<00:02:55.360> to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
fuel 3d software so if I were going to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.569 
fuel 3d software so if I were going to
do<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:55.959> scan<00:02:56.200> again<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.709> would<00:02:56.920> crop<00:02:57.220> along

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
do this scan again I would crop along

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.370 
do this scan again I would crop along
these<00:02:57.760> edges<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:58.360> here<00:02:58.720> along<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.140> hairline

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
these edges like here along the hairline

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.729 
these edges like here along the hairline
where<00:02:59.920> it<00:02:59.980> meets<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.340> face<00:03:00.610> or<00:03:01.269> here<00:03:01.989> where

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
where it meets the face or here where

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.890 
where it meets the face or here where
they<00:03:02.980> at<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.549> edge<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.970> nose<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.750> to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
they at the edge of the nose and up to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.080 
they at the edge of the nose and up to
the<00:03:05.019> eye<00:03:05.049> so<00:03:05.470> any<00:03:05.860> feature<00:03:06.220> set<00:03:06.579> that<00:03:06.730> points

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
the eye so any feature set that points

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.360 
the eye so any feature set that points
in<00:03:07.360> will<00:03:08.230> be<00:03:08.349> much<00:03:08.590> easier<00:03:08.829> to<00:03:09.069> work<00:03:09.190> with

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
in will be much easier to work with

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.780 
in will be much easier to work with
stitching<00:03:10.209> in<00:03:10.450> mesh<00:03:10.780> up<00:03:10.959> software<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:12.069> focus

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
stitching in mesh up software so focus

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.430 
stitching in mesh up software so focus
on<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:13.269> you're<00:03:13.389> doing<00:03:13.510> manual<00:03:13.989> stitching

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
on that if you're doing manual stitching

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.170 
on that if you're doing manual stitching
but<00:03:14.950> what<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.819> have<00:03:16.060> here<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.389> pretty<00:03:16.630> good<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
but what I have here is pretty good and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.670 
but what I have here is pretty good and
let's<00:03:19.180> go<00:03:19.389> ahead<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.690> union<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.079> together<00:03:20.380> and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
let's go ahead and union it together and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.620 
let's go ahead and union it together and
then<00:03:21.190> I'm<00:03:21.310> going<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.459> use<00:03:21.609> blend<00:03:21.940> Union<00:03:22.359> to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
then I'm going to use blend Union to

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.289 
then I'm going to use blend Union to
soften<00:03:22.959> those<00:03:23.290> seams<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:24.370> order<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.970> do<00:03:25.120> an

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
soften those seams in order to do an

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.270 
soften those seams in order to do an
operation<00:03:25.660> like<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.019> blend<00:03:26.380> union<00:03:26.859> I<00:03:27.010> need<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
operation like a blend union I need to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.920 
operation like a blend union I need to
make<00:03:27.459> sure<00:03:27.670> that<00:03:27.819> all<00:03:28.030> my<00:03:28.060> objects<00:03:28.720> are

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
make sure that all my objects are

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.949 
make sure that all my objects are
volumes<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.670> have<00:03:31.030> three<00:03:31.299> choices<00:03:31.510> with

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
volumes so I have three choices with

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.550 
volumes so I have three choices with
volumes

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
volumes

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.610 
volumes
I<00:03:32.709> have<00:03:33.160> envelope<00:03:33.730> shell<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.209> volume<00:03:34.600> now<00:03:35.260> in

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
I have envelope shell and volume now in

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.780 
I have envelope shell and volume now in
this<00:03:35.859> instance<00:03:36.239> either<00:03:37.239> envelope<00:03:38.220> or<00:03:39.220> shell

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
this instance either envelope or shell

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.030 
this instance either envelope or shell
would<00:03:40.000> work<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:41.290> I've<00:03:41.440> played<00:03:41.709> with<00:03:41.859> this<00:03:42.010> a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
would work and I've played with this a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.460 
would work and I've played with this a
bit<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.790> know<00:03:42.970> from<00:03:43.299> what<00:03:43.870> I've<00:03:44.049> done<00:03:44.260> that

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
bit and I know from what I've done that

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.770 
bit and I know from what I've done that
I<00:03:44.650> like<00:03:45.250> envelopes<00:03:45.760> results<00:03:46.209> better<00:03:46.359> for<00:03:46.660> this

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
I like envelopes results better for this

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.750 
I like envelopes results better for this
particular<00:03:47.319> scan<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:47.889> this<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.489> something

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
particular scan so this is something

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.890 
particular scan so this is something
you're<00:03:48.910> just<00:03:48.940> going<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.269> be<00:03:49.389> playing<00:03:49.630> with<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
you're just going to be playing with a

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.860 
you're just going to be playing with a
bit<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.319> see<00:03:50.470> what<00:03:50.500> works<00:03:50.950> best<00:03:51.220> for<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.870> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
bit to see what works best for you and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.860 
bit to see what works best for you and
the<00:03:53.260> next

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:08.020 

and<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.230> final<00:04:00.560> piece<00:04:05.260> great<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.190> now<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.700> need

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
and the final piece great so now I need

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.670 
and the final piece great so now I need
to<00:04:08.740> work<00:04:09.740> with<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:10.040> Union<00:04:10.690> blend<00:04:11.690> Union<00:04:12.140> is<00:04:12.320> an

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
to work with the Union blend Union is an

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.620 
to work with the Union blend Union is an
expensive<00:04:13.130> operation<00:04:13.460> it's<00:04:14.270> computationally

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
expensive operation it's computationally

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.830 
expensive operation it's computationally
intensive<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.010> wherever<00:04:16.579> possible<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.720> want

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
intensive so wherever possible you want

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.270 
intensive so wherever possible you want
to<00:04:17.989> minimize<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.620> amount<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.829> times<00:04:19.100> that

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
to minimize the amount of times that

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.140 
to minimize the amount of times that
you're<00:04:19.700> doing<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.090> blend<00:04:20.269> union<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:22.040> can<00:04:22.970> do

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
you're doing a blend union and I can do

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.040 
you're doing a blend union and I can do
that<00:04:23.300> today<00:04:23.570> by<00:04:24.320> taking<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.950> two<00:04:25.130> sides<00:04:25.430> and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
that today by taking the two sides and

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.980 
that today by taking the two sides and
unioning<00:04:27.050> them<00:04:27.440> together<00:04:27.710> without<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.400> blend

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
unioning them together without a blend

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.260 
unioning them together without a blend
so<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.380> selected<00:04:30.950> both<00:04:31.130> objects<00:04:31.550> choose<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:31.940> zero

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
so I selected both objects choose a zero

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.440 
so I selected both objects choose a zero
for<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.660> amount<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.930> blend

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.550 

so<00:04:41.080> now<00:04:41.230> let's<00:04:41.590> apply<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:41.920> blend<00:04:42.250> Union

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
so now let's apply the blend Union

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.230 
so now let's apply the blend Union
select<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.650> front<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:44.980> face<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.520> select

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
select the front of the face and select

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.150 
select the front of the face and select
the<00:04:46.780> sides<00:04:47.050> what<00:04:47.320> you're<00:04:47.470> not<00:04:47.590> seeing<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:47.920> one

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
the sides what you're not seeing is one

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.270 
the sides what you're not seeing is one
and<00:04:48.430> let's<00:04:49.180> put<00:04:49.450> one<00:04:50.080> foot<00:04:50.470> amount<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.860> blend

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.440 

all<00:04:57.280> right<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:58.480> is<00:04:58.780> done<00:04:59.310> so<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.640> isn't<00:05:00.970> perfect

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
all right it is done so it isn't perfect

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.020 
all right it is done so it isn't perfect
you<00:05:02.260> can<00:05:02.500> see<00:05:02.740> here<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.220> seam<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.760> still

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
you can see here the seam is still

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.780 
you can see here the seam is still
visible<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:05.410> that's<00:05:05.650> probably<00:05:06.370> because<00:05:06.520> it

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
visible and that's probably because it

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.750 
visible and that's probably because it
wasn't<00:05:07.150> knitted<00:05:07.420> closely<00:05:07.900> together<00:05:08.110> enough

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
wasn't knitted closely together enough

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.570 
wasn't knitted closely together enough
but<00:05:09.760> outside<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:12.070> results<00:05:12.490> are

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
but outside of that the results are

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.110 
but outside of that the results are
quite<00:05:12.880> good<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:15.340> there<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:15.640> have<00:05:15.670> it

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
quite good so there you have it

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.200 
quite good so there you have it
manual<00:05:16.810> stitching<00:05:17.260> in<00:05:17.440> mesh<00:05:17.680> up<00:05:17.890> it's<00:05:18.820> not<00:05:19.030> an

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
manual stitching in mesh up it's not an

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.750 
manual stitching in mesh up it's not an
easy<00:05:19.450> task<00:05:19.780> but<00:05:20.560> as<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:20.920> can<00:05:21.070> see<00:05:21.310> here

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
easy task but as you can see here

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.790 
easy task but as you can see here
especially<00:05:22.630> if<00:05:22.810> you<00:05:22.930> pay<00:05:23.110> attention<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.680> how

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
especially if you pay attention to how

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.280 
especially if you pay attention to how
you<00:05:23.860> scan<00:05:24.310> and<00:05:24.610> crop<00:05:24.940> your<00:05:25.120> images<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:25.840> you

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
you scan and crop your images and you

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.110 
you scan and crop your images and you
have<00:05:26.470> some<00:05:26.680> patience<00:05:27.190> to<00:05:27.310> align<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.790> images

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
have some patience to align the images

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.900 
have some patience to align the images
just<00:05:28.390> right<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.900> is<00:05:29.320> absolutely<00:05:30.190> possible<00:05:30.430> in

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
just right it is absolutely possible in

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.510 
just right it is absolutely possible in
mesh<00:05:31.120> up<00:05:31.440> but<00:05:32.440> we<00:05:32.530> want<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:32.830> make<00:05:32.920> this<00:05:33.040> process

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
mesh up but we want to make this process
