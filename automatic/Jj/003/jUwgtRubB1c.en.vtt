00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.410
 Like and videos which I show my 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.969
 the opening of the various things to learn 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.370
 which inspired me throughout 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.630
 of the previous month, all we go of course 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.580

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.020
 and all sorts of space things I have 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.359
 Incidentally, in Korea, all incomprehensible 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.949
 for some reason lies a banana I have not yet 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.910
 was going to actually let see 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.859
 saying that this is my husky 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 I just decided somewhere in the middle 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.340
 the video is stupid to eat because it's me but 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.230
 The first is of course lucky, I love very much 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.800
 it is know what rolling Clap without varnish 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.300
 for nails 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 so here are two favorite theater wore 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.640
 the previous month it is such a color from 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.320
 topshop which is called kim tarlok 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.340
 also that appears again on release 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.829
 like this shock ovsky 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.610

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.500
 called just 325 oh wow i 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.199
 I understand why a min of these huskies have 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.730
 I will kill myself now 24 hours looking at this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 shelf on my computer because 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.629
 constantly monty russian video 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.930
 she is there ron burgundi who looks like 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.729
 on this one color but agree yes and 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.560
 heisenberg all understandably drove on 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.960
 Here it was an unexpected so guys 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.610
 let it be a story too 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.640
 begins with what I was along from 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 center I can look like a guest 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 fluorescent denim spruce bag 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 decided to make badges 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 it's incredibly fun here icons 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.450
 all sorts of usa and in paris from london i.e. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.070
 a bunch of all weird trash that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 It does not please the eye and I think the bag is 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.939
 Looks like you know a little vintage 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.439
 cool girly hooligan to her 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.570
 launched instagram many asked 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.460
 where is she from and what is that ordinary 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.380
 bag and have not sold for a long time but you can 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.540
 do this yourself and find it seems to me 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.850
 there is no limit to creative at all 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.140
 just but incredibly not pleasing to the eye so 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.460
 what's your favorite bag 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.720
 Well, now I 'll show you tell about 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.610
 your favorite flight which 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 collected itself this is my second palette 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 from inglot if anyone knows they are 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.820
 here is the magnetic here five compartments 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.439
 you can collect more palettes but I 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.430
 not 5 colors because in one of them 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.960
 meat love three colors me crazy 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.460
 this flight is what I can with flour with her 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.290
 do not actually tour 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.660
 everyday makeup so that's what i'm 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.860
 every time I make my eyes even today 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.570
 I used this palette to 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.830
 combine with other shadows that 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.800
 I have a collection of reasons for it 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.320
 universal candle from ikea which 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.209
 called singing in my opinion so it is with 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.600
 apple and by the way row 2 is burning at me 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.820
 behind 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.200
 I adore that smell because actually 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.610
 five apples on it are clouds you know 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.230
 as a dispenser in the toilet 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.680
 and it really smells green 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.230
 cut apple so juicy knife 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.180
 such a grassy smell beautiful fresh 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.470
 spring just generally adored by the way 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.239
 Recently there was a perfume with such a smell 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.190
 I will definitely buy it because tomorrow is not 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.320
 really like the cilia themselves very 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.870
 cheap so very blue burn and 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.900

 here is the same disease next is my 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.139
 the most favorite highlight of all 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.030
 which I have and they have a lot 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.590
 because I adore highlighter to me 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.190
 like red hair so that there are two 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.050
 colors 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.220
 they can be mixed together like that 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.690

 champagne is not sparkling here it's all clean 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.180
 mother of pearl and it looks incredible 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.570
 natural when you really 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.830
 glitters skin from the inside it is very beautiful and 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.240
 I do not even know what I will show 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.560
 Like the next issue because they 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.750

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.160

 Further from purchases from America and in general 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.500
 interesting combination I now endure

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.490
 he left such a bracelet in a friend tape 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.020

 hours Srochko I bought back in the past, 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.820
 year they are transparent it seems to me that not 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.590
 very beautiful and so how would it be fashionable how would 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.390
 Is there anything transparent on the way and 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.190
