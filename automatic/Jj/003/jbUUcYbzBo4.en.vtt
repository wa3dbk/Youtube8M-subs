Dustin Hoffman here out of kouya Creek I
just<00:01:00.870> read<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.399> 450<00:01:02.399> big<00:01:02.610> boar<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:03.000> cylinder

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
just read the 450 big boar from cylinder

just read the 450 big boar from cylinder
works

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.260 

immediately<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.910> bike<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.240> really

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
immediately the bike is really

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.300 
immediately the bike is really
comfortable<00:01:07.840> up<00:01:08.110> all<00:01:08.380> these<00:01:08.560> big<00:01:08.830> Hills<00:01:09.070> it

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
comfortable up all these big Hills it

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.580 
comfortable up all these big Hills it
pulls<00:01:09.580> for<00:01:09.910> days<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.360> never<00:01:10.420> dies<00:01:10.840> off<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.470> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
pulls for days it never dies off and the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.290 
pulls for days it never dies off and the
tight<00:01:11.800> corners<00:01:12.220> is<00:01:12.400> still<00:01:12.610> really<00:01:12.880> manageable

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
tight corners is still really manageable

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.000 
tight corners is still really manageable
but<00:01:13.750> in<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.930> big<00:01:14.110> motor<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.440> has<00:01:14.470> plenty<00:01:14.830> of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
but in the big motor it has plenty of

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.410 
but in the big motor it has plenty of
power<00:01:16.890> panels<00:01:17.890> so<00:01:18.010> good<00:01:18.250> jumps<00:01:18.700> good<00:01:18.850> nothing

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
power panels so good jumps good nothing

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.270 
power panels so good jumps good nothing
funky<00:01:19.570> about<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:20.050> you'd<00:01:20.260> think<00:01:20.470> with<00:01:20.950> how<00:01:21.190> much

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
funky about it you'd think with how much

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.609 
funky about it you'd think with how much
power<00:01:21.550> has<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.820> be<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.030> full<00:01:22.270> mod<00:01:22.570> 450<00:01:23.229> but<00:01:23.440> it's

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
power has to be a full mod 450 but it's

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:35.810 
power has to be a full mod 450 but it's
just<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.890> bolt<00:01:24.100> on<00:01:24.280> kit<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.820> works<00:01:24.970> super

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.130 

so<00:01:36.820> our<00:01:36.969> main<00:01:37.149> emphasis<00:01:37.270> was<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.810> motor<00:01:37.990> of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
so our main emphasis was the motor of

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.990 
so our main emphasis was the motor of
course<00:01:38.350> but<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:39.070> make<00:01:39.429> a<00:01:39.460> bike<00:01:39.640> low<00:01:39.759> but<00:01:39.880> more

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
course but to make a bike low but more

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.580 
course but to make a bike low but more
rideable<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.539> enjoyable<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.289> added

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
rideable and enjoyable we added

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.139 
rideable and enjoyable we added

braking<00:01:49.960> stopping<00:01:50.380> power<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.799> then<00:01:51.640> we<00:01:51.939> added

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
braking stopping power and then we added

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.539 
braking stopping power and then we added
a<00:01:52.329> TCR<00:01:52.840> we<00:01:53.409> did<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.649> stock<00:01:53.890> hubs<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.369> stock

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
a TCR we did the stock hubs and stock

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.969 
a TCR we did the stock hubs and stock
rims<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.840> give<00:01:55.959> it<00:01:56.049> a<00:01:56.110> real<00:01:56.229> nice<00:01:56.350> factory<00:01:56.799> look

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
and then of course we got works

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.940 
and then of course we got works

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.640 

but<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> cylinder<00:02:39.850> was<00:02:39.970> big<00:02:40.750> work<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.230> mimics

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
but the cylinder was big work it mimics

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.100 
but the cylinder was big work it mimics

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
the stock power but where the stop 12

the stock power but where the stop 12
was<00:02:44.290> missing<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.710> little<00:02:44.800> bit<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.250> mid<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.760> top

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
was missing a little bit of mid to top
