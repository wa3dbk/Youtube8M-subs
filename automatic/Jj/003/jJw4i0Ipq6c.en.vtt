just<00:04:11.760> he<00:04:12.150> has<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.390> actually<00:04:12.690> go<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.960> couple

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
just he has to actually go a couple

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.260 
just he has to actually go a couple
miles<00:04:13.560> an<00:04:13.680> hour<00:04:13.770> faster<00:04:14.100> than<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.610> people<00:04:15.180> to

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
miles an hour faster than you people to

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.840 
miles an hour faster than you people to
catch<00:04:15.420> up<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:15.900> then<00:04:16.590> he<00:04:17.130> lets<00:04:17.370> off<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.700> match

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
catch up and then he lets off to match

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.430 
catch up and then he lets off to match
your<00:04:18.030> speed<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:18.840> it's<00:04:18.960> the<00:04:19.020> same<00:04:19.230> thing<00:04:19.410> that

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
your speed so it's the same thing that

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.410 
your speed so it's the same thing that
we're<00:04:19.620> doing<00:04:19.650> here<00:04:20.070> I've<00:04:20.640> recognized<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.390> I

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
we're doing here I've recognized that I

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.630 
we're doing here I've recognized that I
threw<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.810> one<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.020> a<00:04:22.200> little<00:04:22.440> slow<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.550> to

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
threw this one in a little slow so to

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.890 
threw this one in a little slow so to
catch<00:04:23.850> up<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.300> other<00:04:24.420> one<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.660> need<00:04:24.810> to

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
catch up with the other one I need to

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.080 
catch up with the other one I need to
over<00:04:25.410> adjust<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:26.040> need<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.340> bring<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:26.970> up<00:04:27.030> to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
over adjust I need to bring it up to

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.270 
over adjust I need to bring it up to
here<00:04:27.420> a<00:04:27.450> couple<00:04:27.750> notches<00:04:27.900> up<00:04:28.230> that's<00:04:29.010> point

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
here a couple notches up that's point

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.060 
here a couple notches up that's point
one<00:04:29.550> right<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.510> catch<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.870> back<00:04:31.020> up<00:04:31.230> now<00:04:31.920> let's

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
one right to catch it back up now let's

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.500 
one right to catch it back up now let's
come<00:04:32.250> back<00:04:32.280> up<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.640> quickly<00:04:32.970> move<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.210> back<00:04:33.390> to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
come back up I quickly move it back to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.249 
come back up I quickly move it back to
this<00:04:33.630> spot<00:04:33.870> we're<00:04:34.110> at<00:04:34.260> where<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.530> was

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
this spot we're at where I was

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.019 
this spot we're at where I was
really<00:04:37.259> simple<00:04:37.619> so<00:04:37.860> it's<00:04:38.009> it's<00:04:38.459> matching<00:04:38.729> like

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:39.029 
really simple so it's it's matching like

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.929 
really simple so it's it's matching like
that<00:04:39.179> now<00:04:39.659> you<00:04:40.409> can<00:04:40.559> go<00:04:40.619> back<00:04:40.649> and<00:04:40.949> forth<00:04:41.189> so<00:04:41.399> if

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 
that now you can go back and forth so if

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.609 
that now you can go back and forth so if
I<00:04:42.179> if<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:42.509> overdo<00:04:42.869> that<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.050> don't<00:04:43.289> have<00:04:43.379> to<00:04:43.469> do<00:04:43.589> it

00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:43.619 
I if I overdo that I don't have to do it

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:44.749 
I if I overdo that I don't have to do it
on<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.800> underside<00:04:44.069> as<00:04:44.279> long<00:04:44.429> go<00:04:44.580> down<00:04:44.729> a

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
on the underside as long go down a

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.739 
on the underside as long go down a
couple<00:04:44.999> notches<00:04:45.240> right<00:04:47.089> so<00:04:48.089> there's<00:04:48.330> there's

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:48.749 
couple notches right so there's there's

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.869 
couple notches right so there's there's
three<00:04:48.959> points<00:04:49.319> here<00:04:49.469> like<00:04:49.709> if<00:04:49.889> if<00:04:50.399> I'm<00:04:50.610> cueing

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
three points here like if if I'm cueing

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.100 
three points here like if if I'm cueing
up<00:04:50.969> this<00:04:51.149> record<00:04:51.509> and<00:04:51.599> I<00:04:51.659> don't<00:04:51.719> I<00:04:52.020> don't

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
up this record and I don't I don't

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.749 
up this record and I don't I don't
really<00:04:52.349> know<00:04:52.709> if<00:04:52.740> it's<00:04:53.159> matched<00:04:53.369> up<00:04:53.550> at<00:04:53.639> that

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
really know if it's matched up at that

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.399 
really know if it's matched up at that
speed<00:04:54.059> there's<00:04:54.509> three<00:04:54.719> points<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.110> one

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
speed there's three points so one

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.679 
speed there's three points so one
there's<00:04:55.619> where<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.889> pitch<00:04:56.339> control<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:57.029> when

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
there's where the pitch control is when

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.540 
there's where the pitch control is when
you<00:04:57.779> when<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.050> start<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.349> song<00:04:58.559> number<00:04:59.249> two

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
you when you start the song number two

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.669 
you when you start the song number two
there's<00:05:00.240> where<00:05:00.539> you<00:05:00.990> think<00:05:01.379> it<00:05:01.499> should<00:05:01.649> be

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:01.679 
there's where you think it should be

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:04.790 
there's where you think it should be
beat<00:05:01.919> match<00:05:02.099> that<00:05:02.429> and<00:05:03.389> number<00:05:03.629> three<00:05:03.959> there's

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
beat match that and number three there's

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.529 
beat match that and number three there's
the<00:05:05.069> adjustment<00:05:05.669> which<00:05:05.939> is<00:05:05.969> gonna<00:05:06.209> be<00:05:06.300> above

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
the adjustment which is gonna be above

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.869 
the adjustment which is gonna be above
or<00:05:06.689> below<00:05:06.809> that<00:05:07.279> so<00:05:08.279> if<00:05:08.399> you<00:05:08.490> keep<00:05:08.639> those<00:05:08.759> three

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:08.879 
or below that so if you keep those three

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.070 
or below that so if you keep those three
points<00:05:09.209> in<00:05:09.269> mind<00:05:09.419> paced<00:05:09.659> writing<00:05:09.869> is<00:05:09.959> really

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
points in mind paced writing is really

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.959 
points in mind paced writing is really
easy<00:05:10.289> so<00:05:10.889> we<00:05:11.039> turn<00:05:11.189> that<00:05:11.309> one<00:05:11.459> song<00:05:11.699> on<00:05:11.819> out

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:18.899 
gonna move this fader up so that I'm not

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:20.179 
gonna move this fader up so that I'm not
cheating<00:05:19.259> I<00:05:19.349> already<00:05:19.589> know<00:05:19.709> where<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:19.889> be<00:05:19.979> man

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189

cheating I already know where to be man
I'm<00:05:21.119> gonna<00:05:21.330> cue<00:05:22.050> it<00:05:22.110> up<00:05:22.169> waves<00:05:22.949> in<00:05:23.069> first<00:05:23.279> beat

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:23.429 
I'm gonna cue it up waves in first beat

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:28.399 
I'm gonna cue it up waves in first beat
down<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.509> first<00:05:24.689> beat<00:05:24.899> and<00:05:27.080> I'm<00:05:28.080> gonna<00:05:28.229> get

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
down the first beat and I'm gonna get

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.019 
down the first beat and I'm gonna get
them<00:05:28.559> my<00:05:29.129> foot<00:05:29.369> going<00:05:29.899> to<00:05:30.899> match<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.229> V<00:05:32.029> good

them my foot going to match the V good

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:42.599 
them my foot going to match the V good
throw

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:42.609 

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:44.709 

so<00:05:43.609> it's<00:05:43.819> too<00:05:43.969> slow<00:05:44.179> so<00:05:44.209> that's<00:05:44.569> down<00:05:44.689> here

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
so it's too slow so that's down here

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.389 
so it's too slow so that's down here
somewhere<00:05:45.259> so<00:05:45.499> it's<00:05:45.649> gonna<00:05:45.829> over<00:05:46.099> adjust

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:46.399 
somewhere so it's gonna over adjust

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.829 
somewhere so it's gonna over adjust
that's<00:05:46.879> give<00:05:47.089> me<00:05:47.149> two<00:05:47.329> slopes<00:05:47.539> when<00:05:47.689> there's<00:05:47.809> a

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
that's give me two slopes when there's a

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.959 
that's give me two slopes when there's a
bring<00:05:48.019> it<00:05:48.139> back<00:05:48.259> up<00:05:48.379> again<00:05:48.759> it's<00:05:49.759> getting<00:05:49.939> a

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
bring it back up again it's getting a

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.039 
bring it back up again it's getting a
little<00:05:50.029> too<00:05:50.239> fast<00:05:50.419> and<00:05:50.599> they're<00:05:50.749> bringing<00:05:50.989> it

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:51.049 
little too fast and they're bringing it

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:54.159 
little too fast and they're bringing it
back<00:05:51.139> down<00:05:51.319> again<00:05:51.349> and<00:05:52.239> then<00:05:53.239> I<00:05:53.299> over<00:05:53.689> just<00:05:53.959> a

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
back down again and then I over just a

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.839 
back down again and then I over just a
