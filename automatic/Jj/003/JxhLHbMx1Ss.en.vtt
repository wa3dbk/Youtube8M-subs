a simple keys to succeed and influence
so<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.200> particular<00:00:40.469> he<00:00:41.160> maps<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
so in particular he maps it out with a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
so in particular he maps it out with a
process<00:00:42.450> called<00:00:42.840> stamp<00:00:43.230> success<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.070> the
