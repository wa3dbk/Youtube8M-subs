00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.750
 i 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.180
 I do not know 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.630
 I know very well what to tell you at this time 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.510
 that two minutes for the biggest battle of 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.200
 our lives as professionals all 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.920
 is summarized to today or we consecrate ourselves as 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.110
 team we do not stay where we are 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.100
 play by play centimeter to 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.860
 centimeter until the final whistle we're 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.350
 at a vital crossroads we can 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.930
 stay there and they take out the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.750
 shit we can not fight for our 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.660
 way back to honor we can 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 leave this hell only you 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.770
 they can do it they are the only owners of 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.339
 your future no one else than you can 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.860
 make this story a legend 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.250
 to recover our honor that of you the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.060
 of the people you do not know very well the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.880
 life gives you and takes away that is part of the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.610
 life but you only assume it when you 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.470
 remove those things that hurt you and you 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.560
 realize that life is only 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.680
 a game of centimeters and so is the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.590
 football because in any game in the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.710
 life or in football the margin of error 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.590
 it's very small half spent late a 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.500
 advance invest a very microsecond 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.050
 slow very fast and you can not get there 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.690
 all those centimeters that we need 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.840
 be there on the court to be in each 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.380
 moment of the game in each minute in each 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.170
 second in this team we fight for each 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.780
 piece of court in this team we 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.000
 we kill every inch by removing the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.110
 rival because we know that if we add 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.200
 all those centimeters that's going to be the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.270
 point difference between winning and losing 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.640
 between living or dying between staying in 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.060
 shadow or retrieve the category is to live 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.780
 something else in any fight wants to be 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.360
 willing to die is who wins his place 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.940
 and I know that if they are willing to live 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.819
 it's because they're still willing to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.580
 fight and die on the court for that 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.550
 centimeter that we lack because that is 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.930
 what it means to live being willing to 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.930
 die for what one loves 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.530
 we have fought a year to recover 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.800
 our respect we are a team with 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.470
 story that does not deserve to be where it is 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.300
 let's return the joy to our people 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.510
 to us to our children now now 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.510
 I can not force them to do it alone 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.940
 Just look at your classmates 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.580
 look them in the eyes and you will see a man 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.610
 willing to run every inch of the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.230
 court for you look at them and they will give a 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.170
 man who is willing to die for 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.860
 this team because he knows that you 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.459
 they will do the same for him that's a team 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.010
 boys because we won it now like 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.819
 a team we do not get lost in the shade 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.900
 as individuals that is soccer gentlemen 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.900
 that's all it is
