00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.969
 greetings to all friends of 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.160
 androidworld.it we are at Beijing this is 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.049
 maze the mx 5 or the new smartphone 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.420
 top of the line range of top house months 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:21.160
 that we say it for now but still it is 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.710
 however successor of mx3 yes 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.720
 also recognizes from the very shapes 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.849
 similar with some news from mine 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.249
 personal point of view anticipate of 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.680
 a few days to those of iphone 6 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.430
 here I say it and here I deny the difference 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.930
 constructive this is an air kraft 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.910
 aluminum aluminum as it should be 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.199
 start a little better or material 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.320
 even lighter and even more 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.120
 resistant compared to the past more 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.969
 convenient opening that can now be done 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.370
 directly with long now I'm not at 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.910
 take it all apart but give you an idea of 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.980
 this processor opts with mediatek 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.620
 what should be 2gb of ram 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.050
 a 5 inch screen and 36 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.280
 full hd resolution more like the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.160
 define them 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.660
 one of the sound dpa and that exceeds 400 of 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.579
 very very nice screen piano a 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.250
 software already in Italian ready in 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.009
 preorder already tonight on a medium 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.780
 punto it therefore also in Italy 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.720
 the interface is new to this is the flai 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 me 4.0 which then we would obviously have the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.270
 time to try in more detail 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.329
 remember a little ios is impossible 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.820
 it is impossible to deny it anyway 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.470
 we will surely have time to try it 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.530
 better music for example one of the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.570
 many totally renewed applications 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.450
 services are obviously integrated for the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.189
 Chinese market but we'll see later in Italy 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.590
 exactly what to expect a 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.840
 product that at first glance is a lot 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.460
 very nice especially from the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.719
 build quality perhaps even more than that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.000
 the example with quality is that 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.490
 the screen is very good 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.869
 I am certainly still to be seen 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.990
 totally renewed camera should 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.730
 be a 27 to 20.7 megapixel with 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.800
 double led flash 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.220
 for this first hands-on from Beijing is 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.220
 all a greeting from the cisotti manuals for 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
