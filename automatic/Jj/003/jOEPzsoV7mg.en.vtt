00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.029
 hello we are now one of you from 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.120
 Matt the bet that is a mobile 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.089
 wireless gaming mouse in the basics 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.499
 from the compact size shows the 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:21.109
 If you look at him in comparison 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:23.170
 to normal sized male hand acts 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.939
 they are then something filigree 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.000
 But what then speaks for the mouse 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.650
 is, so to speak, the versatility despite 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.669
 the compact dimensions so you have 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.980
 of course, then the possibility 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.950
 to make the mouse a little bigger 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.150
 where they want just for the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.760
 Hand can adjust 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.610
 We have a lot of mouse buttons men 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.670
 off especially as the right click the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.310
 left mouse button a middle mouse button 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.620
 the scroll wheel including keys function 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:59.350
 another mouse button on the edge too 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.350
 again two mouse buttons plus 1 53 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.369
 you cut out the one in all, so to speak 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.310
 four directions velvet can push 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.909
 yes that's basically the mouse of 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.909
 optical ago 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:20.350
 which, of course, is such a thing 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.469
 is powered by gaming mice battery 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.009
 with a game report crashes battery 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.829
 empty 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.630
 I was actually no 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.299
 no reason to worry because thanks 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.770
 bluetooth 4.0 technology and now 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.110
 relatively energy efficient which the relatively 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.090
 Energy saving technology is supposed to be the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.189
 Battery according to manufacturer for a year 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.960
 Keep battery change going the ball 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.880
 quite quickly, easily percentage on it 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:52.990
 press pull out batteries exchange 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.549
 insert and continue bluetooth 4.0 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.459
 means you definitely need 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.439
 your computer a bluetooth 4.0 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.929
 connection or here 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.420
 take the supplied dorma that is 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.310
 the household supplied double den 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.929
 you then just connect a computer 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.670
 shortly the software is installed 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.280
 so to speak, the delicacies of the mouse too 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.590
 to be able to use 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.380
 and off you go on the back side 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.079
 you then stop that again 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.900
 surface so to speak so that it very much 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.819
 The mouse can still slide well here 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.840
 in an off switch but you too 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.340
 then just switch off on the way 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.299
 Can that be the battery consumer 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.880
 not additionally burdened by 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.829
 Accessories with cats also has 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.569
 not much like batteries since 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.069
 are with buy then there is a small one 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.200
 transport bag is there and we have 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.459
 a few stickers as well as a small one 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.680
 manual with the short 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.120
 installation options maybe 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.260
 a few technical details, the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.730
 are quite important 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.819
 The mouse has dpi resolution from 25 to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.200
 6400 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:02.709
 dpa you can adjust 25 db 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.859
 short of an acceleration forth to 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.310
 They support up to 50g polling 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.790
 rate 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.469
 that means how many movement 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.129
 be transmitted per second 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.930
 are 120 hertz that means 120 commands 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.209
 so to speak can in one second 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.980
 transfer 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.290
 the tracking speed that is the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.540
 speed of the mouse that you 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.400
 can record six meters or 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.400
 up to six meters per second 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.310
 continue to go it just has a 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.609
 Distance from bluetooth receiver to 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.519
 there are about ten meters around 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.799
 different colors so I hope you 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.230
 had short introductions failed 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.919
 So you just look around again 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.349
 in comparison, just like a hand 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.669
 lies 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.349
 by the way, they can be quite good 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.349
 uses one gets well at the keys ran 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.430
 that's just another one 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.739
 attitude thing like hard and small 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.620
 get used to it if you stop it in 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.199
 my eyes much smaller than one 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.900
 gaming mouse on the stationary computer but 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.579
 for mobile and mobile use 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.229
 You always put a lot of money here 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.209
 that the equipment has also small 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.970
 are compact and you really have one here 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.729
 a very small pleasant gaming mouse 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.620
 so much too dull kenseth m 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.979
 I hope you enjoyed it until the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.979
 next time
