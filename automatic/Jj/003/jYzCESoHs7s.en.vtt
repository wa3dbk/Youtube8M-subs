 nenamark2 average number of frames per 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.769
 second in this test was 20 34 and 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.769

 the bigger he doesn't show top 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.260
 performance but also costs much 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.150
 fewer flagship solutions others 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.350
 companies and of course undoubtedly 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.480
 advantage is the biggest 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.700
 battery in its price segment for 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.700
 many it will be important bye
