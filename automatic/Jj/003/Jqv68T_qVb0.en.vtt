00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so on this project we're building a

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.050 
so on this project we're building a
woodshed<00:00:03.680> from<00:00:04.680> scratch<00:00:05.069> no<00:00:05.430> plans<00:00:05.790> or

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
woodshed from scratch no plans or

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.550 
woodshed from scratch no plans or
anything<00:00:06.270> we're<00:00:06.629> just<00:00:06.660> kind<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.049> making<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.470> up

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
anything we're just kind of making it up

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.930 
anything we're just kind of making it up
as<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.799> go<00:00:07.980> along<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.550> turning<00:00:08.760> out<00:00:08.880> really

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
as we go along it's turning out really

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.720 
as we go along it's turning out really
nice<00:00:09.710> we<00:00:10.710> kind<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.040> wanted<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.280> have<00:00:11.370> it

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
nice we kind of wanted to have it

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.880 
nice we kind of wanted to have it
eight-by-twelve<00:00:12.980> with<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:15.139> sloped<00:00:16.139> roof<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
eight-by-twelve with the sloped roof and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.480 
eight-by-twelve with the sloped roof and
then<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> little<00:00:17.400> overhang<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> front

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
then a little overhang on the front

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.210 
then a little overhang on the front
we've<00:00:20.490> done<00:00:21.650> 6x6<00:00:22.650> beams<00:00:23.810> for<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> posts<00:00:25.380> this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we've done 6x6 beams for the posts this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
we've done 6x6 beams for the posts this
is<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:27.289> gravel<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.439> here

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
is just going to get gravel in here

is just going to get gravel in here
we're<00:00:28.859> gonna<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.130> putting<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:29.849> two<00:00:30.060> by<00:00:30.210> sixes

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
we're gonna be putting some two by sixes

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080 
we're gonna be putting some two by sixes
on<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:31.320> twelve<00:00:31.619> inch<00:00:31.769> centers<00:00:32.070> gives<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
on about twelve inch centers gives it a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
on about twelve inch centers gives it a
nice<00:00:33.270> surface<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> wood<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.590> stacked

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
nice surface for the wood to be stacked

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.490 
nice surface for the wood to be stacked
on<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.239> allows<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.780> air<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.170> move

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
on it and it allows for air to move

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.590 
on it and it allows for air to move
underneath<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.370> wood<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> dry<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.940> out

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
underneath the wood to dry it out

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.590 
underneath the wood to dry it out
come<00:00:40.290> along<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.739> back<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:42.480> know

look so we're gonna have we got the
three<00:00:45.480> posts<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.350> where<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.160> framing

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
three posts and then where that framing

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.279 
three posts and then where that framing
is<00:00:47.670> we're<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.090> putting<00:00:48.870> some<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
is we're gonna be putting some of the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.060 
is we're gonna be putting some of the
party<00:00:49.710> board<00:00:49.920> fiber<00:00:51.050> siding<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> very

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
party board fiber siding which is very

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.360 
party board fiber siding which is very
resilient<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> water<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:56.070> might<00:00:56.250> be

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
resilient for the water and we might be

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.709 
resilient for the water and we might be
doing<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> metal<00:00:56.910> roof<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.300> haven't<00:00:57.510> decided

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
framing on the roof then we can get our

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.300 
framing on the roof then we can get our
we're<00:01:09.479> gonna<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.720> using<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.140> by<00:01:10.260> four<00:01:10.939> cedar

we're gonna be using one by four cedar
three-quarter<00:01:14.310> inch<00:01:14.810> for<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.840> roof<00:01:16.200> gives<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
three-quarter inch for the roof gives it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.880 
three-quarter inch for the roof gives it
a<00:01:16.860> nice<00:01:17.040> finishing<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> framing<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.049> out

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
pressure-treated lumber which is real

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.149 
pressure-treated lumber which is real
nice<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.720> hobby<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.259> course<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.860> said

nice and the hobby of course is I said
the<00:01:26.310> posts<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.790> six<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:27.720> six<00:01:28.020> rough<00:01:28.229> cut<00:01:28.439> cedar

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the posts are six by six rough cut cedar

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.450 
the posts are six by six rough cut cedar
so<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.430> combination<00:01:29.869> gives<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.460> nice

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
so the combination gives it that nice

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.700 
so the combination gives it that nice
look<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.119> cedar<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> be

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
look of all cedar and it's going to be

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.280 
look of all cedar and it's going to be
really<00:01:34.920> resilient<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.420> weather<00:01:37.020> out

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
really resilient for the weather out

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
really resilient for the weather out
here<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.400> rain<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.909> during

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
here because it can rain a lot during

the winter seasons and the walls is you
can<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.869> they're<00:01:43.049> gonna<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.290> off<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.710> ground

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
can see they're gonna be off the ground

can see they're gonna be off the ground
we're<00:01:45.149> gonna<00:01:45.210> allow<00:01:45.509> about<00:01:45.780> four<00:01:46.049> inches<00:01:46.290> we

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
we're gonna allow about four inches we

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.899 
we're gonna allow about four inches we
still<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> grade<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.490> more<00:01:47.640> but

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
still got a grade that a little more but

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
still got a grade that a little more but
it's<00:01:48.270> gonna<00:01:48.390> allow<00:01:48.509> air<00:01:49.079> movement<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.829> get

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it's gonna allow air movement to get

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's gonna allow air movement to get
underneath<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.490> wood<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.000> dry<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.540> out<00:01:51.750> as

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
underneath the wood and dry it out as

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.510 
underneath the wood and dry it out as
well<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:54.320> when<00:01:55.320> you're<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.680> closing<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.369> in

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
well as when you're not closing it in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.840 
well as when you're not closing it in

triple to buy or a triple to buy ten
and<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.570> 6x6

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and then we have actually this is a 6x6

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.190 
and then we have actually this is a 6x6
and<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.890> could<00:02:17.040> see<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.370> been<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:19.140> been

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and if you could see it's been it's been

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.550 
and if you could see it's been it's been
notched<00:02:19.500> into<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.250> beam<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.750> gives<00:02:22.200> us

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.520 

training<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.950> allow<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.530> front

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
training to allow for this front

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.910 
training to allow for this front
overhang<00:02:29.130> which<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.360> keep<00:02:30.890> some<00:02:31.890> of

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
overhang which is going to keep some of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580 
overhang which is going to keep some of
the<00:02:32.040> water<00:02:32.250> out<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:34.020> whole<00:02:34.260> front

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the water out and this this whole front

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.700 
the water out and this this whole front
area<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.640> be<00:02:35.700> open<00:02:36.230> if<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.620> going

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
area is going to be open if it's going

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.470 
area is going to be open if it's going
to<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> problem<00:02:38.460> down<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.760> road<00:02:38.790> we're

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
to be a problem down the road we're

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.660 
to be a problem down the road we're
gonna<00:02:39.600> end<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.050> maybe<00:02:40.620> putting<00:02:40.890> some<00:02:40.980> doors<00:02:41.400> on

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
gonna end up maybe putting some doors on

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.570 
gonna end up maybe putting some doors on
it<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.210> should<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:43.770> way<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.040> wind<00:02:44.250> goes

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
it but it should the way the wind goes

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.740 
it but it should the way the wind goes
from<00:02:45.300> here<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.750> should<00:02:45.990> end<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:47.480> staying<00:02:48.480> dry

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
from here it should end up staying dry

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.830 
from here it should end up staying dry
so<00:02:49.790> projects<00:02:50.790> moving<00:02:51.000> along<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.570> should

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
so projects moving along and we should

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.300 
so projects moving along and we should
have<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.050> wrapped<00:02:52.350> up<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.800> next<00:02:52.980> couple

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
have it wrapped up in the next couple

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.340 
have it wrapped up in the next couple
days
