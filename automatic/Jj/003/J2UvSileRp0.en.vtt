as<00:00:00.269> a<00:00:00.750> child<00:00:01.199> I<00:00:01.500> used<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.770> look<00:00:01.949> through<00:00:02.129> my

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
as a child I used to look through my

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.160 
as a child I used to look through my
telescope<00:00:02.280> at<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.149> planet<00:00:03.510> Saturn<00:00:03.990> and

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
telescope at the planet Saturn and

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.740 
telescope at the planet Saturn and
wonder<00:00:04.620> at<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.430> mystery<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.940> its<00:00:06.089> rings<00:00:06.420> and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
wonder at the mystery of its rings and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.839 
wonder at the mystery of its rings and
the<00:00:06.839> distance<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.500> separated<00:00:08.130> us<00:00:08.400> those

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the distance that separated us those

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.020 
the distance that separated us those
fuzzy<00:00:09.240> images<00:00:10.019> created<00:00:10.860> great<00:00:11.219> intrigue<00:00:11.790> in

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the planet and the Rings is the planet

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.040 
the planet and the Rings is the planet
Venus<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.899> bit<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> left

Venus and a bit up and to the left

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
Venus and a bit up and to the left
looking<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.170> bit<00:00:49.350> blue<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:50.879> anyway<00:00:51.120> that's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
looking a bit blue but anyway that's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.590 
looking a bit blue but anyway that's
Mars<00:00:51.920> not<00:00:52.920> looking<00:00:53.250> red<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.850> whatever<00:00:54.059> reason

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
Mars not looking red for whatever reason

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.410 
Mars not looking red for whatever reason
and<00:00:54.800> then<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.100> straight<00:00:56.579> across<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and then going straight across the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750 
and then going straight across the
planet<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:58.379> around<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> Rings<00:00:59.129> perhaps<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
planet go around the Rings perhaps to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.590 
planet go around the Rings perhaps to
have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> closer<00:01:00.510> look<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:01.020> them<00:01:02.270> look<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
have a closer look at them look at the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.450 
have a closer look at them look at the
detail<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.680> Rings<00:01:06.380> simply<00:01:07.380> astonishing

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.330 

okay<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.700> over<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.119> other<00:01:12.270> side<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
okay right over the other side is the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.469 
okay right over the other side is the
blue<00:01:17.610> planet<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.479> us<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.240> see

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
blue planet which is us and you can see

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.899 
blue planet which is us and you can see
the<00:01:21.630> disc<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.350> form<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.430> prove<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the disc that we form to prove that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.770 
the disc that we form to prove that
rather<00:01:24.270> than<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> pinpoint<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.439> light<00:01:26.780> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
rather than like a pinpoint of light it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.649 
rather than like a pinpoint of light it
is<00:01:28.020> us<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:28.939> perhaps<00:01:29.939> even<00:01:30.329> more

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
is us and then perhaps even more

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.980 
is us and then perhaps even more
astonishingly<00:01:31.729> down<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> left<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.750> have

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
astonishingly down to the left we have

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.870 
astonishingly down to the left we have
amazing<00:01:35.270> pictures<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:37.130> Saturn's<00:01:38.130> moons<00:01:38.220> or

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
amazing pictures of Saturn's moons or

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
amazing pictures of Saturn's moons or
cut<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> couple<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.630> Saturn's<00:01:40.020> moons<00:01:40.259> anyway<00:01:40.770> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
cut a couple of Saturn's moons anyway I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.090 
cut a couple of Saturn's moons anyway I
believe<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:42.270> Prometheus<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:46.100> perhaps

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
believe that's Prometheus and perhaps

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.700 
believe that's Prometheus and perhaps
most<00:01:47.610> remarkable<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:51.270> moon

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
most remarkable of all is the moon

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.429 
most remarkable of all is the moon
Enceladus<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
Enceladus and you can see it's a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.469 
Enceladus and you can see it's a
reflection<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> light<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.180> sun's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
reflection of the light of the sun's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
reflection of the light of the sun's
light<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.869> Saturn<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.710> shadow<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.399> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
light of Saturn and the shadow that it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.050 
light of Saturn and the shadow that it
casts<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.780> ring<00:02:01.049> itself<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:02.060> issuing

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
casts in the ring itself and issuing

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.010 
casts in the ring itself and issuing
from<00:02:03.360> its<00:02:03.600> South<00:02:03.930> Pole<00:02:04.189> are<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.460> icy<00:02:06.450> whatever

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
from its South Pole are the icy whatever

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.249 
from its South Pole are the icy whatever
that<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.979> still<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.369> investigated<00:02:09.390> but

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
that is still to be investigated but

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.980 
that is still to be investigated but
that<00:02:11.090> white<00:02:12.090> issue

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
that white issue

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.250 
that white issue
there<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.530> from<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> moon<00:02:14.610> itself<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
there is from the moon itself and is

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.030 
there is from the moon itself and is
believed<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.280> create<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.300> ring<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:20.010> that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
believed to create this ring so that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.120 
believed to create this ring so that
whatever<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:20.880> issuing<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.710> South

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
whatever it is issuing out of the South

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.600 
whatever it is issuing out of the South
Pole<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.700> moon<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.600> creating<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:26.220> ring

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
Pole of the moon is creating that ring

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.280 
Pole of the moon is creating that ring
and<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.270> we<00:02:27.450> zoom<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:28.080> slowly<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.840> see

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and so if we zoom out slowly and see

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.390 
and so if we zoom out slowly and see
where<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.370> relation<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.990> planet<00:02:34.560> so

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
where it is in relation to the planet so

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.780 
where it is in relation to the planet so
there's<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.090> colitis<00:02:37.040> Prometheus<00:02:38.040> Earth<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.760> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
there's in colitis Prometheus Earth is a
