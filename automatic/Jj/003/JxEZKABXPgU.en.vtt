00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.820
 one of the most successful and what is even more interesting 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.139
 Ingrid Klimke is next to me most versatile riders in Germany 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.410
 Years old, they already work together with the company Equestre Watch how is it too 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.429
 come to this cooperation 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.649
 the GEMAC is not started then 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.970
 and since I am always convinced of the products "I am very happy that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.529
 we already have a decade-long partnership and are fine together 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 exchange as eventing rider everything is demanded forms the horse 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.039
 from the athletes 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.510
 we help them with the products, for example, once the products 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.530
 DTM drives to become Keith 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 in the market whether be used Eliza and that so that electrolytes 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.910
 versatility - Verdi Top game is just in the hot temperatures 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.460
 It then important that you have enough electrolytes 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 again the BAFA on no that can easily pour over the water and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.470
 The ferry everyone likes to take 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.720
 also for the content of the Spring Federer hot days highly recommended 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.500
 or at home my workout thats I think the product is almost Ronson 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 most common detention 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.160
 Here you can see here at the Bundeschampionat straight young horses here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.110
 are represented 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.890
 There are also opportunities to build up a young leader 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.070
 to be there to help 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789
 very important because you have to support the young horses 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.899
 Musculature needs to be built up but also see ligaments and joints 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:14.760
 strengthen 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.180
 Triforce, for example, is ideal for that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.260
 because you can not really do much anymore these days you always have to 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.900
 make sure that the blog is on the 11th of therefore I am very happy that 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 These products are all doping free and you can easily get the young horses in 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.580
 can accompany the development 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.650
 This is just with the application that is often still so intimate sweeping Niemann 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.829
 the animals are up 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.740
 Satisfied in the insider also very satisfied so way with one for the food always 

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:39.880
 everything with it 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.530
 then it becomes a big spoon and the one touched at times 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.240
 everyone likes to meet them then no problems at all 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.150
 product 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.140
 we are 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.890
 Fehr all different so each one is an individual is individual 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.820
 yes, just the large range of Agnes Sturm is figuratively beneficial 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.380
 Werder has ten different ones 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.540
 Types like must and can be supported 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.310
 and that's where the palette is so balanced you really are for everyone 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.910
 Also what I think I am excited about even by the megatrends that is 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.799
 Karsten Tadda minerals 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.479
 or the cell phone numbers when you grow in the fur then he has problems 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:20.109
 or the feeling of being skater-slack or somehow it kinda feels like it 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.209
 in addition to the track then you can also so that everyone is accepted and the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.519
 give meaningless kick 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.430
 we values ​​the holidays in the house Klimke are well looked after 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.150
 and continue to keep their fingers crossed in the sport
