this textured polish you're going to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.410 
this textured polish you're going to
need<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.440> use<00:01:17.470> two<00:01:17.830> coats<00:01:18.130> so<00:01:18.910> I<00:01:18.940> applied<00:01:19.240> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
need to use two coats so I applied the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.300 
need to use two coats so I applied the
first<00:01:19.660> coat<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.200> I'll<00:01:20.500> let<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.800> dry<00:01:21.009> for<00:01:21.040> about

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
first coat and I'll let it dry for about

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.240 
first coat and I'll let it dry for about
30<00:01:21.729> seconds<00:01:22.300> then<00:01:23.140> I'll<00:01:23.320> apply<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.619> second

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
30 seconds then I'll apply the second

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.980 
30 seconds then I'll apply the second
coat<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.700> then<00:01:25.150> I'll<00:01:25.270> remove<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.750> tape

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
coat and then I'll remove the tape

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.109 
coat and then I'll remove the tape
you're<00:01:26.619> going<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:26.920> want<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.160> remove<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.910> tape

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
you're going to want to remove the tape

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.730 
you're going to want to remove the tape
while<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.390> polish<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.869> still<00:01:29.080> slightly<00:01:29.320> wet

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
while the polish is still slightly wet

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.200 
while the polish is still slightly wet
so<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.100> could<00:01:30.280> get<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.460> really<00:01:30.759> clean<00:01:30.970> line

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
so you could get a really clean line

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.330 
so you could get a really clean line
since<00:01:32.170> you've<00:01:32.320> made<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.619> tape<00:01:32.830> in<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.070> cross

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
since you've made the tape in a cross

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.910 
since you've made the tape in a cross
pattern<00:01:33.369> you<00:01:33.910> can<00:01:33.940> reuse<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.390> four<00:01:34.810> times<00:01:35.050> so

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
pattern you can reuse it four times so

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.740 
pattern you can reuse it four times so
just<00:01:36.280> use<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.460> different<00:01:36.880> corner<00:01:37.119> on<00:01:37.420> one<00:01:37.630> of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
just use a different corner on one of

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.480 
just use a different corner on one of
your<00:01:37.960> other<00:01:38.050> nails<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.560> continue<00:01:39.070> these<00:01:39.250> same

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
your other nails and continue these same

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.410 
your other nails and continue these same
steps

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 

after<00:01:43.380> putting<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> turquoise<00:01:44.250> triangle<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
after putting a turquoise triangle on

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.920
