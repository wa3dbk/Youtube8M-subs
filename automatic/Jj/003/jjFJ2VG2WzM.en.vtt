 Well, it was going to be the way you eat alive 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.880
 to everyone's surprise the el tuit 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.320
 reached 400 tweets or 300 in two days like this 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.150
 how good and to this day they follow 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.640
 giving retweets so I do not know the preview 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.800
 to see how ok did not actually have 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.420
 I intend to upload video until Thursday more 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.490
 or less that the super hero ends a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.840
 limit and will upload videos as how 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.340
 they have but that so good did not have 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.320
 I'm going to go up so, like I said 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.520
 short because if I take you away from here it 's 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.710
 he told me to do the preview that 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 I always felt with the previews 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 and well let's record 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.320
 they have excuse me I'm still a little weird 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.790
 a little strange I feel is already 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 it's been a long, long time 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 recorded so good let's start 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.220
 let's start because you have less than 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.649
 home because it's a main screen 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 to say it because I want to show you 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.820
 that changes does not add us or is not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.110
 come on we can add from in the world or 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.200
 if in the world of us I do not have to 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.600
 expose or put commands or take anything 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.759
 because the change already begins once 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.170
 you enter your moment ok for example I 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.549
 believe that a world with a seed that is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.770
 the robot seed so that those who have 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.840
 doubts and good because it appears side with 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.000
 village so good will show the world and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
 as you see once entering the world already 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.750
 would see the change as see here we have to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 the villagers are new villagers that we 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.190
 add the mod 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.709
 the mod the mod sorry and as you see here 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.690
 they would be here let's fly I would have a 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.680
 taste the builder that good these 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.670
 names we will be forever 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.200
 but 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.880
 they have them momentarily that is 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.470
 it is simply for the moment that for 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.330
 that you want taquito of that or so that 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.620
 they had more or less name so that 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.599
 make the proper ticket 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.080
 we have someone here 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.940
 librarian or the law that there has been wave 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.160
 and we already have the jockey 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.560
 there are four corners at the moment 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.760
 only but add I think in total 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.340
 they will be like seven more or less than 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.720
 go to add to the bad way because good 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.630
 depending each village no no if I 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.460
 understand for example the librarian 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.160
 is going to be a villager be a different 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.740
 skin the blacksmith will be another and so on 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.880
 example not for me to understand not here 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.460
 we have to see consultant that yes already what 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.260
 saw have not seen have not seen 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.710
 there are two men and two women 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.500
 we will have here the farmer or 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.819
 find alicia hand I'm alicia by alicia 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.439
 you comment 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.439
 and we would have finally 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.490
 already showed two men true 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.490
 or the scout is hard 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.490
 the explorer who must walk around here 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.970
 he is a man made to his name as you see 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.970
 there would be 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.360
 in this time or in this course 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.650
 in that time it will be and when we 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.560
 let's get closer to here I do not know what to call it 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.360
 single entity not a citizen villager to 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.860
 a person let's call him a 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.630
 villager ok 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.190
 by the extremes to a villager already what 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.270
 we are seeing this in front of us is going to 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.770
 appear an interaction button that I 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.120
 I guess he's going to say interact or 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.690
 something like that good but in English 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.610
 no and good to come, we will open the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.160
 menu not the menu to interact 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.810
 with him and for the moment as taquito no 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.820
 what has been added is not going to add 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.820
 worry because like crazy 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.660
 at the moment it is simply love 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.720
 for the moment it is simply touching the 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.889
 diana galdeano to the villager citizen as 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.720
 they want to say I do not know what to call him 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.850
 good for the day not as if we touch it 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.470
 the name of the villager would appear 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.060
 we'll make hearts appear 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.430
 they have on it the button 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.930
 interact that would be more or less to 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.759
 talk to talk to tell the 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.070
 little one of that you do not already know all 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.229
 the story I do not know where was the omi that 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.250
 it would be so that you do not follow the stay button 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.990
 which is so that it stays still in a 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.610
 just place the special button that is for 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.659
 hire him so I do not know 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:06.509
 min do your work the button of the trade 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:09.030
 or needing a lot already has many already 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.069
 they are voted to treat what comments we are going 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.270
 to be able to bring here what 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.849
 the truth that is going to be a very complete 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.770
 the world of the trader ok and the button 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.240
 select house this is so that the 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.520
 selection of your house practically not 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.629
 for example if it is already gone and it is done 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.069
 night is the pattern transporting in the 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:27.190
 night automatically to sleep on the button 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.169
 to the button to the place where we read it 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.840
 we select as house ok for that goes to 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.940
 work and good no more than nothing is 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.889
 for that so well we hope that 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.350
 taquito congratulate them of that 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.090
 ah and that 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.740
 something I want to tell you is that the mode 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.840
 of is compatible with textures that is if 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.980
 you use a texture the buttons 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.270
 you are going to see us as these as 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.100
 minecraft but it's going to look like the 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.100
 texture they have using which 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.460
 it is very very very well 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.050
 already very well we are doing very well ok now 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.300
 when I want to show you 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.129
 ok those that press the mode many times 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.449
 and moved 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.819
 give a small cut 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.139
 well what I meant with the buttons 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.610
 since it will be compatible with textures 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.930
 is that for example these buttons that 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.759
 they saw there in the in the consell 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.439
 how is that style are going to change 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.819
 make up the texture for example the 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.960
 so tan dragon will look like wood 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.930
 the buttons and it's going to be very father the 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.550
 that's really very, very cool, like that 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.409
 I also want to show that if 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.969
 we go out and we enter the world is not going to 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.139
 affect anything in the world or whether they will 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.749
 to remain villagers which is 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.189
 very cool today we enter again and there 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:31.319
 is what you have are the villagers 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.909
 ocean we can also go out and enter the 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.050
 world as many times as we want and go to 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.029
 remain villagers which is very 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.310
 ok ok so good also around here 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.810
 we have the other objects the objects 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.770
 that beyond us the way we have the 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.689
 engagement ring so that we 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.330
 let's marry the ring is normal so that 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:46.620
 the villagers get married the babies the 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.129
 tombstones with someone dies 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:54.499
 a gravestone remains 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:55.909
 Spaniards and villagers spammers 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:57.649
 we have the whistle that is to call 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.959
 the whole family is going to report when 

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:02.029
 we touch it automatically we have this 

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:03.949
 editor ticket that is to change the 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.679
 skins to change that name everything is what 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.509
 which is going to be very very very father 

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:11.779
 we would have this that is like a paper 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.909
 more or less like a document that 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:16.159
 I will explain what is good for not 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:18.529
 it serves them as nothing I will explain it in 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:24.189
 the first more equal review is not for 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:24.189
 I can or can not you 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.190
 name as your relative or something like that 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.960
 so nothing they hope that I have 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.970
 liked excuse me if you are locking me 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.890
 much that happens is that it has a lot 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.990
 I say he did not record so the groups nothing 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.849
 droid until the next bye bye spiders 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.479
 Take care bye 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.479

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.680
 but it is
