 objects here and you will find yourself without weapons 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.100
 and just buy a weapon and you 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.890
 you will find yourself with more main weapons 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.630

 glitch now guys we're in whiteout 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.489
 and I'll show you two little easter eggs the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.350
 first regards something that it really is 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.910
 more an association than a true e 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.799
 own easter egg that is the fact that 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.480
 those oil platforms on 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.269
 background appear to be those of the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.400
 khost campaign is those of 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.080
 campaign of some special missions of 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.480
 some special modern people 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.640
 warfare 2 the second is unisex 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.190
 I don't know if it's random or wanted because of it 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.000
 these cases the name was deleted 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.180
 the symbol below to write the writing 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.810
 hicks which is the name of a secret ship 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.360
 and super powerful of an online game 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.640
 called galaxy on fire 2 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.010
 I don't know if it's a nice pre-run track 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.690
 because it is strange that they added 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.229
 this writing or maybe something 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.910
 random 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.440
 regarding the next easter 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.210

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.870
 mission all nothing that is the name of 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.520
 one of the characters of the campaign of 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.900
 black ops 1 is not the first time 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.910
 it happens because 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.470
 in the campaigns of all the goals there 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.870
 they often use the names of characters 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.240
 fundamental or however important of the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.139
 campaign even better success way 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.840
 warfare 1 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.820
 however regarding this 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.139
 new easter egg guys here is a 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.860
 reference to the movie save the soldier 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.539

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.410

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.350
