00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello well this time we're going 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.750
 do a reactivity test on the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:17.340
 new v3 for that I took me I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.500
 caught two ferrous here of concrete reinforcing bar 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 here you see there are two concrete bars 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 that I pose here and there hop at 6 cm a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 currency too slab that you saw in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.660
 other cities and I put it here 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.190
 the principle so the principle so and of 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 first go on ferrous 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.079
 normal speed and then see if we 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.489
 take the money out there these are 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.469
 extreme conditions 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 because you will see I'll go 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.230
 do the test in reactivity 1 and in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 responsiveness 5 and you'll see the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.120
 difference that there is between the two so 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.390
 I start first to show you the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.000
 ferrous which I am in adjustment of or 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.000
 fast to a responsiveness 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.100
 here you have read not understand the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.100
 ferrous there I put the change here 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.430
 always go through the series first 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 as you can see the mauny 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.299
 sputter do not I take now 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.299
 will put me to four of responsiveness 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:59.289
 here we hear it twice 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:02:13.150
 take his edge six and that edge I 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:15.360
 returns to a reactivity she trash 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.360
 lot 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.890
 I put 4,9 activesync now from 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.890
 reactivity 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.060
 the very collective apparatus very reactive 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.940
 it's twice on the currency is 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.360
 so to show you the responsiveness of the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.280
 deus ie its speed to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.400
 activate 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.440
 after cutting on a target I put six 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.420
 coins of 10 cents 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.820
 next to each other are not there 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.810
 very nice because I found the beach 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.750
 here and you will see 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.380
 hassen responsiveness how the deus takes 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.830
 the currencies first I put myself to one of 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.830
 reactivity 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.630
 as you can see it 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:22.650
 take a change I put myself now 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:24.450
 to reactivity scene its maximum I 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:34.530
 go as fast as possible but did not miss 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:37.290
 no reactivity as you come from 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.020
 to see it is the capacity of a device 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.330
 to reactivate the fastest 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.850
 possible after cutting on a ferrous or 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.980
 on another target in this case there 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.680
 you have six currencies the device takes 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.010
 2.6 at whatever speed at 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.730
 which one sees is really 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.730
 exceptional here is
