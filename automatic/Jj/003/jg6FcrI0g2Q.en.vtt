00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.960
 I will say that the next video will be 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.400

 brass fireplace lair granny 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 now double click showed low 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.850
 war more often 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.550
 I will show you how they feel there 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.940
 not double or triple may be by 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.899
 one for two for three that is also low 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.140
 the sounds are also very tasty on the hunt 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.330
 beads book you using these sounds 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:18.720
 different you can talk sitting 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:21.600
 goose arches on earth how to make double 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.259
 i.e. single za beads we made out 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.540
 begins with some hoarse goal further 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:36.619
 at closing at setting end 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:39.210
 so how would it turn out like in the end 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 additionally a portion of air from the mouth like 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.110
 squeezed out monatik automatically 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.110
 jump to high frequencies will 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.110
 closed 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.979
 how to make double different 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.700
 sound shown 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:09.970
 just so little 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.680
 in different intonation is pronounced double 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.190
 There are several sound 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:21.250
 i will show two of them now that's what you 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:34.959
 now heard and the fact that geese flying 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:37.480
 geese from afar utter differ in 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.970
 basically you are the gun that is in the first 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.400
 case you need a thin jet to blow very 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.620
 Dramatically decoy in this case that the case keep 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.930
 little as usual but instead this time 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.930
 Snow doing here so fingers as if 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.829
 blocking the hole of the remaining fingers 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:05.680
 This is the way you can 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:07.690
 add on the position of the flute that is 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.700
 you can find it in different positions 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.090
 Originally recommend here as 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.579
 showed it easier for mastering and for 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.120
 so that you get used to what kind of sound 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:22.319
 get recommended immediately 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.609
 learning to shoot on the phone on 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:34.389
 webcam on camcorder this will help in 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:36.940
 Further parsing when working on 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.670
 errors that may be someone 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.760
 there may be a perception 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.569
 our ears are different we are different 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.910
 hear not only others but yourself 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.910
 try to do a little experiment 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.800
 how to suggest and talk 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.520
 say something and offer in front 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.580
 cheeks ears attack 2 hands and you will see 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.230
 that the perception of your sound is completely 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.260
 other you in another way even hear yourself and 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.049
 when will you do this video recording 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.579
 when learning at least occasionally interrupt 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.639
 on your own 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.479
 there will be an adaptation of hearing you will 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:28.240
 perceive this most real 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.490
 believable steel also refers to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.200
 talk in electronic t - shirts when 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.530
 They say there are no records like that on 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.600
 electronic decoys motors they are prohibited 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.510
 i will just disappoint so many why u 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.479
 caterpillars of children because not only that 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.640
 it is recorded there that they did not record 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.440
 versed if only cry was 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.450
 and there can often be a cry 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.210
 hazards in addition have digital recording 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.390
 There is not even in the record and reproducing 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.780
 devices there is a big minus is electro 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.510
