ABS on the tire pressure sensor I always

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.129 
ABS on the tire pressure sensor I always
like<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.770> use<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.069> original<00:00:08.580> factory<00:00:09.139> sensor

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
like to use the original factory sensor

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.749 
like to use the original factory sensor
but<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.559> particular<00:00:10.830> case<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
but in this particular case it's on the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.450 
but in this particular case it's on the
national<00:00:12.179> backorder<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.620> unable<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.130> be

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
national backorder and it's unable to be

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.450 
national backorder and it's unable to be
to<00:00:14.849> be<00:00:14.969> had<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.619> able<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.980> pick<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
to be had so I was able to pick up a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.570 
to be had so I was able to pick up a
aftermarket<00:00:18.210> sensor<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.130> put<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.250> into<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
aftermarket sensor and put it into the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.720 
aftermarket sensor and put it into the
tire<00:00:20.789> already<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.430> now<00:00:23.430> we're<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.670> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
tire already and now we're going to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.759 
tire already and now we're going to
retrain<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.260> let's<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.949> started<00:00:27.619> in<00:00:28.619> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
retrain it so let's get started in this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.650 
retrain it so let's get started in this
video<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> show<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.789> how<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
video I'm going to show you how to to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
video I'm going to show you how to to
retrain<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.289> car<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.710> recognize<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> new

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
retrain your car to recognize a new

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.250 
retrain your car to recognize a new
sensor<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.570> you've<00:00:33.719> got<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> change<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
sensor when you've got to change the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.190 
sensor when you've got to change the
sensor<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> fit<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.540> tires<00:00:36.840> for

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
sensor for the for the fit of tires for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.530 
sensor for the for the fit of tires for
the<00:00:37.230> air<00:00:37.680> pressure<00:00:37.950> sensor<00:00:38.520> there's<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the air pressure sensor there's a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.240 
the air pressure sensor there's a
Chrysler<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.460> 2003<00:00:41.570> Chrysler<00:00:42.570> 300m<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.469> lot<00:00:44.129> of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
Chrysler a 2003 Chrysler 300m a lot of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940 
Chrysler a 2003 Chrysler 300m a lot of
the<00:00:44.309> Chrysler's<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.950> reprogrammed

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the Chrysler's can all be reprogrammed

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.940 
the Chrysler's can all be reprogrammed
this<00:00:47.309> way<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:48.320> what<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> need<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.770> need

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
this way also what you need is you need

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.709 
this way also what you need is you need
the<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.520> magnet<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> actually<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the the magnet that actually is in a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
the the magnet that actually is in a
trunk<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> car<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> don't<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
trunk of the car if you don't have a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.660 
trunk of the car if you don't have a
magnet<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> use<00:00:55.860> any

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
magnet then you can then you can use any

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.549 
magnet then you can then you can use any
other<00:00:56.910> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> magnet<00:00:57.539> alright<00:00:58.410> what

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
other kind of a magnet alright what

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.869 
other kind of a magnet alright what
you're<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.609> course

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you're going to do is you of course

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.160 
you're going to do is you of course
you're<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> replace<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.660> sensor<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you're going to replace the sensor in

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
you're going to replace the sensor in
the<00:01:01.289> wheel<00:01:01.469> itself<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> new<00:01:02.640> sensor<00:01:03.059> on

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the wheel itself put the new sensor on

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.359 
the wheel itself put the new sensor on
already<00:01:03.600> once<00:01:04.320> you've<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> new<00:01:04.890> sensor

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
already once you've got the new sensor

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
already once you've got the new sensor
in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> tire<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> tire<00:01:06.420> mounted<00:01:06.900> back<00:01:07.080> on
