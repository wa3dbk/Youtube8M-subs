hey guys I made a video if you want to

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.520 
hey guys I made a video if you want to
go<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:11.059> but<00:00:12.080> redstone<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.200> how<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.380> can

go about it but redstone on how you can

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.279 
go about it but redstone on how you can
make<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.740> clock<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.580> redstone<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.289> there's

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
make a clock and redstone and there's

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.109 
make a clock and redstone and there's
bit<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.529> confusion<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.820> just

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
bit of confusion about it so I just

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.500 
bit of confusion about it so I just
wanted<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.600> actually<00:00:19.439> yeah<00:00:20.330> just<00:00:21.330> set

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
wanted to go on actually yeah just set

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.050 
wanted to go on actually yeah just set
something<00:00:21.840> straight<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.550> go<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
something straight so when you go to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.240 
something straight so when you go to
make<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> five<00:00:24.570> five<00:00:25.380> o'clock<00:00:25.800> i<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.130> it's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

still have your two by two and you put
one<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.500> each<00:00:43.620> corner<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> box<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.020> then

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
one on each corner of the box and then

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.069 
one on each corner of the box and then
another<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.940> two<00:00:47.940> blocks<00:00:48.180> away<00:00:50.840> now<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> take

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
another one two blocks away now you take

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
another one two blocks away now you take
your<00:00:52.140> redstone<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.399> take<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.670> redstone

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
your redstone you take your redstone

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
your redstone you take your redstone
torch<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.840> point<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.170> towards<00:00:55.590> where<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
torch and you point it towards where you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
torch and you point it towards where you
want<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> car<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.460> going<00:01:02.059> my<00:01:03.059> time's<00:01:03.629> going

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
want the car to be going my time's going

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.840 
want the car to be going my time's going
on<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:06.930> side<00:01:10.159> now<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.220> hide<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:11.549> redstone

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
on one side now you hide your redstone

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.920 
on one side now you hide your redstone
and<00:01:12.619> that<00:01:13.619> puts<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:15.720> keeps

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and that puts that one out that keeps

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.370 
and that puts that one out that keeps
this<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.409> put<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:19.229> can

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
this one on put this one right you can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
this one on put this one right you can
add<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:21.170> tips<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.880> what's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
add this over tips that one on what's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.100 
add this over tips that one on what's
this<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.119> height<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> see<00:01:27.110> it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
this one height and as you can see it's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:38.660 
this one height and as you can see it's
going<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:30.320> flashing<00:01:31.320> bright<00:01:31.439> way<00:01:37.670> so

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
going on and off flashing bright way so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
going on and off flashing bright way so
as<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.570> extends<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> clock

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
as you can see it extends at the clock

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.920 
as you can see it extends at the clock
on<00:01:41.070> backwards<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.479> amount<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> time

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
on backwards and the the amount of time

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.010 
on backwards and the the amount of time
between<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:47.159> power<00:01:47.460> being<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.329> off<00:01:48.570> it's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
between the power being on and off it's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.760 
between the power being on and off it's
both<00:01:49.259> increased<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:52.200> could<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.740> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
both increased so you could put that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.590 
both increased so you could put that
back<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.250> infinite<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.090> blocks<00:01:54.299> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
back and infinite a lot of blocks and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
back and infinite a lot of blocks and
it'll<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.110> take<00:01:55.350> longer<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.829> spend<00:01:56.040> more

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it'll just take longer to spend more

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
it'll just take longer to spend more
time<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.610> more<00:01:56.640> time<00:01:57.030> off<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.840> could

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
time one more time off and you could

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.310 
time one more time off and you could
probably<00:01:58.649> record<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.670> how<00:01:59.700> much<00:01:59.939> time

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
probably record it and see how much time

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.870 
probably record it and see how much time
if<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.890> needed<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.250> certain<00:02:01.490> amount<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.730> time

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
if you needed a certain amount of time

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.810 
if you needed a certain amount of time
whatever<00:02:02.860> but<00:02:03.860> you<00:02:04.010> can<00:02:04.130> power<00:02:04.340> anything<00:02:04.700> with

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
whatever but you can power anything with

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.460 
whatever but you can power anything with
it<00:02:04.850> seeing<00:02:05.420> part<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.900> this<00:02:05.990> door<00:02:08.110> door<00:02:09.110> open

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
it seeing part of this door door open

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.660 
it seeing part of this door door open
door<00:02:10.399> closed<00:02:10.900> door<00:02:11.900> open<00:02:12.310> door<00:02:13.310> closed<00:02:13.520> and

door closed door open door closed and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.980 
door closed door open door closed and
the<00:02:14.300> last<00:02:14.480> flux<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.050> use<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:16.870> faster<00:02:17.870> it'll

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
the last flux you use the faster it'll

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.800 
the last flux you use the faster it'll
open<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.290> close<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:19.820> thanks<00:02:20.450> for<00:02:20.510> watching
