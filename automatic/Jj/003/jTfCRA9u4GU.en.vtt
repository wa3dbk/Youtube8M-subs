seems<00:00:33.460> that<00:00:33.610> we're<00:00:33.820> talking<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.270> lot<00:00:34.450> about<00:00:34.510> the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
seems that we're talking a lot about the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.110 
seems that we're talking a lot about the
environmental<00:00:35.559> compatibility<00:00:36.160> of<00:00:36.730> cars

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
environmental compatibility of cars

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.299

would<00:01:42.280> really<00:01:42.670> like<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.090> drive<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.570> q3<00:01:44.080> to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
would really like to drive the q3 to

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.040 
would really like to drive the q3 to
Paris<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.800> think<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.730> the<00:01:45.820> elegant<00:01:46.300> lines<00:01:46.630> and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
Paris I think that the elegant lines and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.750 
Paris I think that the elegant lines and
the<00:01:47.170> athletic<00:01:47.740> appearances<00:01:48.430> would<00:01:48.580> be<00:01:48.730> a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
the athletic appearances would be a

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.120 
the athletic appearances would be a
perfect<00:01:49.330> match<00:01:49.570> for<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.960> cityscape<00:01:50.290> so

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
perfect match for the cityscape so

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.570 
perfect match for the cityscape so
that's<00:01:51.340> where<00:01:51.580> I'd<00:01:51.730> like<00:01:51.760> to<00:01:51.970> go<00:01:52.270> take<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.600> spin
