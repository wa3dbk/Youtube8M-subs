 two mode vehicles is then the first

 model vehicle will be and beat the formula 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
 1 is the second it will be a karting 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.019
 so these vehicles were created by 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.279
 subscribe to his channel then as one 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.809
 could have seen it at the gameplay I'm going 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.850
 not introduce yourself and not both 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.290
 vehicles in this video remained fine 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 until the end of the video like that you 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.620
 will understand better and it will be at the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.129
 end of the video it will be the most 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.930
 important 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.789
 but before that I wanted to talk to you about 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.070
 rockstar or know that thomas is a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.480
 modder and him with his modes he can 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.850
 create vehicles as has by 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 example a formula 1 karting and full 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.660
 other vehicles as it has not 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 all the objects of gta 5 he can not in 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 create new ones while rockstar them 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.239
 they can create new objects that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.890
 can add in vehicles and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.229
 make perfect vehicles while 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 thomas he can not alas successfully 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.100
 to create maps in waste from 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.460
 Easter and many other things of this 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 kind 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.970
 so that's what I find unfortunate 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.950
 rockstar could do more 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.380
 of vehicles than thomas and especially of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.540
 vehicles better done because rockstar 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.060
 has much more than thomas at 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.470
 level of objects and so on 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.299
 as I tell you if thomas comes to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.460
 create a vehicle so rockstar can 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.810
 do it knowing that this is the game to 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.490
 rockstar they can do what they 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.229
 want in the game that's it that is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.549
 pity he should listen a little more 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.320
 and the community if they want their 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.640
 I walk a lot more 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.740
 after I have nothing else added to 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.600
 about st as I wanted to promised 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.310
 beginning of the video we will go to the trick 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.380
 the most important so let's talk about 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.909
 Formula 1 and karting 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.259
 if you want to see the gameplay is not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.579
 nothing more simple you just have to 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.710
 go into the description of the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.869
 video I put you the links of the two 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.700
 videos that will redirect you and ben 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.200
 towards thomas's gameplay so the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.750
 Formula 1 and karting 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.439
 I can just say something about 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.540
 these vehicles 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.159
 they are just perfect personally 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.420
 i would like to have them on gta 5 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.399
 but the problem is that it's not 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.899
 possible since rockstar does not listen 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.429
 a lot the community I make you a 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.869
 last call you can find the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.160
 gameplay in the description of the video 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.750
 and especially to support them thomas on you 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.280
