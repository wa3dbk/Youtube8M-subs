shortbread cookies I use my food

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.320 
shortbread cookies I use my food
processor<00:00:12.230> this<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:14.250> makes<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:14.969> easy

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
processor this is what makes it so easy

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.790 
processor this is what makes it so easy
you<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.570> pulse<00:00:16.199> everything<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.650> food

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you just pulse everything in the food

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.349 
you just pulse everything in the food
processor<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.340> then<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.270> is

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
processor and then all you have to do is

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.029 
processor and then all you have to do is
cook<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.320> if<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> don't<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> food

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
cook it so if you don't have a food

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.859 
cook it so if you don't have a food
processor<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:20.939> done<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.119> hand<00:00:21.660> it

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
processor this can be done by hand it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.230 
processor this can be done by hand it
just<00:00:22.050> takes<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.439> bit<00:00:22.619> longer

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
just takes a little bit longer

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.640 
just takes a little bit longer
now<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.449> baking<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.289> really

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
now with all baking it's really

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
now with all baking it's really
important<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.160> measure<00:00:26.430> your<00:00:26.730> flour<00:00:27.000> it's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
sort of in the correct way you take your

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900 
sort of in the correct way you take your
measuring<00:00:30.539> cup<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> spoon<00:00:31.859> flour<00:00:32.309> into

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
measuring cup and you spoon flour into

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.810 
measuring cup and you spoon flour into
it<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.110> instead<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.739> scooping<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> flour

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
it this is instead of scooping the flour

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
it this is instead of scooping the flour
out<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.450> tin<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:36.989> pouring<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.800> out

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
out of the tin or pouring it right out

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.750 
out of the tin or pouring it right out
of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> bag

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of the bag

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
of the bag
and<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.480> tapped<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> counter<00:00:40.680> or

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and if I tapped it on the counter or

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250 
and if I tapped it on the counter or
dumped<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> bag<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.840> end<00:00:43.140> up

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
dumped it in from the bag I would end up

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
dumped it in from the bag I would end up
adding<00:00:43.620> extra<00:00:44.250> flour<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> recipe<00:00:45.360> which

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

can make cookies dry or tough and then

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.330 
can make cookies dry or tough and then
another<00:00:49.020> interesting<00:00:49.289> ingredient<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
another interesting ingredient in this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
another interesting ingredient in this
recipe<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:51.090> rice<00:00:51.510> flour<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.680> much<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
recipe is rice flour not very much and

recipe is rice flour not very much and
it's<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> things<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> makes<00:00:54.510> these

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it's one of the things that makes these

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
it's one of the things that makes these
short<00:00:55.020> breads<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.590> wonderfully<00:00:56.160> crumbly<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
crispy so that goes in with the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.479 
crispy so that goes in with the
all-purpose<00:00:58.680> flour<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.410> as<00:01:01.410> well<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
sweetness is icing sugar so that's again

very<00:01:05.159> soft<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.390> crumbly<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
very soft going to be very crumbly and

very soft going to be very crumbly and
very<00:01:07.770> nice<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.490> terms<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.909> its<00:01:09.060> texture<00:01:09.570> with

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
very nice in terms of its texture with

very nice in terms of its texture with
the<00:01:10.290> rice<00:01:10.619> flour<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> icing<00:01:11.310> sugar<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
measure it in the same way as I do the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.890 
measure it in the same way as I do the
flour<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.729> spooning<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> then

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
flour so spooning it in and then

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.310 
flour so spooning it in and then
scooping<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> off<00:01:17.450> salt<00:01:18.450> goes<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.170> as

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
scooping it off salt goes in there as

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.219 
scooping it off salt goes in there as
well<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.330> then<00:01:21.330> I'm<00:01:21.420> gonna<00:01:21.540> blitz<00:01:21.840> together

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
well and then I'm gonna blitz together

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.660 
well and then I'm gonna blitz together
the<00:01:22.470> dry<00:01:22.590> ingredients<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> step<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.640> done

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the dry ingredients so step one is done

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.210 
the dry ingredients so step one is done
now<00:01:27.509> comes<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> butter<00:01:28.200> shortbread<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
now comes the butter shortbread is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580 
now comes the butter shortbread is
notorious<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:29.880> being<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.960> very<00:01:31.320> buttery

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
notorious for being very very buttery

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.039 
notorious for being very very buttery
and<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> use<00:01:32.700> unsalted<00:01:33.299> butter<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and I like to use unsalted butter and it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
and I like to use unsalted butter and it
has<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.860> cold<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.520> cut<00:01:36.150> into

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
has to be really cold and cut into

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.230 
has to be really cold and cut into
little<00:01:36.630> cubes<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
little cubes so now I'm just going to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
little cubes so now I'm just going to
pulse<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.750> until<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> starts<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> form<00:01:40.770> big

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
pulse this until it starts to form big

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.600 
pulse this until it starts to form big
crumbs

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.660 

so<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:45.970> looking<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:46.300> big<00:01:46.750> clumps<00:01:47.350> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so this is looking like big clumps that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.250 
so this is looking like big clumps that
means<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:48.940> perfect<00:01:49.540> now<00:01:49.900> I<00:01:49.930> know<00:01:50.080> it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
means it is perfect now I know it

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.410 
means it is perfect now I know it
doesn't<00:01:50.290> look<00:01:50.500> anything<00:01:50.770> like<00:01:50.950> cookies<00:01:51.490> but
