00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 Hello everyone, I have not been here this 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.880
 due to the fact that I sewed almost nothing 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.759
 because holidays are moods in general 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.429
 there was no sewing somehow decided more 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 one thing this fall which is now but 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.109
 not known to me is the neck 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 wishing her on the pattern with me watching 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 1716 and in general it was all pretty 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.369
 just nothing i had 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 especially I do something myself 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 changed but it's not a goal to do 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.239
 it turns out such a waterfall due to the fact 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 that these two details that we rush we 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.570
 connect them with the detail in the middle in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.260
 Overall, it's pretty simple, just here. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.750
 these two parts are connected 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.239
 join this there inside i 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.699
 removed a little from the shoulders but it is not 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.859
 I just had to do it almost always 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.460
 wow almost all patterns clean 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.649
 keys 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.210
 but in this pattern, in general, it is not 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.489
 it was necessary to do the shoulders were 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.110
 normal on the pattern of this dress 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
 looks more somehow delicate 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.260
 with these folds I have them 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.020
 turned out to be more rude it's all because 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.360
 choice of fabric choice of fabric and how I thought 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 what I have is good but it turns out for 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.250
 this pattern is needed and the fabric is even more 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.130
 thin so that it was not like this 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 roughly as I did and also I 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.520
 added in the middle a bit at the level 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.280
 my hips sorry i'm not wet from 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.280
 flesh because i'm just spontaneously so 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.860
 decided to shoot this video the back consists of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.649
 two parts 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.869
 this is how the inside of me looks like this 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.180
 something here suffered in general something 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.600
 it turned out but honestly I donâ€™t 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.700
 love this such a cutout 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 the stuff is very nice i don't remember 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.260
 to the composition there is some good composition to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.290
 general 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.360
 very very pleasant to the body so this 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.650
 will become my home dress on this 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.650
 I will say goodbye to you all bye
