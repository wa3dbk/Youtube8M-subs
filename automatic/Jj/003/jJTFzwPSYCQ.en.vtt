00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.610
 one from latin america the next 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.580
 problem is quite interesting from 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.190
 the point of view of the pose himself 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.119
 says that the price of a book is 57 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.699
 pesos and that of a magazine is 25 and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.580
 says that if juan buys both things and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.170
 pay with a 100 bill how much you returned 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.619
 They should give you good in 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.720
 main thing we should find out is 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.350
 how much in total 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.630
 that is, if he has 100 in the first place 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.050
 we're going to see it from this point of 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.470
 view if first of all Juan has 100 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470
 pesos 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.610
 and buy the book 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.180
 you have to subtract the 57 pesos from the book 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.780
 they were 57 perfect I'm not wrong it's 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.200
 say 100 minus 57 will give us as 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.480
 result the silver that is left to 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.210
 the 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.300
 that is, this account to solve it 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.159
 we must realize this contraption quite 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.990
 simple 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.469
 the hundred convert it into 10 tens 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 and these 10 tens of us became 9 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:28.440
 tens and 10 units 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.040
 so at 100 hundreds the 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.040
 we turn look 100 hundred 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.130
 we converted them into nine tens 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.960
 and 10 units 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.119
 and 100 hundreds equals 9 tens and 10 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.369
 units now this kind of 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.380
 problems like all the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.549
 problems is always interesting 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.140
 pose the data that we have the data 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.140
 what we have say the following 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:17.129
 Juan has 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:21.220
 100 pesos that are what we have in the 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:26.620
 first question first 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:29.290
 up to 57 pesos to buy the book is 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.100
 say 100 minus 57 after doing that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.510
 contraption we have that 10 minus 7 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.980
 stress and 95 is 4 that is to say the 100 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.600
 pesos 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.710
 once I spend the 57 in the book 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.120
 he has 43 left 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.470
 second 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.040
 spend 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.610
 25 pesos in the magazine therefore of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.850
 the silver that was left of those 43 pesos 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.540
 now we have to subtract 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:10.290
 the 25 pesos he spent on buying the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:13.840
 magazine that is 43 minus 25 we should 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.110
 ask the partner let me erase 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.110
 here 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.090
 let me erase here 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.660
 the four tens the four tens 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.390
 happen to be three and ten more units is 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.880
 say to the ten units 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.180
 we are going to add the three that already 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:40.970
 we had those three units now pass 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:44.930
 to be 13 13 minus 5 is 8 and 3 - 2 is one 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:51.230
 that is, if Juan has 100 pesos and 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:54.610
 first spend 57 and then spend 25 in 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.610
 total you have left 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.850
 18 pesos 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.080
 and the problem that is solved and now 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.440
 this is very interesting this question 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.430
 raised here 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.860
 since when solving problems 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.260
 there is no secret other than the order and 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.780
 the prolixity at the moment of reasoning 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.390
 as long as we have our data well 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.570
 ordered any problem will be of 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.180
 easy solution in this case the data 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.760
 What we have is that Juan has 100 pesos 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:36.380
 which first spends 57 and second spends 25 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.690
 as we know he is spending money 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.330
 We know that you are spending money 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.880
 we also know that those 100 pesos are going to 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.000
 begin to descend that is to say they are going to 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.820
 subtract first the 57 that you spend on 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.750
 first place and then to come back from that or 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:59.730
 what's left of those last 25 and 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.020
 as we said well in total there are 18 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.060
 educational I recommend the following 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.060
 videos so you can keep learning
