00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.270
 to let you know it though now 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.270
 let's go to rincon 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.890
 we are following the road that goes from 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.170
 santa barbara of samanà all'ats galeras 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.960
 this road runs along the bay of 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.540
 samanà which is mostly rocky 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.760
 but nevertheless it is possible to find 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.170
 of the beaches that are true and 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.170
 own little paradises 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.090
 friends and get dallas terrenas to 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.700
 santa barbara di samanà and continue to 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.670
 the galeras is very simple because everything 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.999
 well marked the junction that leads to 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.409
 playa rincón is not so 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.770
 in fact it is not reported as a playa 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.470
 rincon but like ramallah and rincon 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.519
 this and the junction to get to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:22.239
 playa rincon because many people get lost 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:24.720
 simply still a few kilometers and 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.720
 here we are 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.150
 so far we have gone through various villages 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.180
 and the road was well paved but 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.859
 the last stretch is still made of 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.290
 demolished earth and stone 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.849
 so I advise you to come and do 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.849
 this excursion with a jeep 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.980
 we finally got to player in 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.500
 with this beach it has two 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.090
 special features the first is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.650
 which is among the ten most beaches 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.510
 beautiful in the world 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.420
 the second one is that this beach 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.630
 in three faces in practice we can find 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.210
 this part which is a beautiful bay 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.910
 where the water is almost always calm and is 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.950
 even the most touristic part to a few 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.170
 meters on the other side we find one 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.150
 beach completely open with sea 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.820
 stormy and instead from the opposite side 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.200
 we find the naturalistic part where there is 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.200
 the mouth of a beautiful river 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.340
 good boy 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.420
 we arrived from the other side of the player 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.820
 in where there is the mouth of the river that is 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.980
 call the word itself to crio frio 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.980
 suggests that the water here is very cold 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.690
 so after a good tonic bath not 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.230
 we just have to eat 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.230
 you are hungry 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.709
 when you come here I recommend 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.850
 eat in this typical restaurant 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.280
 Dominican called restaurant il 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.400
 crio frio which is not just a restaurant 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.300
 but it is also part of an association 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.160
 the president is with me 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.590
 of the association to which we ask for 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.550
 talk to us about this hello 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.419
 Andro Minor lands during 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:44.370

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:48.510

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.250

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.699

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:40.380
