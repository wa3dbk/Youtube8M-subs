right as the iPad air I have both of

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.529 
right as the iPad air I have both of
them<00:00:14.269> have<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.570> brightness<00:00:16.539> brightness

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
them have the brightness brightness

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.410 
them have the brightness brightness
turned<00:00:17.750> pretty<00:00:18.740> much<00:00:18.830> all<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.100> way<00:00:19.189> up<00:00:19.420> I'm

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
turned pretty much all the way up I'm

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.640 
turned pretty much all the way up I'm
just<00:00:20.570> going<00:00:20.779> to<00:00:20.869> show<00:00:21.109> you<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.350> difference

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
just going to show you the difference

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.859 
just going to show you the difference
between<00:00:21.710> flux<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:22.670> not<00:00:22.789> having<00:00:23.000> flux<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:23.810> go

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
between flux and not having flux so go

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.320 
between flux and not having flux so go
ahead<00:00:23.930> and<00:00:24.109> pop<00:00:24.260> these<00:00:24.590> down<00:00:25.119> tried<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.210> have

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
ahead and pop these down tried to have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.910 
ahead and pop these down tried to have
the<00:00:26.420> same<00:00:26.599> wallpaper<00:00:27.050> on<00:00:27.289> both<00:00:27.439> of<00:00:27.619> them<00:00:27.740> so

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
the same wallpaper on both of them so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.450 
the same wallpaper on both of them so
the<00:00:28.220> brightness<00:00:28.640> was<00:00:28.789> comparable<00:00:30.340> but<00:00:31.340> I<00:00:31.369> do

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
the brightness was comparable but I do

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.450 
the brightness was comparable but I do
have<00:00:31.699> flex<00:00:32.000> installed<00:00:32.420> here<00:00:33.310> I'll<00:00:34.310> go<00:00:34.400> ahead

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
have flex installed here I'll go ahead

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.390 
have flex installed here I'll go ahead
and<00:00:34.610> turn<00:00:34.700> on<00:00:34.880> flux<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:35.710> have<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:36.800> set<00:00:37.070> at<00:00:37.100> night

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
you can adjust how nice how nice so you

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.890 
you can adjust how nice how nice so you
want<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:42.140> set<00:00:43.210> but<00:00:44.210> I'll<00:00:44.450> go<00:00:44.510> ahead<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:44.750> flip

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
want this set but I'll go ahead and flip

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.680 
want this set but I'll go ahead and flip
it<00:00:45.050> back<00:00:45.230> as<00:00:45.560> you<00:00:45.740> can<00:00:45.890> see<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:47.270> iPad<00:00:47.540> on<00:00:47.630> the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690

right has a little bit more cooler tone

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.900 
right has a little bit more cooler tone
or<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.530> warmer<00:00:51.860> tone<00:00:52.040> maybe<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.550> right<00:00:52.730> way<00:00:52.850> to

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
or a warmer tone maybe the right way to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.660 
or a warmer tone maybe the right way to
say<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:53.650> then<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:54.770> one<00:00:54.890> on<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.070> on<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.490> left

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
without flux and the brightness turned

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.660 
without flux and the brightness turned
all<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.590> way<00:01:12.680> up<00:01:13.480> other<00:01:14.480> options<00:01:14.960> in<00:01:15.470> flux<00:01:16.190> you

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
all the way up other options in flux you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.670 
all the way up other options in flux you
can<00:01:16.790> have<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.060> adjusted<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.660> daytime<00:01:17.990> and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
can have it adjusted in the daytime and

if<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:18.950> slide<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.820> can<00:01:19.970> kind<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.300> see<00:01:20.720> a

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
if I slide it you can kind of see a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.160 
if I slide it you can kind of see a
little<00:01:22.490> kind<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.760> adjust<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:23.330> temporarily<00:01:23.900> at

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
little kind of adjust it temporarily at

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.960 
little kind of adjust it temporarily at
least<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.590> then<00:01:24.680> if<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:24.860> let<00:01:25.040> go<00:01:25.070> it'll<00:01:25.610> change

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
least and then if I let go it'll change

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.530 
least and then if I let go it'll change
back<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.510> night<00:01:26.660> setting<00:01:27.970> this<00:01:28.970> actually

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
back to the night setting this actually

back to the night setting this actually
Lowe's<00:01:29.720> knows<00:01:30.140> my<00:01:30.290> location<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.400> adjusts

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
Lowe's knows my location and it adjusts

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.890 
Lowe's knows my location and it adjusts
it<00:01:32.030> based<00:01:32.390> on<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.750> time<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:32.960> day<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.040> flex<00:01:34.370> will

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
it based on the time of day so flex will

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.630 
it based on the time of day so flex will
knows<00:01:35.900> what<00:01:36.230> time<00:01:36.500> zone<00:01:36.530> I'm<00:01:36.890> in<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.490> knows

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
knows what time zone I'm in and it knows

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.070 
knows what time zone I'm in and it knows
that<00:01:37.670> it's<00:01:37.970> whatever<00:01:38.300> time<00:01:38.540> right<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:38.870> it's

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
that it's whatever time right now it's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.050 
that it's whatever time right now it's
11<00:01:39.260> o'clock<00:01:39.500> at<00:01:39.830> night<00:01:39.860> or<00:01:40.310> 12<00:01:40.670> o'clock<00:01:40.909> at

11 o'clock at night or 12 o'clock at
night<00:01:41.230> so<00:01:42.230> it<00:01:42.320> goes<00:01:42.470> ahead<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:42.770> adjusts<00:01:43.900> based

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
night so it goes ahead and adjusts based

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.740 
night so it goes ahead and adjusts based
on<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.200> time<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.409> day<00:01:45.650> it's<00:01:45.830> assumes<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:47.120> I

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
on the time of day it's assumes that I

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.940 
on the time of day it's assumes that I
want<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.080> setting<00:01:48.350> at<00:01:48.470> night<00:01:48.620> in<00:01:48.800> this

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
want this setting at night in this

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.310 
want this setting at night in this
setting<00:01:49.220> during<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.520> day<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:49.870> you<00:01:50.870> can<00:01:50.960> adjust

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320
