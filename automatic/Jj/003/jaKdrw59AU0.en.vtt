00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.559
 especially how you teach with your method 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.559

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.860

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.390
 stimulated with ideas with support with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.650

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.680
 no university that has the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.690
 methodology that has look for the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.089
 process methodology as is the profile 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.300
 of the good local student is in fact a 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.720
 student profile with a lot of freedom 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.890
 of thought with much passion model 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.150
 of what he wants to do read legible 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.280

 great you want what it was a 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.100
 little talk about me was the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.420
 advertising and motivations because the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.270
 emotional world he is driving and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.860
 marks of people now that the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.810
 advertising is so fashionable that it is the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.549
 really influential that the market that 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.470
 would go was a boy who is just 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.399
 starting in reality it has to do with 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.600
 that not only from the part 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.590
 commercial is good that the nights because 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 there are also many things to do for 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.470
 society there are people who need 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.030
 communication there are societies that 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.250
 they need communication and this is a 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.319
 incredible site to create a space 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.720
 that seems another side of the world in mind 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.360
 playful not as stimulating your senses 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.800
 is in Peru there are fabulous people people 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.179
 professional and the guys really come out 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.739
 he was delighted and the parents too for 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.239
 noticing parents over time 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.610
 have heard many prejudices normally 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.380
 about creative careers there are people 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.489
 that are successful as he had these 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.590
 races then it would be good that 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.180
 let's say with the common and what is it that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.070
 you would say to the parents and in them 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.370
 want to give local children has always been 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.080
 thought-out 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.080
 the money is what brings you to the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.930
 happiness the proposal that I have brought is 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.180
 just the opposite is happiness 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.410
 the one that brings you the money is 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.569
 university has 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.030
 in the essence just to promote 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.790
 use 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.990
 developing this creativity in 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.690
 the students 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.060
 that this one is 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.370
 this entity that feels like being in a 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.830
 university as a professional I imagine 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.940
 it gives you a much more didactic support and 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.650
 stimulating so that they turn their 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.670
 units the students not well good what 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.770
 what we do here is develop the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.580
 creative thinking and we focus the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.200
 creativity as something not inspiration 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.630
 divine or because the focus is on and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.730
 those things we are not banishing for 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.260
 complete that concept and that's what 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.400
 We work to bring a methodology that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.440
 it's called process that has been 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.990
 developed by the buccal group toulouse 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.000
 and that we apply to all courses of 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.580
 the race the process I do not wait with I know 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.850
 yes no but cesc or as they promote 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.850
 sweets 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.410
 workshop to build a robot 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.920
 and what do you think that stimulates in your mind 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.920
 that really 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.920
 build 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.459
 to walk walk let's do what 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.349
 basic that you would recommend for the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.299
 people come to study educate because it is 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.250
 I would recommend it that you think it provides 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.689
 of special which is your plus respect 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.069
 to the other universities that have a 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.689
 support maybe a little more theoretical more 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.180
 good classic definitely because you 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.290
 let create is a free society is a 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.479
 university that promotes you the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.380
 creativity then you really do not go 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.340
 to be limiting with issues and apart 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.530
 they are full of new equipment 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.880
 we have a giant chroma with the guys 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.410
 can they experience the cameras so to their 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.760
 disposition the teachers all the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.710
 time there are also interns 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.060
 for each course that you feel being in 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.680
 such a creative university I see that 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.199
 everyone is listening to music 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.520
 I'm watching art going on life in 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.979
 I think I decided and do the teaching 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.889
 you do not feel passion not passion so you 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.560
 do this action for what you learn 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.199
 be in an environment that invites you not to 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.120
 invites to create invites you to develop 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.780
 to do what you want and make it happy 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.130
 when you enjoy is when you really 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.160
 learn and want to learn more besides 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.800
 this tedious learning process 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.820
 boring and monotonous to the contrary 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.130
 to be motivated 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.130
 stimulating and that is what we are looking for here
