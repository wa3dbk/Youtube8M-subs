00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
nice and straight aligned how you want
it<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.659> tighten<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it and then you can tighten it up with a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
it and then you can tighten it up with a
smaller<00:01:49.799> section<00:01:50.479> now<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.540> great<00:01:51.810> thing

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
smaller section now the great thing

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.170 
smaller section now the great thing
about<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.159> tightly<00:01:53.460> Radek<00:01:53.850> AIT's<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
about that is it tightly Radek AIT's the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
about that is it tightly Radek AIT's the
need<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.810> any<00:01:55.020> o-rings<00:01:55.680> rubbers<00:01:56.520> anything

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
need for any o-rings rubbers anything

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
need for any o-rings rubbers anything
like<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.630> you're<00:01:57.780> putting<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> there

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
like that that you're putting in there

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.580 
like that that you're putting in there
to<00:01:58.710> try<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.070> align<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.670> straight<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.140> ensure

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to try and align this straight so ensure

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260 
to try and align this straight so ensure
that<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.860> totally<00:02:02.310> straight<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.790> then

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that it's totally straight and then

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
that it's totally straight and then
because<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:04.049> completely<00:02:04.619> tightened

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
because that is completely tightened

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.249 
because that is completely tightened
down<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.689> anywhere

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
down that is not going anywhere

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.520 
down that is not going anywhere
lovely<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:09.060> far<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.539> getting<00:02:09.720> insert<00:02:10.289> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
lovely then as far as getting insert in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.920 
lovely then as far as getting insert in
there<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.160> concerned<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.720> simply

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
there is concerned all you do is simply

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.850 
there is concerned all you do is simply
moisten

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
moisten

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.120 
moisten
these<00:02:14.100> little<00:02:14.310> grommet<00:02:15.120> bits<00:02:15.300> at<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.630> here

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
these little grommet bits at the in here

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.250 
these little grommet bits at the in here
so<00:02:17.130> once<00:02:17.430> moisten<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.300> simply<00:02:18.660> pop<00:02:19.080> them

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
so once moisten just simply pop them

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.220 
so once moisten just simply pop them
into<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> holes<00:02:20.030> either<00:02:21.030> side<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
into the holes either side like so and

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.740 
into the holes either side like so and
then<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.790> case<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.000> twisting<00:02:27.600> this

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
then it's just a case of twisting this

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.840 
then it's just a case of twisting this
round<00:02:29.750> sitting<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.050> place<00:02:33.470> lovely<00:02:34.850> now

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850
