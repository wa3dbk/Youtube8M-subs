00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.640
 and in which name July because this is 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.859
 pace and today can teach them a cliché to 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.330
 king and theft auto 5 for walking can 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.340
 above the water is like that 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.110
 floating above her and well nobody 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.670
 registered and a location that can 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.620
 points now on the map is basically 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.779
 one of the airports that is 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.660
 helicopter you can only go then 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.869
 indicated on the map where it is to know that 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.179
 there like that down the map if there is 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.699
 right left I do not know but if 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.220
 is there they go there and teach them 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.480
 now it's very easy the trick to me let's go 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.220
 to do the first as always is the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.410
 hit that I do this power and that is 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.300
 for him basically this wall and take out 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 a soul where you have to hit from 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.620
 here sad part of the other side of 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.440
 the wall while it is in the water 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.690
 it's going down little by little while you 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.280
 you're hitting the water this has to be 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.440
 there stuck to the wall and you have to do 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.510
 that your pistol is completely measured 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.390
 in the water and once you're in 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.680
 the water so I'm covering it 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.330
 shoot and supposed to take out the knife 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.310
 but I do not get the first time this 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.590
 stupidity and then if this happens to you then what 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.949
 does it again the second time ago 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.439
 will teach it now 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.240
 and you're going to see there hit me to the wall and 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.430
 I turn back I do not know one of the two 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.570
 because I like you have to be stuck 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.670
 to the wall it can not be like that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 walking evil like that so it comes and you 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.020
 You're here again, so what 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 which was 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.759
 lv12 you hit the wall giving little to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.369
 little the cac and I think I fired a 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.750
 Once I start nothing if that happens because it's going to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.009
 do again until it works you saw 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.189
 shot and I still have my soul in the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.649
 hand I do not do it again shot and there 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.170
 changed the knife and that means that 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.869
 it worked what it does jump out of the water under 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.030
 the surface leaves me here and gets you 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.220
 water again and they will see now I had 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.810
 to be walking above the water 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.310
 feet get like polito in the water 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.140
 but also by walking can here as 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.539
 if nothing in some cliché and fun 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.030
 different I hope you like this not 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.909
 I had seen such a cliche as weird as 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.520
 I do not understand why this happens like 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.599
 that 6 in the game records that still 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.060
 is changing like that by the 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.950
 surface or believes that it is already in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.569
 the water I understand what it is that is 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.519
 happening here if you can get your soul 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.929
 if so maybe if i walk by the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.150
 water if you do not want 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.530
 take a tour of the ten days 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.939
