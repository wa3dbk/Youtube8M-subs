control towers as computer rooms but the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.399 
control towers as computer rooms but the
one<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.880> wanted<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> mostly<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> top

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409

one we wanted go to mostly is at the top
so<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> speed<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> run<00:01:11.790> all

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
so I'm going to speed it up and run all

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359

the<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> stairs<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.189> think<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.280> was

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the way up the stairs I think there was

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.760 
the way up the stairs I think there was
actually<00:01:14.700> six<00:01:15.000> floors<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.960> does<00:01:16.500> take<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
actually six floors so it does take a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.530 
actually six floors so it does take a
couple<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.189> seconds<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
couple of seconds if you do this in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
couple of seconds if you do this in
multiplayer<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.560> army<00:01:20.009> cannot<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> here
