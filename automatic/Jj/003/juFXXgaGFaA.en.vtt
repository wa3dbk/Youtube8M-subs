00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.900
 I think it's really cool 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.730
 the last is all his hema is 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.830
 login page that is in the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.270
 website and we do it because we don't 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.680
 only want the commercial side 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.660
 Our site emphasize that we actually 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.970
 Customers also want to give Drempt 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.530
 find inspiration and make hand 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.910
 we offer that ourselves and other times 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.920
 bloggers 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.260
 professional bloggers and with that net 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.110
 start the interest there to express their opinion 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.790
 give about once products 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.769
 I started my blog once six years ago 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.870
 as a passion project 'purely because I learn 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.750
 many sites from abroad followed that 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.579
 have always been teaching the big trout sheets 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.110
 cosmo stuff like that 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.210
 and this was the first time women 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.340
 as I became a certain mother about fashion 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.489
 talking and I found it fascinating so 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.960
 so I started and I never hide myself 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.600
 the most important tip I want to give 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.979
 it is focusing on it not it is one 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.960
 of the most difficult things and that one 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.399
 person take my time and me 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.380
 important to do something that is not yet 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.119
 done by 100000 others and that 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.890
 ensures recognisability and I take care of you 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.660
 stamp w on your spot on 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.210
 the web and that fish that I all 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.530
 potential bloggers want to give is that 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.689
 they have to stay close to themselves 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.820
 create authentic content where you yourself 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.990
 all the way back is most important 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.979
 that you followers I must be able to you 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.439
 identify 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.870
 So keep writing about things that affect you 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.210
 how you like it 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.710
 is something all the successful blogs with 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.780
 have in common is that the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.400
 consistency is in the first 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.050
 quality of the content and in addition 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.120
 also how often you post something new on a blog 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.040
 think it's good for your readers to 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.870
 know exactly when and for what 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.460
 your block can do something again 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.870
 that you just have to do because you 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.340
 of the platform wooden with your one 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.110
 story to tell it you have nothing to 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.110
 lose so go for it and block already 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.330

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.070

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.880

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.110
 many basics but all good fun there than 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.340
 girl when she comes to tell yara something 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.200
 and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.610

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.770
