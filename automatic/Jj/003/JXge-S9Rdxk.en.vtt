one to the other port going out and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.240 
one to the other port going out and
those<00:02:09.100> two<00:02:09.340> go<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.670> cylinder<00:02:14.040> I've<00:02:15.040> cut

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
those two go to the cylinder I've cut

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.550 
those two go to the cylinder I've cut
them<00:02:15.370> real<00:02:15.550> short<00:02:16.020> but<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> kit<00:02:17.290> comes<00:02:17.500> with

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
20 feet of air lines so you can make it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.840 
20 feet of air lines so you can make it
any<00:02:19.570> size<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.020> want
