the<00:00:14.370> thing<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.610> makes<00:00:14.910> us<00:00:15.059> both<00:00:15.299> unique<00:00:15.690> is

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the thing that makes us both unique is

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.590 
the thing that makes us both unique is
it's<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> stern<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.490> way<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.820> stone

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it's the stern the way the stone

it's the stern the way the stone
sections<00:00:19.080> come<00:00:19.350> very<00:00:19.529> fine<00:00:22.220> it's<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.550> replica

sections come very fine it's a replica

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.419 
sections come very fine it's a replica

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
from around about 1850 and they were use

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060 
from around about 1850 and they were use
extensively<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:33.320> insured<00:00:34.320> offshore<00:00:34.860> fishing

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.860 

the<00:00:49.129> reason<00:00:49.519> that<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.760> schooner<00:00:50.030> became<00:00:50.539> so

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
the reason that the schooner became so

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.380 
the reason that the schooner became so
popular<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:51.530> useful<00:00:51.860> was<00:00:52.280> because<00:00:53.180> it<00:00:53.269> was

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
popular and so useful was because it was

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.630 
popular and so useful was because it was
manageable<00:00:53.899> with<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.379> very<00:00:54.680> reduced<00:00:55.219> number<00:00:55.610> of

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
crew they sailed this particular design

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.780 
crew they sailed this particular design

with<00:01:12.080> that's<00:01:12.380> not<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.680> case<00:01:12.860> with<00:01:13.100> this

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
with that's not the case with this

call cards head mackerel tail because

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.889 
call cards head mackerel tail because
it's<00:01:18.890> still<00:01:19.130> rather<00:01:19.429> bluff<00:01:19.759> in<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.060> bow<00:01:20.240> but

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
it's still rather bluff in the bow but

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.899 
it's still rather bluff in the bow but
finds<00:01:21.200> off<00:01:21.440> towards<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.950> stern<00:01:22.250> like<00:01:22.880> a

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
finds off towards the stern like a

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.570 
finds off towards the stern like a
Michaels<00:01:23.390> tail<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:25.009> doesn't<00:01:25.310> leave<00:01:25.429> much

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580

in the way of a breeze for this boat to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.249 
in the way of a breeze for this boat to
slip<00:01:27.860> along<00:01:27.979> really<00:01:28.460> quite<00:01:28.700> nicely<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:30.140> when

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
slip along really quite nicely and when

slip along really quite nicely and when
it<00:01:30.380> really<00:01:30.649> gets<00:01:30.860> up<00:01:31.039> to<00:01:31.190> blow<00:01:31.399> then<00:01:32.240> they<00:01:32.420> come

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
it really gets up to blow then they come

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.389 
it really gets up to blow then they come
into<00:01:32.810> their<00:01:33.080> own<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.289> they<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:33.890> point<00:01:34.159> really

into their own and they can point really
high<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.729> windward<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.300> they<00:01:35.720> can<00:01:36.100> look<00:01:37.100> after

these boats evolved in first place is
what<00:01:40.670> they're<00:01:40.819> all<00:01:40.940> about

is a living material and it seems

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.940 
is a living material and it seems
