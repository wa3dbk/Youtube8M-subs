00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
cute game and it's not really hard like

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
cute game and it's not really hard like
the<00:00:41.940> battles<00:00:42.180> they're<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.480> hard<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the battles they're not hard the the

the battles they're not hard the the
boss<00:00:43.500> battle<00:00:43.829> should<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.040> hard<00:00:44.250> either<00:00:44.370> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
boss battle should not hard either I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.639 
boss battle should not hard either I
thought<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> first<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.320> little

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
thought the first one was a little

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
thought the first one was a little
tricky<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.129> maybe<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.420> I

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
tricky but maybe this just me because I

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.470 
tricky but maybe this just me because I
kind<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.140> suck<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.469> fighting<00:00:49.850> in<00:00:50.850> games<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
kind of suck at fighting in games so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
kind of suck at fighting in games so
yeah<00:00:52.379> they're<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.100> harder<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.789> little

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
yeah they're not harder on the little

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.439 
yeah they're not harder on the little
dog<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.600> cute<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.110> actually<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.800> first

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
is a lot more effective than just
attacking<00:01:37.290> them<00:01:37.619> straight<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.040> without<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
attacking them straight on without the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
attacking them straight on without the
brush<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> brush<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:40.770> ink

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
brush so and with the brush you need ink

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.889 
brush so and with the brush you need ink
pots<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> beginning<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> game<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
pots and the beginning of the game you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.190 
pots and the beginning of the game you
start<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.320> three<00:01:43.890> solar<00:01:44.820> energy<00:01:45.780> units<00:01:46.079> I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
start with three solar energy units I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.539 
start with three solar energy units I
think<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.740> they're<00:01:46.829> called<00:01:47.100> solar

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
think what they're called solar

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.950 
think what they're called solar
understand<00:01:47.909> units<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> start<00:01:48.869> with

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
understand units and you start with

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
understand units and you start with
three<00:01:49.170> ink<00:01:49.320> pots<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.820> all

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
three ink pots but then as you do all

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
three ink pots but then as you do all
these<00:01:51.270> good<00:01:51.479> deeds<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.960> gets<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> grow<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
these good deeds it gets to grow and I

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
these good deeds it gets to grow and I
think<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.250> i'm<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.579> six<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.509> five

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
think right now i'm on at six or five

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.039 
think right now i'm on at six or five
for<00:01:55.409> both<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.890> them<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:58.020> don't

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
for both of them so and you don't

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.600 
for both of them so and you don't
actually<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> worry<00:01:58.950> about<00:01:59.100> running<00:01:59.430> out

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
actually have to worry about running out

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.330 
actually have to worry about running out
of<00:01:59.840> health<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.170> running<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.740> ink<00:02:02.100> pads

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
of health or running out of ink pads

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.219 
of health or running out of ink pads
because<00:02:02.759> everywhere<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.200> are

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
because everywhere you go there are

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.749 
because everywhere you go there are
these<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.560> pots<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.430> kind<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.640> like

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
these little pots it's kind of like

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
these little pots it's kind of like
Legend<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.180> Zelda<00:02:06.390> where<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.500> hit<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
Legend of Zelda where you you hit it and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.580 
Legend of Zelda where you you hit it and
you<00:02:08.550> break<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.060> then

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
you break it and then

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.520 
you break it and then
to<00:02:09.739> health<00:02:09.979> or<00:02:10.250> gives<00:02:10.519> you<00:02:10.610> ink<00:02:10.789> pot<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.239> that's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
to health or gives you ink pot so that's

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.650 
to health or gives you ink pot so that's
that's<00:02:12.530> really<00:02:12.650> nice<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.280> also<00:02:14.239> when<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.450> cut

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
that's really nice and also when you cut

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.280 
that's really nice and also when you cut
down<00:02:14.870> trees<00:02:15.879> it<00:02:16.879> gives<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.360> rice<00:02:17.599> balls<00:02:17.870> which

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
down trees it gives you rice balls which

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.110 
down trees it gives you rice balls which
is<00:02:18.500> what<00:02:18.950> they<00:02:19.040> use<00:02:19.069> for<00:02:19.220> health<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:19.819> I<00:02:19.849> thought

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
is what they use for health so I thought

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.850 
is what they use for health so I thought
that<00:02:20.180> was<00:02:20.390> kind<00:02:20.629> of<00:02:20.690> funny<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:20.930> these<00:02:21.170> rice

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
that was kind of funny that these rice

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.869 
that was kind of funny that these rice
balls<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.459> replenish<00:02:22.760> health<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.599> yeah<00:02:24.879> and

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
balls to replenish health so yeah and

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.309 
balls to replenish health so yeah and
whenever<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.390> cut<00:02:26.540> down<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.840> tree<00:02:27.019> it's<00:02:27.170> not

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
whenever you cut down the tree it's not

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.229 
whenever you cut down the tree it's not
that<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.590> disappears<00:02:28.069> it<00:02:28.430> grows<00:02:28.670> back<00:02:28.700> and

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
that it disappears it grows back and

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.520 
that it disappears it grows back and
there<00:02:29.599> are<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> lot<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.810> same<00:02:30.080> points<00:02:30.379> in<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
there are a lot of same points in the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.930 
there are a lot of same points in the
game<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> don't<00:02:31.129> have<00:02:31.220> ever<00:02:31.549> have<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
game so you don't have ever have to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.550 
game so you don't have ever have to
worry<00:02:32.030> about<00:02:32.209> having<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.959> repeat<00:02:33.349> something

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
worry about having to repeat something

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.229 
worry about having to repeat something
if<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> character<00:02:34.220> ever<00:02:34.370> dies<00:02:34.580> but<00:02:34.940> then<00:02:35.090> I've

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
if the character ever dies but then I've

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.789 
if the character ever dies but then I've
never<00:02:35.269> actually<00:02:35.660> experienced<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.470> character

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
never actually experienced the character

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.009 
never actually experienced the character
dying<00:02:37.129> because<00:02:37.700> they<00:02:37.849> ran<00:02:38.180> out<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.360> health<00:02:38.660> one

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
dying because they ran out of health one

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.780 
dying because they ran out of health one
other<00:02:39.170> thing<00:02:39.319> I<00:02:39.769> wanted<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.220> mention<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.760> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
other thing I wanted to mention is the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.819 
other thing I wanted to mention is the
controls<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.480> controls<00:02:41.569> kind<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.349> move<00:02:42.650> the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
controls it controls kind of move the

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.880 
controls it controls kind of move the
character<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.250> little<00:02:43.370> bit<00:02:43.760> fast<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.890> sometimes

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
character a little bit fast so sometimes

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.190 
character a little bit fast so sometimes
you'll<00:02:46.069> run<00:02:46.280> into<00:02:46.310> something<00:02:46.700> or<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:48.049> then<00:02:48.170> I

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
you'll run into something or and then I

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.780 
you'll run into something or and then I
have<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.410> back<00:02:48.650> up<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:48.980> then<00:02:49.099> make<00:02:49.519> him<00:02:49.640> move

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
have to back up and then make him move

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.640 
have to back up and then make him move
somewhere<00:02:50.120> else<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.870> that's<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.170> only<00:02:51.440> thing

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
somewhere else so that's the only thing

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.069 
somewhere else so that's the only thing
I<00:02:51.769> didn't<00:02:52.069> like<00:02:52.099> about<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:53.959> then

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
I didn't like about it that and then

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.080 
I didn't like about it that and then
sometimes<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:55.040> characters<00:02:55.459> are<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:55.879> really

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
sometimes the characters are like really

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.869 
sometimes the characters are like really
tiny<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.140> mean<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.769> TS<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.280> it's<00:02:58.760> not

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
tiny but I mean it's a TS so it's not

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.970 
tiny but I mean it's a TS so it's not
supposed<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.269> be<00:02:59.329> like<00:02:59.420> really<00:02:59.810> large<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.680> one

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
supposed to be like really large and one

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.170 
supposed to be like really large and one
thing<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.310> noticed<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.819> when<00:03:02.060> I'm

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
thing that I noticed is that when I'm

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.420 
thing that I noticed is that when I'm
playing<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.810> move<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.410> screen<00:03:03.739> closer<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.340> my

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
playing I move the screen closer to my

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.250 
playing I move the screen closer to my
face<00:03:04.670> as<00:03:04.849> I'm<00:03:05.090> playing<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.599> just<00:03:05.780> notice<00:03:06.140> it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
face as I'm playing and I just notice it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.460 
face as I'm playing and I just notice it
and<00:03:06.349> then<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.500> always<00:03:06.709> kind<00:03:07.069> of<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:08.470> distance

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
and then I always kind of like distance

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.559 
and then I always kind of like distance
distance<00:03:10.129> it<00:03:10.340> from<00:03:10.579> my<00:03:10.700> face<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.269> then<00:03:11.450> I

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
distance it from my face but then I

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.420 
distance it from my face but then I
always<00:03:11.750> find<00:03:12.110> myself<00:03:12.260> doing<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.980> same<00:03:13.129> thing

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
always find myself doing the same thing

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.370 
always find myself doing the same thing
so<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> find<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.690> characters<00:03:15.139> are<00:03:15.319> a

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
so I find that the characters are a

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.050 
so I find that the characters are a
little<00:03:15.739> small<00:03:16.250> sometimes<00:03:16.549> when<00:03:16.940> they're

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
little small sometimes when they're

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.509 
little small sometimes when they're
running<00:03:17.180> then<00:03:17.989> for<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.829> most<00:03:18.980> part<00:03:19.069> it's<00:03:19.340> fine

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
running then for the most part it's fine

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.000 
running then for the most part it's fine
and<00:03:19.840> yes<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.139> that's<00:03:21.350> pretty<00:03:21.560> much<00:03:21.739> what<00:03:21.980> I

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
and yes so that's pretty much what I

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.250 
and yes so that's pretty much what I
think<00:03:22.340> about<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.700> game<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.209> far<00:03:23.510> but<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.109> full
