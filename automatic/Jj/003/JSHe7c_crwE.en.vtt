00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
last night i was sleeping and I was not

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.700 
last night i was sleeping and I was not
sleeping<00:00:58.210> I<00:00:58.570> was<00:00:58.720> just<00:00:58.930> laying<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.560> bed

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
sleeping I was just laying in bed

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.710 
sleeping I was just laying in bed
thinking<00:01:00.010> like<00:01:00.340> what<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.120> hell's<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.570> this

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
thinking like what the hell's of this

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.590 
thinking like what the hell's of this
ending<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.890> then<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.070> thought<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.449> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
ending and then I thought one of the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.660 
ending and then I thought one of the
quotes<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.049> you<00:01:05.199> get<00:01:05.409> in<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:06.159> robot<00:01:06.520> when

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
quotes that you get in the robot when

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.730 
quotes that you get in the robot when
you<00:01:06.759> go<00:01:06.880> inside<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.329> robots<00:01:07.689> head<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.380> hear

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
you go inside the robots head you hear

you go inside the robots head you hear
dr.<00:01:09.040> max<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.610> talking<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:10.749> and<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.350> the

the space-time continuum is there

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.190 
the space-time continuum is there
something<00:01:34.060> going<00:01:34.090> on<00:01:34.359> and<00:01:34.659> we<00:01:35.020> know<00:01:35.170> that

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.980 
you can go back in time forward in time
and<00:01:41.319> I'll<00:01:41.409> do<00:01:41.530> all<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.829> crazy<00:01:42.009> stuff<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
and I'll do all this crazy stuff and you

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.529 
and I'll do all this crazy stuff and you
know<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.530> got<00:01:44.679> me<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.889> thinking<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.429> this<00:01:46.359> is

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
know that got me to thinking and this is

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.910 
know that got me to thinking and this is
something<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:46.899> is<00:01:47.200> from<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.409> while<00:01:47.619> ago<00:01:47.649> but

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
something that is from a while ago but

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800 
something that is from a while ago but
you<00:01:48.789> know<00:01:48.880> one<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.209> theories<00:01:49.420> right<00:01:49.719> now

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
you know one of the theories right now

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.510 
you know one of the theories right now
going<00:01:50.049> around<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.529> that<00:01:50.560> there<00:01:50.829> are<00:01:50.859> different

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
going around is that there are different

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.550 
going around is that there are different
universes<00:01:52.270> colliding<00:01:52.869> then<00:01:53.259> if<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.439> guys

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
universes colliding then if you guys

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.440 
universes colliding then if you guys
don't<00:01:53.709> know<00:01:53.889> what<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.310> multiverse<00:01:54.819> theory<00:01:55.149> is

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
don't know what the multiverse theory is

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.910 
don't know what the multiverse theory is
and<00:01:55.749> I'm<00:01:55.810> not<00:01:55.959> going<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.139> go<00:01:56.229> too<00:01:56.289> deep<00:01:56.590> into<00:01:56.799> it

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
and I'm not going to go too deep into it

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.899 
and I'm not going to go too deep into it
because<00:01:57.130> this<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.459> something<00:01:57.579> that's<00:01:57.759> really

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
because this is something that's really

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.910 
because this is something that's really
complicated<00:01:58.450> their<00:01:58.929> top<00:01:59.170> scientists<00:01:59.709> to<00:01:59.799> go

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
complicated their top scientists to go

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.169 
complicated their top scientists to go
with<00:02:00.069> this<00:02:00.219> some<00:02:00.459> people<00:02:00.579> don't<00:02:00.850> believe<00:02:01.060> it

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
with this some people don't believe it

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.339 
with this some people don't believe it
other<00:02:01.299> people<00:02:01.450> believe<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:02.020> other<00:02:02.170> people

other people believe it other people

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.050 
other people believe it other people
just<00:02:02.499> you<00:02:02.920> know<00:02:03.039> think<00:02:03.639> it's<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.939> ultimate

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
just you know think it's the ultimate

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.089 
just you know think it's the ultimate
thing<00:02:04.450> there's<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.499> thing<00:02:05.740> there's<00:02:05.979> this

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
thing there's this thing there's this

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.070 
thing there's this thing there's this
theory<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.729> it's<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.299> theory<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.990> know

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
theory and it's the theory that you know

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.010 
theory and it's the theory that you know
what<00:02:08.289> there<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.679> no<00:02:09.069> it's<00:02:09.910> impossible<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.690> go

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
what there is no it's impossible to go

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.360 
what there is no it's impossible to go
back<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.470> time<00:02:11.680> it's<00:02:11.890> impossible<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
back in time it's impossible to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.550 
back in time it's impossible to
time-travel<00:02:12.700> its<00:02:13.060> what<00:02:13.209> Einstein<00:02:13.420> said<00:02:14.050> he

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
time-travel its what Einstein said he

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.200 
time-travel its what Einstein said he
said<00:02:14.770> time<00:02:15.040> viewing<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.550> possible<00:02:16.090> that

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
said time viewing is possible that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.580 
said time viewing is possible that
you're<00:02:16.300> able<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.660> see<00:02:16.810> into<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.140> future<00:02:17.170> you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you're able to see into the future you

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.780 
you're able to see into the future you
were<00:02:17.650> able<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.950> see<00:02:18.070> into<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> past

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
were able to see into the past

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.899 
were able to see into the past
but<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.709> ability<00:02:21.159> to<00:02:21.340> actually<00:02:21.430> go

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909

through time and go to a different time

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.220 
through time and go to a different time
period<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.459> not<00:02:24.640> possible<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.719> theory<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.079> a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
period is not possible the theory that a

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
period is not possible the theory that a
lot<00:02:26.409> of<00:02:26.469> people<00:02:26.590> think<00:02:26.829> is<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.519> there<00:02:27.700> are

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
lot of people think is that there are

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.990 
lot of people think is that there are
multiple<00:02:28.239> universes<00:02:29.189> by<00:02:30.189> this<00:02:30.400> theory<00:02:30.819> it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
multiple universes by this theory it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.970 
multiple universes by this theory it
means<00:02:31.239> there<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.689> one<00:02:31.930> universe<00:02:32.349> where<00:02:32.680> say

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
means there is one universe where say

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.069 
means there is one universe where say
you<00:02:33.640> know<00:02:33.730> someone<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.180> gun<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:34.629> they

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
you know someone has a gun and they

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.179 
you know someone has a gun and they
point<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.409> gun<00:02:35.530> at<00:02:35.590> their<00:02:35.799> head<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:35.980> they

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
point the gun at their head and they

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.670 
point the gun at their head and they
shoot<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.819> one<00:02:37.359> universe<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:38.200> know<00:02:38.290> maybe<00:02:38.470> in

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
shoot in one universe you know maybe in

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.110 
shoot in one universe you know maybe in
this<00:02:38.829> universe<00:02:39.220> we're<00:02:39.400> at<00:02:39.459> right<00:02:39.579> now<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
this universe we're at right now if the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.880 
this universe we're at right now if the
gun<00:02:40.299> doesn't<00:02:40.450> shoot<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.930> was<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.079> blank<00:02:41.349> or<00:02:41.769> it

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
gun doesn't shoot it was a blank or it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.190 
gun doesn't shoot it was a blank or it
malfunction<00:02:42.640> there<00:02:43.329> is<00:02:43.480> another<00:02:43.720> universe

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
malfunction there is another universe

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.479 
malfunction there is another universe
where<00:02:44.439> a<00:02:44.470> dinner<00:02:44.680> malfunction<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.370> that

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
where a dinner malfunction in that

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.270 
where a dinner malfunction in that
person<00:02:45.909> died<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.389> every<00:02:46.989> time<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.920> know

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
person died and every time that you know

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.379 
person died and every time that you know
the<00:02:48.400> person<00:02:48.730> takes<00:02:48.909> is<00:02:49.030> their<00:02:49.180> head<00:02:49.359> and

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
the person takes is their head and

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.520 
the person takes is their head and
clicks<00:02:49.659> in<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.019> doesn't<00:02:50.260> kill<00:02:50.409> them

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
clicks in and it doesn't kill them

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.869 
clicks in and it doesn't kill them
there's<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.799> different<00:02:51.129> universe<00:02:51.430> or<00:02:51.579> someone

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
there's a different universe or someone

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.080 
there's a different universe or someone
else<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.329> dying<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:52.930> what<00:02:53.769> does<00:02:53.859> this<00:02:54.010> mean<00:02:54.159> it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
else is dying so what does this mean it

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.129 
else is dying so what does this mean it
means<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.510> there<00:02:55.629> might<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.959> different

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
means that there might be a different

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.199 
means that there might be a different
universes<00:02:56.769> wall<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.280> zombies<00:02:57.790> now<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.030> guys

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
universes wall for zombies now you guys

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.129 
universes wall for zombies now you guys
are<00:02:58.269> pregnant<00:02:58.569> thinking<00:02:58.780> yeah<00:02:58.870> these<00:02:59.079> guys

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
are pregnant thinking yeah these guys

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.259 
are pregnant thinking yeah these guys
are<00:02:59.319> going<00:02:59.739> too<00:02:59.859> much<00:02:59.889> into<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:01.090> really

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
are going too much into it but really

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.030 
are going too much into it but really
we're<00:03:01.540> not<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:02.169> you<00:03:02.319> think<00:03:02.530> about<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.769> there's

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
we're not if you think about it there's

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.530 
we're not if you think about it there's
all<00:03:03.220> these<00:03:03.340> little<00:03:03.400> things<00:03:03.639> within<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.239> story

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
all these little things within the story

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.229 
all these little things within the story
that<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.049> little<00:03:05.439> game<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.280> explain<00:03:06.760> how<00:03:07.030> can

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
that a little game can explain how can

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.509 
that a little game can explain how can
you<00:03:07.329> have<00:03:07.480> all<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.900> these<00:03:07.989> details<00:03:08.530> all<00:03:09.189> these

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
you have all of these details all these

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.099 
you have all of these details all these
historical<00:03:10.150> dates<00:03:10.450> all<00:03:10.659> this<00:03:10.780> kind<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.049> stuff

historical dates all this kind of stuff

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.440 
historical dates all this kind of stuff
that<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:12.189> not<00:03:12.340> possible<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:13.060> little

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
that just is not possible for little

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.869 
that just is not possible for little
eleven-year<00:03:13.930> old<00:03:14.260> 12<00:03:14.859> year<00:03:15.010> old<00:03:15.159> kids<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.669> come

eleven-year old 12 year old kids to come

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.849 
eleven-year old 12 year old kids to come
up<00:03:16.030> with<00:03:16.060> they're<00:03:16.840> not<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.230> smart<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.799> I'm

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
up with they're not that smart and I'm

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:18.929 
up with they're not that smart and I'm
not<00:03:18.069> saying<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.549> like<00:03:18.669> all<00:03:18.790> they're

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
not saying this is like all they're

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.369 
not saying this is like all they're
stupid<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:19.450> they're<00:03:19.780> not<00:03:19.959> smart<00:03:20.139> enough<00:03:20.290> to

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
stupid but they're not smart enough to

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.740 
stupid but they're not smart enough to
do<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:21.400> why<00:03:21.549> do<00:03:21.609> I<00:03:21.700> think<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.419> think

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
do that so why do I think it is I think

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.960 
do that so why do I think it is I think
there<00:03:23.049> are<00:03:23.079> different<00:03:23.709> universes<00:03:24.280> where<00:03:24.669> in

there are different universes where in

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.000 
there are different universes where in
one<00:03:25.269> University<00:03:25.870> there<00:03:26.169> is<00:03:26.290> an<00:03:26.440> actual<00:03:26.859> zombie

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
one University there is an actual zombie

outbreak Richtofen Dr Maxis are there

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.069 
outbreak Richtofen Dr Maxis are there
they're<00:03:30.639> making<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.479> know<00:03:31.599> they're<00:03:31.810> still

fighting over control and you know that

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.839 
fighting over control and you know that
universe<00:03:35.229> because<00:03:35.949> of<00:03:36.129> this<00:03:36.250> power<00:03:36.519> that<00:03:36.609> they

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
universe because of this power that they

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.180 
universe because of this power that they
got<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.180> go<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.900> Garza<00:03:38.199> to<00:03:38.530> get<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.769> e<00:03:38.799> thrus

got to go to a Garza to get the e thrus
energy<00:03:39.579> all<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:39.940> kind<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.180> stuff<00:03:40.239> these

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
energy all that kind of stuff these

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.020 
energy all that kind of stuff these
universes<00:03:41.829> are<00:03:41.949> colliding<00:03:42.250> together<00:03:42.549> and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
universes are colliding together and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.149 
universes are colliding together and
you're<00:03:43.269> seeing<00:03:43.569> mixes<00:03:44.379> of<00:03:44.530> things<00:03:44.799> from<00:03:45.010> the

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
you're seeing mixes of things from the

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.979 
you're seeing mixes of things from the
from<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.549> different<00:03:45.940> universe<00:03:46.359> or<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.659> different

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
from a different universe or a different

from a different universe or a different
time<00:03:47.199> period<00:03:47.560> colliding<00:03:48.069> with<00:03:48.190> things<00:03:48.400> from

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
time period colliding with things from

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.129 
time period colliding with things from
the<00:03:48.639> past<00:03:48.819> which<00:03:49.120> is<00:03:49.150> why<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.419> see<00:03:49.720> weapons

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
the past which is why you see weapons

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.710 
the past which is why you see weapons
like<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:51.129> know<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.430> r870<00:03:52.269> things<00:03:52.569> like

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
like the you know the r870 things like

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.839 
like the you know the r870 things like
the<00:03:52.840> DSR<00:03:53.319> in<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.919> time<00:03:54.190> that's<00:03:54.430> supposed<00:03:54.729> to<00:03:54.819> be

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
the DSR in a time that's supposed to be

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.729 
the DSR in a time that's supposed to be
world<00:03:55.150> at<00:03:55.479> war<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:56.019> know<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.229> first<00:03:56.470> war

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
world at war you know the first war

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.729 
world at war you know the first war
world<00:03:57.430> war<00:03:57.609> one<00:03:57.970> so<00:03:58.930> all<00:03:59.139> of<00:03:59.169> these<00:03:59.319> things<00:03:59.560> are

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
world war one so all of these things are

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.780 
world war one so all of these things are
coming<00:03:59.919> together<00:04:00.069> they're<00:04:00.430> colliding

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
coming together they're colliding

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.939 
coming together they're colliding
because<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.810> they're<00:04:01.959> little<00:04:02.290> riffs

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
because of this and they're little riffs

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.439 
because of this and they're little riffs
that<00:04:03.099> are<00:04:03.280> happening<00:04:03.459> because<00:04:03.849> of<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.299> that's

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
that are happening because of it that's

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.960 
that are happening because of it that's
my<00:04:04.780> theory<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.319> saw<00:04:06.010> someone<00:04:06.220> saying<00:04:06.519> a<00:04:06.669> theory

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
my theory I saw someone saying a theory

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.039 
my theory I saw someone saying a theory
in<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.120> comments<00:04:07.449> section<00:04:07.479> below<00:04:07.780> they<00:04:07.959> were

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
in the comments section below they were

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.569 
in the comments section below they were
saying<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.290> know<00:04:08.409> what<00:04:08.439> maybe<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:09.489> know

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
saying you know what maybe you know

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.099 
saying you know what maybe you know
they're<00:04:09.729> actually<00:04:10.150> living<00:04:10.419> the<00:04:10.659> one<00:04:10.810> from<00:04:10.959> the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
they're actually living the one from the

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.689 
they're actually living the one from the
cuts<00:04:11.319> and<00:04:11.470> actually<00:04:11.739> living<00:04:12.040> any<00:04:12.340> time<00:04:12.549> where

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
cuts and actually living any time where

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.339 
cuts and actually living any time where
there's<00:04:12.849> zombies<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.540> they're<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.049> playing

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
there's zombies and they're just playing

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.020 
there's zombies and they're just playing
a<00:04:14.500> game<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.250> past<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.579> time<00:04:15.759> but<00:04:15.879> it's

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
a game the past the time but it's

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.879 
a game the past the time but it's
actually<00:04:16.509> happening<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.169> that's<00:04:17.530> where<00:04:17.859> you

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
actually happening and that's where you

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.069 
actually happening and that's where you
know<00:04:18.159> Richthofen<00:04:18.729> comes<00:04:18.940> from<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.690> know<00:04:19.720> and

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
know Richthofen comes from you know and

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.509 
know Richthofen comes from you know and
that's<00:04:20.229> where<00:04:20.380> Samantha<00:04:20.680> happens<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.459> all

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
that's where Samantha happens and all

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.010 
that's where Samantha happens and all
that<00:04:21.669> kind<00:04:21.849> of<00:04:21.909> stuff<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.180> it's<00:04:22.479> kind<00:04:22.659> of<00:04:22.720> weird

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
that kind of stuff so it's kind of weird

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.570 
that kind of stuff so it's kind of weird
let<00:04:23.530> me<00:04:23.620> know<00:04:23.710> what<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.919> guys<00:04:24.009> think<00:04:24.340> I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
let me know what you guys think I

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.219 
let me know what you guys think I
honestly<00:04:25.090> think<00:04:25.449> it's<00:04:25.570> just<00:04:25.810> multiple

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
honestly think it's just multiple

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.529 
honestly think it's just multiple
different<00:04:26.440> times<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.190> universes<00:04:28.029> you<00:04:28.419> know

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
different times and universes you know

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.390 
different times and universes you know
collapsing<00:04:29.110> on<00:04:29.229> each<00:04:29.260> other<00:04:29.590> from<00:04:29.919> because<00:04:30.279> of

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
collapsing on each other from because of

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.710 
collapsing on each other from because of
this

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
this

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.690 
this
you<00:04:31.020> know<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.230> whole<00:04:31.350> transfer<00:04:32.130> of<00:04:32.220> power<00:04:32.430> and

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
you know the whole transfer of power and

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.640 
you know the whole transfer of power and
II<00:04:32.880> thrus<00:04:33.120> energy<00:04:33.480> and<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.870> Agartha<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.590> all

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
II thrus energy and the Agartha and all

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.230 
II thrus energy and the Agartha and all
that<00:04:34.800> kind<00:04:34.980> of<00:04:35.010> stuff<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.880> that's<00:04:36.030> what<00:04:36.210> I

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
that kind of stuff so that's what I

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.610 
that kind of stuff so that's what I
think<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.810> think<00:04:36.840> it's<00:04:37.170> multiple

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
think it is I think it's multiple

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.190 
think it is I think it's multiple
universes<00:04:38.280> crashing<00:04:39.090> together<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.690> don't

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
universes crashing together I don't

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.630 
universes crashing together I don't
think<00:04:40.440> this<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.710> end<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:41.250> don't<00:04:41.400> think<00:04:41.460> it

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
think this is the end I don't think it

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.990 
think this is the end I don't think it
was<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.120> game<00:04:42.360> if<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.870> is<00:04:43.340> no<00:04:44.340> ha<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:44.910> is

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
was just a game if it is no ha that is

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.940 
was just a game if it is no ha that is
such<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> sad<00:04:45.540> thing<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> think<00:04:46.170> but<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.860> know

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
such a sad thing to think but you know

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.110 
such a sad thing to think but you know
it's<00:04:47.130> what<00:04:47.820> happens<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.570> hopefully<00:04:49.170> hopefully

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
it's what happens so hopefully hopefully

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.220 
it's what happens so hopefully hopefully
that<00:04:51.120> is<00:04:51.150> not<00:04:51.360> what<00:04:51.480> happens<00:04:51.750> hopefully<00:04:51.990> we

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
that is not what happens hopefully we

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.290 
that is not what happens hopefully we
find<00:04:52.410> out<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.890> is<00:04:52.920> some<00:04:53.220> kind<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.580> time

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
find out that it is some kind of time

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.090 
find out that it is some kind of time
collapsing<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.170> itself<00:04:55.200> maybe<00:04:55.860> it's

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
collapsing on itself maybe it's

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.740 
collapsing on itself maybe it's
different<00:04:56.370> universes<00:04:57.150> colliding<00:04:57.660> together

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
different universes colliding together

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.230 
different universes colliding together
hopefully<00:04:58.620> that's<00:04:58.770> what<00:04:58.950> it<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.070> because<00:04:59.940> i

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
hopefully that's what it is because i

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.060 
hopefully that's what it is because i
