maybe Dionne Warwick but that's about it
I<00:01:42.860> think<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:44.180> is<00:01:44.390> definitely<00:01:44.900> going<00:01:45.020> to

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
I think that this is definitely going to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.620 
I think that this is definitely going to
be<00:01:45.200> good<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:46.100> makes<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.150> said<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.510> that

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
be good it makes it like I said so that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.929

you<00:01:47.720> can<00:01:47.869> get<00:01:47.990> all<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.260> cards<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.220> one<00:01:49.310> spot<00:01:49.880> I

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
you can get all the cards in one spot I

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.760 
you can get all the cards in one spot I
mean<00:01:50.180> I'm<00:01:50.299> sure<00:01:50.540> that<00:01:50.869> there's<00:01:51.350> going<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.740> be

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:09.859 
like gears INX is as borderline broken

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:10.919 
like gears INX is as borderline broken
as<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.069> can<00:02:10.279> get<00:02:10.429> there

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
NX and sits on a while like that's

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.819 
NX and sits on a while like that's
pretty<00:02:12.609> much<00:02:12.879> that<00:02:13.719> was<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:13.989> right<00:02:14.349> above

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
pretty much that was like right above

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.250 
pretty much that was like right above
it's<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:15.700> right<00:02:15.969> near<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.420> limit<00:02:16.870> or<00:02:17.019> that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
it's like right near that limit or that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.289 
it's like right near that limit or that
deadline<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.280> like<00:02:18.430> should<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:18.700> limit<00:02:19.030> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
can pretty much make rank 3 as easy as

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.379 
can pretty much make rank 3 as easy as
it<00:02:37.629> can<00:02:37.750> rank<00:02:38.500> 4<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.099> like<00:02:39.280> giving<00:02:40.030> them<00:02:40.209> are
