resto shaman and myself went up against
a<00:02:57.200> boomkin<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.849> mom<00:02:59.090> should<00:02:59.420> have<00:02:59.450> been

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
a boomkin and a mom should have been

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.619 
a boomkin and a mom should have been
done<00:02:59.900> deal<00:03:00.280> three-minute<00:03:01.280> match<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:02.030> was<00:03:02.209> over

done deal three-minute match it was over

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.750 
done deal three-minute match it was over
even<00:03:03.530> if<00:03:03.620> ads<00:03:03.799> wait<00:03:04.010> for<00:03:04.190> pulled<00:03:04.340> out<00:03:04.489> stuff

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
like that we actually ended up getting

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.839 
like that we actually ended up getting
beat<00:03:06.500> because<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.890> boomkin<00:03:07.220> was<00:03:07.579> just

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
beat because the boomkin was just

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.330 
beat because the boomkin was just
healing<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.170> could<00:03:09.470> literally<00:03:09.769> just<00:03:10.129> not

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
healing and I could literally just not

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.300 
healing and I could literally just not
put<00:03:10.610> out<00:03:10.819> enough<00:03:11.239> damage<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.709> counteract<00:03:13.190> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
put out enough damage to counteract the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.920 
put out enough damage to counteract the
boom<00:03:13.519> concealing<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.360> they<00:03:14.420> couldn't<00:03:14.660> kill

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
boom concealing and they couldn't kill

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.160 
boom concealing and they couldn't kill
me<00:03:15.110> either<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:16.579> tell<00:03:17.209> my<00:03:17.359> shaman<00:03:17.810> ran<00:03:17.989> out<00:03:18.140> of

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
mana which was something that kind of

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.589 
mana which was something that kind of
pissed<00:03:21.859> me<00:03:21.980> off<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.129> my<00:03:22.970> shaman<00:03:23.390> around

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
pissed me off because my shaman around

mana before the boom cadet even though

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.809 
mana before the boom cadet even though
my<00:03:25.519> shaman<00:03:25.879> healer<00:03:26.420> in<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.569> boomkin<00:03:26.840> has<00:03:27.200> not

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
my shaman healer in the boomkin has not
