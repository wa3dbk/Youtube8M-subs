00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 I'm going to teach you to do the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.629
 with wholemeal flour and the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.460
 filling will be palm heart 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.940
 then there will also be three 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.940
 stuffing and dough and assemble to make the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.940
 stuffing I'll start getting on this cake 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 one tomato and 200 grams of palm heart 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.430
 It reminds us of the method of our area that my 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.879
 Always after everything, chopped good to 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.390
 to heat a little olive oil and the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.390
 notion 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.680
 after heated oil add the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.680
 onion to worship 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:06.640
 after gilding and recent wiping 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.640
 automatic and a little salt 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.799
 After you've taken it, you've softened it. 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.799
 add the palm heart 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.790
 when it was almost ready and 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.890
 will add 5 tablespoons of 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.960
 oats oats will suck water from the river 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.680
 full leaving him more dry and 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.170
 creamy cream when the vein has 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.090
 sucked all the water and the filling is already 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:47.710
 dry it can turn off the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 I always start the dough by putting three 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:59.619
 cups flour and salt to taste and oil 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.430
 I'll put our few oil up 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.430
 give mass point 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.939
 the blonde 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.410
 I want some people on the job 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.690
 the mass must be at a point where 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 Can you put it together? 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.750
 homogeneous but at the same time it is 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.160
 spreads easily to mount 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.260
 I'll get some of the pasta. 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.129
 place in the mold and tighten 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.340
 fingers for her to take shape shape 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:50.010
 It is important that the dough does not get too 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.060
 that you can not see the background of the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.019
 sheet but that it maintains the shape of the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.120
 fury 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.030
 here, do not get too much and not much 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.829
 stuffing here in the middle 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.290
 we will put the filling and to cover or 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:12.750
 get some more pasta with the help 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.920
 the palm stretch fit the hand 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.920
 over the line 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:28.730
 here, just take those with your fingers and 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.730
 sinking of the light weight of the edges 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.330
 or not yet 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.720
 braga 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.410
 or not 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.410
 I want manga 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.620

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:05.290

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.270
 200 degrees 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.430
 the time in the oven depends 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.590
 size of the Olympics if it is a 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.410

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.800
 ready the pot pie can take up to an hour 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.860
 misdirecting us to handle and forminha 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.820
