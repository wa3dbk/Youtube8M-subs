we<00:01:34.610> put<00:01:34.789> it<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.030> on<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.990> electric<00:01:39.380> fuel

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
we put it on on and the electric fuel

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.449 
we put it on on and the electric fuel
pump<00:01:39.799> comes<00:01:40.039> on<00:01:41.020> put<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.259> on<00:01:42.830> there's<00:01:43.369> a

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
pump comes on put this on on there's a

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:44.980 
pump comes on put this on on there's a
starter<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.209> have<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.450> hold<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.750> brake

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
starter but you have to hold the brake

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.990 
starter but you have to hold the brake
and<00:01:45.289> push<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.069> starter<00:01:46.399> at<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.580> same<00:01:46.759> time

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
and push the starter at the same time

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.249 
and push the starter at the same time
now<00:01:47.179> this<00:01:47.330> is<00:01:47.390> fuel-injected

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
now this is fuel-injected

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.309 
now this is fuel-injected
so<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:48.979> starts<00:01:49.250> up<00:01:49.429> really<00:01:50.090> nice<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.330> cold<00:01:51.020> so

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
so it starts up really nice and cold so

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.039 
so it starts up really nice and cold so
I'm<00:01:51.770> going<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.069> pull<00:01:52.250> this<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.869> reach<00:01:53.869> over

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
I'm going to pull this and reach over

on<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.440> motorcycle<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.910> one<00:02:27.060> thing<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
on a motorcycle this is one thing I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.570 
on a motorcycle this is one thing I
really<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:27.960> like<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.100> way<00:02:29.220> bikes

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
really don't like but it's the way bikes

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.230 
really don't like but it's the way bikes
are<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:31.800> low<00:02:32.520> beam<00:02:32.730> right<00:02:33.000> here

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
are this is your low beam right here

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.400 
are this is your low beam right here
right<00:02:33.480> here<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.880> your<00:02:36.000> high<00:02:36.120> beam

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
right here and this is your high beam

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.380 
right here and this is your high beam
usually<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.560> put<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.010> all<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.340> bulb<00:02:38.640> but

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
usually they put it all in one bulb but

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.910 
usually they put it all in one bulb but
if<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.570> come<00:02:39.690> over<00:02:39.810> here<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.320> put<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.590> on

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.360 

high<00:02:43.920> beam<00:02:44.160> right<00:02:44.430> there<00:02:45.770> what<00:02:46.770> happens<00:02:47.160> is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
high beam right there what happens is

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
high beam right there what happens is
the<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.830> right<00:02:50.010> side<00:02:50.280> goes<00:02:50.520> off<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> left

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
the the right side goes off and the left

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.160 
the the right side goes off and the left
side<00:02:51.600> goes<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:52.640> which<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.970> neat<00:02:54.170> so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
side goes on which is kind of neat so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.080 
side goes on which is kind of neat so
I'm<00:02:55.290> going<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:55.830> drive<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.880> top

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
I'm going to go out and drive it the top

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.550 
I'm going to go out and drive it the top
speed<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.390> supposed<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.020> 40s<00:02:58.380> but

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
speed is supposed to be in the 40s but

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.470 
speed is supposed to be in the 40s but
I'm<00:02:58.680> not<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:59.520> not<00:02:59.700> sure<00:02:59.880> we'll<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:00.210> what<00:03:00.360> it's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I'm not I'm not sure we'll see what it's

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.670 
I'm not I'm not sure we'll see what it's
like<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:02.400> pay<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> lot<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.850> money<00:03:02.940> for

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.429 

for<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:09.349> Yamahas<00:03:09.829> or<00:03:10.099> Honda's<00:03:10.519> but<00:03:10.670> they<00:03:10.790> have

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
for the Yamahas or Honda's but they have

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.559 
for the Yamahas or Honda's but they have
so<00:03:12.439> many<00:03:12.650> millions<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.730> dollars<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.269> years

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
so many millions of dollars and years

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.380 
so many millions of dollars and years
and<00:03:14.870> hours<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.260> research<00:03:15.909> into<00:03:16.909> all<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
and hours of research into all the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.589 
and hours of research into all the
plastics<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.230> all<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.819> engines<00:03:19.819> so<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.420> they

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
plastics and all the engines so it they

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.849 
plastics and all the engines so it they
last<00:03:20.840> forever<00:03:23.290> though<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.349> you<00:03:24.500> give<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.739> a

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
last forever though so you give it a

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:30.070 
last forever though so you give it a
little<00:03:24.980> Rev<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.370> see<00:03:25.489> what<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.670> sounds<00:03:25.819> like

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.449 

that's<00:03:30.800> power

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.440 

okay<00:03:35.459> I'm<00:03:35.549> going<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.700> go<00:03:35.790> for<00:03:35.939> my<00:03:36.030> first<00:03:36.239> test

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
okay I'm going to go for my first test

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:49.209 
okay I'm going to go for my first test
drive<00:03:38.090> 2013<00:03:40.010> Yamaha<00:03:41.010> Zoomer<00:03:41.840> 50<00:03:43.609> with<00:03:44.609> exactly

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:49.219 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.599 

1.7<00:03:50.219> miles<00:03:50.400> on<00:03:50.670> them<00:03:52.370> I'll<00:03:53.370> take<00:03:53.519> another

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
1.7 miles on them I'll take another

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.450 
1.7 miles on them I'll take another
video<00:03:53.969> when<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.180> get<00:03:54.329> back
