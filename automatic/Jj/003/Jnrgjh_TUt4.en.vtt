bullet<00:02:20.920> drop<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.660> 15<00:02:22.680> meters<00:02:23.680> per<00:02:24.340> second

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
bullet drop is 15 meters per second

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.039 
bullet drop is 15 meters per second
alrighty<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.950> reload<00:02:27.640> time<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.540> three

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
alrighty the reload time is three

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.059 
alrighty the reload time is three
seconds<00:02:29.620> when<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.000> magazine<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.269> empty<00:02:31.569> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
seconds when the magazine is empty and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.420 
seconds when the magazine is empty and
reload<00:02:33.069> time<00:02:33.489> is<00:02:33.850> 2.5<00:02:34.769> seconds<00:02:35.769> when<00:02:36.190> there<00:02:36.340> is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
reload time is 2.5 seconds when there is

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.870 
reload time is 2.5 seconds when there is
least<00:02:36.730> one<00:02:37.180> left<00:02:37.600> in<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> chamber<00:02:38.880> therefore

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
least one left in the chamber therefore

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.390 
least one left in the chamber therefore
meaning<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.049> definitely<00:02:41.620> reload<00:02:42.220> when

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
meaning you know definitely reload when

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.949 
meaning you know definitely reload when
there's<00:02:42.549> one<00:02:42.670> left<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.090> chamber<00:02:43.299> it's<00:02:43.750> got

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
there's one left in the chamber it's got

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.229 
there's one left in the chamber it's got
a<00:02:43.989> pretty<00:02:44.380> fast<00:02:44.829> reload<00:02:45.519> time<00:02:45.819> for<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
a pretty fast reload time for the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.840 
a pretty fast reload time for the
assaults<00:02:46.930> therefore<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.920> kind<00:02:48.489> of<00:02:48.549> have<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
assaults therefore you kind of have the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.620 
assaults therefore you kind of have the
drop<00:02:49.090> on<00:02:49.239> other<00:02:49.510> people<00:02:50.260> recoil<00:02:51.299> going<00:02:52.299> into

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
drop on other people recoil going into

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.949 
drop on other people recoil going into
the<00:02:52.750> recoil<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.380> ak-12<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.569> 0.32<00:02:55.569> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
the recoil on the ak-12 it is 0.32 the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.759 
the recoil on the ak-12 it is 0.32 the
up<00:02:56.790> recoil<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.299> left<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.720> zero<00:02:58.989> point<00:02:59.200> 15

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
up recoil to the left is zero point 15

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.580 
up recoil to the left is zero point 15
recoil<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.519> right<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.880> 0.1<00:03:01.810> therefore

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
recoil to the right is 0.1 therefore

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.190 
recoil to the right is 0.1 therefore
you're<00:03:02.709> looking<00:03:03.040> at<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.579> know<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.850> high<00:03:04.299> to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
you're looking at a you know a high to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.590 
you're looking at a you know a high to
the<00:03:05.319> left<00:03:05.680> recoil<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.910> counter<00:03:07.269> that<00:03:07.420> you're

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
the left recoil to counter that you're

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.180 
the left recoil to counter that you're
going<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> want<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.930> drag<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.500> right<00:03:08.859> and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
going to want to drag to the right and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.690 
going to want to drag to the right and
down<00:03:09.630> make<00:03:10.630> sure<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.959> go<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.440> right<00:03:11.920> first

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
down make sure you go to the right first

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.530 
down make sure you go to the right first
that<00:03:13.510> basically<00:03:13.780> leaves<00:03:14.319> us<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:15.069> stats

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
that basically leaves us to the stats

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.220 
that basically leaves us to the stats
some<00:03:16.769> opinion<00:03:17.769> wise<00:03:18.040> with<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.879> ak-12<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:20.049> I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
some opinion wise with the ak-12 that I

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.300 
some opinion wise with the ak-12 that I
can<00:03:20.650> definitely<00:03:20.830> put<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.700> with<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:23.129> gun

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
can definitely put in is with the gun

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.970 
can definitely put in is with the gun
it<00:03:24.370> does<00:03:24.700> have<00:03:24.910> some<00:03:25.209> pretty<00:03:25.480> high<00:03:25.780> recoil<00:03:26.470> so

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
it does have some pretty high recoil so

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.190 
it does have some pretty high recoil so
I<00:03:27.010> would<00:03:27.220> like<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.489> build<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.000> gun<00:03:28.209> as<00:03:28.420> much<00:03:28.930> as

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
I would like to build the gun as much as

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.960 
I would like to build the gun as much as
a<00:03:29.260> recoil<00:03:30.390> destroyer<00:03:31.390> as<00:03:31.950> possible<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.489> i<00:03:33.520> will

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
a recoil destroyer as possible so i will

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.550 
a recoil destroyer as possible so i will
throw<00:03:34.330> on<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:35.140> angled<00:03:35.890> grip<00:03:35.890> is<00:03:36.959> my<00:03:37.959> main

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
throw on the angled grip is my main

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.759 
throw on the angled grip is my main
attachment<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.970> also<00:03:40.239> want<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:41.080> also<00:03:41.290> put<00:03:41.620> on

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
attachment you also want to also put on

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.970 
attachment you also want to also put on
the<00:03:42.010> muzzle<00:03:42.790> barrel<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:44.500> stop<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.910> incoming

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
the muzzle barrel to stop the incoming

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.949 
the muzzle barrel to stop the incoming
or<00:03:47.980> not<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.400> muzzle<00:03:48.670> muzzle<00:03:49.060> bait<00:03:49.269> brake<00:03:49.630> arm

or not the muzzle muzzle bait brake arm

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.640 
or not the muzzle muzzle bait brake arm
to<00:03:50.890> stop<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.670> lot<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.330> recoil<00:03:52.569> coming<00:03:53.230> up<00:03:53.440> it

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
to stop a lot of recoil coming up it

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.720 
to stop a lot of recoil coming up it
will<00:03:53.980> affect<00:03:54.430> though<00:03:54.730> your<00:03:55.030> hipfire<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:57.010> but

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
will affect though your hipfire so but

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.340 
will affect though your hipfire so but
it<00:03:57.819> is<00:03:57.940> such<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> powerful<00:03:58.540> gun<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:59.019> close

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
it is such a powerful gun for close

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.039 
it is such a powerful gun for close
range<00:03:59.530> you<00:04:00.010> can<00:04:00.040> pretty<00:04:00.850> hit<00:04:01.120> them<00:04:01.299> off<00:04:01.450> quite

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
range you can pretty hit them off quite

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.910 
range you can pretty hit them off quite
easily<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.370> also<00:04:03.640> then<00:04:04.420> like<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.959> put<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.380> on

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
easily and I also then like to put on on

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.190 
easily and I also then like to put on on
the<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.840> I'm<00:04:07.959> forgetting<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:09.599> Cobra<00:04:10.599> site

red dot sight no because the recoil on

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.120 
red dot sight no because the recoil on
this<00:04:16.930> gun<00:04:17.200> is<00:04:17.410> kind<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:17.979> up<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.030> like<00:04:19.479> how<00:04:19.750> the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
this gun is kind of up so I like how the

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.490 
this gun is kind of up so I like how the
Cobra<00:04:21.130> site<00:04:21.430> has<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.729> line<00:04:22.300> going<00:04:22.660> down<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.320> to

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
Cobra site has a line going down and to

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.230 
Cobra site has a line going down and to
the<00:04:23.530> left<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:23.950> I<00:04:23.979> can<00:04:24.280> you<00:04:24.400> know<00:04:24.550> counter<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.120> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
the left so I can you know counter it a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.409 
the left so I can you know counter it a
little<00:04:25.540> easier<00:04:26.200> let<00:04:27.100> me<00:04:27.190> say<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.340> again<00:04:27.490> like

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
little easier let me say that again like

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.219 
little easier let me say that again like
I<00:04:28.570> said<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:29.490> vertical<00:04:30.490> grip<00:04:30.940> muzzle<00:04:31.810> brake

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
I said the vertical grip muzzle brake

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.219 
I said the vertical grip muzzle brake
and<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> Cobra<00:04:33.310> site<00:04:33.760> are<00:04:34.000> my<00:04:34.240> favorite
