00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.240 
the general answer is ninety-nine
percent<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.630> time<00:01:45.840> yes<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:46.860> some<00:01:47.070> point

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
percent the time yes just at some point

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
percent the time yes just at some point
in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> future<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.630> far<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> only<00:01:49.079> thing

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
in the future at so far the only thing

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.399 
in the future at so far the only thing
we're<00:01:49.530> missing<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:50.100> hardcore<00:01:51.030> mode<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.570> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
we're missing is hardcore mode and I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.350 
we're missing is hardcore mode and I
think<00:01:53.250> writing<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.670> books<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.000> even<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
think writing in books but even that

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.539 
think writing in books but even that
could<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.899> theory<00:01:55.110> come<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.189> yeah<00:01:56.340> we're<00:01:56.520> not

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
could in theory come so yeah we're not

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.999 
could in theory come so yeah we're not
really<00:01:56.700> missing<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> much<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.439> world<00:01:58.649> sizes

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
really missing that much the world sizes

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.190 
really missing that much the world sizes
up<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.219> limited<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.670> generally<00:02:00.149> speaking

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
up is limited but generally speaking

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.420 
up is limited but generally speaking
features<00:02:01.200> come<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.829> well<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.250> pretty

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
features come in as well it's pretty

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
features come in as well it's pretty
good<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.790> way<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.500> fireworks<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.770> don't

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
good that way and fireworks I don't

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
good that way and fireworks I don't
think<00:02:05.430> they'll<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.909> coming<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.270> toilet<00:02:06.540> 14

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
think they'll be coming in toilet 14

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.550 
think they'll be coming in toilet 14
because<00:02:07.789> they<00:02:08.789> were<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.060> 1.4<00:02:09.569> m<00:02:09.629> pc<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.140> there

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
because they were in 1.4 m pc and there

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.809 
because they were in 1.4 m pc and there
are<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> fair<00:02:10.950> amount<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.250> effort<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.700> them

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
are a fair amount of effort to get them

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.120 
are a fair amount of effort to get them
because<00:02:12.270> they're<00:02:12.480> like

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
because they're like

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.410 
because they're like
you<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.310> intensive<00:02:13.700> for<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.850> xbox<00:02:14.240> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
you can intensive for the xbox and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.120 
you can intensive for the xbox and
they're<00:02:15.080> not<00:02:15.200> really<00:02:15.380> much<00:02:15.500> pay<00:02:15.770> off<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.100> I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
they're not really much pay off so I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.350 
they're not really much pay off so I
wouldn't<00:02:16.430> imagine<00:02:16.490> they'd<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:17.000> coming<00:02:17.270> in

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
wouldn't imagine they'd be coming in

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.990 
wouldn't imagine they'd be coming in
early<00:02:17.690> like<00:02:17.960> that's<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.590> they<00:02:19.310> could<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.820> but

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
early like that's I they could be but

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.060 
early like that's I they could be but
it's<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.300> unlikely<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.990> fireworks<00:02:21.590> probably

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
it's just unlikely so fireworks probably

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.980 
it's just unlikely so fireworks probably
not<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.250> tablet<00:02:22.520> 14<00:02:22.940> almost<00:02:23.540> definitely<00:02:23.900> in

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
think they'll be village trading and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.250 
think they'll be village trading and
will<00:02:34.910> there<00:02:35.120> be<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.300> different<00:02:35.600> interface<00:02:35.810> so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
will there be a different interface so

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.440 
will there be a different interface so

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.440 
one screen it's pretty snazzy it
basically<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.730> more<00:02:49.850> console<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.270> any

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
basically it's a more console for any

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.270 
basically it's a more console for any
version<00:02:50.600> pc<00:02:50.990> one<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:51.650> pretty<00:02:52.040> similar

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
version pc one it's pretty similar

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.040 
version pc one it's pretty similar
though<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:52.820> everything's<00:02:53.270> still<00:02:53.630> there<00:02:53.870> it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
though so everything's still there it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.480 
though so everything's still there it
just<00:02:54.440> looks<00:02:54.650> different<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.100> it's<00:02:55.280> pretty

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
just looks different and it's pretty

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.460 
just looks different and it's pretty
decent<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.150> um<00:02:56.330> there<00:02:56.840> will<00:02:57.020> definitely<00:02:57.050> be

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
decent so um there will definitely be

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.840 
decent so um there will definitely be
villager<00:02:57.770> trading<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.460> does<00:02:58.610> have<00:02:58.640> a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
villager trading and it does have a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.520

and you know do stuff like that and
commands<00:04:38.060> there<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.360> really<00:04:38.599> complex<00:04:38.930> thing

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
commands there is really complex thing

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.839 
commands there is really complex thing
that<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.650> do<00:04:39.770> properly<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:40.280> need<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.550> keyboard

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
that to do properly you need a keyboard

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.089 
that to do properly you need a keyboard
and<00:04:41.300> they<00:04:42.199> don't<00:04:42.319> want<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.590> encourage<00:04:42.800> people

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099

to<00:04:43.160> plug<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.550> keyboard<00:04:43.940> because<00:04:44.090> then

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
to plug in the keyboard because then

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.790 
to plug in the keyboard because then
that<00:04:44.300> gives<00:04:44.449> in<00:04:44.630> bondage<00:04:44.960> people<00:04:45.199> to<00:04:45.289> do<00:04:45.470> and

that gives in bondage people to do and

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800 
that gives in bondage people to do and
it's<00:04:46.430> they<00:04:46.759> said<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.270> while<00:04:47.419> back<00:04:47.479> when

villager<00:06:11.330> trading<00:06:11.479> and<00:06:12.759> maybe<00:06:13.759> the<00:06:14.210> fact<00:06:14.389> that

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
villager trading and maybe the fact that

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.540 
villager trading and maybe the fact that
anvils<00:06:15.110> are<00:06:15.229> there<00:06:15.440> so<00:06:15.740> you<00:06:15.800> can<00:06:16.070> just<00:06:16.099> kind<00:06:16.490> of
