00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
kind of serious parts you had the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.750 
kind of serious parts you had the
beginning<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.510> God<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.309> kind<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
beginning with God that was kind of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.189 
beginning with God that was kind of
interesting<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> again<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.989> can't

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
interesting but that again we can't

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.060 
interesting but that again we can't
really<00:00:55.489> get<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.850> information<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
really get much information from that it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.310 
really get much information from that it
was<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.840> need<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.109> how<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
was just I don't need to know how to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.939 
was just I don't need to know how to
explain<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
explain it but I think is going to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.390 
explain it but I think is going to
go<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> next<00:01:06.960> episode<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.799> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
go down in the next episode because it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.020 
go down in the next episode because it
ends<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.979> pretty<00:01:10.979> obvious<00:01:11.610> moment

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
ends up with a pretty obvious moment

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
ends up with a pretty obvious moment
where<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> know<00:01:12.330> something<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
where you know something is going to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070 
where you know something is going to
happen<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.490> am<00:01:15.060> looking<00:01:15.540> forward<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
happen so I am looking forward to the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
happen so I am looking forward to the
next<00:01:16.200> episode<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.460> really

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
next episode this one I just really

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
next episode this one I just really
enjoyed<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> humor<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.220> games

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
enjoyed for the humor and all the games

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
enjoyed for the humor and all the games
are<00:01:20.640> funny<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.090> well<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:21.689> came<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.110> with

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
are funny as well like they came up with

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.429 
are funny as well like they came up with
stupidest<00:01:23.009> games<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.299> bets<00:01:24.689> actually

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
stupidest games and of all bets actually

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
stupidest games and of all bets actually
and<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> reason<00:01:27.240> why<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.720> played<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> games

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and the reason why they played the games

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.319 
and the reason why they played the games
is<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:28.880> Steph<00:01:29.880> wanted<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> make

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
is because Steph wanted to kind of make

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
is because Steph wanted to kind of make
 oh<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.950> sua<00:01:35.659> decent<00:01:36.659> who<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.770> he<00:01:37.860> really

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
 oh and sua decent who and he really

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
 oh and sua decent who and he really
wanted<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.670> decent<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.240> he<00:01:39.390> wanted<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> lose

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
wanted to be decent so he wanted to lose

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.920 
wanted to be decent so he wanted to lose
but<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.740> gonna<00:01:40.920> help<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:42.150> he

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
but that's not gonna help because he

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.300 
but that's not gonna help because he
just<00:01:43.530> wins<00:01:43.710> every<00:01:44.070> time

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
just wins every time

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.300 
just wins every time
and<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:45.570> also<00:01:46.020> had<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> whole<00:01:46.590> theory<00:01:46.950> about

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and they also had a whole theory about

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.330 
and they also had a whole theory about
everything<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.200> went<00:01:49.470> kind<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.920> serious

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
everything and that went kind of serious

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280 
everything and that went kind of serious
then<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.850> was<00:01:51.000> also<00:01:51.180> very<00:01:51.329> interesting

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
then that was also very interesting

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.960 
then that was also very interesting
after<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:52.950> he<00:01:52.979> played<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.579> games<00:01:53.610> they

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
after when he played all the games they

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.590 
after when he played all the games they
also<00:01:54.210> kind<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.659> realized<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
also kind of realized that they have to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.139 
also kind of realized that they have to
do<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.950> take<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.790> stuff

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.170 
do you have to take more more stuff
seriously<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> case

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
seriously and that was not the case

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.870 
seriously and that was not the case
before<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.369> more<00:02:05.579> asking

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
before so they have to do more asking

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550 
before so they have to do more asking
and<00:02:06.360> queen<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and queen and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.120 
and queen and
they<00:02:07.710> end<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> library<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.750> step

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
they end up at a library like step

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.760 
they end up at a library like step
library<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.400> they're<00:02:11.550> supposed<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
library and they're supposed to be a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
library and they're supposed to be a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
actually an angel and I didn't expect it

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.670 
actually an angel and I didn't expect it
to<00:02:20.010> look<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.500> was

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
