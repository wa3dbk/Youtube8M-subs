trouble if you don't have this type of
packaging<00:02:24.190> gap<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:24.670> impossible<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:26.170> that's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
packaging gap it's impossible and that's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.010 
packaging gap it's impossible and that's
because<00:02:27.490> with<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.480> happen<00:02:28.990> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
because with this you just happen to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.320 
because with this you just happen to
spritz<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:31.440> corner<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.330> basically

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
spritz it in the corner and basically

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.880 
spritz it in the corner and basically

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
you turn this sir you close it so you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.980 
you turn this sir you close it so you
turn<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.370> back<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.240> is<00:02:40.450> basically<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
turn it back and this is basically the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.830 
turn it back and this is basically the
way<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.290> he<00:02:41.410> looks<00:02:42.030> also<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.270> other<00:02:43.390> problem

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
way that he looks also the other problem

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.430 
way that he looks also the other problem
that<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.020> got<00:02:44.290> sir<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:46.120> when<00:02:46.930> me

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
that I got sir with this is that when me

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.410 
that I got sir with this is that when me
now<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.980> see<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.430> there<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:49.000> liquid

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
now you can see that there is the liquid

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.860 
now you can see that there is the liquid
and<00:02:49.920> when<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.070> goes<00:02:51.280> past<00:02:51.610> beyond<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.330> very

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
and when it goes past beyond this very

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.440 
and when it goes past beyond this very
very<00:02:53.170> little<00:02:55.170> transparent<00:02:56.170> PISA<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:58.240> don't

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
very little transparent PISA you don't

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.230 
very little transparent PISA you don't
know<00:02:58.570> how<00:02:58.750> much<00:02:58.960> is<00:02:59.200> left<00:02:59.410> I<00:03:00.010> mean<00:03:00.520> this<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:01.060> is

not basically lose the cap but also you
know<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.850> bottom<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:50.050> actually<00:03:50.410> have<00:03:50.590> to

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
know the bottom you actually have to

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.860 
know the bottom you actually have to
turn<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.760> if<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:52.000> turn<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.540> close<00:03:52.840> it

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
well is not going to open up so overall

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.150 
well is not going to open up so overall
I<00:03:57.220> think<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.580> travel<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.150> better<00:03:58.390> as<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:59.160> said

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
I think that travel is better as I said

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.640 
I think that travel is better as I said
because<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:01.209> can<00:04:01.510> see<00:04:01.660> how<00:04:01.810> much<00:04:01.959> product<00:04:02.470> is

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
because I can see how much product is

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.370 
because I can see how much product is
left<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.430> much<00:04:03.640> easier<00:04:03.670> also<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:05.170> don't

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
this one cannot be used the results

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.140 
this one cannot be used the results
another<00:05:06.229> one<00:05:06.500> by<00:05:06.680> Bulgari<00:05:07.250> which<00:05:07.520> has<00:05:07.669> got<00:05:07.910> a

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
another one by Bulgari which has got a

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.210 
another one by Bulgari which has got a
similar<00:05:08.660> packaging<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.470> a<00:05:09.560> sense<00:05:09.800> that<00:05:09.919> it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
similar packaging in a sense that it

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.300 
similar packaging in a sense that it
doesn't<00:05:10.400> have<00:05:10.760> this<00:05:11.120> nozzle<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:12.310> therefore

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
doesn't have this nozzle and therefore

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.610 
doesn't have this nozzle and therefore
this<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.520> Sephora<00:05:14.150> would<00:05:14.570> work<00:05:14.870> out<00:05:15.139> much

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
this a Sephora would work out much

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.600 
this a Sephora would work out much
better<00:05:16.070> so<00:05:16.970> overall<00:05:17.450> it's<00:05:18.290> an<00:05:18.560> okay<00:05:18.860> product<00:05:19.430> I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
better so overall it's an okay product I

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.010 
better so overall it's an okay product I
mean<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:19.940> at<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.210> end<00:05:20.330> of<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.540> day<00:05:20.720> it's<00:05:20.900> an

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
mean and at the end of the day it's an

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.180 
mean and at the end of the day it's an
optimizer<00:05:21.729> it<00:05:22.729> is<00:05:23.630> much<00:05:23.990> easier<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.500> find<00:05:24.650> it

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
optimizer it is much easier to find it

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.520 
optimizer it is much easier to find it
