on the end it isn't supposed to drop
into<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.750> slot<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.340> should<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.939> be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
into the slot but it should just be

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.649 
into the slot but it should just be
right<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.229> edge<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.659> the

it<00:02:32.420> should<00:02:32.780> sit<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.439> top<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.189> that<00:02:34.549> step<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:36.170> the

it should sit on top of that step if the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.229 
it should sit on top of that step if the

gauge falls in alongside of that step

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.709 
gauge falls in alongside of that step
then<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:41.659> track<00:02:42.079> is<00:02:42.290> too<00:02:42.560> wide<00:02:43.389> to<00:02:44.389> check<00:02:44.689> a

turnout

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
turnout

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.729

we<00:02:46.069> start<00:02:46.459> by<00:02:46.700> using<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.569> pins<00:02:47.930> labeled

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
we start by using the pins labeled

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.670 
we start by using the pins labeled
points<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.150> upper<00:02:50.480> right<00:02:50.750> hand<00:02:50.780> side<00:02:51.199> of

points in the upper right hand side of
the<00:02:51.769> gauge<00:02:52.329> so<00:02:53.329> we<00:02:53.510> turn<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.989> over<00:02:54.169> set<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.219> down

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the gauge so we turn it over set it down

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.610 
the gauge so we turn it over set it down
just<00:02:55.819> ahead<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.480> switch<00:02:56.780> points<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.530> it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
gauge so by turning it upside down we

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.399 
gauge so by turning it upside down we
can<00:03:33.859> set<00:03:34.129> them<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.790> turnout<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.629> then

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
can set them in the turnout and then

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.920 
can set them in the turnout and then

the<00:04:14.910> important<00:04:15.540> thing<00:04:15.780> about<00:04:15.810> using<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.860> NMR

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the important thing about using the NMR

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.360 
the important thing about using the NMR
8<00:04:17.459> gauge<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:18.180> if<00:04:18.780> both<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.380> track<00:04:19.800> and<00:04:20.160> the
