this all you need to do is to load up a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
this all you need to do is to load up a
clean<00:01:15.390> save<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.920> exactly<00:01:20.340> what

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
clean save so and that's exactly what

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.900 

we<00:01:48.260> can<00:01:48.470> always<00:01:48.740> load<00:01:49.100> slower<00:01:49.460> when<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.700> have

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
we can always load slower when I have

00:01:49.910 --> 00:02:06.320 
we can always load slower when I have
perhaps<00:01:50.180> running<00:01:50.540> eat<00:01:50.990> it

the quest markets work and you'll notice
that<00:02:42.960> this<00:02:43.380> time<00:02:43.740> when<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:43.980> when<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> enter<00:02:44.700> an

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that this time when I when I enter an

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.610 
that this time when I when I enter an
sqb<00:02:45.120> into<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> console<00:02:45.900> command<00:02:46.170> all<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
sqb into the console command all the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.610 
sqb into the console command all the
aliases<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.460> filled<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:51.450> here's<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.410> neat

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
aliases have it filled and here's a neat

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.710 
aliases have it filled and here's a neat
trick<00:02:52.740> if<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:53.910> want<00:02:54.630> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
make sure that the the log entries look

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.780 
make sure that the the log entries look
the<00:02:57.870> way<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.020> want<00:02:58.140> all<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.370> do<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.670> that

the way you want all you do is that

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.820 
the way you want all you do is that
you'll<00:02:59.910> enter<00:03:00.680> set<00:03:01.680> stage<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:03.030> quest<00:03:03.360> ID

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
you'll enter set stage the quest ID

enter that's it and in the stage you

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.570 
enter that's it and in the stage you
want<00:03:07.200> into<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> console<00:03:07.890> command<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.370> I'm

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
want into the console command so I'm

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.080 
want into the console command so I'm
gonna<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:09.260> 20

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.430 

and<00:03:15.540> you'll<00:03:16.170> see<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:17.750> let<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> log<00:03:19.080> entries

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and you'll see here let the log entries
