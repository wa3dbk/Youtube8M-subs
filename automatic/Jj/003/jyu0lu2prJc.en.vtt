from<00:00:01.829> day<00:00:02.129> one<00:00:02.399> Lego<00:00:03.120> said<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.810> game<00:00:04.080> is

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
from day one Lego said this game is

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.140 
from day one Lego said this game is
about<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.770> community<00:00:05.100> well<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.089> our

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
about the community well this is our

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.450 
about the community well this is our
second<00:00:06.540> big<00:00:06.750> lump<00:00:07.350> event<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.980> first<00:00:08.189> one<00:00:08.340> was

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
second big lump event the first one was

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.430 
second big lump event the first one was
about<00:00:08.610> their<00:00:09.030> ideas<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:10.230> was<00:00:10.320> their

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
about their ideas and what was their

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.620 
about their ideas and what was their
vision<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.219> had<00:00:11.309> an<00:00:11.400> empty<00:00:11.639> palate<00:00:12.059> what

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
vision if you had an empty palate what

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.140 
vision if you had an empty palate what
would<00:00:12.780> lego<00:00:12.960> universe<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.700> really<00:00:14.910> fed

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
would lego universe be and we really fed

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.460 
would lego universe be and we really fed
off<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.750> they<00:00:15.839> built<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.199> lot<00:00:16.379> of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
off of that and they built a lot of

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.990 
off of that and they built a lot of
amazing<00:00:16.680> stuff<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.369> still<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.730> around

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
amazing stuff that we still have around

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 
amazing stuff that we still have around
here<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.420> still<00:00:18.750> motivates<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.740> think<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
here that still motivates I think the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.509 
here that still motivates I think the
team<00:00:20.220> even<00:00:20.520> today<00:00:21.560> now<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.619> games<00:00:23.039> progressed

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
team even today now the games progressed

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.160 
team even today now the games progressed
enough<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.480> about<00:00:24.689> them<00:00:24.900> actually

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
enough and now it's about them actually

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.439 
enough and now it's about them actually
making<00:00:25.619> their<00:00:25.920> worlds<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> game<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.240> this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
making their worlds in the game and this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
making their worlds in the game and this
is<00:00:27.539> kind<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.779> our<00:00:27.930> first<00:00:28.170> time<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:29.220> someone

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
is kind of our first time of someone

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
is kind of our first time of someone
besides<00:00:29.910> us<00:00:30.179> actually<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.869> getting<00:00:31.199> in

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
besides us actually really getting in

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.900 
besides us actually really getting in
there<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.769> making<00:00:32.009> their<00:00:32.279> own<00:00:32.309> stuff<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
there and making their own stuff you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.209 
there and making their own stuff you
know<00:00:33.000> many<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> them<00:00:33.480> are<00:00:33.660> lead<00:00:34.290> engineers<00:00:34.920> at

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
know many of them are lead engineers at

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.950 
know many of them are lead engineers at
all<00:00:35.460> these<00:00:35.610> major<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.210> know<00:00:36.270> aeronautical

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
all these major you know aeronautical

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.420 
all these major you know aeronautical
engineering<00:00:37.410> companies<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.340> know

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
engineering companies and you know

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.479 
engineering companies and you know
during<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> day<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.719> serious

difficult job and they take that same

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.639 
difficult job and they take that same
engineering<00:00:44.879> approach<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:46.079> how<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.350> build

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
engineering approach to how they build

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.780 
engineering approach to how they build
things<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:48.149> amazing

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
laps our LEGO universe partners and they

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.240 
laps our LEGO universe partners and they
work<00:00:55.000> with<00:00:55.210> us<00:00:55.420> on<00:00:55.720> developing<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.770> game<00:00:56.980> and

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
work with us on developing the game and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.580 
work with us on developing the game and
developing<00:00:57.970> tools<00:00:58.240> to<00:00:58.570> actually<00:00:58.780> put<00:00:59.110> content

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
developing tools to actually put content

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.930 
developing tools to actually put content
into<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.100> game<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.490> so<00:01:00.640> they're<00:01:00.760> very

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
into the game and so they're very

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.490 
into the game and so they're very
passionate<00:01:01.180> about<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.050> they<00:01:02.140> just<00:01:02.350> bring

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500

passionate about it and they just bring
another<00:01:02.950> viewpoint<00:01:03.310> from<00:01:03.610> what<00:01:03.970> Lego<00:01:04.390> company

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
another viewpoint from what Lego company

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.540 
another viewpoint from what Lego company
brings<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.440> so<00:01:05.590> we<00:01:05.710> look<00:01:06.010> at<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.220> as<00:01:06.370> they

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
brings and so we look at it as they

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.240 
brings and so we look at it as they
really<00:01:06.760> are<00:01:06.910> part<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.750> 360<00:01:08.470> strategy<00:01:08.950> to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
really are part of a 360 strategy to

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.570 
really are part of a 360 strategy to
bring<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:10.120> Lego<00:01:10.450> use<00:01:11.140> into<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.920> online<00:01:12.370> space

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
bring the Lego use into the online space

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.250 
bring the Lego use into the online space
I<00:01:13.000> mean<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.300> humor<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:13.690> these<00:01:13.780> guys<00:01:13.930> r<00:01:13.960> ian

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
our designs and you know not take things

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.900 
our designs and you know not take things
seriously<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.070> really<00:01:21.250> helps<00:01:21.610> actually
