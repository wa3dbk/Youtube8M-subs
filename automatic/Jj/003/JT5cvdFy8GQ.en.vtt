we've<00:03:10.320> got<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> flashback<00:03:11.070> system<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:11.790> rear

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
we've got a flashback system so rear

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.290 
we've got a flashback system so rear
tail<00:03:12.420> lights<00:03:12.660> flash<00:03:12.990> fuse<00:03:13.740> blocks<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:15.120> also

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
tail lights flash fuse blocks we also

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.460 
tail lights flash fuse blocks we also
have<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:16.730> manual<00:03:17.730> reset<00:03:18.300> circuit<00:03:18.630> breaker<00:03:18.930> so

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
have a manual reset circuit breaker so

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.160 
have a manual reset circuit breaker so
if<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.710> hit<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.480> everything<00:03:21.480> goes<00:03:21.690> off<00:03:21.930> so

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
if you hit that everything goes off so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.420 
if you hit that everything goes off so
you<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.410> work<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> electronics<00:03:23.340> without
