00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:11.490

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.070

 some have it so that we give ourselves a 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.189
 part 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.440
 that the truth that is very bad with no 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.960
 play like this with someone 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.960
 Well with a person who has nothing 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.680
 I do not have anything right 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.680
 of communication so sincerely to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.049
 none will not be left over in a game for 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.049
 that we can not buy it 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.700
 tell me yes I know 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 good 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.870
 we already have a chaco 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.410
 m go for the salmon 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.410
 that's that 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.490
 in yemen lords comments 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.200
 a private message if you have the game 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.200
 so that we throw ourselves some games 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.260
 we are able to reach 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.260
 in this mode men 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.620
 what I can not yet I did not know 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.680
 double score 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.830
 good as you can hear at least 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.830
 the web video is in Spanish 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.550
 when I made the pre purchase the only thing 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.050
 they guaranteed me was that I would be in 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.050
 English nothing more 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.680
 at least in spanish 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.010
 I also think it was a gameplay of 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.010
 history 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.549
 good friends I hope you 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.240

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.000
 Do not fuck the copyright 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.000
 now with the first example 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.480
 and well then let's see 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.860
 what's up with that but since the moral is 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.860
 continue studying 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.800
 so that they could no longer be can be 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.800
 do 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.590
 what I do not think is because the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.590
 exponential 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.610

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.340

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.830
