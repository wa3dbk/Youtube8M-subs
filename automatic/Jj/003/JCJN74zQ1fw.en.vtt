00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.329
 small knife contained off 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.509
 you put yourself with the rabbit on your stomach 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:37.010
 where you see fat we go to 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:40.340
 remove ok so we eliminate more fat 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.460
 possible where there is incise the belly 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.750

 color then the Romans now along the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.979
 chest we make an incision 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.390
 until you get to feel the bones underneath 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.500
 we take the meat so we raise it e 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.630
 let's pull the bones out of the rib 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.430
 attention guys this part here and there 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.770
 most delicate part because it is a lot 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.210
 thin 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.210
 ok so we're not going to puncture it 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.469
 arrived at the bottom on this side like this 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.210
 the other bones of the ribs come out 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.340
 those these low ones that must be removed 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 passing us knife from below so pure 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:43.569
 for the same thing on the other side 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:47.869
 so I turn so I take the skin up 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:54.649
 and I am going to remove even up here 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:57.849
 get to the neck and then we remove these 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.849
 workshop like that 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.670
 let's start with the part of the loin 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.160
 so again like in the case 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.520
 thoracic above so we engrave everything 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.580
 long up to the bone 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.250
 we joke the fillets so this is it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.610
 how to bone a rabbit saddle not 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.610
 nothing changes 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.090
 we raise the meat arrived at the bottom 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.980
 you guys took off the first one 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.320
 row of bones this one looks good no 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.150
 and municipal almost like a bone of a 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.060
 fish we remove the thigh bones 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.770
 so we take off the thigh so we have 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.360
 a bit of meat and doing this 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:51.270
 movement comes out the little bone here it is 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:55.120
 here the kneecap comes off from 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.070
 from the attachment itself work 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.290
 on the other side therefore made by one 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.940
 part learned to a part from the part 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.770
 opposite is the same proper name and a 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.660
 equal mirror therefore does not change 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.320
 absolutely nothing free all 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.860
 these free bones and poked the blade of the 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.800
 knife underneath so and re barefoot

 we have this already so ok 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.200
 freed 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.330
 now once you've done your job 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.610
 watched boys had freed everything 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.459
 well we spin the knife we ​​cut away 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:31.420
 this with the right hand we hold firm 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:35.890
 down and feel is good as the bone 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.910
 just not the whole part comes away 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.810
 of the spine 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.600
 ok now our thighs we have removed all the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.570
 the central part remains only to do the two 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:55.110
 things the two shoulders engrave long 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:04:00.600
 the bone we incise we engrave under and on 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:04.400
 the bones in the first thigh 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.860
 on the other side, I have a long record 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.690
 the thigh bone goes down along 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:17.030
 the bone of the cross and detachment from one 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.030
 part and the other 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.830
 once the bone is pulled out 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.259
 put the knife under and detached 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.259
 the bone like that 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.960
 and comes off the other bone we thread the 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.479
 knife under the shovel these the bone 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.479
 where the two things are attached no e 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.930
 let's go and do a job of removing them 2 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.400
 the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.780
 the two sticks here so we have 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.440
 first the part of the case 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.810
 thoracic 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.569
 then the spine then we remove 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.849
 the two red of the thighs and then these 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.130
 two posts in which we do a 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.530
 incision along the entire blade of the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.669
 shoulder monza and open it canada on the right 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.210

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.259
 we get to the bottom here and free the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.259
 first bite of the shoulder 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:19.039
 now we stick the knife down here 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:22.960
 under the first shoulder bone the thread underneath 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:25.819
 here the two shoulders are free 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.370
 ok we touch in the central part it is 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:32.419
 I was something I would say no well 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.689
 now we stretch the rabbit that 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:39.080
 we spread it on the well laid board 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:44.419
 so we open the eyeshadows in this way 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:47.300
