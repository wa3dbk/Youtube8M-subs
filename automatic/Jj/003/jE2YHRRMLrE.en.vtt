00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.520
 towards one of the towers that are there 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.510
 then how will we meet 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.110
 towards one of the towers that are there 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.090
 up to this point 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.160
 there I have the fault I will hit you there 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.490
 hit the sheep usually steal the 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.490
 position 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.190
 the replacements we are going to die hitting him 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.580
 hit him with the stick you're going to steal 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.650
 I keep it in the sea and with the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.750
 extinguisher 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.710

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.710
 to die 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.600
 facing 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.060
 I think that there are more, because with 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 this speed kit 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:13.920
 because you are or you are a witness raster 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.780
 come on let's see if we find graph 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.690
 of the sticks for the wooden sticks 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:26.470
 so there comes a guy I go and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.320
 hit him to talk 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.870

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.430
 I spent the stick already know that we are thieves 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.430
 you know we're thieves but it's been 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.580

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:53.640

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.739
 others 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.319
 otherwise you do not have them all 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.690
 together that is why it is not like that separately 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.370
 do not put the five that you have 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.319
