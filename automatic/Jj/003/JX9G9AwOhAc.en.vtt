00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.600
 there are some screening tests 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.630
 ischemia in cardiology being the most 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.860
 important that of poetry to this 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.900
 test is the effort test 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.669
 conventional he submitted it they are added 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.730
 imaging tests such as the range 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.860
 García the pp or the ultrasound test or 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.420
 the resonance 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.830
 in certain patients you 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.200
 we recommend in the competition 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.150
 conventional, the patient usually 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.060
 submits to a physical exercise in a 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.190
 Rolling skin tape an endless tape 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.500
 or by bicycle and the 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.770
 chemical response to the appearance or not of 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.180
 mágina pain and electrocardiogram 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.130
 way that the test is considered 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.050
 positive when changes appear in the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.940
 electrocardiogram but not any 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.410
 change but only the rise or fall 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.540
 from st 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.580
 at least a millimeter tell me about 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.280
 60 80 billy seconds from the end of the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.040
 current that is called point j do not serve 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.320
 the changes in the t wave because those are 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.960
 of the intervention associated with the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.840
 exercise and does not serve the promotion of 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.119
 st in derivations that has wave by 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.430
 old necrosis short that this are 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.400
 Normal variants of the response 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.930
 in this electrocardiogram image 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.960
 during a stress test the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.530
 descent of the extensive st that appears in 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.320
 lower face leads 23 to vf and 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.990
 in derivations of the euro 4 av 6 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.890
 showing the electrical positivity of the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.440
 test 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.970
 only in some patients in whom 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.340
 We would like to evaluate the response to 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.220
 stress to see if there is or is not ischemia 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.900
 but we can not do it because it turns out 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.540
 that the patient has a 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.150
 little valuable electrocardiogram 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.760
 for whatever reason or we can not 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.500
 do a physical exercise like we 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.010
 like it because it has a limitation 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.770
 mechanics we consider using the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.259
 other ischemia screening tests 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.969
 when we want to evaluate the present I 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.189
 we make a conventional rush but 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.229
 only if it turns out that the patient will 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.810
 we want to walk and it does not have 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.670
 legs or have any limitation in the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.709
 legs that prevents him from moving as 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.590
 intermittent claudication a prosthesis or 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.379
 any kind of mechanical problem 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.110
 we make a different stress from the 3 physical 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.150
 that will be the pharmacological 3 of their masters 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.239
 of bitch mine and he touched us and with another 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.069
 compositive o / love that produces a robbery 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.980
 coronary as we have already explained in 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.040
 these drugs evidence in ischemia if 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.959
 ex if it exists in the patient are the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.829
 equivalent to do physical exercise without 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.829
 do physical exercise
