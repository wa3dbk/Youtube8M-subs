00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.290
 Children under 13 years old due to the Road Traffic Law amendment in June 2008 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.749
 When you ride a bicycle 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.279
 Practical spirit such as low fuel consumption is required to stay in the ocean 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.619
 is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.160
 How Safe Is It By Wearing A Helmet 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.329
 Is not it 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.599
 At the same time, at the mobile site, AIST Kanazawa University 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.149
 Research on helmet safety in collaboration with 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.960
 Look at the work situation at the time of the case using dummy doll of 3 years old child 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 Saw 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.930
 If you do not wear a belt 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.580
 It seems that the head directly collides with the ground and a strong impact is applied. 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.580
 I understand 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.550
 When used in combination with the easy-to-use children's ride and the right 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.260
 space 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.830
 It is understood that it is made to approve by blood donation 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 Was 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.470
 Please see the video which analyzed this case in detail compared with the month 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.990
 If you do not wear a helmet 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.390
 It takes about four times the force of a skull fracture mark 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780
 You should wear a helmet 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.650
 Skull fractures are suppressed to one quarter again 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.060
 Let's compare the new 23 with the biggest impact 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.830
 If you are not considering the left side 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.950
 Although 30% of the facility has 11 greatly expanded 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 If you are considering a friend 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.090
 In the base with collagen 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.090
 By wearing a helmet 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.850
 I had an impact on my head 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 It can be reduced to about one fifteenth 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.969
 In addition, helmets worn for safety are new 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.499
 There is no meaning without it 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.810
 We wanted you to spend you want to spend 12 general boy 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.849
 When shock is applied to the helmet, the external repair shock is dispersed 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.939
 Absorb shock by collapsing it 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.930
 I received a strong shock once, but I will never return 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.929
 So we recommend opening 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.069
 At 5gk., We take the product to cope with any failure. 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.069
 I have aligned 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.249
 I have not been aware of the last few years I was wearing telnet properly 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:57.819
 Shall I say
