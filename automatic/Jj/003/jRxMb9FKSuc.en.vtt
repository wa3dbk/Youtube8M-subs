00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
alright after you done transferring the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.780 
alright after you done transferring the
masking<00:03:27.230> tape<00:03:27.410> over<00:03:27.560> make<00:03:28.160> sure<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.370> press<00:03:28.609> it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
masking tape over make sure you press it

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.300 
masking tape over make sure you press it
down<00:03:28.910> really<00:03:29.180> hard<00:03:29.299> so<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.590> could<00:03:30.799> get<00:03:31.069> as

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
down really hard so you could get as

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.890 
down really hard so you could get as
much<00:03:31.849> as<00:03:32.530> as<00:03:33.530> much<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.450> grooves<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.750> you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
much as as much of the grooves as you

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.129 
much as as much of the grooves as you
can<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:37.579> stick<00:03:37.880> onto<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.389> did<00:03:38.599> you<00:03:39.019> know

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
can to stick onto you did you know

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.069 
can to stick onto you did you know
masking<00:03:39.590> tape<00:03:39.859> so<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.940> paint<00:03:41.209> would<00:03:41.480> run

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
masking tape so the paint would run

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.870 
masking tape so the paint would run
through<00:03:42.349> it<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:43.760> we<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.750> got<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.230> gist<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.829> it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.229 

the<00:03:49.880> COG<00:03:50.540> symbol<00:03:51.260> well<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.889> that<00:03:52.849> emblem

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
the COG symbol well the that emblem

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.460 
the COG symbol well the that emblem
looks<00:03:54.019> like<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.700> now<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:56.060> are<00:03:56.389> ready<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.690> paint

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
looks like so now we are ready to paint

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.699 
looks like so now we are ready to paint
and<00:03:57.829> so<00:03:58.400> basically<00:03:58.849> just<00:03:59.169> put<00:04:00.169> a<00:04:00.200> coat<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.470> red

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
and so basically just put a coat of red

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.770 
and so basically just put a coat of red
over<00:04:00.980> this<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:02.200> then<00:04:04.209> remove<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.359> masking

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
over this and then remove the masking

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.900 
over this and then remove the masking
tape<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.290> they<00:04:06.440> should<00:04:06.709> review<00:04:07.040> the

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
tape and they should review the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.730 
tape and they should review the
symbol<00:04:08.510> onto<00:04:09.260> your<00:04:09.470> answer<00:04:11.170> all<00:04:12.170> right<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.410> have

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
symbol onto your answer all right I have

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.610 
symbol onto your answer all right I have
applied<00:04:13.340> three<00:04:13.910> layers<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.510> paint<00:04:14.780> onto<00:04:15.380> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
applied three layers of paint onto the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.390 
applied three layers of paint onto the
sink<00:04:15.940> using<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.300> acrylic<00:04:18.050> paint

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
sink using the acrylic paint

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.450 
sink using the acrylic paint
that's<00:04:19.940> water<00:04:20.239> base<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.260> applied<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:22.010> using

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
that's water base and I applied it using

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.330 
that's water base and I applied it using
a<00:04:22.730> q-tip<00:04:24.580> so<00:04:25.580> let's<00:04:25.940> remove<00:04:26.690> this<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.260> see<00:04:28.250> how

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
a q-tip so let's remove this and see how

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.070 
a q-tip so let's remove this and see how
it<00:04:28.430> turns<00:04:28.640> out

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
it turns out

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.590 
it turns out
all<00:04:30.080> right<00:04:30.260> here<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.610> guess<00:04:32.390> it's

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
all right here it is the I guess it's

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.120 
all right here it is the I guess it's
called<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:33.050> crimson<00:04:33.830> almond<00:04:34.540> Lancer<00:04:35.920> as<00:04:36.920> you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
called a crimson almond Lancer as you

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:46.000 
called a crimson almond Lancer as you
can<00:04:37.310> see<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:39.620> red<00:04:41.830> insignia<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:42.950> there<00:04:45.010> Lancer

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
can see the red insignia is there Lancer

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.480 
can see the red insignia is there Lancer
itself<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:48.290> here's<00:04:48.590> Marcus<00:04:49.070> holding<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:51.490> it

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
itself and here's Marcus holding it it

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.400 
itself and here's Marcus holding it it
is<00:04:52.700> kind<00:04:53.030> of<00:04:53.090> hard<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.360> tell<00:04:53.660> when<00:04:54.170> you're<00:04:54.320> up

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
is kind of hard to tell when you're up

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.820 
is kind of hard to tell when you're up
close<00:04:54.440> because<00:04:55.310> of<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:56.290> detailing<00:04:57.290> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
close because of the detailing the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.270 
close because of the detailing the
greens<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.430> all<00:04:58.580> that<00:04:59.080> under<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.860> Lancer

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
greens and all that under the Lancer

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.440 
greens and all that under the Lancer
itself<00:05:03.250> once<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:05.470> did<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.740> paint<00:05:07.400> job<00:05:07.700> and

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
itself once you did the paint job and

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:15.490 
itself once you did the paint job and
once<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.200> removed<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.870> masking<00:05:12.380> tape<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:15.020> face

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
once I removed the masking tape the face

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.430 
once I removed the masking tape the face
itself<00:05:16.310> was<00:05:16.730> kind<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.120> hard<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.480> see<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:18.290> was

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
itself was kind of hard to see it was

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.850 
itself was kind of hard to see it was
really<00:05:19.100> hard<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.430> define<00:05:19.870> especially<00:05:20.870> the

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
really hard to define especially the

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.600 
really hard to define especially the
eyes<00:05:23.860> point<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.100> it<00:05:26.800> very<00:05:27.800> hard<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.130> tell<00:05:28.400> the

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
eyes point to it very hard to tell the

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.460 
eyes point to it very hard to tell the
eyes<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:30.020> mouth<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:30.950> also<00:05:32.470> the

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
eyes and the mouth and also the

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.150 
eyes and the mouth and also the
surrounding<00:05:33.940> section<00:05:34.940> of<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.390> skull<00:05:35.690> so<00:05:36.160> what

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
surrounding section of the skull so what

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.490 
surrounding section of the skull so what
I<00:05:37.190> had<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.580> do<00:05:37.700> was<00:05:37.940> by<00:05:38.240> using<00:05:38.480> a<00:05:38.720> sharpie<00:05:39.350> a

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
I had to do was by using a sharpie a

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.850 
I had to do was by using a sharpie a
black<00:05:39.920> sharpie<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:41.050> color<00:05:42.050> these<00:05:42.350> sections

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
black sharpie and color these sections

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.490 
black sharpie and color these sections
so<00:05:43.730> they'll<00:05:43.970> be<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.210> little<00:05:44.480> bit<00:05:44.660> darker<00:05:45.140> around

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
so they'll be a little bit darker around

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:54.760 
so they'll be a little bit darker around
the<00:05:45.860> mouth<00:05:51.130> as<00:05:52.130> well<00:05:52.840> so<00:05:53.840> now<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.110> skull<00:05:54.560> is

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
the mouth as well so now the skull is

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.370 
the mouth as well so now the skull is
more<00:05:55.100> defined

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
more defined

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.360 
more defined
pretty<00:05:58.070> much<00:05:58.280> kept<00:05:58.640> it<00:05:59.200> outside<00:06:00.200> a<00:06:00.740> siddhis<00:06:03.370> it

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
pretty much kept it outside a siddhis it

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.030 
pretty much kept it outside a siddhis it
looks<00:06:04.670> to<00:06:04.820> be<00:06:04.940> easier<00:06:05.390> to<00:06:05.750> see<00:06:06.050> when<00:06:06.830> you're

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
looks to be easier to see when you're

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.100 
looks to be easier to see when you're
further<00:06:07.580> away<00:06:07.880> from<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.800> Lancer<00:06:10.250> so<00:06:10.960> as<00:06:11.960> you

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
further away from the Lancer so as you

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.810 
further away from the Lancer so as you
can<00:06:12.260> see<00:06:12.460> turned<00:06:13.460> out<00:06:13.670> pretty<00:06:15.010> okay<00:06:16.010> yes<00:06:16.490> I

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
can see turned out pretty okay yes I

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.690 
can see turned out pretty okay yes I
mean<00:06:17.360> I'm<00:06:17.660> happy<00:06:17.990> with<00:06:18.230> it<00:06:21.220> don't<00:06:22.220> think<00:06:22.550> I

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
mean I'm happy with it don't think I

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.840 
mean I'm happy with it don't think I
will<00:06:22.970> do<00:06:23.660> that<00:06:23.810> to<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.200> Nasher<00:06:24.650> because<00:06:25.640> the

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
will do that to the Nasher because the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.590 
will do that to the Nasher because the
National<00:06:26.270> has<00:06:26.450> a<00:06:26.480> lot<00:06:26.900> of<00:06:28.120> great<00:06:29.120> section

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
National has a lot of great section

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.580 
National has a lot of great section
silver<00:06:30.470> bits<00:06:30.680> instead<00:06:31.580> of<00:06:31.790> black<00:06:32.050> because<00:06:33.050> it

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
silver bits instead of black because it
