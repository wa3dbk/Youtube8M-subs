00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.770
 the new york musikmesse report 2013 will be 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.570
 presented by connex man really 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.500
 professional solution for online 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.620
 Mastering hello and welcome 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.449
 to the music fair cars 2013 from the 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.089
 frankfurt music fair is like me on 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.650
 stand by mackie and jan former 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:25.359
 work colleagues now worked at mac 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.699
 hello hello hello there is no 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.550
 now a small version of the dr 16 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.890
 08 and new software exactly 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.710
 but we have that 806 here 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.020
 so to speak, the little sister of 16 08 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.630
 the only difference is we have 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.120
 fewer inputs fewer outputs and that 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.560
 also costs less money very short 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.450
 already ask to the exits 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.850
 what about the aux out how much 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.490
 I have exits we have here now 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.980
 four outputs and the two masters in the 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.200
 contrast to six exits at 16 08 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.239
 as gold exactly and eight microphone 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.030
 Entries instead of 16 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.719
 these are like the big model combination 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.710
 sockets exactly or hire can 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.999
 you connect with both 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.490
 Now a little bit what the 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.659
 new features from the 14 aversion because 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.249
 you have her now only just a new 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.409
 update released for the software 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:22.780
 be very fresh that on friday there is 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.729
 the version 1.4 for the dl pulp the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.460
 suits or the only one of the first 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.469
 difference we see here soon 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.229
 is we have new cruze we have 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.509
 even so to say our standard eic 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.920
 Until now, Jews had been called here 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.709
 modern kyu and there is one 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.539
 wintercheck you where, so to speak, in the 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:44.920
 lifestyle has been recreated 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.709
 We also have the whole thing for 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.310
 our dynamics means we have here 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:55.389
 also at gate a vintage gate.de 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.869
 imitated away and the compressor 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:02:00.729
 we have recreated an 11 76 here 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.279
 Murder gets right with mine 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.579
 11 78 mb comparison test whether that too 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:08.200
 all so true to clear in any case 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.060
 in any case, it is cheaper than his 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.700
 eleven 76 what you stand at home 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.900
 that's right yes that's the biggest 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.280
 News about the 1.4 version 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 what's interesting is a whole 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.569
 Short time will be a new software 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.330
 Give that for iphone and ipod touch 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.980
 we see here the whole thing can be synonymous 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.670
 connect that you can yes up to ten 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.849
 connect a mixer 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.370
 this will be my fate and so on 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.530
 can you then the most important functions 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.269
 the iphone or the ipod touch from 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.730
 of course, it is great to serve in that 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.650
 a band is a singer wants only for example 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.269
 quickly set his orders 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.459
 then he can do this right here on the iphone 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.769
 make the good is yes I know yes 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.560
 because we actually do the lecture every 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.510
 week already use that then 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.760
 so can the singer then 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.190
 not the drama or the bassist the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.959
 channels was in a mood I am myself 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.310
 Of course, bassist and I want me 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.260
 I would always have the loudest 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.510
 Of course, start immediately and the master 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.130
 Full turn up for the bass we have 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.739
 but me a log in function that is 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.540
 I can say per device you can only 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.390
 Doing that you can only do that 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.310
 in the monitoring situation that means 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.940
 drama, for example, really only his 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.140
 own way served in the case 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.390
 In addition, we have new show function 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.829
 with the installed a bit more 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.350
 are clearer than in the 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.920
 we have snapshots and 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.600
 shot at our mixing desks and we 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.220
 have rebuilt this a bit that 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.980
 is called then offline look that is 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.269
 I can save a lot of shows 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.630
 a look can then be different 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.319
 snapshot 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.380
 snapshots are then the sport me 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.750
 setting which you can then call from now 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.819
 in the real world, for example, one becomes one 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.010
 could say ne band who a show if 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.260
 you mix a band and have per song 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.910
 you make your own snapshots well coal 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.040
 yes very superordinate functions if 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.470
 so much but also something like that 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.700
 So almost as nice of the sun 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.680
 but was similar to now again 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.160
 simplified whole operation, so to speak 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.010
 has become even easier including one 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.950
 ask to the dock here in the version 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.720
 that I have I can not give it 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.639
 lightning connection is that now with 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.969
 lightning 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.199
 No, that's not yet with lightning 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:27.180
 works if you also want to 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.039
 the adapter from apple so we have 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.749
 We always do that too 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.789
 I can attest that is wonderful 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:35.069
 works exactly but then it looks 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:39.180
 ipad of course a bit more out of it 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:42.719
 in july we will introduce something 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.509
 so to speak, the dl 16 08 or 806 on 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:47.430
 senior posts 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.300
 now there is a remedy for this is synonymous 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.810
 not really not quite like that 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.909
 problematic because the bolt is the big one 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.569
 Advantage of the federal government is just now 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:59.939
 that the ipad can detach itself from me 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.990
 we almost never use it in this one 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.560
 combination 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.020
 That's why I wish the whole as 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.379
 19 inch rack unit where you just then 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.379
 really just control the ipad 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.969
 Interesting thought in any case 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.520
 but as you say it works over 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.020
 wlan that means if you just here 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.539
 no lightning connection but has one 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.669
 ipad 4 you can do it all without 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.409
 you should handle problems as well 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.129
 because that's just the benefit 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.120
 i can walk around even if i am 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.949
 make the house a bit 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.379
 listen around how does it sound in the 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.969
 corner and so that's the benefit 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.050
 That's why I do not think so 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.669
 bad that you can do it now 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.129
 without lightning so do not have that 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.649
 yes of course you can miss it too 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.199
 keep charging good that's one 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:53.159
 good function but you have to 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.990
 do not dock in the case you just have to 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.349
 not much long all clear 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.349
 with pleasure
