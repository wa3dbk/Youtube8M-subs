so<00:01:57.460> it<00:01:58.120> looks<00:01:58.360> like<00:01:58.450> it's<00:01:58.930> coming<00:01:59.170> back<00:01:59.530> with<00:01:59.800> a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
so it looks like it's coming back with a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.460 
so it looks like it's coming back with a
picture<00:02:00.190> of<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.550> weasel<00:02:00.970> through<00:02:01.960> wolfram

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
picture of a weasel through wolfram

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.100 
picture of a weasel through wolfram
alpha<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.550> guess<00:02:04.210> I'm<00:02:04.360> not<00:02:04.390> savvy<00:02:04.990> enough

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
alpha so I guess I'm not savvy enough

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.300 
alpha so I guess I'm not savvy enough
with<00:02:05.500> Wolfram<00:02:05.980> Alpha<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.460> really<00:02:06.790> know<00:02:08.310> kind

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
with Wolfram Alpha to really know kind

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.090 
with Wolfram Alpha to really know kind
of<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.940> extent<00:02:10.930> of<00:02:11.080> what<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.920> can<00:02:12.040> offer

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
of the the extent of what it can offer

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.490 
of the the extent of what it can offer
you<00:02:12.550> but<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.240> looks<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.750> does<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.170> some

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
you but it looks like it does have some

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.060 
you but it looks like it does have some
sort<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.740> image<00:02:14.950> aggregation<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:17.070> does

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
sort of image aggregation and it does

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.830 
sort of image aggregation and it does
present<00:02:18.310> some<00:02:18.640> image<00:02:19.030> back<00:02:19.270> or<00:02:19.570> as<00:02:19.720> some

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
present some image back or as some

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.660 
present some image back or as some
images<00:02:20.200> back<00:02:20.410> through<00:02:20.800> Siri<00:02:21.070> which<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.520> pretty

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
images back through Siri which is pretty

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.420 
images back through Siri which is pretty
cool<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.410> don't<00:02:23.560> know<00:02:23.680> how<00:02:23.800> far<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.370> will

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
cool I just don't know how far this will

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.840 
cool I just don't know how far this will
go<00:02:24.790> i'm<00:02:24.910> going<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> try<00:02:25.210> something<00:02:25.810> else<00:02:25.990> here

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
go i'm going to try something else here

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.960 
go i'm going to try something else here
what<00:02:27.850> does<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> German<00:02:28.480> Shepherd<00:02:28.930> look<00:02:29.110> like

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.330 

okay<00:02:33.970> how<00:02:34.720> about<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> web<00:02:35.350> search<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.980> what<00:02:36.190> is

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
okay how about a web search for what is

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.570 
okay how about a web search for what is
a<00:02:36.370> German<00:02:36.820> Shepherd<00:02:37.180> look<00:02:37.360> like<00:02:38.160> ok<00:02:39.160> so

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
a German Shepherd look like ok so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.870 
a German Shepherd look like ok so
doesn't<00:02:40.570> have<00:02:40.780> maybe<00:02:41.710> specific<00:02:42.130> types<00:02:42.700> of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
doesn't have maybe specific types of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.110 
doesn't have maybe specific types of
dogs<00:02:43.150> let's<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.900> try<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:45.250> does<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.460> dog<00:02:45.820> look

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
dogs let's just try what does a dog look

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.470 
dogs let's just try what does a dog look
like<00:02:50.580> does<00:02:51.580> might<00:02:51.790> answer<00:02:52.000> your<00:02:52.360> question<00:02:53.250> ok

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
like does might answer your question ok

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.710 
like does might answer your question ok
so<00:02:55.890> simple<00:02:56.890> animal<00:02:57.250> pictures<00:02:57.520> looks<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.420> I

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
so simple animal pictures looks like I

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.670 
so simple animal pictures looks like I
guess<00:02:59.500> not<00:02:59.710> that<00:03:00.010> useful<00:03:00.280> ah<00:03:01.500> let's<00:03:02.500> try

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
guess not that useful ah let's try

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.729 
guess not that useful ah let's try
something<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.810> what<00:03:04.810> does<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.989> horse<00:03:05.350> look

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
something like what does a horse look

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:13.229 
something like what does a horse look
like<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:11.250> whoa<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.640> don't<00:03:12.790> even<00:03:12.850> know<00:03:13.060> what

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
like you whoa I don't even know what

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.180 
like you whoa I don't even know what
that<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.480> let's<00:03:14.350> try<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.620> again<00:03:17.010> what<00:03:18.010> does<00:03:18.160> a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
that is let's try that again what does a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.150 
that is let's try that again what does a
horse<00:03:18.459> look<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:22.290> let<00:03:23.290> me<00:03:23.440> check<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.890> for

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
horse look like let me check that for

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.630 
horse look like let me check that for
you<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:25.020> found<00:03:26.020> this<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:27.330> ok<00:03:28.330> so<00:03:29.640> horses

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
you I found this for you ok so horses

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.699 
you I found this for you ok so horses
coming<00:03:30.850> back<00:03:31.150> with<00:03:31.420> just<00:03:31.600> some<00:03:31.750> data<00:03:32.080> just<00:03:32.530> no

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
coming back with just some data just no

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.699 
coming back with just some data just no
picture<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:34.720> was<00:03:34.900> interesting<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.350> see<00:03:35.560> that

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
picture it was interesting to see that

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.979 
picture it was interesting to see that
that<00:03:36.040> woman<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.790> think<00:03:37.270> her<00:03:37.510> last<00:03:37.750> name<00:03:37.959> was

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
that woman I think her last name was

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.500 
that woman I think her last name was
force<00:03:39.000> wonder<00:03:40.000> if<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:40.150> could<00:03:40.239> do<00:03:40.300> something

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
force wonder if we could do something

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.820 
force wonder if we could do something
like<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:43.030> does<00:03:43.209> Robert<00:03:43.630> De<00:03:43.840> Niro<00:03:44.080> look<00:03:44.410> like

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.160 

this<00:03:49.760> might<00:03:49.970> answer<00:03:50.180> your<00:03:50.540> question<00:03:51.160> Wow<00:03:52.160> okay

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
this might answer your question Wow okay

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.250 
this might answer your question Wow okay
so<00:03:55.210> basically<00:03:56.210> I<00:03:56.570> think<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:57.020> just<00:03:57.050> a

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
so basically I think this is just a

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.890 
so basically I think this is just a
Wolfram<00:03:57.590> Alpha<00:03:57.770> thing<00:03:58.130> but<00:03:59.120> it's<00:03:59.360> quite

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
Wolfram Alpha thing but it's quite

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.600 
Wolfram Alpha thing but it's quite
interesting<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.410> see<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.860> does<00:04:01.040> do<00:04:01.280> image

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
interesting to see that it does do image

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.230 
interesting to see that it does do image
integration<00:04:02.120> with<00:04:02.270> with<00:04:02.630> series<00:04:03.020> so

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
integration with with series so

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.850 
integration with with series so
definitely<00:04:05.240> some<00:04:05.420> cool<00:04:05.630> stuff<00:04:05.750> there<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.350> i

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
definitely some cool stuff there and i

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.680 
definitely some cool stuff there and i
think<00:04:07.010> i<00:04:07.370> would<00:04:07.580> encourage<00:04:07.760> everyone<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.450> go

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
think i would encourage everyone to go

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.300 
think i would encourage everyone to go
through<00:04:08.960> Wolfram<00:04:09.350> Alpha<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:09.740> kind<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.070> test

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
through Wolfram Alpha and kind of test

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.670 
through Wolfram Alpha and kind of test
the<00:04:10.460> limits<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.910> what<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:11.810> does<00:04:12.050> offer<00:04:12.320> if<00:04:12.590> you

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
the limits of what it does offer if you

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.100 
the limits of what it does offer if you
haven't<00:04:13.010> really<00:04:13.190> spent<00:04:13.640> time<00:04:13.730> with<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.360> in

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
haven't really spent time with it and in

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.650 
haven't really spent time with it and in
that<00:04:15.320> way<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.530> might<00:04:15.790> learn<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.390> can<00:04:17.540> do

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
that way you might learn that you can do

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.180 
that way you might learn that you can do
quite<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.900> bit<00:04:17.989> more<00:04:18.230> of<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.380> serie<00:04:18.650> than<00:04:18.890> you

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
quite a bit more of a serie than you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.300 
quite a bit more of a serie than you
even<00:04:19.340> anticipated<00:04:19.910> so<00:04:20.500> anyway<00:04:21.500> hope<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.100> guys

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
even anticipated so anyway hope you guys

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.820 
even anticipated so anyway hope you guys
found<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:22.640> useful<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.960> had<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.230> come<00:04:24.680> in

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
found this useful just had to come in

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.170 
found this useful just had to come in
and<00:04:25.040> share<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:25.430> experience<00:04:25.640> with<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:26.000> guys

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180
