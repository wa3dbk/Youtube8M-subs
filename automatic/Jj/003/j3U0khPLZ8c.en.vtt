00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
this is my 2010 Kia Soul 58,000

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.780 
this is my 2010 Kia Soul 58,000
kilometers<00:00:08.300> on<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.360> clock<00:00:09.889> and<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.460> couple<00:00:11.700> of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
kilometers on the clock and a couple of

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.680 
kilometers on the clock and a couple of
weeks<00:00:11.910> ago<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.480> started<00:00:12.780> making<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.259> noise<00:00:13.610> on

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
weeks ago I started making this noise on

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.040 
weeks ago I started making this noise on
the<00:00:15.980> steering<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:20.029> with<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> quick<00:00:21.510> look<00:00:21.750> under

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the steering so with a quick look under

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.370 
the steering so with a quick look under
here<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> noise<00:00:24.140> comes<00:00:25.140> from

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
here we can see the noise comes from

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.990 
here we can see the noise comes from
this<00:00:25.560> piece<00:00:26.340> which<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> shaft<00:00:29.250> at

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this piece which is where the shaft at

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.110 
this piece which is where the shaft at
the<00:00:30.090> end<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> steering<00:00:30.960> column<00:00:32.120> goes

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the end of the steering column goes

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.580 
the end of the steering column goes
through<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> floor<00:00:33.890> by<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> brake<00:00:35.250> pedal<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
through the floor by the brake pedal and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.299 
through the floor by the brake pedal and
connects<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> steering<00:00:38.730> rack<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.160> can

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
connects to the steering rack so you can

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.600 
connects to the steering rack so you can
see<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:41.790> play<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.860> moves<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
see the some play there it moves up and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.660 
see the some play there it moves up and
down<00:00:45.739> about<00:00:48.289> five<00:00:49.289> six<00:00:49.770> millimeters<00:00:52.670> so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
down about five six millimeters so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.369 
down about five six millimeters so
obviously<00:00:54.090> concerned<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.870> noise<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
obviously concerned about this noise and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
obviously concerned about this noise and
I<00:00:55.440> went<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> talk<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> kia<00:00:56.430> people<00:00:57.270> here

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I went to talk to the kia people here

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
I went to talk to the kia people here
and<00:00:59.059> they<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.739> agree<00:01:01.739> there's<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> noise<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and they they agree there's a noise and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.230 
and they they agree there's a noise and
listen<00:01:02.820> play<00:01:04.400> but<00:01:07.369> although<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.760> market

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
listen play but although in this market

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820 
listen play but although in this market
the<00:01:09.360> cars<00:01:09.600> guarantee<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.229> three<00:01:10.470> years<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the cars guarantee for three years and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.969 
the cars guarantee for three years and
hundred<00:01:11.100> thousand<00:01:11.460> kilometers<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.619> I<00:01:13.619> missed

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
hundred thousand kilometers and I missed

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.850 
hundred thousand kilometers and I missed
an<00:01:14.070> oil<00:01:14.310> change<00:01:15.049> about<00:01:16.049> three<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.470> four<00:01:16.619> months

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
an oil change about three or four months

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.980 
an oil change about three or four months
ago<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> they're<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.830> interested<00:01:20.700> in

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
ago so they're not interested in

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.010 
ago so they're not interested in
investigating<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.759> steering<00:01:23.759> problem<00:01:25.220> I

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
investigating the steering problem I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.330 
investigating the steering problem I
suggested<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> them<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.740> important

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
suggested to them it would be important

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
suggested to them it would be important
for<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> investigate<00:01:30.150> themselves<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
for them to investigate themselves and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.609 
for them to investigate themselves and
figure<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.320> what's<00:01:31.970> making<00:01:32.970> their<00:01:33.320> part<00:01:34.850> fail

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
figure out what's making their part fail

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
figure out what's making their part fail
they've<00:01:37.619> told<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> cars<00:01:38.479> might<00:01:39.479> be

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
they've told me the cars might be

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
they've told me the cars might be
dangerous<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> shouldn't<00:01:40.530> drive<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.009> but

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
dangerous and I shouldn't drive it but

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.649 
dangerous and I shouldn't drive it but
they<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:44.360> investigate<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
they don't want to investigate the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.620 
they don't want to investigate the
steering<00:01:46.079> problem<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.329> missed<00:01:48.329> an<00:01:48.479> oil

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
steering problem because I missed an oil

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.980 
steering problem because I missed an oil
change<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:51.000> intention<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.689> films

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
change so my intention with these films

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.429 
change so my intention with these films
is<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> next<00:01:53.310> part<00:01:53.549> I'll<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:54.320> taking<00:01:55.320> out

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
is in the next part I'll be taking out

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.020 
is in the next part I'll be taking out
the<00:01:55.619> steering<00:01:56.040> rack<00:01:57.829> stripping<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.030> see

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the steering rack stripping it down see

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.770 
the steering rack stripping it down see
what<00:02:00.210> parts<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.659> failed<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:05.270> we<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.479> see

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
what parts have failed and so we can see

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.040 
what parts have failed and so we can see
what's<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:08.069> wrong<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.629> I<00:02:09.629> hope<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.899> will

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
what's going wrong and I hope this will

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.839 
what's going wrong and I hope this will
be<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.590> other<00:02:10.770> Kia<00:02:11.069> users

be of use to other Kia users

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.140 
be of use to other Kia users
who<00:02:13.450> might<00:02:13.750> be<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.290> similar<00:02:14.860> situation

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
who might be in a similar situation
