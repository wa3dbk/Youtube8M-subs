00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
would fit in a lot more bags than the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.330 
would fit in a lot more bags than the
insulin<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.780> does<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.530> this<00:04:33.800> wallet<00:04:34.040> for

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
insulin and it does so this wallet for

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.460 
insulin and it does so this wallet for
me<00:04:34.460> has<00:04:34.610> really<00:04:34.790> done<00:04:35.150> every<00:04:36.050> expectation

that<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.070> could<00:04:37.220> possibly<00:04:37.970> ever<00:04:38.060> want<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.720> it's

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
that I could possibly ever want it it's

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.690
