 Decisive for the admission the Falcons of the super test candidates is the

 the aluminum gear knob seems to have escaped the PlayStation and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.720
 reinforces the impression of a mini-vans head grows 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.230

 Ladies, the engine got its voice like a race car 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670
 The power flows during gear changes fit perfectly with the joystick 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670
 through the streets that it is a pleasure 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.740
 Almost playfully, the little one can be around the handguns 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.560
 his neutral driving behavior almost demands the approach to the border area

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.439
 A maximum of one g transverse acceleration is possible in the Opel Corsa 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.859
 as well as the amazing lap time of one minute 20 grief 9 seconds 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.609
 Some of the larger and much stronger competitors are in their place

 Slalom shows the steering assisted by an electric motor 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.029
 has a big share in the agility of the Civic descent 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.079
 and even though he sometimes lifts his leg, the embarrassment remains 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.529
 critical load change reactions 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.999
 whether this remains the case even at high speeds 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.999
 will show the Nürburgring

 is already plunging into the roller coaster in the heart of Bach 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:57.729
 Precisely it should be through the exchange rates should 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.249

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.789
 even the cheap road surface on the notorious Sweden Cross is capable of

 barely intimidating silver samurai 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.939
 and that at 211 km / h 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.160
 with the q3 and it goes through the arenas Berghofer down in the 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.079
 Fuchsröhre 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.620
 This narrow valley must not allow neither car nor pilot mistakes 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.510
 at 206 km / h every faux-pas is dealt a total loss 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.219
 Adenauer forestry helps the sea way the thing of tendency during load changes completely

 to push to the outside 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.680
 the high-side executives of the 205 and Bridgestone Gomis impress 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.360
 especially in the outward the triple left turn in front of the section 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.360
 we sat 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.989
 just past the wall pike that they are the Taipan on readiness 

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:54.989
 the bridge 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.090
 he reaches almost 90 km / h 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.090
 the right basis for a good lap time 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.039
 the test finale for the Honda Civic 3par at the Nürburgring close 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.719
 Klostertal Group is considered the potential free of the 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:10.770
 Front-wheel drive 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.020
 The CD can still rise very early on the gas 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.189
 even the steep concrete trough of the carousel does not disturb him 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.190
 the following climb to the highest point of the track requires engine and transmission 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.710
 the pulling power of the small engine is in the north 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.419
 not for nothing is the leap succeeded Pflanzgarten as a popular spectator bot 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.419
 the chassis has to perform at its best 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.710
 on almost only three wheels but with a speed of 166 they are the animals 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.969
 fire around the corner 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.199
 The following combination of curves must be deflected blind 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.199
 before the dovetail shakes the Honda vigorously 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:55.499
 Violins head 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.049
 the last corner is taken at 128 km / h 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.860
 at the height Döttinger already William Sweden Cross Tempo remained 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.120
 the lap time of 8 minutes 47 seconds requires one thing in particular 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.479
 big respect 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.779
 I'm the absolute record hunter in the super test 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.559
 but in his class he is hard to beat for coming an extremely 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.830
 attractive price-performance ratio 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.020
 Among the high utility value in everyday life a sports car 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.740
 for bargain hunters, so to speak
