00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
it now and really just took it step by

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.760 
it now and really just took it step by
step<00:00:34.220> module<00:00:35.000> by<00:00:35.120> module<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.930> followed<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
checklist which was really helpful to me

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.520 
checklist which was really helpful to me
