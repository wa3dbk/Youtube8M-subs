the 425 is carbureted the 445 is

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.889 
the 425 is carbureted the 445 is
fuel-injected<00:01:25.969> so<00:01:26.240> that's<00:01:26.450> pretty<00:01:26.689> much<00:01:26.780> the

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
fuel-injected so that's pretty much the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.870 
fuel-injected so that's pretty much the
only<00:01:27.200> difference<00:01:27.530> there<00:01:27.740> otherwise<00:01:27.979> it's<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
only difference there otherwise it's the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.780 
only difference there otherwise it's the
same<00:01:29.119> great<00:01:29.420> motor<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.890> believe<00:01:31.460> this<00:01:31.610> was

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
same great motor and I believe this was

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.959 
same great motor and I believe this was
made<00:01:31.969> in<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.299> 2000s<00:01:33.170> according<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.829> just<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
made in the 2000s according to just the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.260 
made in the 2000s according to just the
the<00:01:35.270> style<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.659> deckle<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.350> has<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.430> by

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the style of deckle that it has so by

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.060 
the style of deckle that it has so by
all<00:01:38.390> means<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.840> should<00:01:39.049> have<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.439> steel

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
all means it should have the steel

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.060 
all means it should have the steel
camshaft<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.659> replacement<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.680> plastic

one the deco for the service intervals
is<00:01:46.250> still<00:01:46.789> present<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.450> hood<00:01:50.140> but<00:01:51.140> dirty

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
is still present on the hood but dirty

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.080 
is still present on the hood but dirty
underneath<00:01:51.799> that<00:01:51.950> engine<00:01:52.310> compartment<00:01:52.340> I

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
underneath that engine compartment I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.289 
underneath that engine compartment I
won't<00:01:53.509> be<00:01:53.630> able<00:01:53.719> to<00:01:53.810> wash<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.170> till<00:01:54.380> spring<00:01:55.299> but

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
won't be able to wash it till spring but

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.230 
won't be able to wash it till spring but
I<00:01:56.799> mean<00:01:57.799> it<00:01:58.070> works<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:01.490> finished<00:02:01.820> mounting

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
I mean it works just finished mounting

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.219 
I mean it works just finished mounting
this<00:02:02.390> setup<00:02:02.689> today<00:02:03.109> and<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:04.899> tried<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:06.020> over

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
this setup today and I tried it over

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.810 
this setup today and I tried it over
there<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.500> snow's<00:02:06.710> rock-hard<00:02:07.250> now<00:02:07.490> because

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
there the snow's rock-hard now because

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.340 
there the snow's rock-hard now because
we<00:02:07.969> had<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.119> melt<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.690> now<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:08.960> starting<00:02:09.259> to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
we had a melt and now it's starting to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.400 
we had a melt and now it's starting to
freeze<00:02:09.590> again<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:10.520> tried<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.300> blow<00:02:12.170> some

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
freeze again I tried to blow some

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.350 
freeze again I tried to blow some
rock-hard<00:02:12.830> snow<00:02:13.130> there<00:02:13.370> but<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.820> just<00:02:14.090> didn't

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
rock-hard snow there but I just didn't

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.450 
rock-hard snow there but I just didn't
have<00:02:14.480> enough<00:02:14.510> traction<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.980> slide<00:02:16.190> into

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
have enough traction to just slide into

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.030 
have enough traction to just slide into
it<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.900> at<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.200> point

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
it and at that point

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.069 
it and at that point
when<00:02:19.159> you<00:02:19.310> press<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.849> reverse<00:02:20.000> pedal<00:02:20.540> there

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
when you press the reverse pedal there

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.550 
when you press the reverse pedal there
is<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:22.209> safety<00:02:23.209> switch<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.480> cuts<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.200> PTO

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
is a safety switch that cuts out the PTO

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.349 
is a safety switch that cuts out the PTO
that's<00:02:25.069> very<00:02:25.340> annoying<00:02:25.579> I'm<00:02:25.849> gonna<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
that's very annoying I'm gonna have to

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.459 
that's very annoying I'm gonna have to
change<00:02:26.599> that<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.790> anyway<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.299> should<00:02:29.689> start<00:02:30.349> it

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
change that so anyway I should start it

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:45.590 
change that so anyway I should start it
up<00:02:30.530> at<00:02:30.739> this<00:02:30.859> point<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.969> is<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.180> warm<00:02:32.480> start

headlights<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.330> actually<00:02:54.690> comes<00:02:54.900> with

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
headlights do and it actually comes with

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.820 
headlights do and it actually comes with
the<00:02:55.290> original<00:02:55.850> side<00:02:56.850> deflectors<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.830> those

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
the original side deflectors there those

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.910 
the original side deflectors there those
orange<00:03:00.200> deflectors<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> side<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
orange deflectors on the side of the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560 
orange deflectors on the side of the
headlights<00:03:02.250> often<00:03:02.820> go<00:03:02.970> missing

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
headlights often go missing

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:12.860 
headlights often go missing
but<00:03:03.960> there<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.880> has<00:03:06.060> them

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.199 

the<00:03:13.380> whole<00:03:13.560> machine<00:03:13.920> rattles<00:03:14.520> quite<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> lot

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
the whole machine rattles quite a lot

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.339 
the whole machine rattles quite a lot
when<00:03:15.450> it's<00:03:15.599> an<00:03:15.750> idle<00:03:16.580> we<00:03:17.580> can<00:03:17.760> certainly<00:03:18.349> up

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
when it's an idle we can certainly up

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.190 
when it's an idle we can certainly up
the<00:03:19.770> throttle

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.230 

thinking<00:03:25.950> for<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.160> bit<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.459> drive

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
thinking for a bit of a drive

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.760 
thinking for a bit of a drive
as<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:28.450> can<00:03:28.570> see<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.080> front<00:03:29.320> quick<00:03:29.560> hitch

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
as you can see the front quick hitch

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.110 
as you can see the front quick hitch
snowblower<00:03:30.450> raises<00:03:31.450> quite<00:03:31.750> high

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
snowblower raises quite high

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.699 
snowblower raises quite high
hi

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:04:02.280 

very<00:03:41.340> slow<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.879> Reverse

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.960 

all<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.350> can<00:04:03.560> really<00:04:03.800> do<00:04:04.040> for<00:04:04.070> now<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.370> Drive<00:04:04.820> it

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
all I can really do for now is Drive it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.140 
all I can really do for now is Drive it
in<00:04:05.090> circles<00:04:09.100> so<00:04:10.100> I'm<00:04:10.220> completely<00:04:10.550> unsure<00:04:11.120> of

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
in circles so I'm completely unsure of

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.800 
in circles so I'm completely unsure of
what<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:11.660> with<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.930> tractor<00:04:13.690> because<00:04:14.690> of

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
what to do with this tractor because of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.690 
what to do with this tractor because of
its<00:04:14.960> low<00:04:15.230> hours<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.830> would<00:04:15.920> also<00:04:16.100> make<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.519> a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
its low hours that would also make it a

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.380 
its low hours that would also make it a
prime<00:04:17.000> candidate<00:04:17.540> for<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.810> quick<00:04:18.170> flip<00:04:18.350> but

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
prime candidate for a quick flip but

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.699 
prime candidate for a quick flip but
really<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.420> mean<00:04:20.690> my<00:04:20.810> parents<00:04:21.019> have<00:04:21.290> warmed<00:04:21.560> up

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
really I mean my parents have warmed up

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.470 
really I mean my parents have warmed up
to<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:21.950> I've<00:04:22.100> warmed<00:04:22.460> up<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.730> it<00:04:22.760> it's<00:04:23.330> a

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
to it I've warmed up to it it's a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.600 
to it I've warmed up to it it's a
fantastic<00:04:24.170> tractor<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:24.650> got<00:04:24.920> it<00:04:25.040> for<00:04:25.190> about<00:04:25.400> a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
fantastic tractor I got it for about a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.520 
fantastic tractor I got it for about a
quarter<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.330> what<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.630> was<00:04:26.750> worth<00:04:26.900> up<00:04:27.200> here<00:04:27.410> in

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
quarter of what it was worth up here in

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.910 
quarter of what it was worth up here in
Canada<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:29.180> I'll<00:04:29.720> have<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.230> see<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.440> might<00:04:30.710> just

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
Canada so I'll have to see I might just

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.560 
Canada so I'll have to see I might just
end<00:04:31.040> up<00:04:31.220> using<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.880> throughout<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.300> winter
