that focus it's gonna be right there tip
of<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:41.990> pencil<00:05:42.370> little<00:05:43.370> bar<00:05:43.580> pushes<00:05:44.300> out<00:05:44.480> and

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
of the pencil little bar pushes out and

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.840 
of the pencil little bar pushes out and
the<00:05:44.930> bar<00:05:45.140> is<00:05:45.169> pushing<00:05:45.710> against<00:05:46.610> like<00:05:46.700> let's

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
the bar is pushing against like let's

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.060 
the bar is pushing against like let's
say<00:05:46.970> here's<00:05:47.180> where<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.450> ricasso<00:05:47.930> is<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.860> bar

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
say here's where the ricasso is the bar

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.590 
say here's where the ricasso is the bar
is<00:05:49.160> like<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:49.880> handle<00:05:50.210> let's<00:05:50.510> say

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
is like this in the handle let's say

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.480 
is like this in the handle let's say
this<00:05:50.750> is<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:50.930> bar<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.410> when<00:05:52.010> you<00:05:52.100> when<00:05:52.400> you

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
this is the bar and when you when you

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.310 
this is the bar and when you when you
rotate<00:05:52.850> that<00:05:53.060> it's<00:05:53.270> pushing<00:05:53.450> out<00:05:53.750> and<00:05:54.020> up

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
rotate that it's pushing out and up

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.409 
rotate that it's pushing out and up
against<00:05:54.650> this<00:05:54.770> so<00:05:55.040> now<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:55.790> can't<00:05:56.060> move<00:05:56.180> this

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
against this so now you can't move this

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.930 
against this so now you can't move this
okay<00:05:57.169> so<00:05:57.830> it's<00:05:57.980> recessed<00:05:58.340> in<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.520> handle<00:05:58.850> and

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
okay so it's recessed in the handle and

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.880 
okay so it's recessed in the handle and
you<00:05:59.540> know<00:05:59.630> blade<00:05:59.870> moves<00:06:00.110> freely<00:06:00.350> up<00:06:00.590> and<00:06:00.740> down

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
you know blade moves freely up and down

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.950 
you know blade moves freely up and down
and<00:06:01.310> then<00:06:01.790> when<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.000> you<00:06:02.480> know<00:06:02.570> push<00:06:02.810> the

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
and then when you you know push the

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.290 
and then when you you know push the
button<00:06:03.200> this<00:06:03.650> moves<00:06:03.919> over<00:06:04.310> so<00:06:04.850> now<00:06:04.970> this<00:06:05.120> is<00:06:05.180> in

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
button this moves over so now this is in

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.020 
button this moves over so now this is in
the<00:06:05.450> way<00:06:05.600> and<00:06:06.380> that's<00:06:06.560> how<00:06:06.680> that<00:06:06.740> works<00:06:07.030> so

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
the way and that's how that works so

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.880 
the way and that's how that works so
very<00:06:08.300> interesting<00:06:09.169> the<00:06:09.500> only<00:06:09.530> things<00:06:09.830> that

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
very interesting the only things that

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.540 
very interesting the only things that
does<00:06:10.130> not<00:06:10.780> lock<00:06:11.780> in<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.050> open<00:06:12.290> position<00:06:12.550> but

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
does not lock in the open position but

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.550 
does not lock in the open position but
that<00:06:13.580> it<00:06:13.790> does<00:06:14.030> not<00:06:14.150> matter<00:06:14.390> whatsoever<00:06:14.900> just

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
that it does not matter whatsoever just

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.980 
that it does not matter whatsoever just
by<00:06:16.010> design<00:06:16.430> you<00:06:16.700> holding<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.330> knife<00:06:17.360> is<00:06:17.810> going

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
by design you holding the knife is going

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.140 
by design you holding the knife is going
to<00:06:18.080> prevent<00:06:18.320> it<00:06:18.500> from<00:06:18.560> closing<00:06:19.190> there's<00:06:19.940> no

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
to prevent it from closing there's no

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.640 
to prevent it from closing there's no
way<00:06:20.330> this<00:06:20.540> is<00:06:20.660> going<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:20.900> close<00:06:21.050> if<00:06:21.350> you're<00:06:21.500> if

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
way this is going to close if you're if

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.490 
way this is going to close if you're if
you're<00:06:21.680> holding<00:06:22.070> it<00:06:22.160> like<00:06:22.190> this<00:06:23.260> very<00:06:24.260> cool

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
you're holding it like this very cool

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.990 
you're holding it like this very cool
very<00:06:24.740> interesting<00:06:27.070> it<00:06:28.070> also<00:06:28.220> has<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.520> carabiner

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
very interesting it also has a carabiner

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.780 
very interesting it also has a carabiner
built<00:06:29.480> into<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.870> blade<00:06:30.710> here<00:06:30.980> so<00:06:31.610> you<00:06:31.669> can

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
built into the blade here so you can

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.640 
built into the blade here so you can
just<00:06:31.910> clip<00:06:32.120> this<00:06:32.210> right<00:06:32.390> onto<00:06:32.510> your<00:06:32.690> maybe<00:06:33.560> a

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
just clip this right onto your maybe a

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.350 
just clip this right onto your maybe a
belt<00:06:33.919> loop<00:06:34.070> on<00:06:34.250> your<00:06:34.370> pants<00:06:34.790> or<00:06:34.940> you<00:06:35.240> know<00:06:35.330> a

very very interesting design let's see
the<00:06:42.330> price<00:06:42.570> on<00:06:42.780> this<00:06:42.930> with<00:06:43.230> I<00:06:43.350> think<00:06:43.560> 75<00:06:44.010> even

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
the price on this with I think 75 even

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.940 
the price on this with I think 75 even
and<00:06:45.780> he<00:06:45.840> watched<00:06:46.020> my<00:06:46.170> other<00:06:46.260> video<00:06:46.530> I<00:06:46.590> think<00:06:46.710> I

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
and he watched my other video I think I

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.790 
and he watched my other video I think I
showed<00:06:47.130> the<00:06:47.280> price<00:06:47.460> on<00:06:47.610> that<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:49.530> planar

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
showed the price on that the planar

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.460 
showed the price on that the planar
versions<00:06:50.250> are<00:06:50.340> a<00:06:50.370> little<00:06:50.490> bit<00:06:50.640> cheaper<00:06:51.470> but

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
versions are a little bit cheaper but

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.320 
versions are a little bit cheaper but
definitely<00:06:52.860> an<00:06:52.920> awesome<00:06:53.040> knife<00:06:53.370> it's<00:06:54.090> got<00:06:54.270> it

definitely<00:06:54.630> has<00:06:54.720> that<00:06:54.750> cool<00:06:55.020> factor<00:06:55.260> that

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
definitely has that cool factor that

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.180 
definitely has that cool factor that
kind<00:06:56.640> of<00:06:56.700> wow<00:06:56.880> you<00:06:57.540> know<00:06:57.660> what's<00:06:57.840> that<00:06:58.080> I'm<00:06:59.010> not

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
so hot on the blade shape itself I wish

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.560 
so hot on the blade shape itself I wish
it<00:07:01.980> was<00:07:02.070> slightly<00:07:02.430> different<00:07:02.760> like<00:07:03.240> I<00:07:03.330> can<00:07:03.480> do

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
it was slightly different like I can do

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.020 
it was slightly different like I can do
without<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:03.900> carabiner<00:07:04.440> clip<00:07:04.740> not<00:07:05.700> really<00:07:05.880> my

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
without the carabiner clip not really my

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.270 
without the carabiner clip not really my
thing<00:07:06.150> but<00:07:06.480> overall<00:07:07.200> I<00:07:07.590> definitely<00:07:08.160> respect

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
thing but overall I definitely respect
