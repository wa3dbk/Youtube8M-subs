00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
like that and we do have another pack of

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
like that and we do have another pack of
these<00:01:30.509> stone<00:01:30.780> Quillen<00:01:31.170> or<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> two

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
these stone Quillen or one of the two

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
these stone Quillen or one of the two
packs<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.400> say<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.030> can't<00:01:33.240> pull<00:01:33.420> both<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
packs to say you can't pull both of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.030 
packs to say you can't pull both of
these<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> same<00:01:34.259> time<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.799> you've<00:01:35.009> got

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
these at the same time if you've got

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800 
these at the same time if you've got
confident<00:01:35.640> group<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:36.570> we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
confident group if not I don't we

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.600 
confident group if not I don't we
recommend<00:01:37.229> pulling<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.799> time<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.400> do

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
recommend pulling one at time as they do

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.999 
recommend pulling one at time as they do
quite<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.299> damage<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.780> tanks<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.799> if

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
quite a lot of damage to you tanks so if

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.140 
quite a lot of damage to you tanks so if
you<00:01:41.100> pull<00:01:41.280> both<00:01:41.430> you're<00:01:41.700> probably<00:01:41.880> end<00:01:42.090> up

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you pull both you're probably end up

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.780 
you pull both you're probably end up
wiping<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.750> know<00:01:43.310> sure<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> handle

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
wiping if you know sure you can handle

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.020 
wiping if you know sure you can handle
them<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:46.100> final<00:01:47.100> park<00:01:47.280> once<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.700> out<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
them a final park once we get out of the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.850 
them a final park once we get out of the
way<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.509> pull<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> bus<00:01:49.049> now<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
moment unnormal this three stone Quillen

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
moment unnormal this three stone Quillen
there's<00:01:51.930> meant<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.259> four<00:01:52.619> or<00:01:52.799> stone<00:01:53.399> guards

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
there's meant to be four or stone guards

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.639 
there's meant to be four or stone guards
and<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.110> there's<00:01:55.350> meant<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> be

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
and I don't know if there's meant to be

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.590 
and I don't know if there's meant to be
four<00:01:55.860> unnormal<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.790> very<00:01:57.030> difficult<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
four unnormal or just very difficult to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.149 
four unnormal or just very difficult to
go<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.960> only<00:01:58.110> three<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
go there is only three so there the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.410 
go there is only three so there the
mechanics<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.610> we're<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.909> go<00:02:00.000> over<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
mechanics so we're going to go over and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
mechanics so we're going to go over and
the<00:02:01.380> main<00:02:01.590> thing<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.670> gain

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the main thing is that they all gain

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.719 
the main thing is that they all gain
this<00:02:03.119> energy<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.009> once<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.130> reach<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.549> full

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
this energy and once you reach your full

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.940 
this energy and once you reach your full
bar<00:02:05.939> advantages<00:02:06.450> it'll<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> an

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
bar advantages it'll do like a an

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.919 
bar advantages it'll do like a an
overload<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.970> causes<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> mass<00:02:09.599> amount<00:02:09.720> of

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
overload which causes a mass amount of

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.380 
overload which causes a mass amount of
damage<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> Reed<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.120> you'll<00:02:12.120> see<00:02:12.270> how

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
damage to the Reed and you'll see how

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.760 
damage to the Reed and you'll see how
that's<00:02:12.599> handled<00:02:12.780> very<00:02:13.140> shortly

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that's handled very shortly

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
that's handled very shortly
and<00:02:13.950> they<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.430> their<00:02:14.550> own<00:02:14.610> sort<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.060> side

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and they all have their own sort of side

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.240 
and they all have their own sort of side
ability<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.990> when<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.620> are<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.770> range<00:02:17.040> of

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
ability and when there are a range of

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.430 
ability and when there are a range of
each<00:02:17.400> other<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:18.240> won't<00:02:18.510> gain<00:02:18.690> any<00:02:18.960> energy

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
each other they won't gain any energy

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680 
each other they won't gain any energy
they<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.770> still<00:02:20.100> attack<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.390> they'll<00:02:21.540> also

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
they can still attack but they'll also

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.020 
they can still attack but they'll also
take<00:02:21.870> 90<00:02:22.470> percent<00:02:22.800> reduced<00:02:23.220> damage<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.850> when

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
take 90 percent reduced damage so when

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.420 
take 90 percent reduced damage so when
they're<00:02:24.180> out<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.510> way<00:02:24.680> they<00:02:25.680> don't<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.190> do

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
they're out the way they don't really do

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.820 
they're out the way they don't really do
anything<00:02:26.640> apart<00:02:26.850> from<00:02:27.060> auto<00:02:27.330> attacks<00:02:27.830> but

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
anything apart from auto attacks but

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.550 
anything apart from auto attacks but
they'll<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:30.000> gain<00:02:30.390> any<00:02:30.570> energy<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.470> they

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
they'll not gain any energy but and they

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.910 
they'll not gain any energy but and they
can't<00:02:31.800> really<00:02:32.130> be<00:02:32.310> damaged<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.680> way<00:02:34.800> we

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
can't really be damaged so the way we

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.740 
can't really be damaged so the way we
handle<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.210> tank<00:02:36.480> pulled

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
handle this was to have one tank pulled

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.180 
handle this was to have one tank pulled
two<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.050> them<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> other<00:02:37.680> tank<00:02:37.890> after

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
two of them and the other tank after

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.130 
two of them and the other tank after
tank<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.850> live<00:02:39.210> one<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> side<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
tank have the live one to the side and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.290 
tank have the live one to the side and
the<00:02:40.200> one<00:02:41.160> that's<00:02:41.340> active<00:02:41.760> you'll<00:02:41.940> tell<00:02:42.120> it's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
the one that's active you'll tell it's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.240 
the one that's active you'll tell it's
active<00:02:42.630> by<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.020> sort<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.380> tornado<00:02:43.980> and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
active by this sort of tornado and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.310 
active by this sort of tornado and
you'll<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.670> debuff<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.900> we've<00:02:46.080> got<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
you'll have this debuff so we've got the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.780 
you'll have this debuff so we've got the
red<00:02:46.500> one<00:02:46.710> so<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> Jazz<00:02:47.340> phone<00:02:47.580> that's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
red one so it's the Jazz phone that's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.700 
red one so it's the Jazz phone that's
active<00:02:48.090> at<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.240> moment<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.410> what<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
active at the moment and the what the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.400 
active at the moment and the what the
debuff<00:02:50.040> does<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.490> it'll<00:02:50.700> slowly<00:02:50.970> slowly<00:02:51.870> tick

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
debuff does is it'll slowly slowly tick

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.260 
debuff does is it'll slowly slowly tick
up<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.160> hits<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.670> actual<00:02:54.060> turn

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
up and when it hits on just actual turn

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.600 
up and when it hits on just actual turn
to<00:02:54.420> stone<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:55.680> it'll<00:02:55.920> also<00:02:56.010> give<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.430> eighty

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
to stone but it'll also give you eighty

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.190 
to stone but it'll also give you eighty
percent<00:02:56.820> fire<00:02:57.240> reduction<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.960> want<00:02:58.140> to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
percent fire reduction so you want to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.990 
percent fire reduction so you want to
have<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.950> debuff<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.700> one<00:02:59.850> that's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
have that debuff for the one that's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.730 
have that debuff for the one that's
going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.210> overload<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.230> as<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.410> see<00:03:01.590> we've

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
going to overload so as you see we've

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.230 
going to overload so as you see we've
got<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.920> red<00:03:02.070> debuff<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.610> when<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.820> overloads

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
got the red debuff so when it overloads

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.420 
got the red debuff so when it overloads
like<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:04.380> have<00:03:04.590> any<00:03:04.800> tips<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.160> damage

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
like now you have any tips and damage

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.800 
like now you have any tips and damage
reduction<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.210> not<00:03:06.330> going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.510> do<00:03:06.660> much

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
reduction so it's not going to do much

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.620 
reduction so it's not going to do much
damage<00:03:06.990> to<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.240> then<00:03:09.240> what<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.570> were

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
damage to you and then what we were

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.300 
damage to you and then what we were
doing<00:03:09.870> was<00:03:10.050> once<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.560> one's<00:03:10.740> finished<00:03:10.950> we

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
doing was once that one's finished we

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.070 
doing was once that one's finished we
swap<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.730> out<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.120> we're<00:03:12.270> not<00:03:12.390> continuing<00:03:12.960> to

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
swap it out so we're not continuing to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.290 
swap it out so we're not continuing to
get<00:03:13.200> stacks<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.250> deactivates<00:03:14.790> basically

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
get stacks so it deactivates basically

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.600 
get stacks so it deactivates basically
and<00:03:15.510> then<00:03:16.260> we<00:03:16.380> pull<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.800> active<00:03:17.040> one<00:03:17.220> so

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
and then we pull in the active one so

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.160 
and then we pull in the active one so
we've<00:03:17.760> got<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.970> cobalt<00:03:18.360> at<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.600> Jade<00:03:18.810> one<00:03:18.990> now

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
we've got the cobalt at the Jade one now

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.380 
we've got the cobalt at the Jade one now
and<00:03:19.350> we're<00:03:19.470> getting<00:03:19.680> stacks<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.370> it'll<00:03:21.209> keep

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and we're getting stacks and it'll keep

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.900 
and we're getting stacks and it'll keep
damaging<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.080> ticking<00:03:22.410> up<00:03:22.560> once<00:03:23.340> it's<00:03:23.610> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
damaging it ticking up once it's the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.820 
damaging it ticking up once it's the
full<00:03:24.120> stacks<00:03:24.510> it'll<00:03:24.840> overload<00:03:25.080> causing<00:03:25.709> mass

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
full stacks it'll overload causing mass

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.110 
full stacks it'll overload causing mass
amounts<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.100> damage<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:26.640> because<00:03:26.850> you've<00:03:27.000> got

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
amounts of damage but because you've got

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.460 
amounts of damage but because you've got
the<00:03:27.240> YouTube<00:03:27.510> sent<00:03:27.660> damage<00:03:27.930> reduction<00:03:28.140> it's

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the YouTube sent damage reduction it's

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.590 
the YouTube sent damage reduction it's
very<00:03:28.680> minimal<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.250> they'll<00:03:30.060> also<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.420> their

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
very minimal and they'll also have their

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.070 
very minimal and they'll also have their
own<00:03:30.660> little<00:03:30.720> side<00:03:31.140> attack<00:03:31.850> which<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.150> just

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
own little side attack which is just

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.960 
own little side attack which is just
basically<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.560> one-off<00:03:35.040> attack<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.760> Jade

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
basically a one-off attack so the Jade

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.170 
basically a one-off attack so the Jade
does<00:03:36.930> aj<00:03:37.530> h<00:03:37.650> ad<00:03:37.950> which<00:03:38.250> will<00:03:38.400> hit<00:03:38.550> all<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
does aj h ad which will hit all the the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.110 
does aj h ad which will hit all the the
raid<00:03:39.360> 450k<00:03:39.959> damage<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.910> Jasper<00:03:41.910> does<00:03:42.090> a

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
raid 450k damage and the Jasper does a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.300 
raid 450k damage and the Jasper does a
cleave<00:03:42.660> which<00:03:42.930> will<00:03:43.110> hit<00:03:43.230> all<00:03:43.380> targets<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
cleave which will hit all targets the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.210 
cleave which will hit all targets the
nearest<00:03:44.820> five<00:03:45.030> targets<00:03:45.300> for<00:03:45.630> 65<00:03:46.200> k<00:03:46.500> its

cobalt grasp which will come from under

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.590 
cobalt grasp which will come from under
the<00:03:52.560> ground<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.160> inflict<00:03:53.550> for<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> key<00:03:54.209> down

the ground and inflict for a key down

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.720 
the ground and inflict for a key down
into<00:03:54.870> under<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.140> players<00:03:55.350> feet<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.830> prevent

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
into under the players feet and prevent

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.480 
into under the players feet and prevent
for<00:03:57.480> moving<00:03:57.780> for<00:03:57.959> six<00:03:58.140> seconds<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.070> not<00:03:59.459> very

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
for moving for six seconds so not very

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.520 
for moving for six seconds so not very
advanced<00:03:59.970> mechanics<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.840> bus<00:04:01.080> will<00:04:01.350> go

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
advanced mechanics and the bus will go

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.840 
advanced mechanics and the bus will go
down<00:04:01.680> very<00:04:01.920> easily<00:04:02.040> if<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.490> just<00:04:02.730> keep

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
down very easily if you just keep

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.430 
down very easily if you just keep
swapping<00:04:03.150> out<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.420> inactive<00:04:03.959> in<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.140> active

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
swapping out the inactive in the active

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.190 
swapping out the inactive in the active
ones<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.300> that's<00:04:06.300> pretty<00:04:06.540> much<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> finest

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
ones and that's pretty much the finest

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.080 
ones and that's pretty much the finest
as<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.440> said<00:04:07.620> it's<00:04:07.830> probably<00:04:08.010> under<00:04:08.520> tuned<00:04:08.910> at

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
as I said it's probably under tuned at

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.390 
as I said it's probably under tuned at
the<00:04:09.150> moment<00:04:09.510> not<00:04:10.170> how<00:04:10.350> it's<00:04:10.530> meant<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.830> be<00:04:10.860> is

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the moment not how it's meant to be is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.650 
the moment not how it's meant to be is
the<00:04:11.730> first<00:04:11.940> raid<00:04:12.150> test<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.510> we<00:04:12.570> had

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
the first raid test that we had

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.630 
the first raid test that we had
available<00:04:12.860> but<00:04:13.860> that's<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.100> quick<00:04:14.280> look<00:04:14.430> at<00:04:14.550> the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
available but that's a quick look at the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.430 
available but that's a quick look at the
fight<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.570> hope<00:04:15.720> you've<00:04:15.900> enjoyed<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.260> first

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
fight so I hope you've enjoyed the first

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.470 
fight so I hope you've enjoyed the first
look<00:04:16.980> at<00:04:17.190> mogu'shan<00:04:17.700> vaults<00:04:18.060> we<00:04:18.209> will<00:04:18.359> be

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
look at mogu'shan vaults we will be

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.970 
look at mogu'shan vaults we will be
covering<00:04:18.630> more<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.020> it<00:04:19.140> in<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.290> future<00:04:19.620> thanks
