00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.650
 the European developers are more 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.960
 interested in playstation 4 and in steam 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.840
 box that in the other consoles so 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.390
 has unveiled a survey of the gdc europe 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.890
 Well, the interest in 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.689
 playstation 4 with the rest of 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.119
 platforms and is that according to this study 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.670
 interest in playstation 4 of the 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.610
 developers is set at 39 by 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.860
 hundred this inbox follows her very closely 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.019
 playstation 4 puts a figure of 37 per 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.479
 cent and eye because today they are already 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.370
 third position with 32 percent 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.580
 something that has surprised many people 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.750
 also in terms of xbox one they are 20% 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.559
 the developers that are 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.360
 interested in this microsoft console 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.699
 playstation vita wii and nintendo 3ds 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.379
 they occupy the last positions of all 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.839
 I already tell you , do not worry, do not worry 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.580
 you do not make an excessive case to 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.680
 this survey since for example 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.140
 nintendo 3ds you already know that it is one of the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.210
 most sold consoles and good look at 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.710
 this list occupy the last 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.780
 of interest on the part of 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.430
 European developers also also 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.409
 it must be clarified that the developers 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.540
 actively creating games for the 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.940
 annexation have been quite scarce in 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.350
 as to quantity with only 13% 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.530
 of those who participated in the survey 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.710
 working with playstation 4 and with 9% 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.840
 doing the same in xbox one 23% 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.119
 plans to work in the future with the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.270
 sony machine with the Playstation 4 and 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.710
 14% with the xbox one you also have to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.830
 clarify that tablets and smartphones 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.750
 they are the ones who take the palm in all 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 this survey and is that outside of 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.119
 video game consoles are the platforms that 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.340
 more interest they attract with a 61 and a 53 by 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.020
 a hundred certainly very careful because 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.660
 if the control of the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.679
 smartphones and tablets consoles 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.679
 they would have much to fear
