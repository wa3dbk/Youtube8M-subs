out<00:02:11.980> any<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.370> detail<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.240> carving<00:02:13.660> but

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
out any of the detail of the carving but

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.660 
out any of the detail of the carving but
we<00:02:14.350> can<00:02:14.470> clearly<00:02:14.710> see<00:02:15.040> where<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> high<00:02:15.460> and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
we can clearly see where the high and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:27.570 
we can clearly see where the high and
low<00:02:15.730> points<00:02:15.880> will<00:02:16.450> be

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.100 

let's<00:02:28.580> take<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> closer<00:02:29.120> look<00:02:29.240> at<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.690> results

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
let's take a closer look at the results

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.120 

the<00:02:41.570> next<00:02:41.840> phase<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.320> where<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.650> begin<00:02:42.890> to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
the next phase is where we begin to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.950 
the next phase is where we begin to
provide<00:02:43.430> more<00:02:43.730> definitions<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.450> carving

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
provide more definitions of carving

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.680

at<00:03:15.349> this<00:03:15.560> point<00:03:15.860> we've<00:03:16.130> cut<00:03:16.400> about<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.640> half

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
at this point we've cut about a half

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.270 
at this point we've cut about a half

bit<00:05:14.000> our<00:05:14.870> plan<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:15.199> to<00:05:15.410> use<00:05:15.680> an<00:05:15.860> even<00:05:16.100> finer<00:05:16.430> bit

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
bit our plan is to use an even finer bit

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.400 
bit our plan is to use an even finer bit
to<00:05:17.120> finish<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.570> carbon<00:05:19.720> for<00:05:20.720> this<00:05:20.840> final<00:05:21.110> pass

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
to finish the carbon for this final pass

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.680 
to finish the carbon for this final pass
we'll<00:05:21.740> use<00:05:21.919> a<00:05:21.949> one-eighth<00:05:22.669> inch<00:05:23.030> ball<00:05:23.479> node

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
we'll use a one-eighth inch ball node

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.510 
we'll use a one-eighth inch ball node
bit<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.290> we'll<00:05:24.650> step<00:05:24.860> over<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.190> entire

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
bit and we'll step over the entire

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.360 
bit and we'll step over the entire
carving<00:05:26.030> in<00:05:26.150> small<00:05:26.570> offsets<00:05:27.290> we'll<00:05:28.070> also<00:05:28.220> use

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
carving in small offsets we'll also use

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.969 
carving in small offsets we'll also use
a<00:05:28.550> raster<00:05:29.180> strategy<00:05:29.810> with<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.290> bit<00:05:30.530> moving<00:05:30.800> back

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
a raster strategy with a bit moving back

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.920 
a raster strategy with a bit moving back
and<00:05:31.130> forth<00:05:31.220> in<00:05:31.520> straight<00:05:31.880> lines<00:05:31.910> along<00:05:32.720> the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
from this angle we can see how much

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.710 
from this angle we can see how much
travel<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.740> bit<00:05:39.919> takes<00:05:40.250> along<00:05:40.550> the<00:05:40.759> z-axis<00:05:41.030> as

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
travel the bit takes along the z-axis as

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.469 
travel the bit takes along the z-axis as
it<00:05:42.199> traces<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.710> green<00:05:42.919> man's<00:05:43.129> profile<00:05:43.819> from

of his nose to the lowest point is just
over<00:05:49.310> an<00:05:49.400> inch<00:05:49.639> and<00:05:49.879> a<00:05:49.940> half<00:05:51.819> that<00:05:52.819> will<00:05:52.940> give

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
over an inch and a half that will give

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.180 
over an inch and a half that will give
us<00:05:53.090> a<00:05:53.240> very<00:05:53.449> realistic<00:05:53.900> level<00:05:54.259> of<00:05:54.500> detail<00:05:54.949> by
