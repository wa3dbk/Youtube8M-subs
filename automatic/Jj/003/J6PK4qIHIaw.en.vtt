00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
right here you can grab a star if you

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.869 
right here you can grab a star if you
want<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.589> so<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.799> can<00:00:04.920> get<00:00:05.009> invincible<00:00:05.609> for<00:00:05.850> a

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
want to so you can get invincible for a

want to so you can get invincible for a
little<00:00:06.120> bit<00:00:08.510> be<00:00:09.510> careful<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.019> making<00:00:10.290> your

little bit be careful and making your
long<00:00:10.620> jump<00:00:10.830> over<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.130> big<00:00:11.309> gap<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.820> then

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
long jump over the big gap and then

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.549 
long jump over the big gap and then
we're<00:00:12.210> gonna<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.480> another<00:00:12.780> big<00:00:13.019> gap<00:00:13.230> coming

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
we're gonna have another big gap coming

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:38.610 
we're gonna have another big gap coming
up<00:00:13.679> with<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> single<00:00:14.130> platform<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.150> middle

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.830 

the<00:00:39.620> beginning<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.070> hs2<00:00:40.700> hasn't<00:00:41.060> lakitu<00:00:41.570> as

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
the beginning of hs2 hasn't lakitu as

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.670 
the beginning of hs2 hasn't lakitu as
well<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:42.500> some<00:00:42.650> coupons<00:00:43.100> dropping<00:00:43.490> down<00:00:44.680> get

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
well as some coupons dropping down get

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.320 
well as some coupons dropping down get
up<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.920> past<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.430> if<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:46.640> want<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:47.180> can

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
up the past and if you want to you can

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.240 
up the past and if you want to you can
grab<00:00:47.480> an<00:00:47.600> extra<00:00:47.720> life<00:00:48.080> by<00:00:48.290> using<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:48.920> spring

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
grab an extra life by using the spring

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.120 
grab an extra life by using the spring
in<00:00:49.489> order<00:00:49.580> to<00:00:49.820> hit<00:00:49.970> that<00:00:50.150> block<00:00:50.920> watch<00:00:51.920> the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
in order to hit that block watch the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.680 
in order to hit that block watch the
extra<00:00:52.400> life<00:00:52.580> as<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:52.850> moves<00:00:53.030> across<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.330> top

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
extra life as it moves across the top

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.000 
extra life as it moves across the top
and<00:00:53.930> then<00:00:54.140> grab<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.379> as<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.739> reaches<00:00:54.980> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
and then grab it as it reaches the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:09.280 
and then grab it as it reaches the
bottom<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:08.060> gap<00:01:08.330> right<00:01:08.570> there<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.930> probably

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
bottom that gap right there is probably

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.480 
bottom that gap right there is probably
one<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.560> harder<00:01:09.890> jumps<00:01:10.220> to<00:01:10.310> make

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
one of the harder jumps to make

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.100 
one of the harder jumps to make
especially<00:01:10.970> considering<00:01:11.420> momentum<00:01:11.869> is<00:01:11.990> going

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
especially considering momentum is going

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:32.920 
especially considering momentum is going
to<00:01:12.200> be<00:01:12.259> a<00:01:12.290> problem<00:01:31.090> 8-3<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.540> second<00:01:32.869> to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
to be a problem 8-3 is the second to

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.930 
to be a problem 8-3 is the second to
last<00:01:32.960> level<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> game<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:34.190> has<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.610> lot<00:01:34.820> of

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
last level of the game it has a lot of

last level of the game it has a lot of
bullet<00:01:35.240> bills<00:01:35.420> as<00:01:35.660> well<00:01:35.690> as<00:01:35.869> these<00:01:36.110> castle

bullet bills as well as these castle

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.710 
bullet bills as well as these castle
walls<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.550> real<00:01:37.789> tricky<00:01:38.180> part<00:01:38.420> about<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
walls the real tricky part about the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.330 
walls the real tricky part about the
stage<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:39.380> filled<00:01:39.649> with<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.979> lot<00:01:40.220> of

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
stage is that it's filled with a lot of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.520 
stage is that it's filled with a lot of
these<00:01:40.430> different<00:01:40.820> hammer<00:01:41.060> brothers<00:01:41.510> some<00:01:42.409> of

these different hammer brothers some of
which<00:01:42.680> are<00:01:42.890> just<00:01:42.920> going<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.280> be<00:01:43.340> on<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.670> ground

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
which are just going to be on the ground

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.280 
which are just going to be on the ground
and<00:01:44.270> you're<00:01:44.360> gonna<00:01:44.479> have<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.810> figure<00:01:44.990> out<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
and you're gonna have to figure out the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.109 
and you're gonna have to figure out the
best<00:01:45.500> ways<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.770> jump<00:01:46.220> over<00:01:46.520> them<00:01:46.640> or<00:01:46.790> get<00:01:46.909> past

them in order to continue some of them
you're<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.690> have<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.869> either<00:01:51.020> run<00:01:51.290> right

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
you're going to have to either run right

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.770 
you're going to have to either run right
underneath<00:01:51.770> or<00:01:52.189> make<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.760> big<00:01:53.060> jump<00:01:53.270> over<00:01:53.659> them

your way across and drop down this pipe
it'll<00:02:22.459> take<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.940> another<00:02:23.180> segment<00:02:23.569> of<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.880 
level as you make your way across you
have<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.720> hit<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> block<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.410> here<00:02:30.470> in<00:02:30.769> order

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
to get up to this pipe up here this will

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.259 
to get up to this pipe up here this will
take<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:33.920> another<00:02:34.129> area<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.730> stage<00:02:37.269> you
