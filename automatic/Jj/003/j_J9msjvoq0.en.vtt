between<00:02:31.799> us<00:02:32.159> and<00:02:32.719> we<00:02:33.719> really<00:02:34.200> had<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.379> wonderful

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
between us and we really had a wonderful

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.440 
between us and we really had a wonderful
time<00:02:34.889> working<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.519> each<00:02:35.670> other<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.239> guess

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
time working with each other and I guess

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.569 
time working with each other and I guess
what's<00:02:36.719> important<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.349> when<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.010> respect<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
what's important is when you respect the

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.979 
what's important is when you respect the
other<00:02:38.730> actor<00:02:39.120> who's<00:02:39.329> standing<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:39.689> front<00:02:39.840> of

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
other actor who's standing in front of

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.170 
other actor who's standing in front of
you<00:02:40.170> or<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:41.010> work<00:02:41.189> automatically<00:02:41.819> becomes

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
you or the work automatically becomes

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.569 
you or the work automatically becomes
better<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:43.139> think<00:02:43.170> both<00:02:43.889> of<00:02:43.950> us<00:02:44.159> respect

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
better and I think both of us respect

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.059 
better and I think both of us respect
each<00:02:44.790> other<00:02:44.969> as<00:02:45.150> actors<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.780> lot<00:02:46.319> no<00:02:46.889> but

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
each other as actors a lot no but

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.770 
each other as actors a lot no but
another<00:02:47.370> norm<00:02:47.669> in<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.909> industry<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.329> single

but I think marriage in today's day and

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.379 
but I think marriage in today's day and
age<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> very<00:03:20.489> important<00:03:20.909> decision<00:03:21.000> that

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
age is a very important decision that

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.559 
age is a very important decision that
one<00:03:21.569> takes<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.729> one<00:03:23.729> cannot<00:03:24.000> frivolously

sense<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.299> unfortunately<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:29.250> media's

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
sense and unfortunately the media's

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.339 
sense and unfortunately the media's
really<00:03:29.849> killed<00:03:30.090> my<00:03:30.359> own<00:03:30.629> marriage<00:03:30.959> for<00:03:31.319> me

that statement each time it comes

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.899

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
is the kind of picture that I kind of

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.280 
is the kind of picture that I kind of
visualize<00:04:03.120> when<00:04:03.419> these<00:04:03.599> kind<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.870> reports

visualize when these kind of reports
come<00:04:04.470> out<00:04:04.560> because<00:04:05.189> that<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:06.060> would<00:04:06.269> be

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
come out because that that would be

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.969 
come out because that that would be
definitely<00:04:06.540> something<00:04:07.169> that<00:04:07.199> I<00:04:07.500> would<00:04:07.739> think

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
definitely something that I would think

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.330 
definitely something that I would think
if<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.489> would<00:04:08.639> read<00:04:08.790> an<00:04:08.909> article<00:04:09.030> like<00:04:09.389> that<00:04:09.599> and

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
if I would read an article like that and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.830 
if I would read an article like that and
definitely<00:04:11.340> marriage<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.180> something<00:04:12.389> which<00:04:12.689> I

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
definitely marriage is something which I

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.789 
definitely marriage is something which I
hold<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:13.919> very<00:04:14.129> high<00:04:14.340> regard<00:04:15.239> in<00:04:16.139> my<00:04:16.320> life<00:04:16.530> it

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
would be a very very important decision

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.960 
would be a very very important decision
for<00:04:18.599> my<00:04:18.720> side<00:04:18.989> it's<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.889> certain<00:04:20.579> sections<00:04:20.909> of

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.119 
Bombay and none of them asked me this
question<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.139> I<00:04:40.259> really<00:04:40.650> don't<00:04:40.770> think<00:04:40.889> it's

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
question so I really don't think it's

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.610 
question so I really don't think it's
the<00:04:41.220> media<00:04:41.900> it's<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.020> feel<00:04:43.199> of<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.349> media

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
the media it's a feel of the media

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.770 
the media it's a feel of the media
because<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:44.009> media<00:04:44.190> is<00:04:44.509> absolutely<00:04:45.509> lovely

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
because the media is absolutely lovely

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.570 
because the media is absolutely lovely
and<00:04:46.139> they're<00:04:46.289> very<00:04:46.319> sweet<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:47.039> you<00:04:47.159> think<00:04:47.190> they

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
and they're very sweet so you think they

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.909 
and they're very sweet so you think they
have<00:04:47.669> planted<00:04:48.060> they<00:04:49.050> obviously<00:04:49.199> planted

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
have planted they obviously planted

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.550 
have planted they obviously planted
because<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.280> guess<00:04:50.819> the<00:04:51.629> wave<00:04:51.780> media<00:04:52.080> functions

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
because I guess the wave media functions

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.899 
because I guess the wave media functions
have<00:04:52.680> spoken<00:04:52.949> to<00:04:53.129> a<00:04:53.159> lot<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.310> journalists<00:04:53.759> who

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.610 
have spoken to a lot of journalists who
are<00:04:54.030> close<00:04:54.539> to<00:04:54.569> me<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:54.930> I'll<00:04:55.020> ask<00:04:55.199> them<00:04:55.440> this

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
are close to me and I'll ask them this

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.499
