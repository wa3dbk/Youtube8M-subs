the 2011 budget we have already hit a

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.200 
the 2011 budget we have already hit a
figure<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:42.140> by<00:01:42.680> any<00:01:42.860> standard<00:01:43.430> would<00:01:44.090> be

we<00:02:02.300> start<00:02:02.600> applying<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.740> approach<00:02:04.130> where

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
we start applying that approach where

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.890 
we start applying that approach where
I've<00:02:04.790> got<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.000> get<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.210> hundred<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.630> ten
