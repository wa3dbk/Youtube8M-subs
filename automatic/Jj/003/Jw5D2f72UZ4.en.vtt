what's<00:00:00.900> up<00:00:01.079> guys<00:00:01.260> it's<00:00:01.469> me<00:00:01.560> Jeremy<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.220> since

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and since

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.770 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and since
so<00:00:02.639> many<00:00:02.760> people<00:00:02.879> have<00:00:03.149> requested<00:00:03.360> it<00:00:03.689> and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
so many people have requested it and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.240 
so many people have requested it and
since<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.140> item<00:00:04.319> has<00:00:04.470> finally<00:00:04.890> been<00:00:05.009> patched

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
since the item has finally been patched

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.010 
since the item has finally been patched
here<00:00:05.790> my<00:00:05.940> thoughts<00:00:06.180> on<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> new<00:00:06.509> art<00:00:06.870> and

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
here my thoughts on the new art and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.129 
here my thoughts on the new art and
sensor<00:00:07.379> let's<00:00:08.069> get<00:00:08.220> started<00:00:08.750> now<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.780> thing

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
sensor let's get started now the thing

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.900 
sensor let's get started now the thing
about<00:00:10.290> art<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.679> sensor<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.460> based<00:00:11.730> on

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
about art and sensor is that based on

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.640 
about art and sensor is that based on
the<00:00:12.059> stats<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.570> gives<00:00:12.750> alone<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.410> can<00:00:13.590> be

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the stats it gives alone it can be

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.279 
the stats it gives alone it can be
incredibly<00:00:14.490> useful<00:00:14.580> or<00:00:15.120> completely<00:00:16.080> useless

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
incredibly useful or completely useless

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.820 
incredibly useful or completely useless
so<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.340> gives<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.580> 30<00:00:17.910> AP<00:00:18.270> 10<00:00:18.630> mana<00:00:18.840> per<00:00:18.990> 5<00:00:19.199> 10%

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
so it gives you 30 AP 10 mana per 5 10%

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.279 
so it gives you 30 AP 10 mana per 5 10%
CDR<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.340> 8%<00:00:20.640> movement<00:00:21.119> speed<00:00:21.300> ignoring<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
CDR and 8% movement speed ignoring the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.830 
CDR and 8% movement speed ignoring the
passive<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.890> puts<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.310> item<00:00:23.580> add<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.390> below

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
passive this puts the item add and below

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
passive this puts the item add and below
average<00:00:25.080> 93<00:00:26.010> percent<00:00:26.400> gold<00:00:26.609> efficiency<00:00:27.000> which

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
average 93 percent gold efficiency which

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
average 93 percent gold efficiency which
is<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.750> too<00:00:27.960> great<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.099> passive<00:00:29.429> attack

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
is not too great but the passive attack

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.569 
is not too great but the passive attack
speed<00:00:30.029> buff<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.539> worth<00:00:30.810> 750<00:00:31.740> gold<00:00:31.949> per<00:00:32.160> person

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
speed buff is worth 750 gold per person

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
speed buff is worth 750 gold per person
that<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.030> which<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> pretty<00:00:34.200> solid

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that it's on which is a pretty solid

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.870 
that it's on which is a pretty solid
amount<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:35.040> than<00:00:35.160> enough<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.730> for

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
amount more than enough to make up for

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
amount more than enough to make up for
the<00:00:35.940> lack<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> gold<00:00:36.420> efficiency<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> add<00:00:37.829> into

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the lack of gold efficiency and add into

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.740 
the lack of gold efficiency and add into
that<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> nice<00:00:38.940> build<00:00:39.239> path<00:00:39.450> with

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that that it has a nice build path with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.240 
that that it has a nice build path with
cheap<00:00:39.960> parts<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.500> allows<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> slowly

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
cheap parts that allows you to slowly

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
cheap parts that allows you to slowly
build<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> item<00:00:41.910> overtime<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.989> measly

item is looking pretty good maybe even

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.779 
item is looking pretty good maybe even
overpowered<00:00:48.980> but<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> thing<00:00:50.250> about<00:00:50.370> art<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
overpowered but the thing about art and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
overpowered but the thing about art and
sensor<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.289> high

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
they aren't the main things you want to

they aren't the main things you want to
itemize<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.140> usually<00:01:04.140> you're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> want

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
itemize for usually you're going to want

itemize for usually you're going to want
to<00:01:04.890> invest<00:01:05.070> into<00:01:05.519> some<00:01:05.700> tankiness<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> help

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to invest into some tankiness to help

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.200 
to invest into some tankiness to help
you<00:01:06.659> survive<00:01:06.990> fights<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:07.860> useful

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
you survive fights and be more useful

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.190 
you survive fights and be more useful
there's<00:01:09.210> no<00:01:09.390> question<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> movement

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
there's no question that the movement

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
there's no question that the movement
speed<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.380> also<00:01:10.650> solid<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.280> again<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
speed is also solid but again is it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.219 
speed is also solid but again is it
something<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
something that you really want to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
something that you really want to
itemize<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.670> attack<00:01:14.970> speed<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.360> well<00:01:15.540> as

a weird stat to give to your team as

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.340 
a weird stat to give to your team as
many<00:01:17.820> champions<00:01:18.270> cannot<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:19.080> use<00:01:19.320> of

don't<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.680> benefit<00:01:23.040> from<00:01:23.070> attack<00:01:23.430> speed

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
don't really benefit from attack speed

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
don't really benefit from attack speed
and<00:01:23.970> while<00:01:24.360> many<00:01:24.509> champions<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.200> benefit<00:01:25.619> from

and while many champions do benefit from
attack<00:01:26.040> speed<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.700> might<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.180> always<00:01:27.450> have

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
attack speed you might not always have

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
attack speed you might not always have
those<00:01:27.930> champions<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:28.650> team<00:01:28.799> composition

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
those champions in your team composition

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
those champions in your team composition
that<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.090> benefit<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.570> such<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> stat<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that can benefit from such a stat and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
that can benefit from such a stat and
why<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.549> building<00:01:32.970> art<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.270> sensor<00:01:33.570> be

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
why would building art and sensor be

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.120 
why would building art and sensor be
better<00:01:33.900> than<00:01:34.079> say<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:34.380> item<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.770> zeke's
