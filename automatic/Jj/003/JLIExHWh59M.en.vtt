00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
guitar being very coos - well this

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.570 
guitar being very coos - well this
guitar<00:02:14.960> happens<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.590> salt<00:02:15.860> spruce<00:02:16.310> top

you're just going to be adjusting the

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.240 
you're just going to be adjusting the
volume<00:06:19.629> of<00:06:20.319> the<00:06:20.500> front<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:20.860> pick<00:06:20.979> up<00:06:21.129> with

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
volume of the front and pick up with

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.159 
volume of the front and pick up with
this<00:06:21.430> right<00:06:21.879> here<00:06:22.120> but<00:06:22.360> if<00:06:22.750> you're<00:06:22.960> in<00:06:23.080> the

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169

this right here but if you're in the
middle<00:06:23.379> position<00:06:23.979> and<00:06:25.469> you<00:06:26.469> find<00:06:26.740> some<00:06:27.009> sound

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
middle position and you find some sound

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.100 
middle position and you find some sound
that<00:06:27.460> you<00:06:27.550> like<00:06:27.759> between<00:06:28.120> these<00:06:28.419> two<00:06:28.659> pickups

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
that you like between these two pickups

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.110 
that you like between these two pickups
by<00:06:29.319> just<00:06:29.620> in<00:06:29.770> the<00:06:29.889> upper<00:06:30.280> lower<00:06:30.490> barns<00:06:30.939> of

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
by just in the upper lower barns of

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.480 
by just in the upper lower barns of
these<00:06:31.240> pickups<00:06:31.830> say<00:06:32.830> you<00:06:32.889> find<00:06:33.129> out<00:06:33.280> and<00:06:33.340> tell

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
these pickups say you find out and tell

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.020 
these pickups say you find out and tell
them<00:06:33.639> that<00:06:33.729> you<00:06:33.819> really<00:06:34.000> like<00:06:38.340> now<00:06:39.370> instead<00:06:39.909> of

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
them that you really like now instead of

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.320 
them that you really like now instead of
reaching<00:06:40.180> over<00:06:40.539> here<00:06:40.689> trying<00:06:41.020> to<00:06:41.110> turn<00:06:41.349> those

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
reaching over here trying to turn those

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.939 
reaching over here trying to turn those
you<00:06:43.330> know<00:06:43.479> identically<00:06:44.229> at<00:06:44.349> the<00:06:44.469> same<00:06:44.680> time

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
you know identically at the same time

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.860 
you know identically at the same time
but<00:06:45.039> you<00:06:45.189> physically<00:06:45.819> can't<00:06:46.150> you<00:06:46.539> just<00:06:46.750> reach

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
but you physically can't you just reach

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.159 
but you physically can't you just reach
over<00:06:47.050> your<00:06:47.259> master<00:06:47.650> volume<00:06:48.599> and<00:06:49.599> that<00:06:49.780> lowers

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
over your master volume and that lowers

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.020 
over your master volume and that lowers
both<00:06:50.440> of<00:06:50.620> these<00:06:50.710> volumes<00:06:51.190> equally<00:06:51.849> at<00:06:51.940> the

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
both of these volumes equally at the

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.629 
both of these volumes equally at the
same<00:06:52.270> time<00:06:52.599> so<00:06:52.840> you<00:06:52.930> can<00:06:53.080> continue<00:06:53.530> to<00:06:53.639> keep

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
same time so you can continue to keep

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.550 
same time so you can continue to keep
that<00:06:54.699> tone<00:06:55.360> that<00:06:55.629> you<00:06:55.750> found<00:06:56.020> between<00:06:56.199> these

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
that tone that you found between these

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.290 
that tone that you found between these
pickups<00:06:57.009> and<00:06:57.280> adjusted<00:06:57.759> with<00:06:57.849> the<00:06:57.940> master

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
pickups and adjusted with the master

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.279 
pickups and adjusted with the master
behind<00:06:59.789> as<00:07:00.789> conveniently<00:07:01.629> placed<00:07:01.870> and

behind as conveniently placed and
smaller<00:07:02.740> table<00:07:03.099> so<00:07:03.370> you<00:07:03.460> don't<00:07:03.639> hit<00:07:03.789> your<00:07:03.909> hand

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
smaller table so you don't hit your hand
