00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 welcome and welcome back to this new one 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.890
 episode of this new sky column 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.719
 the history of Japanese animation with 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.030
 this video we open a world that is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.880
 tied to my past with those emotions 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.590
 that I felt as a child when I saw for 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 the first time the animated series 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.330
 mine was a bound interest not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.939
 only to the animated drawing to which one is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.340
 refers to the term of souls but everything 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.090
 that Japanese animation he had 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.720
 a story a development is an evolution 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.430
 unmatched 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 but even more important and we will come to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.010
 knowledge of a culture of a society 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.989
 intricate and fascinating that yes 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.579
 will express that we will see express themselves 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 through their own works by 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.739
 animation and that's why I want 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.399
 share my passion with 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.399
 you all 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.560
 then guys we can introduce 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.809
 this talk saying we can 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.080
 define any technical process that 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.120
 undermines the reproduction of a movement 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.950
 animation this technical process has 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.380
 its history has evolved 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.320
 in all its forms from the one in stop 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.080
 motion to that frame by frame of 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.060
 plasticine puppets where we will see i 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.150
 creators swearing during 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.200
 execution until the animation 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.390
 computerized of our days 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.149
 this process will obviously develop 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.580
 will evolve all over the world but here the 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.590
 Japan will stand out above all for 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.399
 the study of animated drawings that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.440
 generally we call souls and saying 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.720
 this seems right to me to start 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.520
 talk about the origin of this word 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.670
 the term according to most 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.860
 of the sources derives from the word 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.160
 animation transliteration of English 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.289
 of animation while other sources in 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.979
 divide its origin from the French 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.640
 anime or animate but the latter option 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.550
 is seen very forcibly so we 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.080
 we discard anime boys is a term that 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.450
 has only recently entered the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.550
 Japanese vocabulary is before it 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.950
 different words have been used 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.209
 to indicate the animation in them 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.400
 language and we see some deco boxing 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.390
 to this the new notebook of the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.390
 brat scribbles senga league and da 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.670
 in the twenties the word yes 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.300
 will transform into a manga eiga no cup 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.020
 I would kill you like you do 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.090
 or anime comics movie in Japan 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.160
 is a term that you experience a dispute 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.510
 cultural about its use and its 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.489
 meaning 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.410
 we in the common language use 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.770
 this term to group in 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.440
 general every animated work but in 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.020
 Japan is not really like that 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.930
 some currents of thought disprove 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.740
 all defining souls only those 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.780
 forms of commercial production e 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.370
 cinematographic derivative but why 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.510
 this happens 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.849
 many authors right 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.579
 they want to make the difference between the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.640
 their artistic and poetic works ed 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.980
 others that in reality are only 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.930
 commercial and have only one purpose of 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.879
 entertainment you really miss this 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.950
 it happens because japan believes 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.620
 strongly in his expression 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.510
 artistic that he has here in Italy is 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.150
 seen only as a product of 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.489
 mass consumption is only dedicated to a 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.840
 child public but the people who 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.269
 they think so 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.940
 they are very wrong indeed 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.120
 specify that they are not childish but 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.620
 that have origins linked to ours 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.690
 creative childhood 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.299
 the anime is at the origin of the expression 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.170
 of man and the artistic development of the 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.780
 a gesture we used to make when we were children 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.170
 we drew two-dimensional things and 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.989
 colored so it makes no sense to punish 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.019
 manga and anime of something childish 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.209
 in the negative sense then that comes 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.570
 connected to our past so 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.720
 wrong and this wonderful gesture is 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.389
 simple has always made us happy then 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.250
 just shoot shit and break the 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.250
 balls all friends 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.520
 the anime is not to be criticized for his 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.340
 aspect but rather for its content 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.860
 which in the course of its development was 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.599
 divided into sections of public so as to 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.270
 please everyone a bit 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.669
 these works can deal with subjects 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.919
 very different topics and genres of 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.130
 them including science fiction 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.919
 love is content eroticism for 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.010
 children and much more 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.840
 but this episode is all about 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.300

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.639

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.280
