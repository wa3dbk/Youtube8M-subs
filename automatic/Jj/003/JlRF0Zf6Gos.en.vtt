00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.020
 First, outline your motif through a sheet of indigo paper on a thick wooden base. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.460
 Then stain it with acrylic matte paint. 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.820
 Cut all pieces of paper. 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.460
 Draw the pieces on the microporous rubber. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.860
 Cut with scissors for precise cutting. 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.980
 The basis for the print and design are ready. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.100
 Glue the pieces on the bottom of the base with a quick drying glue. 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.420
 Place a pocket of a folder under the textiles you want to decorate. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.060
 Apply textile paint to the stamp using a tamping brush. 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.100
 Let's start with printing. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.700
 Apply a new layer of paint to the print before each use. 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.140
 After about 30 minutes of drying, fix the paint by ironing the textiles with hot iron over baking paper. 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.060
 Make different seals, but be careful with the inscriptions because they have to be mirrored.
