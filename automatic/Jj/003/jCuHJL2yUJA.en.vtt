a<00:01:49.619> pattern<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.579> fabric<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.390> created<00:01:52.020> using

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a pattern on the fabric is created using

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
a pattern on the fabric is created using
wax<00:01:54.020> obviously<00:01:55.020> soaked<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.500> dye<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.840> after

you remove the wax you sort of get this

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.480 
you remove the wax you sort of get this
really<00:02:00.360> beautiful<00:02:00.570> pattern<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.009> fabric

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
really beautiful pattern on the fabric

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
really beautiful pattern on the fabric
and<00:02:03.110> for<00:02:04.110> me<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.320> decided<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.460> stick<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.320> saris

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and for me I decided to stick to saris

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.710 
and for me I decided to stick to saris
because<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.429> tradition<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
because that is the tradition and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.729 
because that is the tradition and
culture<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:11.069> Bangladesh<00:02:11.959> mostly<00:02:12.959> women<00:02:13.380> would

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
culture of Bangladesh mostly women would

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.250 
culture of Bangladesh mostly women would
wear<00:02:13.920> saris<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.760> most<00:02:15.750> occasions<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:17.040> since

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
wear saris on most occasions and since

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.930 
wear saris on most occasions and since
it<00:02:19.260> was<00:02:19.440> spring<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.099> thought<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.640> would<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:20.910> a

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it was spring I thought it would be a
