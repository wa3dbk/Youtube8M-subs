you want to create your own planetary
system<00:00:13.200> how<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.950> do<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.130> where<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.820> you

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
system how do you do it where do you

system how do you do it where do you
start

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
start

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.900 
start
what<00:00:15.630> are<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> rules<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.949> many<00:00:17.220> questions<00:00:17.730> but

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
what are the rules so many questions but

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.540 
what are the rules so many questions but
don't<00:00:18.090> worry<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.660> will<00:00:18.750> all<00:00:18.900> become<00:00:19.380> clear<00:00:19.800> if

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
don't worry it will all become clear if

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.279 
don't worry it will all become clear if
you<00:00:20.699> want<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> build<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.300> planetary<00:00:21.779> system<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
you want to build a planetary system the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.019 
you want to build a planetary system the
first<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.920> most<00:00:23.010> important<00:00:23.580> step<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
first and most important step is to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.939 
first and most important step is to
build<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> star<00:00:24.600> which<00:00:25.170> coincidentally<00:00:25.800> have

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
build a star which coincidentally have

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980 
build a star which coincidentally have
already<00:00:26.189> done<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.640> previous<00:00:26.820> video<00:00:27.180> links

will be on screen and in the description
and<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.300> should<00:00:30.480> check<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> out

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and you really should check it out

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.959 
and you really should check it out
before<00:00:31.050> proceeding<00:00:31.560> otherwise<00:00:32.099> things<00:00:32.579> might

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
before proceeding otherwise things might

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.369 
before proceeding otherwise things might
get<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.420> confusing<00:00:37.969> hey<00:00:38.969> welcome<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
get a bit confusing hey welcome back so

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.840 
get a bit confusing hey welcome back so
now<00:00:40.530> we've<00:00:40.710> built<00:00:40.950> our<00:00:41.070> star<00:00:41.309> let's<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.670> ahead

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
now we've built our star let's go ahead

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.119 
now we've built our star let's go ahead
and<00:00:42.090> place<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.809> map<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.140> step

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and place it on a little map here step

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.090 
and place it on a little map here step
one<00:00:44.399> complete<00:00:45.350> next<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.980> determine

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
one complete next up I have to determine

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.279 
one complete next up I have to determine
my<00:00:47.520> systems<00:00:47.969> inner<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.570> outer<00:00:48.690> boundaries

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
too close to the star and a planet will

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
too close to the star and a planet will
be<00:00:51.899> torn<00:00:52.170> apart<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:52.739> its<00:00:52.890> gravitational<00:00:53.309> force

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
be torn apart by its gravitational force

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.540 
be torn apart by its gravitational force
too<00:00:54.719> far<00:00:55.020> owls<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> stars<00:00:55.920> gravity<00:00:56.219> will

system then stop once I placed all the
orbits<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.840> check<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.290> make<00:03:36.440> sure<00:03:36.650> no<00:03:36.980> two

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
orbits I check to make sure no two

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.030 
orbits I check to make sure no two
orbits<00:03:37.700> are<00:03:37.820> ready<00:03:38.000> not<00:03:38.360> 0.15<00:03:39.230> au<00:03:39.800> of<00:03:39.920> each

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
orbits are ready not 0.15 au of each

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.449

other

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
other

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.180

why<00:03:40.940> because<00:03:41.810> any<00:03:42.019> closer<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.860> orbits

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
why because any closer and the orbits

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.890 
why because any closer and the orbits
will<00:03:43.310> be<00:03:43.400> gravitationally<00:03:44.090> unstable<00:03:44.120> and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
will be gravitationally unstable and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.020 
will be gravitationally unstable and
will<00:03:45.080> decay<00:03:45.470> over<00:03:45.500> time<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.850> that's

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
will decay over time so that's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.090 
will decay over time so that's
essentially<00:03:47.510> our<00:03:47.780> system<00:03:48.230> built<00:03:48.470> note

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
essentially our system built note

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.979 
essentially our system built note
however<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.640> I've<00:03:49.850> left<00:03:50.150> all<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.630> orbits

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
however that I've left all the orbits

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.900 
however that I've left all the orbits
blank<00:03:51.290> I'll<00:03:51.590> fill<00:03:52.010> them<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:52.310> later<00:03:52.550> when<00:03:52.880> I
