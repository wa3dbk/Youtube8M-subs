race just for a try and share a few tips
of<00:00:16.340> view<00:00:16.520> from<00:00:16.820> my<00:00:17.150> experiences<00:00:17.720> of<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.470> round

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
of view from my experiences of the round

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.970 
of view from my experiences of the round
the<00:00:18.740> island<00:00:18.860> race<00:00:20.020> so<00:00:21.020> I<00:00:21.079> think<00:00:21.169> firstly<00:00:21.770> and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
the island race so I think firstly and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.190 
the island race so I think firstly and
probably<00:00:22.250> most<00:00:22.400> importantly<00:00:22.970> is<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:24.050> make

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
probably most importantly is to make

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.959 
probably most importantly is to make
sure<00:00:24.349> that<00:00:24.470> everybody<00:00:24.800> knows<00:00:25.039> their<00:00:25.579> role<00:00:25.759> on

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:25.969 
sure that everybody knows their role on

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:27.700 
sure that everybody knows their role on
board<00:00:26.149> the<00:00:26.239> boat<00:00:26.419> even<00:00:26.719> if<00:00:27.140> that's<00:00:27.259> making<00:00:27.619> a

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
board the boat even if that's making a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.639 
board the boat even if that's making a
tea<00:00:28.210> it's<00:00:29.210> really<00:00:29.509> important<00:00:29.930> that<00:00:30.110> everybody

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
tea it's really important that everybody

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.229 
tea it's really important that everybody
understands<00:00:31.460> where<00:00:31.669> they're<00:00:31.820> supposed<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.090> be

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
understands where they're supposed to be

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.299 
understands where they're supposed to be
on<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.450> boat<00:00:32.660> not<00:00:33.530> only<00:00:33.770> from<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:34.040> performance

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
on the boat not only from a performance

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.950 
on the boat not only from a performance
point<00:00:34.670> of<00:00:34.820> view<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:35.180> also<00:00:35.270> from<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.660> safety

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
point of view but also from a safety

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.200 
point of view but also from a safety
point<00:00:36.230> of<00:00:36.379> view<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.730> making<00:00:38.059> sure<00:00:38.149> you

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
point of view and so making sure you

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.310 
point of view and so making sure you
have<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.360> good<00:00:38.480> briefing<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.050> run<00:00:39.170> through

have a good briefing and run through

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.350 
have a good briefing and run through
that<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:39.770> everybody's<00:00:40.160> happy<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:41.059> obviously

in<00:00:42.260> some<00:00:42.470> ways<00:00:42.620> quite<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:42.860> simple<00:00:43.130> course<00:00:43.460> going

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
in some ways quite a simple course going

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.310 
in some ways quite a simple course going
around<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.000> other<00:00:44.150> white<00:00:44.390> but<00:00:44.630> also<00:00:44.930> there

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
around the other white but also there

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.050 
around the other white but also there
are<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.410> lot<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.680> sand<00:00:45.980> banks<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.520> wrecks<00:00:46.760> and

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
are a lot of sand banks and wrecks and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.569 
are a lot of sand banks and wrecks and
also<00:00:48.020> marks<00:00:48.290> of<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.470> course<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:48.950> really<00:00:49.370> make

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
also marks of the course so really make

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.460 
also marks of the course so really make
sure<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.820> you've<00:00:50.090> gone<00:00:50.270> through<00:00:50.470> the

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
sure that you've gone through the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.020 
sure that you've gone through the
sailing<00:00:51.800> instructions<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:52.489> understand<00:00:52.940> the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
sailing instructions you understand the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.340 
sailing instructions you understand the
course<00:00:53.270> you've<00:00:53.600> got<00:00:53.630> someone<00:00:53.960> on<00:00:54.079> board<00:00:54.260> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
course you've got someone on board the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.540 
course you've got someone on board the
boat<00:00:54.500> who's<00:00:54.860> got<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.220> really<00:00:55.399> good

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
boat who's got a really good

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.130 
boat who's got a really good
understanding<00:00:55.970> of<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.149> navigation<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:56.899> the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
understanding of the navigation and the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.139 
understanding of the navigation and the
course<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.500> get<00:00:57.620> around<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:58.489> starts<00:00:58.910> going

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
course to get around this starts going

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.700 
course to get around this starts going
to<00:00:59.210> be<00:00:59.329> a<00:00:59.540> huge<00:00:59.840> part<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> race<00:01:00.470> and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
to be a huge part of the race and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.500 
to be a huge part of the race and
they're<00:01:00.800> gonna<00:01:01.040> be<00:01:01.190> up<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.430> 18<00:01:01.820> hundred<00:01:01.850> boats

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
they're gonna be up to 18 hundred boats

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.749 
they're gonna be up to 18 hundred boats
approximately<00:01:03.140> out<00:01:03.260> there<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:03.770> it's<00:01:04.699> really

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
approximately out there so it's really

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.609 
approximately out there so it's really
important<00:01:05.299> to<00:01:05.360> try<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.600> get<00:01:05.689> a<00:01:05.720> transit<00:01:06.259> at

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
important to try and get a transit at

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.410 
important to try and get a transit at
such<00:01:06.829> a<00:01:06.860> long<00:01:07.100> line<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.640> I'd<00:01:07.759> be<00:01:07.880> using<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
such a long line so I'd be using the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.840 
such a long line so I'd be using the
transit<00:01:09.259> marks<00:01:09.710> on<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.009> yacht<00:01:10.280> squadron<00:01:10.700> or

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
transit marks on the yacht squadron or

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.459 
transit marks on the yacht squadron or
something<00:01:11.450> on<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.659> mainland<00:01:11.930> Shore<00:01:12.229> which

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
something on the mainland Shore which

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.649 
something on the mainland Shore which
can<00:01:12.619> help<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.890> have<00:01:13.009> a<00:01:13.100> transit<00:01:13.659> very

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
can help you have a transit very

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.450 
can help you have a transit very
important<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.380> maybe<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:15.830> know<00:01:15.950> doing<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.250> few

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
important and maybe you know doing a few

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.920 
important and maybe you know doing a few
practice<00:01:16.880> runs<00:01:17.030> at<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.330> line<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.659> try<00:01:17.780> and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
practice runs at the line to try and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.260 
practice runs at the line to try and
work<00:01:18.020> out<00:01:18.290> your<00:01:18.950> time<00:01:19.220> on<00:01:19.370> distance<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.000> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
work out your time on distance and and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.820 
work out your time on distance and and
how<00:01:20.540> easy<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.229> spot<00:01:21.470> where<00:01:21.650> you're<00:01:21.799> on

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
how easy it is to spot where you're on

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.070 
how easy it is to spot where you're on
the<00:01:22.070> line<00:01:22.250> then<00:01:23.030> after<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:23.450> trying<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.840> find

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
the line then after that trying to find

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.510 
the line then after that trying to find
some<00:01:24.260> space<00:01:24.470> for<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:24.860> many<00:01:24.950> boats<00:01:25.220> around

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
some space for so many boats around

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.539 
some space for so many boats around
course<00:01:26.030> you're<00:01:26.180> racing<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:28.220> know<00:01:28.340> maybe

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
course you're racing but you know maybe

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.520 
course you're racing but you know maybe
as<00:01:28.940> opposed<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.510> normal<00:01:29.810> race<00:01:29.990> maybe<00:01:30.260> just

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
as opposed to a normal race maybe just

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.380 
as opposed to a normal race maybe just
back<00:01:30.680> off<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:30.890> little<00:01:31.070> bit<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.210> long

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
back off a little bit and it's a long

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.850 
back off a little bit and it's a long
course<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:32.900> think<00:01:32.990> you've<00:01:33.260> got<00:01:33.380> plenty<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.650> time

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
course I think you've got plenty of time

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.700 
course I think you've got plenty of time
to<00:01:34.570> find<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.690> right<00:01:35.840> time<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.260> overtake<00:01:36.590> the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
to find the right time to overtake the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.969 
to find the right time to overtake the
other<00:01:36.830> boats<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.340> not<00:01:38.299> get<00:01:38.510> too<00:01:38.720> too<00:01:39.470> keen<00:01:39.740> and

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
other boats and not get too too keen and

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.100 
other boats and not get too too keen and
too<00:01:40.100> close<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.270> tides<00:01:41.540> are<00:01:41.780> going<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:41.960> be<00:01:42.080> a

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
too close the tides are going to be a

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.190 
too close the tides are going to be a
big<00:01:42.320> part<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.890> race<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.280> always<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:44.810> an

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
big part of the race as always as an

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.840 
big part of the race as always as an
element<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.590> risk<00:01:45.770> involved<00:01:46.280> with<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.580> you

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
element of risk involved with that you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.039 
element of risk involved with that you
know<00:01:46.970> how<00:01:47.210> much<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.479> want<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.630> try<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.869> stay

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
know how much you want to try to stay

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.830 
know how much you want to try to stay
out<00:01:48.080> of<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.439> tide<00:01:48.680> or<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.189> tide<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.840> going

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
out of the tide or in the tide and going

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.960 
out of the tide or in the tide and going
in<00:01:50.960> shore<00:01:51.200> or<00:01:51.350> offshore<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.430> again<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:52.759> think

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
in shore or offshore so again I think

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.670 
in shore or offshore so again I think
very<00:01:53.450> important<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.869> have<00:01:53.990> someone<00:01:54.350> on<00:01:54.500> board

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
very important to have someone on board

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.679 
very important to have someone on board
the<00:01:54.770> boat<00:01:54.920> who's<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:56.119> know<00:01:56.210> happy<00:01:56.479> with<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
the boat who's you know happy with the

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.100 
the boat who's you know happy with the
navigation<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.909> maybe<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.630> know

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
navigation and maybe you know

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.840 
navigation and maybe you know
we<00:02:00.650> all<00:02:00.740> want<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.950> push<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:01.340> hard<00:02:01.370> as<00:02:01.580> we<00:02:01.640> can

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
we all want to push it as hard as we can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.430 
we all want to push it as hard as we can
but<00:02:01.910> maybe<00:02:02.210> just<00:02:02.360> step<00:02:02.720> back<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:02.960> bit<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.230> the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
but maybe just step back a bit on the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.520 
but maybe just step back a bit on the
risk<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:05.090> know<00:02:05.210> running<00:02:05.480> aground<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:06.020> never

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
risk you know running aground is never

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.190 
risk you know running aground is never
given<00:02:07.000> some<00:02:08.000> some<00:02:08.270> areas<00:02:08.570> of<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> island<00:02:09.080> it's

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
given some some areas of the island it's

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.470 
given some some areas of the island it's
not<00:02:09.410> too<00:02:09.560> sandy<00:02:09.740> it's<00:02:09.979> more<00:02:10.130> rocky<00:02:10.400> so<00:02:10.820> trying

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
not too sandy it's more rocky so trying

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.450 
not too sandy it's more rocky so trying
to<00:02:11.540> avoid<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.900> if<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.080> can<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:13.160> can<00:02:13.310> be<00:02:13.340> a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
to avoid that if you can it can be a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.010 
to avoid that if you can it can be a
really<00:02:13.670> long<00:02:13.910> race<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.660> know<00:02:14.780> doesn't

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
really long race it you know doesn't

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.210 
really long race it you know doesn't
matter<00:02:15.170> what<00:02:15.290> type<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.620> boat<00:02:15.770> you're<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.070> if

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
matter what type of boat you're in if

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.310 
matter what type of boat you're in if
there's<00:02:16.430> not<00:02:16.550> much<00:02:16.730> wind<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.900> long<00:02:18.050> course

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
there's not much wind it's a long course

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320 
there's not much wind it's a long course
can<00:02:18.530> take<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.740> long<00:02:18.920> time<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.490> make<00:02:20.060> sure<00:02:20.210> you've
