00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.250
 a.ben valley that has not been so far 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.189
 use the lesson he will believe you boxer 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 keep 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:59.020
 invites him to first central network and then the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.020
 passer 0 30 perfect mission 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.759
 there 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.220
 then we give it to reaffirm it this is the way 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.240
 right 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.240
 the new aggressive 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:02:04.490
 out the ritual of greens that is always cautious 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.490
 the led 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:15.610
 losses on the one hand the line widening 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.129
 but then we will have just over 10 thousand and 200 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.129
 points from Monday 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:25.349
 and just to give the idea the third the 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:28.950
 our standard 5650 this at the moment 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.950
 but the gap 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.410
 so much stuff 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.170
 I 'm sorry but it's the only comment 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.170
 can do in front of this exchange 15 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.000
 33 times with the straight 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.709
 we don't like two performances 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:44.220
 and wrong wrong greens that even the top 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.370
 ten that's where he makes the difference 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.500
 I know I did it in Australia by beating tsonga 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:04:06.810
 murray then stopping only in the semifinals 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:04:10.700
 in front of going the ready answer and the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.700
 cider 8 30 fair 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.310
 ladies and gentlemen, the king
