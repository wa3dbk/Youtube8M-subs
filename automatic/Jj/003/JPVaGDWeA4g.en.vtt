there's still hope that we have a

there's still hope that we have a
untethered<00:00:21.900> jailbreak<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.560> iOS<00:00:22.910> 6.1<00:00:23.910> once

untethered jailbreak for iOS 6.1 once

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.380 
untethered jailbreak for iOS 6.1 once
from<00:00:24.570> Apple<00:00:24.990> releases<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:26.029> from<00:00:27.029> our<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
from Apple releases that from our the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
from Apple releases that from our the
reason<00:00:27.720> why<00:00:27.840> he<00:00:28.050> doesn't<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.680> actually

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
reason why he doesn't want to actually

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.580 
reason why he doesn't want to actually
explored<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.449> six-point<00:00:31.109> no<00:00:31.199> point<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
explored the six-point no point to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
explored the six-point no point to
jailbreak<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.390> he

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
jailbreak right now is because if he

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.540 
jailbreak right now is because if he
does<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.410> basically<00:00:34.800> lose<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> jailbreak

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
does we basically lose the jailbreak

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.090 
does we basically lose the jailbreak
forever<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:37.170> once<00:00:37.410> when<00:00:37.559> Apple<00:00:37.829> comes

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
forever because once when Apple comes

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
forever because once when Apple comes
out<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.370> iOS<00:00:38.730> 6.1<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:40.020> will<00:00:40.200> actually

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
out with iOS 6.1 they will actually

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.520 
out with iOS 6.1 they will actually
patch<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.460> kernels<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.750> phone<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
patch the kernels and the phone and you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
patch the kernels and the phone and you
will<00:00:43.710> basically<00:00:44.040> never<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> jailbreak

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
will basically never have a jailbreak

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
will basically never have a jailbreak
again<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.989> stay<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.230> six

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
again you actually have to stay on six

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.049 
again you actually have to stay on six
point<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> point<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
point a point to if you want to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
point a point to if you want to
jailbreak<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
jailbreak from here on out from the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
jailbreak from here on out from the
iphone<00:00:50.430> 5<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> iPad<00:00:50.910> Mini<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
iphone 5 and the iPad Mini so that is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.990 
iphone 5 and the iPad Mini so that is
why<00:00:52.559> he's<00:00:52.829> basically<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.399> releasing<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
why he's basically not releasing it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.139 
why he's basically not releasing it
right<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.300> until<00:00:54.449> Apple<00:00:54.809> releases<00:00:55.110> iOS<00:00:56.149> 6.1

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
right now until Apple releases iOS 6.1

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.840 
right now until Apple releases iOS 6.1
so<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.350> look<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.800> reddit<00:00:59.100> he<00:00:59.730> has
