00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.630 
view the source code of the code of this
website<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.420> view<00:00:34.640> view

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
code for their website that's pretty

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
code for their website that's pretty
great<00:00:45.530> but<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.760> flaws<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.539> there

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
great but there are flaws to that there

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.930 
great but there are flaws to that there
are<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.379> websites<00:00:49.559> where<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
are some websites where if you go to the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
are some websites where if you go to the
website<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:52.820> website<00:00:53.820> immediately<00:00:55.070> closes

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
website that website immediately closes

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.119 
website that website immediately closes
or<00:00:56.280> opens<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.789> pop-up<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.539> does<00:00:58.260> something<00:00:58.710> so

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
or opens a pop-up or does something so

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.349 
or opens a pop-up or does something so
that<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.730> chance<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.239> your

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that you don't have chance in your

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.200 
that you don't have chance in your
browser<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.899> go<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> view<00:01:01.289> source<00:01:02.000> that's<00:01:03.000> why

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
browser to go to view source that's why

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750 
browser to go to view source that's why
we've<00:01:03.420> made<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> second<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.949> we've

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
we've made a second way to do this we've

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
we've made a second way to do this we've
written<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.150> program<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:07.110> pretty<00:01:07.409> simple

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
written a program that's pretty simple

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.609 
written a program that's pretty simple
on<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.369> Mac<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.119> um<00:01:09.420> only<00:01:09.659> runs<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.170> Leopard

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
on your Mac that um only runs on Leopard

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.460 
on your Mac that um only runs on Leopard
I<00:01:10.770> might<00:01:11.159> add<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:12.060> allows<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> view<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I might add that allows you to view the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
I might add that allows you to view the
source<00:01:13.619> code<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> any<00:01:14.070> website<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:15.270> should

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
source code of any website you should

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
source code of any website you should
come<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.049> an<00:01:16.200> application<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
come out with an application like this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.980 
come out with an application like this
for<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> iPhone<00:01:18.720> pretty<00:01:19.140> soon<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.810> can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
for the iPhone pretty soon so we can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.859 
for the iPhone pretty soon so we can
open<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.350> view<00:01:22.740> source<00:01:23.210> which<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> some

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
open up view source which is some

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.940 
open up view source which is some
something<00:01:25.830> we've<00:01:26.189> made<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.200> download<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
something we've made you can download it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.850 
something we've made you can download it
