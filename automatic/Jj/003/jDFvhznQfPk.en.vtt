this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:01.020> review<00:00:01.439> of<00:00:01.469> three<00:00:01.860> different

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
this is a review of three different

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.329 
this is a review of three different
devices<00:00:02.689> made<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.899> waterproof<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.710> note<00:00:05.009> 4

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
devices made to waterproof a note 4

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.589 
devices made to waterproof a note 4
could<00:00:05.970> also<00:00:06.089> be<00:00:06.299> used<00:00:06.480> for<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.250> s4<00:00:08.250> or<00:00:08.490> s6<00:00:09.389> I

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
could also be used for the s4 or s6 I

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.079 
could also be used for the s4 or s6 I
suppose<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.290> size<00:00:10.500> would<00:00:10.679> probably<00:00:11.190> fit<00:00:14.089> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
suppose the size would probably fit the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.510 
suppose the size would probably fit the
variant<00:00:15.420> price<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.750> one's<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.049> 10<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.220> 12

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
variant price this one's about 10 to 12

to 24 this one's only available in China
through<00:00:20.369> order<00:00:21.439> because<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.710> recent

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
through order because it is recent

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.740

technology has a harder side actually
can<00:00:27.900> punch<00:00:28.109> better<00:00:28.289> seal<00:00:30.500> see<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> silicon<00:00:32.009> bead

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
can punch better seal see a silicon bead

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.490 
can punch better seal see a silicon bead
around<00:00:32.340> there<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:33.899> goes<00:00:34.079> all<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.260> way<00:00:34.350> around

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

the<00:00:34.800> only<00:00:34.950> problem<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.809> major

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the only problem with this one major

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.500 
the only problem with this one major
problem<00:00:37.140> crouched<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.510> this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
problem crouched about it is that this

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.049 
problem crouched about it is that this
front<00:00:41.809> plastic<00:00:43.129> material<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> extremely<00:00:44.550> thin

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
front plastic material is extremely thin

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.380 
front plastic material is extremely thin
it's<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.750> um<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.730> stretchy<00:00:47.730> cellophane

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it's it's like um a stretchy cellophane

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.700 
it's it's like um a stretchy cellophane
which<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.410> really<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
which is a really really a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.959 
which is a really really a
disappointment<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.820> made

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
disappointment because if it was made

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.000 
disappointment because if it was made
out<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.510> harder<00:00:51.930> plastic<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
out of a harder plastic like these it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040 
out of a harder plastic like these it
would<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.190> been<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> perfect<00:00:53.640> device<00:00:54.050> does

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
would have been a perfect device does

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.610 
would have been a perfect device does
have<00:00:55.199> clamp<00:00:55.469> seals<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> side<00:00:57.079> I<00:00:58.079> don't

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
have clamp seals on the side I don't

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.750 
have clamp seals on the side I don't
know<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> brand<00:00:58.920> name<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> kind

recent<00:01:02.489> technology<00:01:02.940> comes<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> plastic<00:01:04.140> box

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
recent technology comes in a plastic box

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.000 
recent technology comes in a plastic box
with<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.000> card<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.290> programmer<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
with this card with very programmer so

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.179 
with this card with very programmer so
obviously<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:08.760> China<00:01:10.189> did

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
obviously it was in from China did

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
obviously it was in from China did
different<00:01:11.580> culture<00:01:11.850> alarms<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.540> if

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
different culture alarms and we do if

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
different culture alarms and we do if
you<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> pause<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.250> read<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.790> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you want to pause this and read that so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.940 
you want to pause this and read that so
you<00:01:15.270> laugh<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:18.720> case<00:01:19.020> comes<00:01:19.320> folded<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you laugh this case comes folded in this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
you laugh this case comes folded in this
box<00:01:22.460> problem<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.180> kinks

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
box problem with that is that it kinks

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.210 
box problem with that is that it kinks
the<00:01:24.600> corners<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.110> that's<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> box<00:01:26.009> too

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the corners if that's in the box too

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
the corners if that's in the box too
long<00:01:26.430> may<00:01:26.670> compromise<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> plastic

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
long may compromise the plastic

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
long may compromise the plastic
integrity<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.439> bought<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
integrity I bought this one because I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.550 
integrity I bought this one because I
believe<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> silicone<00:01:31.140> bead<00:01:31.380> that's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
believe this was a silicone bead that's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
believe this was a silicone bead that's
would<00:01:31.920> seal<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> edges<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.790> no<00:01:32.939> better<00:01:33.210> than

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
would seal the edges it's no better than

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.940 
would seal the edges it's no better than
this<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.960> basically<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.380> laminated

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
this one it's basically just laminated

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
this one it's basically just laminated
plastic<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.180> trim<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:36.750> decorative

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
plastic this is a trim that's decorative

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.920 
plastic this is a trim that's decorative
only<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.579> superior<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.450> respect<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
only this is superior in one respect it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
only this is superior in one respect it
has<00:01:39.960> almost<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.710> ziplock<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.400> connection

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
has almost a ziplock like connection

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.190 
has almost a ziplock like connection
right<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.000> which<00:01:42.240> may<00:01:42.420> lock<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> water<00:01:43.020> out

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
right here which may lock the water out

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.190 
right here which may lock the water out
better<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.920> flat<00:01:44.100> plastic<00:01:44.369> inside

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
better this is just flat plastic inside

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
better this is just flat plastic inside
so<00:01:46.200> you'll<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.250> under<00:01:48.000> different

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so you'll see these under different

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.480 
so you'll see these under different
brand<00:01:48.450> names<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> same<00:01:49.409> clamp<00:01:49.740> styles

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
brand names with the same clamp styles

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
brand names with the same clamp styles
they're<00:01:51.270> probably<00:01:51.479> made<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> same

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
they're probably made at the same

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
they're probably made at the same
factory<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.829> would<00:01:53.040> recommend<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.610> type

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
factory so I would recommend this type

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.580 
factory so I would recommend this type
of<00:01:54.210> clamp<00:01:54.420> style<00:01:54.950> or<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.310> case<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:58.320> one

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
of clamp style or this case but this one

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.080 
of clamp style or this case but this one
I<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:58.950> think<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.369> would<00:01:59.460> seal<00:01:59.640> very<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.030> at

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
I don't think it would seal very well at

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
that you have to take it out of the

that you have to take it out of the
rubber<00:02:36.660> Smith<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.620> put<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.860> phone<00:02:38.040> in

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
rubber Smith and just put the phone in

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.740 
rubber Smith and just put the phone in
there<00:02:38.340> which<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.180> why<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> didn't<00:02:39.630> use<00:02:39.720> it

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
there which is why I didn't use it

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.020 
there which is why I didn't use it
because<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.380> thin<00:02:41.160> rubber<00:02:41.430> membrane<00:02:41.670> on

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
because of that thin rubber membrane on

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.120 
because of that thin rubber membrane on
top<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.480> didn't<00:02:42.720> trust<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.920> actually

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
top I didn't trust it what I actually

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.920 
top I didn't trust it what I actually
did<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.760> take<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> plastic<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.570> this

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
did do is take the plastic that this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.800 
did do is take the plastic that this
thing<00:02:46.140> was<00:02:46.260> delivered<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:47.450> sealed<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.570> tape

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
thing was delivered in sealed the tape

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.930 
thing was delivered in sealed the tape
or<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.260> electrical<00:02:49.770> tape<00:02:49.920> high-quality

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
or on it electrical tape high-quality

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.480 
or on it electrical tape high-quality
this<00:02:51.600> cost<00:02:51.840> plastic<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.530> very<00:02:52.710> translucent<00:02:53.100> so

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
this cost plastic is very translucent so

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.760 
this cost plastic is very translucent so
basically<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.420> video<00:02:54.660> worked<00:02:54.900> through<00:02:55.440> here

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
basically the video worked through here

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.700 
basically the video worked through here
and<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.220> case<00:02:56.930> which<00:02:57.930> they'll<00:02:58.470> have

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
and the case which they'll have

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.310 
and the case which they'll have
relatively<00:02:59.310> clear<00:02:59.580> window<00:02:59.880> for<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> match<00:03:01.110> so

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
relatively clear window for the match so

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.460 
relatively clear window for the match so
potato<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:04.220> problem<00:03:05.220> with<00:03:05.400> all<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:07.290> them

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
potato for the problem with all of them

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.840 
potato for the problem with all of them
is<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:12.470> you're<00:03:13.470> risking<00:03:13.650> an<00:03:14.010> expensive<00:03:14.640> fall

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
is that you're risking an expensive fall

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.650 
is that you're risking an expensive fall
of<00:03:15.090> thumb<00:03:15.330> basically<00:03:16.910> for<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> cheap<00:03:18.209> plastic

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
of thumb basically for a cheap plastic

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.930 
of thumb basically for a cheap plastic
seal<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.980> trust<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.850> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
seal and you have to trust in the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.870 
seal and you have to trust in the
integrity<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:22.130> what<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> recommend<00:03:23.730> is

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
integrity of that what I recommend is

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.460 
integrity of that what I recommend is
probably<00:03:24.630> if<00:03:25.140> they<00:03:25.320> do<00:03:25.380> improve<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:26.160> one

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
probably if they do improve this one

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.080 
probably if they do improve this one
with<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> harder<00:03:28.950> plastic<00:03:29.190> front<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.850> didn't

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
with a harder plastic front that didn't

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.590 
with a harder plastic front that didn't
be<00:03:30.180> perfect<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.560> far<00:03:31.770> that's<00:03:31.980> not<00:03:32.040> available<00:03:32.670> I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
be perfect so far that's not available I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.979 
be perfect so far that's not available I
was<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.950> actually<00:03:35.690> take<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.810> rubber

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
was going to actually take the rubber

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.970 
was going to actually take the rubber
sleeve<00:03:37.290> put<00:03:38.220> some<00:03:38.459> high-grade<00:03:38.940> scotch<00:03:39.980> black

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
sleeve put some high-grade scotch black

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.680 
sleeve put some high-grade scotch black
electrical<00:03:41.430> tape<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.910> there<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.360> seal<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
electrical tape in there to seal the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.560 
electrical tape in there to seal the
portholes<00:03:43.550> except<00:03:44.550> for<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.790> Cameron<00:03:45.120> port<00:03:45.450> of

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.080 
portholes except for the Cameron port of
course<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.130> then<00:03:47.130> slip<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.610> inside<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
course and then slip that inside the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.150 
course and then slip that inside the
case<00:03:48.300> so<00:03:48.720> if<00:03:48.840> any<00:03:48.989> water<00:03:49.170> did<00:03:49.470> get<00:03:49.620> inside<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
case so if any water did get inside it

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.740 
case so if any water did get inside it
would<00:03:50.370> be<00:03:50.700> unlikely<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.090> compromise<00:03:51.510> the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
thank you I also got this floating thing

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.000 
thank you I also got this floating thing
which<00:05:18.480> is<00:05:18.750> pretty<00:05:18.990> good<00:05:19.140> for<00:05:19.380> 10<00:05:19.530> bucks<00:05:19.740> the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
which is pretty good for 10 bucks the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.160 
which is pretty good for 10 bucks the
only<00:05:20.160> problem<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.640> this<00:05:20.970> plastic<00:05:21.300> clamp

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
only problem is that this plastic clamp

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.710 
only problem is that this plastic clamp
is<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:22.620> cheap<00:05:22.950> I<00:05:23.250> had<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.000> put<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> ring<00:05:24.360> on<00:05:24.510> there

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
is so cheap I had to put a ring on there

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.560 
is so cheap I had to put a ring on there
and<00:05:24.840> through<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.760> through<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.850> base<00:05:27.060> instead

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
and through the through the base instead

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.940 
and through the through the base instead
because<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.140> didn't<00:05:28.320> trust<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.800> with<00:05:28.920> a

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
because I didn't trust it and with a

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.340 
because I didn't trust it and with a
good<00:05:29.160> quality<00:05:29.640> alligator<00:05:30.330> clip<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:31.050> really

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
good quality alligator clip it really

you're in the water
this<00:05:36.360> one's<00:05:36.540> most<00:05:36.810> likely<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.170> float<00:05:37.380> as<00:05:37.530> well

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
this one's most likely to float as well

didn't want to have this but this I
wouldn't<00:05:42.180> trust<00:05:42.420> the<00:05:42.840> wires<00:05:43.050> fine<00:05:43.380> with<00:05:43.560> the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
wouldn't trust the wires fine with the

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.560 
wouldn't trust the wires fine with the
clamp<00:05:43.920> itself<00:05:44.070> as<00:05:44.340> such<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:44.880> cheap<00:05:45.120> plastic<00:05:45.480> is

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
clamp itself as such so cheap plastic is

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.450 
clamp itself as such so cheap plastic is
dangerous<00:05:45.900> okay<00:05:46.680> hopefully<00:05:46.920> that<00:05:47.190> helps<00:05:47.400> you

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460
