00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 the current I am the km 61 20 is one more 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.050
 video from minecraft and this time we are 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.389
 point 8 to learn a little 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.820
 tutorial because you should already have term 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 nine minutes to triar and we count here 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.800
 same is always for tutorials is always 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.619
 to our typical very beautiful side 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.260
 This time the sun I'm going to teach as she 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.590
 avoided the title on how to block the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.510
 access to a gesture but you by titles 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.540
 Maybe you do not understand the idea. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 Now the idea is you have a boss 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 like this and when they put in the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 I can see if you can open it but is not 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.770
 the command that I'm going to teach the goal 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 Are you explaining but do not force and glue 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.520
 and foaming glue and foaming command is 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.829
 very simple command and this is bar 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.989
 block date because they will not be checked with 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.410
 The block therefore requires information 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 of the block and putting the coordinates in the block 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.240
 in this case or by one above the ordinary 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.189
 block is not because this can only be 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500
 done with boxing calm has been having the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.670
 Careful let's get the boss, no, not this. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 will happen 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 then let's give it a name of walk locke 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.409
 which means or block the boss and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.290
 we have here because the name of the key plate is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.229
 The one that will only allow us is brilliance. 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.320
 chez as essential use ie we 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.939
 We have a plate of our own for April. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.560
 so signing up is not just the ituano 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.479
 that it will allow the opening of the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 head of state stay here I have 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.170
 creative but what difference will it take? 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.500
 extract the same thing here and click on the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:57.600
 Okay, you're going to get the boss. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.649
 Peter, I can because it gives you the sound of a 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.409
 door open 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.060
 but view neighborhood cheste slot so full 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.060
 It's closed. We're not allowed. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.920
 to open however only attention that has 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.229
 quite importantly we taking in 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.430
 to be in this neighborhood 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.870
 Yes, we can 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.549
 from the boss ie we can 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.409
 just get here bank 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.180
 but we do not want that too we 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.829
 we simply want to play 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.659
 so let's do it here too 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.370
 a good match could our miss 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.340
 want to land the hospital and not 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.040
 got to see the movie is we now the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.389
 idea is we can open the boss like 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.329
 It's that we're going to open the boss. 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 we arrived here at na intec it is not seen 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.359
 I already have that matters and few the name 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.129
 that we gave to find so much name was like 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.409
 we write reap just like 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.150
 it was so prominent 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.919
 conan and now if they go to see I do not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.930
 I was able to open with the command is no more 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.959
 get the public in full 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.730
 and who says naim tag says one item so 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.469
 I can try this on intec as ethan 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.780
 any with this are for example as 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:08.040
 robust to join as the robust and you 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 they will see it, so we see the name of the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.359
 Pride will give was also finding here 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.810
 as I do not give you there 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.359
 but the body already gives so much is basically 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.909
 That's what I was showin 'sun and this 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.430
 It could be even more efficient just to 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:32.669
 You can only confirm that 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:35.699
 I'm not joking around until 10 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:39.239
 I can open a lot to this I can not 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:41.549
 open this or not but if I use a 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.729
 item that has the name that the daee in the key 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.599
 I can do very well and the inventory of 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:49.049
 boss 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.750
 That's why I wanted to say now it's just that we 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.449
 here also transports the boss has no 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.099
 foundation but also think of Grandma 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.689
 the edict from the part of it goes 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.750
 leaving there is no chance 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.870
 but the question is this is very funny 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.139
 if you are into playing nobody mold is 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:14.950
 2 Jorge in fashion event because you 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:16.930
 not only can you not go away 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.480
 can not athletes can not participate 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.210
 or thought to expose a magic 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.950
 from there a point and still do not know everything 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.770
 one point but this is not going to 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.720
 earthquake may be here at will not 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.880
 not for 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.810
 and can only understand with the 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.360
 your item 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.700
 so it's a scene that leaves me 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.520
 enthusiastic need to do 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.990
 This is but it's very funny and not only 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.000
 will facilitate the access of the servers 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.000
 because you are in a range 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.919
 have, for example, traffic in a 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.240
 and you are in good condition and we are in my 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.460
 Sergio's sister will not be able to use 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.530
 as a block but I am interested in the cinema of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.350
 cuba for god's work I have as a block 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.300
 they had voice pots connected so and no one 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.490
 More may be your vote only you 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.400
 you can do this and that only the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.020
 people who have this target can and 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.729
 soap in april the boss 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.550
 I think it's pretty funny to do. 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.930
 with which our mind is patton too 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.729
 you know you like it or not is not missing 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.950
 everything is all said this is a little 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.300
 tutorial that is quite a point and 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.880
 just do not forget the points of sale 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.350
 another version 1.8 already know that I am 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.850
 here show 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.400
 despite the map will be even the versions 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.720
 alter and sometimes you have decks and 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.590
 is an important guy because this 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.210
 growth 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.740
 so the small states that will be 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.750
 let your aip 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.669
 let a master zequini tutorial 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.729
 want me to make explanations that 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.220
 They want me to show you how they subscribe. 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.050
 sweat mike subscribe then they did 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.960
 that combination for what is a 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.840
 very beautiful combination very perfect 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.120
 and thanks I like I like 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.950
 of these combinations to and favorite can 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.840
 being not as the main favorite but 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.849
 in this case the favorite while you 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.130
 realize but I'm not going to tire but only 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.320
 Let's stay and the focus now is on 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.150
 farewell and in farewell I tell you 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.039
 God, that's why to whoever is driving. 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.039
 Irons in the next video
