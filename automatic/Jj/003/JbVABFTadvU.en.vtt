00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.330
 I am going to give the fragments of six children and here very important and if 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.590
 you remember altitude and its laws 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.380
 I think everyone knows everything they know because a classic 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.550
 making simple use 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.850
 for example 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.400
 the singles 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.480
 Oyarbide is fun all the personal figure 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.350
 will have to try to treats that deals with treats that deals with maybe 11 hit 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.100
 they are like the prison but he double the tresillo addition legacy 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.220
 then 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.910
 for example and it emits more or proven simple singles na in the country 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.910
 like this 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.310
 until that day 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 we have the lowest b 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.640
 has more 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 newfound 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.120
 the least 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.120
 this leaves in Andalusia but very well given serious voice 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.980
 now we are going to see Carlos Mamani again 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.600
 that exercise p 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.320
 also the success for this for this one 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.820
 but there were also other 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.860
 that is the key 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.050
 in fact afterwards you can make your own melody or phrase 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 for example I do not know if I have is to that phrase electronic voice 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.490
 I'm going anywhere 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.569
 that is, under the river of life 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.700
 but this should not kind is going to be like in mud locker does not work too 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.479
 because as Mao and Diana the easy subject to grasp 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.479
 We are going to go by parties 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.629
 beware of the granddaughter and in flooded street a very important 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.489
 the liver was the legacy allows us to go back to go again is super 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.489
 important linked to having to do it very carefully 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:02:59.579
