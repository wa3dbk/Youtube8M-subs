that they probably got somewhere there I
sell<00:01:54.060> shoes<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.770> he<00:01:55.770> does<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> same<00:01:56.310> exact

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
sell shoes and he does the same exact

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
sell shoes and he does the same exact
thing<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> other<00:01:57.210> arm<00:01:57.479> isn't<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
thing on the other arm isn't that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.520 
thing on the other arm isn't that
amazing

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
amazing

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.200

he's<00:01:58.890> got<00:01:59.069> some<00:01:59.219> paint<00:01:59.429> flaking<00:01:59.729> there<00:02:00.060> but

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
he's got some paint flaking there but

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.450 
he's got some paint flaking there but
that's<00:02:00.359> because<00:02:00.539> this<00:02:01.109> figure<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.590> loose<00:02:01.799> so

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
that's because this figure was loose so

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.059 
that's because this figure was loose so
apparently<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> movie<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.710> our

panel in the end Dracula in the next

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.279 
panel in the end Dracula in the next
hour<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.390> senator

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
I'm huge next to Hugh Jackman but of

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.210 
I'm huge next to Hugh Jackman but of
course<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.989> isn't<00:02:19.319> based<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.799> real<00:02:19.920> Hugh

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
course this isn't based on the real Hugh

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.830 
course this isn't based on the real Hugh
Jackman<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.150> based<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.659> real

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
Jackman this is based on the real

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.929 
Jackman this is based on the real
Wolverine<00:02:22.349> although<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.189> real<00:02:23.340> Wolverine<00:02:23.819> is

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
Wolverine although the real Wolverine is

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.399 
Wolverine although the real Wolverine is
a<00:02:23.970> comic<00:02:24.390> book<00:02:24.420> character<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.079> know<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
a comic book character and I know that

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.110 
a comic book character and I know that
it's<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:25.590> real<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.370> anyways<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.879> get<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
it's not real but anyways you get the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.899 
it's not real but anyways you get the
idea<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.870> first<00:02:28.560> size<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.190> pretty<00:02:29.610> big

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
idea so first size is pretty big

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.699 
idea so first size is pretty big
