honestly<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.670> combination<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:30.380> world

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620

honestly a combination of a world
championship<00:03:31.100> wins<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.610> World<00:03:31.820> Championship

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
championship wins the World Championship

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.880 
championship wins the World Championship
where<00:03:32.480> there's<00:03:32.660> really<00:03:32.810> one<00:03:33.049> true<00:03:33.380> champion

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
where there's really one true champion

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.340 
where there's really one true champion
not<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.100> knight<00:03:34.760> or<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.150> champion<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:35.780> an<00:03:35.900> NHRA

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
not a knight or a champion and an NHRA

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.319 
not a knight or a champion and an NHRA
champion<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:37.190> there's<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.730> lot<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:37.940> things<00:03:38.209> that

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
champion so there's a lot of things that

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.699 
champion so there's a lot of things that
I<00:03:38.390> think<00:03:38.480> would<00:03:38.720> be<00:03:38.870> beneficial<00:03:39.019> for<00:03:39.470> the

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
I think would be beneficial for the

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.280 
I think would be beneficial for the
sport<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.489> happen<00:03:41.180> as<00:03:41.299> time<00:03:41.540> progresses<00:03:41.930> and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
sport to happen as time progresses and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.180 
sport to happen as time progresses and
hopefully<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.769> going<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.160> way<00:03:43.780> he's

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.520 

yes<00:03:51.210> bernstein<00:03:52.210> rose<00:03:52.480> him<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.810> semis<00:03:53.170> i

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
yes bernstein rose him in the semis i

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.110 
yes bernstein rose him in the semis i
let<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:53.920> gave<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.550> he<00:03:54.640> could<00:03:54.850> but

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
let it gave it all that he could but

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.590

made some moves on the car that helped

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:54.709 
made some moves on the car that helped
we<00:06:53.819> were<00:06:53.909> a<00:06:53.939> little<00:06:54.059> worried<00:06:54.299> with<00:06:54.419> all<00:06:54.539> the

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:54.719 
we were a little worried with all the

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.449 
we were a little worried with all the
downtime<00:06:55.169> here<00:06:55.439> the<00:06:55.529> this<00:06:55.949> afternoon<00:06:56.339> it

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:56.459 
downtime here the this afternoon it

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.189 
downtime here the this afternoon it
might<00:06:56.669> hurt<00:06:56.879> it<00:06:57.059> but<00:06:57.119> it<00:06:57.509> didn't<00:06:57.809> it<00:06:57.899> got<00:06:58.019> loose

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
might hurt it but it didn't it got loose

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.499 
might hurt it but it didn't it got loose
again<00:06:58.379> but<00:06:58.769> it<00:06:58.889> still<00:06:59.129> responded<00:07:00.029> and<00:07:00.179> went

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
again but it still responded and went

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:01.759 
again but it still responded and went
down<00:07:00.629> the<00:07:00.749> racetrack<00:07:00.929> and<00:07:01.319> that's<00:07:01.469> what<00:07:01.619> it's

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:01.769 
down the racetrack and that's what it's

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:03.679 
down the racetrack and that's what it's
all<00:07:01.889> about<00:07:01.919> so<00:07:02.189> I<00:07:02.669> think<00:07:03.089> it'll<00:07:03.179> be<00:07:03.329> okay<00:07:03.629> for

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:03.689 
all about so I think it'll be okay for

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.909 
all about so I think it'll be okay for
the<00:07:03.899> rest<00:07:04.019> of<00:07:04.079> the<00:07:04.199> season<00:07:04.349> we'd<00:07:04.559> have<00:07:04.649> to<00:07:04.739> stay

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 
the rest of the season we'd have to stay

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.529 
the rest of the season we'd have to stay
after<00:07:05.099> it<00:07:05.219> now<00:07:05.399> what<00:07:05.819> about<00:07:05.909> the<00:07:06.149> lanes<00:07:06.359> after

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
after it now what about the lanes after

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:08.119 
after it now what about the lanes after
that<00:07:06.779> oil<00:07:06.989> down<00:07:07.109> right<00:07:07.349> before<00:07:07.499> the<00:07:07.679> finals<00:07:08.009> in

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.129 
that oil down right before the finals in

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.529 
that oil down right before the finals in
the<00:07:08.219> right<00:07:08.369> side<00:07:08.579> well<00:07:08.909> there's<00:07:09.269> no<00:07:09.389> doubt

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
the right side well there's no doubt

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.329 
the right side well there's no doubt
about<00:07:09.599> it<00:07:09.869> that<00:07:10.019> the<00:07:10.349> right<00:07:10.709> lane<00:07:10.919> couldn't<00:07:11.249> be

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:11.339 
about it that the right lane couldn't be

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:12.979 
about it that the right lane couldn't be
any<00:07:11.489> better<00:07:11.699> it<00:07:11.969> wasn't<00:07:12.329> the<00:07:12.419> best<00:07:12.629> lane<00:07:12.809> all

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:12.989 
any better it wasn't the best lane all

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:14.329 
any better it wasn't the best lane all
day<00:07:13.169> and<00:07:13.289> I'm<00:07:13.379> sure<00:07:13.559> that<00:07:13.739> didn't<00:07:14.039> help<00:07:14.219> the

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:14.339 
day and I'm sure that didn't help the

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:16.159 
day and I'm sure that didn't help the
situation<00:07:14.549> for<00:07:14.969> Mark<00:07:15.209> and<00:07:15.359> the<00:07:15.779> guys<00:07:15.959> over
