second counts and emergency is it not
going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.200> take<00:02:19.350> longer<00:02:19.740> now<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.400> get<00:02:20.610> those

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
going to take longer now to get those

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.540 
going to take longer now to get those
resources<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.870> where<00:02:22.020> they<00:02:22.170> need<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.380> be

resources to where they need to be

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.380 
resources to where they need to be
everyday<00:02:25.070> stations<00:02:26.070> respond<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.790> calls<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
everyday stations respond on calls and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.110 
everyday stations respond on calls and
other<00:02:28.080> stations<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.130> come<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.820> fill

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
other stations have to come in and fill

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.900 
other stations have to come in and fill
in<00:02:30.270> behind<00:02:30.660> them<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.980> emphasis<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
in behind them so the emphasis on the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.790 
in behind them so the emphasis on the
fact<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.240> fire<00:02:33.690> suppression<00:02:34.290> personnel

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
fact that fire suppression personnel

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.130 
fact that fire suppression personnel
will<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.010> responding<00:02:35.820> from<00:02:36.030> one<00:02:36.390> location<00:02:36.810> or

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
will be responding from one location or

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.670 
will be responding from one location or
another<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.880> not<00:02:38.880> an<00:02:39.090> issue<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.500> takes

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
another is not an issue but it takes

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.380 
another is not an issue but it takes
longer

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
longer

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.050 
longer
well<00:02:42.390> that's<00:02:43.520> conjecture<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.880> takes

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
well that's conjecture that it takes

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.540 
well that's conjecture that it takes
longer<00:02:45.480> because<00:02:45.900> they<00:02:46.320> could<00:02:46.500> be<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.520> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
longer because they could be going on a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.460 
longer because they could be going on a
call<00:02:47.820> anywhere<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.660> any<00:02:48.810> time

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
call anywhere at any time

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.620 
call anywhere at any time
I<00:02:49.500> mean<00:02:49.800> if<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.100> want<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.400> focus<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.390> fact

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
I mean if you want to focus on the fact

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.110 
I mean if you want to focus on the fact
that<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.960> fire<00:02:52.230> suppression<00:02:52.980> personnel<00:02:53.460> will

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
that the fire suppression personnel will

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.040 
that the fire suppression personnel will
not<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.570> sitting<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.470> fire<00:02:55.710> station<00:02:57.050> then

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
not be sitting in the fire station then

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.750 
not be sitting in the fire station then
you<00:02:58.740> could<00:02:58.890> look<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.490> way<00:02:59.700> but

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
you could look at it that way but

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.940 
you could look at it that way but
they're<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.570> always<00:03:01.080> sitting<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.710> fire

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
they're not always sitting in the fire

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.290 
they're not always sitting in the fire
station<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.580> come<00:03:02.820> from<00:03:03.060> different

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
station and come from different

and 13 and Riverdale heights you were

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.750 
and 13 and Riverdale heights you were
moving<00:03:10.410> career<00:03:10.740> staff<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.280> only<00:03:11.490> thing<00:03:11.640> we'll

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
moving career staff the only thing we'll

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.920 
moving career staff the only thing we'll
be<00:03:11.850> there<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.060> volunteers<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.690> they<00:03:12.750> don't

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
be there is volunteers and they don't

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.300 
be there is volunteers and they don't
have<00:03:13.020> much<00:03:13.200> volunteer<00:03:13.620> participation<00:03:13.740> and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
have much volunteer participation and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.010 
have much volunteer participation and
either<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.610> those<00:03:14.700> stations<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.300> think<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.870> can

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
either of those stations I think you can

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.020 
either of those stations I think you can
probably<00:03:16.140> see<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.470> statistics<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> days

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
probably see the statistics on the days

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.310 
probably see the statistics on the days
that<00:03:18.270> you've<00:03:18.390> done<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> rotating<00:03:18.990> closures

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
that you've done the rotating closures

that you've done the rotating closures
they're<00:03:19.650> not<00:03:19.770> getting<00:03:19.980> now<00:03:20.100> right<00:03:20.670> there<00:03:20.970> are
