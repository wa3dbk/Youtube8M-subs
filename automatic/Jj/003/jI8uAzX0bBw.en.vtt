00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
things will still steal a little bit of

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.610 
things will still steal a little bit of
light<00:01:52.479> whether<00:01:52.750> or<00:01:52.900> not<00:01:52.990> it's<00:01:53.200> enough<00:01:53.440> to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
light whether or not it's enough to

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.469 
light whether or not it's enough to
really<00:01:53.830> make<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.190> difference<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.820> will<00:01:55.210> still<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
really make a difference it will still a

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.270 
really make a difference it will still a
little<00:01:55.720> bit<00:01:55.960> but<00:01:56.110> sometimes<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.860> steals<00:01:57.130> a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
little bit but sometimes it steals a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.310 
little bit but sometimes it steals a
whole<00:01:57.490> lot<00:01:57.820> I'm<00:01:58.090> sure<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.900> would<00:01:59.020> have<00:01:59.049> seen

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
whole lot I'm sure you would have seen

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.500 
whole lot I'm sure you would have seen
product<00:01:59.860> photos<00:02:00.190> like<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.610> guy<00:02:00.880> where

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
product photos like this guy where

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.510 
product photos like this guy where
they're<00:02:01.750> showing<00:02:02.110> beautiful<00:02:02.440> detail<00:02:03.159> inside

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
they're showing beautiful detail inside

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.680 
they're showing beautiful detail inside
the<00:02:03.700> lens<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.090> whilst<00:02:04.270> that's<00:02:04.420> nice

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
the lens and whilst that's nice

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.149 
the lens and whilst that's nice
graphically<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.740> show<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:05.979> the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
graphically and to show you the

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.399 
graphically and to show you the
complexity<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.030> lens<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.900> fact<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.259> you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
complexity of the lens the fact that you

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.259 
complexity of the lens the fact that you
can<00:02:08.590> see<00:02:08.860> all<00:02:09.069> of<00:02:09.250> those<00:02:09.369> different<00:02:09.819> lenses

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
can see all of those different lenses

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.649 
can see all of those different lenses
inside<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.230> lens<00:02:11.709> body<00:02:12.099> means<00:02:13.060> that's<00:02:13.480> a

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
inside the lens body means that's a

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.360 
inside the lens body means that's a
reflection<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.379> that's<00:02:14.590> light<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.069> isn't

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
reflection and that's light that isn't

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.039 
reflection and that's light that isn't
passing<00:02:15.879> through<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.269> hitting<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.659> sensor

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
passing through and hitting the sensor

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.320 
passing through and hitting the sensor
so<00:02:17.500> that's<00:02:17.709> loss<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.489> light<00:02:18.790> essentially

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
so that's loss of light essentially

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.180 
so that's loss of light essentially
because<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:19.870> being<00:02:20.019> bounced<00:02:20.530> back<00:02:20.680> at<00:02:20.920> you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
because it's being bounced back at you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.390 
because it's being bounced back at you
ok<00:02:21.879> so<00:02:21.940> even<00:02:22.450> lenses<00:02:23.319> like<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.709> beauty<00:02:24.159> the

a<00:03:28.310> whole<00:03:28.550> bunch<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.970> lenses<00:03:29.150> reviewed<00:03:29.810> there

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
a whole bunch of lenses reviewed there

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.290 
a whole bunch of lenses reviewed there
where<00:03:30.590> they<00:03:30.770> can<00:03:31.040> give<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.640> T<00:03:31.850> value

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
where they can give you the T value

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.090 
where they can give you the T value
that's<00:03:32.510> actually<00:03:33.020> been<00:03:33.230> measured<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:33.860> let<00:03:34.010> me

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
that's actually been measured so let me

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.500 
that's actually been measured so let me
just<00:03:34.220> run<00:03:34.370> through<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.670> couple<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:35.030> ones<00:03:35.240> for

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
just run through a couple of ones for

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.680 
just run through a couple of ones for
you<00:03:35.720> okay<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.709> god<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.280> lens<00:03:37.520> the<00:03:37.760> Nikon<00:03:38.120> 70<00:03:38.540> to

you okay a god of a lens the Nikon 70 to
200<00:03:38.900> F<00:03:39.470> 2.8<00:03:40.209> actually<00:03:41.209> has<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.540> T<00:03:41.870> value<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.440> 3.3

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
200 F 2.8 actually has a T value of 3.3

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.830 
200 F 2.8 actually has a T value of 3.3
so<00:03:43.550> you're<00:03:43.670> losing<00:03:43.970> quite<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.300> bit<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.660> light

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
so you're losing quite a bit of light

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.870 
so you're losing quite a bit of light
going<00:03:45.050> through<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.530> one<00:03:45.740> that's<00:03:46.280> not<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.700> say

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
why those cinema lenses can cost so much

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.519 
why those cinema lenses can cost so much
comparing<00:05:22.069> the<00:05:22.189> canon<00:05:22.550> 85mm<00:05:23.089> f1<00:05:23.929> point<00:05:24.199> to

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529 
comparing the canon 85mm f1 point to

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.769 
comparing the canon 85mm f1 point to
that's<00:05:25.159> two<00:05:25.699> two<00:05:25.969> and<00:05:26.089> a<00:05:26.149> half<00:05:26.300> thousand

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
that's two two and a half thousand

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.089 
that's two two and a half thousand
dollars<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.649> t<00:05:28.329> 1.3<00:05:29.329> is<00:05:29.599> five<00:05:30.529> thousand

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
dollars the t 1.3 is five thousand

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.699 
dollars the t 1.3 is five thousand
dollars<00:05:31.399> so<00:05:31.579> more<00:05:31.849> than<00:05:32.089> double<00:05:32.449> but<00:05:32.839> that's<00:05:33.589> a

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:33.709 
dollars so more than double but that's a

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:37.059 
dollars so more than double but that's a
1.3<00:05:34.279> t<00:05:34.789> and<00:05:35.089> we<00:05:35.269> know<00:05:35.449> that<00:05:35.659> the<00:05:35.869> 1.2<00:05:36.649> actually

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069 
1.3 t and we know that the 1.2 actually

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.709 
1.3 t and we know that the 1.2 actually
has<00:05:37.219> a<00:05:37.249> t<00:05:37.489> of<00:05:37.579> 1.4<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:38.989> it's<00:05:39.379> F<00:05:39.679> number<00:05:40.159> is

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
has a t of 1.4 so it's F number is

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.019 
has a t of 1.4 so it's F number is
significantly<00:05:41.719> bigger<00:05:42.019> than<00:05:42.199> 1.2<00:05:43.069> or<00:05:43.279> the

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
significantly bigger than 1.2 or the

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:45.619 
glass and the way it's been designed

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:47.230 
glass and the way it's been designed
just<00:05:45.919> has<00:05:46.129> a<00:05:46.159> much<00:05:46.279> higher<00:05:46.550> transmission

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
just has a much higher transmission

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.709 
just has a much higher transmission
ratio<00:05:47.869> on<00:05:48.050> top<00:05:48.589> of<00:05:48.769> that<00:05:48.919> they<00:05:49.369> have<00:05:49.399> d<00:05:50.360> clicked

ratio on top of that they have d clicked
apertures<00:05:51.259> so<00:05:51.439> you<00:05:51.529> can<00:05:51.679> smoothly<00:05:52.099> adjust

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
apertures so you can smoothly adjust

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.879 
apertures so you can smoothly adjust
your<00:05:52.819> aperture<00:05:52.939> and<00:05:53.389> a<00:05:53.689> huge<00:05:54.050> throw<00:05:54.559> on<00:05:54.769> the

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
your aperture and a huge throw on the

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.159 
your aperture and a huge throw on the
focus<00:05:55.279> ring<00:05:55.490> so<00:05:55.759> then<00:05:55.969> you<00:05:56.449> can<00:05:56.629> make<00:05:56.899> minor

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
focus ring so then you can make minor

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.559 
focus ring so then you can make minor
adjustments<00:05:57.499> really<00:05:58.219> smoothly<00:05:58.550> in<00:05:58.789> video<00:05:59.089> so

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
adjustments really smoothly in video so

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.600 
adjustments really smoothly in video so
there<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:00.169> go<00:06:00.349> feel<00:06:00.740> free<00:06:00.949> to<00:06:00.979> jump<00:06:01.309> on<00:06:01.459> the

there you go feel free to jump on the
DxO<00:06:02.089> and<00:06:02.300> run<00:06:02.479> through<00:06:02.659> and<00:06:02.839> see<00:06:03.019> what<00:06:03.289> all<00:06:03.469> of

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:03.619 
DxO and run through and see what all of

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:05.319 
DxO and run through and see what all of
your<00:06:03.740> different<00:06:04.069> lenses<00:06:04.429> do<00:06:04.729> in<00:06:04.909> terms<00:06:05.149> of

performance of transmission of light and

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:08.949 
performance of transmission of light and
you<00:06:07.879> may<00:06:07.999> want<00:06:08.149> to<00:06:08.240> keep<00:06:08.389> that<00:06:08.449> in<00:06:08.569> mind<00:06:08.839> if
