solely<00:00:41.280> my<00:00:41.640> opinion<00:00:42.149> my<00:00:42.270> thoughts<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.989> but

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
solely my opinion my thoughts on it but

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.470 
solely my opinion my thoughts on it but
I<00:00:43.980> venture<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> say<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> reason<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.300> haven't

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
I venture to say the reason they haven't

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
I venture to say the reason they haven't
headed<00:00:45.750> south<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.320> because<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> limited

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
headed south is because of the limited

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240 
headed south is because of the limited
snow<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:48.289> don't<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.710> changed<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
snow I don't know if it's changed but I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
snow I don't know if it's changed but I
know<00:00:50.340> years<00:00:50.730> ago<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> few<00:00:51.510> places<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
know years ago there was a few places it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
know years ago there was a few places it
was<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.350> almost<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> ravine<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
was like almost like a ravine so if you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540
