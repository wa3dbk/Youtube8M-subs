00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.500
 well I told you that the weekend had 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.390
 Been to Valencia in Cheste 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.870
 in motorcycle racing the last 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.960
 this year's World Cup 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.410
 and spectacular in the races with 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.990
 rain 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.630
 and sometimes with rain, more often 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.660
 lackluster but the same goes dull 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.490
 that there are spectacular and good topics 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:33.670
 in step with marc marquez 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.900
 he made a mistake on Friday he pushed him a 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.150
 little one who took us off the track 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.430
 in the trainings and they made him leave 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.180
 from the last position, the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.590
 34 or the 35 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.190
 pérez that won that has to give the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.989
 last and you get the first one and me that's 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.880
 out of what had never happened in the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.830
 motorcycling that someone who leaves the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.770
 last great is because it had happened to 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.510
 he somehow again the same 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.510
 motorcycling when you do something 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.610
 that is not in order they sanction you and you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.830
 they put back when you equal and you go to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.630
 leave the first the second the fifth 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.290
 so you made a mistake you have to leave the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.390
 latest 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.220
 that's one is a serious handicap 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.360
 and it had happened to him that in some other 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.270
 occasion they had made him leave the last 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.240
 put and had gone to the podium doing 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.300
 third, this is a carrerón but what 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.250
 did bad marquez on Sunday out of the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.890
 normal his last race on moto2 because 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.950
