00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
hinges but if you're going to do job

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.920 
hinges but if you're going to do job
yourself<00:00:56.850> let's<00:00:57.329> say<00:00:57.449> you're<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> make

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
yourself let's say you're going to make

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.450 
yourself let's say you're going to make
your<00:00:58.140> own<00:00:58.350> door<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> install<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> well<00:01:02.070> then

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
your own door and install it well then

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.329 
your own door and install it well then
you<00:01:02.879> should<00:01:03.420> make<00:01:04.080> sure<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.979> some

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you should make sure that you have some

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
you should make sure that you have some
heavy<00:01:05.640> duty<00:01:06.360> hinges<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.229> some<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> these

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
heavy duty hinges and some of these

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
heavy duty hinges and some of these
hinges<00:01:08.100> might<00:01:08.670> need<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.150> special<00:01:09.630> ordered

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
hinges might need to be special ordered

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
hinges might need to be special ordered
and<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:11.250> would<00:01:11.369> imagine<00:01:11.610> most<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.720> hardware

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and I would imagine most of the hardware

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.740 
and I would imagine most of the hardware
you<00:01:13.380> would<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:14.100> looking<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.390> could<00:01:15.540> find

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you would be looking for you could find

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.170 
you would be looking for you could find
on<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> Internet<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> special<00:01:17.340> order<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
on the Internet and special order it I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.539 
on the Internet and special order it I
just<00:01:18.930> wanted<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.500> throw<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.130> there

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
just wanted to throw that out there

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
just wanted to throw that out there
there<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.240> guy<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> knew<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.259> time<00:01:22.560> who

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
there was a guy I knew one time who

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.080 
there was a guy I knew one time who
installed<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.549> door<00:01:24.830> an<00:01:25.830> extremely<00:01:26.369> heavy<00:01:26.670> door

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
installed a door an extremely heavy door

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
installed a door an extremely heavy door
that<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.900> custom<00:01:28.409> ordered<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.979> very

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that was a custom ordered or very

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.130 
that was a custom ordered or very
expensive<00:01:29.340> door<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.570> fell<00:01:30.780> off<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
expensive door and it fell off the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
expensive door and it fell off the
hinges<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.759> didn't<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
hinges because they they didn't use the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.609 
hinges because they they didn't use the
right<00:01:33.299> hinges<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.409> needed

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
right hinges they really needed

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
right hinges they really needed
something<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.189> mean<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.790> these

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
something I mean if you look at these

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
something I mean if you look at these
doors<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:37.049> back<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> re-watch<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.920> video<00:01:38.159> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
doors go back and re-watch the video you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
doors go back and re-watch the video you
can<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> door<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.259> bulk

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
can actually see that the door the bulk

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.190 
can actually see that the door the bulk
of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.220> door<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.880> basically<00:01:42.360> sitting<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
of the door is basically sitting on the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.490 
of the door is basically sitting on the
bottom<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.770> weight<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> doors<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.500> being

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
bottom the weight of the doors is being

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.999 
bottom the weight of the doors is being
transferred<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.490> bottom<00:01:48.380> hinge<00:01:49.380> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
transferred to the bottom hinge this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.130 
transferred to the bottom hinge this
basically<00:01:50.399> floor<00:01:50.759> mounted<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.840> makes<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
basically floor mounted so that makes a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.090 
basically floor mounted so that makes a
lot<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> sense

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
lot of sense

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.260 
lot of sense
you<00:01:53.399> know<00:01:53.460> you've<00:01:53.579> got<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> bulk<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you know you've got the bulk of the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.959 
you know you've got the bulk of the
weight<00:01:54.450> being<00:01:54.659> transferred<00:01:55.229> down<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.969> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
weight being transferred down to the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
weight being transferred down to the
foundation<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.110> should<00:01:58.320> say<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
foundation you should say or the
