00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.060
 your ex and they only play with you and that 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.799
 If they do not try with you, they saw that 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.730

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.620

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.560

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.720
 normally with a person from the planet 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.090
 boys if they have not outdone their ex not 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.100
 make another fucking boyfriend seriously or be 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.860
 Of course you will not forget about the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.780
 overnight as they say neither in a 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.700
 day they love each other and in one day they forget 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.130
 but what you have is if you have not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.009
 overcome 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.079
 he does not have another point he did not see another 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.829

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.110
 whether they see if there is no hope that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.659
 they are not going to come back ok what they play here 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.189
 is to take some time for you alone as 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.789
 I said it once I put it in a state 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.649
 Take time for you and get to know you more and 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.509
 Knowing well is what you want to know and 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.420
 think that it's actually what you occupy 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.440
 in your life that you really need had 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 to be happy 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.890
 if you really happiness to a 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.959
 person because they remember that it is 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 indispensable happiness is us 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.190
 themselves not next to someone not to the one of 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.959
 the person imagine if you need to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.880
 that person to be happy let me 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.780
 tell you that you are completely screwed 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.250
 Really fucking really I do not know why 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.840
 what do they do 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.670
 you end a relationship and better advice 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.500
 What I am is being alone for a while 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.180
 you know what's going good in me 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.470
 case what happens is that it ended with a 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.120
 person 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.160
 and what I want is to fill the gap that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.580
 He left that person thinking that another 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.410
 person is going to fill it maybe there 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.630
 many people better than you ex and 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.310
 there are some, but it turns out that the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.410
 product does not dwell this was boyfriend not of the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.390
 other people there will be better and much 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.340
 better if there are them but it's not going to 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.970
 fill then is the worst we can 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.630
 do try to fill the gap that we 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.710
 he left a certain person in serious no no what 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.410
 let's fill up with anyone because in 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.970

 handsome that my ex you you you are going to fill me 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.540
 It is clear that this is not the case 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.270
 So many guys are really saved 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.520
 yourselves hurt yourself are accepted from 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.800
 Jos more and now hurt another person 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.750
 remember that in this life everything is 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.010
 pay and everything is returned then if you 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.470
 you are also thanks with treachery 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.200

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.730
 side for you do it for you good ok 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.860
 I'm doing this for myself 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.290
 beat the other bat to the other guy not what 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.390
 I'm going to do it for me but yes but 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.250
 sometimes 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.350
 fate do not see it and then what 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.209
 it happens that everything everything is returned before 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.970
 really if you're not prepared by the 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.970
 relationship well what I do not recommend you not 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130
 it's good to do it is not good to finish 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.530
 with a crazy boyfriend to become another of 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.209
 truth is not not good I say it because what 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010
 I have done and they always turn out to be a failure 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.140
 of relationships are very rare 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.000
 creators are very successful 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.800
 rare but the best thing here is that you finish 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.110
 with your ex give yourself some time for yourself 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.170
 think things mourn him suffer a while 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.080
 a while and then after almost two months 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.640
 without anything of nothing to return to 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.620
 start and now yes look for the person 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.150
 what you need but it's not the most 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.980
 advisable to finish with your mobile or 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.090
 boyfriend basketball because he really does not know 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.100
 overcome the relationship 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.720
 I say you are you still not even you 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.560
 you learn to love you can not love 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.230
 others 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.790
 chaux val ourense and avoid playing with the 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.450
 feeling with the feelings of the 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.180
 Real people that have a dt 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.210
 does a relationship have this super 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.100
 fast after the previous one is very 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.140
 bad really 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.420
 and many problems will be avoided and with 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.420
