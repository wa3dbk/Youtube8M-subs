00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
they're just gonna wreck the rest of the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.410 
they're just gonna wreck the rest of the
base<00:01:12.229> as<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.280> see<00:01:13.400> here<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:13.640> had<00:01:13.880> plenty<00:01:14.240> of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
base as you can see here I had plenty of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.310 
base as you can see here I had plenty of
archers<00:01:14.840> left<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.200> three<00:01:15.410> start<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:16.240> this

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
archers left to three start and this

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.450 
archers left to three start and this
when<00:01:18.320> you're<00:01:18.440> telling<00:01:18.620> house<00:01:18.770> 6<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:19.220> really

when you're telling house 6 it's really

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.420 
when you're telling house 6 it's really
easy<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.000> run<00:01:20.450> over<00:01:20.750> bases<00:01:21.230> and<00:01:21.530> win<00:01:22.130> in

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
easy just to run over bases and win in

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.640 
easy just to run over bases and win in
less<00:01:22.640> than<00:01:22.910> like<00:01:23.120> a<00:01:23.450> minute<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.050> half<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:24.260> as

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
less than like a minute and a half so as

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.170 
less than like a minute and a half so as
you<00:01:24.830> can<00:01:24.920> see<00:01:25.070> here<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.280> won<00:01:25.460> in<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.670> minute<00:01:25.910> in<00:01:26.000> 10

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
you can see here I won in a minute in 10

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.040 
you can see here I won in a minute in 10
seconds<00:01:26.720> three-star<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:28.700> say<00:01:28.880> not<00:01:29.210> greatly

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
seconds three-star you say not greatly

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.780 
seconds three-star you say not greatly
but<00:01:30.290> it's<00:01:30.530> pretty<00:01:30.770> good<00:01:30.890> for<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:31.160> level<00:01:31.340> I'll

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
but it's pretty good for this level I'll

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.120 
but it's pretty good for this level I'll
take<00:01:32.150> anything<00:01:32.390> like<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.860> now<00:01:33.980> we're

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
take anything like that so now we're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.910 
take anything like that so now we're
coming<00:01:34.250> into<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.550> second<00:01:34.910> raid<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:36.650> know<00:01:36.890> a

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
coming into the second raid you know a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.430 
coming into the second raid you know a
little<00:01:37.280> bit<00:01:37.840> first<00:01:38.840> looks<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:39.260> I'm<00:01:39.380> just

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
little bit first looks like I'm just

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.220 
little bit first looks like I'm just
collecting<00:01:39.710> my<00:01:39.950> collectors<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.730> here<00:01:41.000> we<00:01:41.150> are

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
collecting my collectors and here we are

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.200 
collecting my collectors and here we are
so<00:01:42.230> 10<00:01:42.890> miles<00:01:43.070> on<00:01:43.160> outside<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:43.760> of<00:01:43.880> course<00:01:44.090> I'm

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
so 10 miles on outside so of course I'm

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.630 
so 10 miles on outside so of course I'm
gonna<00:01:44.330> secure<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.960> win<00:01:45.200> then<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.280> base<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:46.610> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
gonna secure the win then this base is a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.360 
gonna secure the win then this base is a
little<00:01:46.760> harder<00:01:47.330> more<00:01:47.780> compartments<00:01:48.140> but<00:01:48.710> as

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
little harder more compartments but as

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.980 
little harder more compartments but as
you<00:01:49.580> can<00:01:49.670> see<00:01:49.730> I'm<00:01:50.030> avoiding<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.630> one<00:01:50.810> wizard

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
you can see I'm avoiding that one wizard

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.590 
you can see I'm avoiding that one wizard
tower<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.920> start<00:01:52.190> with<00:01:52.340> because<00:01:52.730> it's<00:01:53.390> pretty

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
tower to start with because it's pretty

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
through the bottom wall and then got all

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.360 
through the bottom wall and then got all
the<00:02:02.750> collectors<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.320> had<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> pretty<00:02:04.010> decent

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
the collectors I had a pretty decent

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.470 
the collectors I had a pretty decent
amount<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.610> loot<00:02:04.730> so<00:02:05.000> now<00:02:05.120> I'm<00:02:05.240> just<00:02:05.360> gonna

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
amount of loot so now I'm just gonna

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.970 
amount of loot so now I'm just gonna
spam<00:02:05.720> all<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.050> rest<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.320> my<00:02:06.380> troops<00:02:06.590> down<00:02:06.740> here

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
spam all the rest of my troops down here

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.219 
spam all the rest of my troops down here
but<00:02:07.580> make<00:02:07.790> their<00:02:08.000> way<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.360> center<00:02:08.509> I'm

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
but make their way to the center I'm

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.530 
but make their way to the center I'm
hoping<00:02:10.129> that<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.519> mortar<00:02:10.819> doesn't<00:02:11.209> take<00:02:11.360> out

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
hoping that the mortar doesn't take out

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.110 
hoping that the mortar doesn't take out
all<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.750> my<00:02:11.959> troops<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.709> then<00:02:13.160> okay<00:02:13.849> that's

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
all of my troops and then okay that's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.550 
all of my troops and then okay that's
why<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.360> placed<00:02:14.629> this<00:02:14.870> heal<00:02:15.080> spell<00:02:15.319> it<00:02:15.440> looks

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
why I placed this heal spell it looks

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.160 
why I placed this heal spell it looks
like<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.459> then<00:02:16.610> since<00:02:17.269> mortars<00:02:17.629> can't<00:02:17.870> want<00:02:18.080> to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
like so then since mortars can't want to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.830 
like so then since mortars can't want to
hit<00:02:18.319> troops<00:02:18.709> at<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.010> level<00:02:19.450> at<00:02:20.450> least<00:02:20.689> these

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
hit troops at this level at least these

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.229 
hit troops at this level at least these
low<00:02:21.049> level<00:02:21.349> mortars<00:02:21.650> though<00:02:22.549> be<00:02:22.700> free<00:02:22.969> to<00:02:23.090> go

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
low level mortars though be free to go

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.070 
low level mortars though be free to go
and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
