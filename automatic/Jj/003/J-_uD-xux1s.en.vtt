there's<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.730> dual-core<00:00:51.480> Intel<00:00:52.440> Atom<00:00:52.559> z2580<00:00:53.520> in

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there's a dual-core Intel Atom z2580 in

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.139 
there's a dual-core Intel Atom z2580 in
here<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.210> running<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.890> 2.0<00:00:55.890> gigahertz<00:00:56.340> so

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here that's running a 2.0 gigahertz so

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
here that's running a 2.0 gigahertz so
it's<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> fast<00:00:57.870> cpu<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:59.190> got<00:00:59.430> two

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it's a fast cpu in there that's got two

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's a fast cpu in there that's got two
gigs<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.030> ram<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> 16<00:01:00.780> gigabytes<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> on-board

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
gigs of ram and 16 gigabytes of on-board

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.549 
gigs of ram and 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.270> running<00:01:03.420> android<00:01:03.960> 4.2

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
storage and it's running android 4.2

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
storage and it's running android 4.2
point2<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.670> let's<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.150> quickly<00:01:06.619> try

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
point2 i think let's just quickly try

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
point2 i think let's just quickly try
and<00:01:07.799> find<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.280> there's<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> settings<00:01:09.540> right

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and find out there's the settings right

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.920 
and find out there's the settings right
there<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.530> check<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.189> about<00:01:11.610> phone<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.780> have

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
there and check out about phone we have

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
there and check out about phone we have
android<00:01:13.350> 4.2<00:01:13.950> point2<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.060> that's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
android 4.2 point2 and here so that's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.080 
android 4.2 point2 and here so that's
jellybean<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.140> most<00:01:16.650> up-to-date<00:01:16.830> version

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
jellybean the most up-to-date version

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
jellybean the most up-to-date version
except<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.450> 4.3<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:19.560> probably

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
except it's not 4.3 but there's probably

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.890 
except it's not 4.3 but there's probably
going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.189> update<00:01:20.460> asus<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.630> really

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
going to be an update asus is not really

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
going to be an update asus is not really
modifying<00:01:22.350> anything<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> interface

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
modifying anything on the interface

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
modifying anything on the interface
itself<00:01:24.360> there's<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.320> couple<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
itself there's just a couple of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
itself there's just a couple of
differences<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.240> design<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
differences on the design of the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
differences on the design of the
settings<00:01:28.500> menu<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.000> device<00:01:30.270> they're

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
settings menu and on this device they're

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
settings menu and on this device they're
actually<00:01:30.780> missing<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> mini<00:01:31.470> apps<00:01:31.680> great

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
actually missing the mini apps great

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
actually missing the mini apps great
which<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> other<00:01:33.030> asus<00:01:33.509> devices

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
which you have on the other asus devices

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.679 
which you have on the other asus devices
where<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> could<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.579> small<00:01:36.000> apps<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.509> top

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
where you could have small apps on top

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.010 
where you could have small apps on top
of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.380> typical<00:01:37.740> android<00:01:38.220> user<00:01:38.579> interface

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
of the typical android user interface

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
of the typical android user interface
performance<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.500> zippy<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.520> can

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
performance is really zippy as you can

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.240 
performance is really zippy as you can
see<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.259> atom<00:01:43.259> graphics<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> actually<00:01:44.100> doing

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
see the atom graphics is actually doing

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.429 
see the atom graphics is actually doing
a<00:01:44.340> pretty<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.579> job<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.149> let's<00:01:46.110> take<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> quick

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
a second and up here we have a flat

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.500 
a second and up here we have a flat
behind<00:02:14.080> which<00:02:14.500> there<00:02:15.220> are<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:15.879> sim<00:02:16.060> card<00:02:16.090> slot

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
and the micro USB port so this is

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.650 
and the micro USB port so this is
actually<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.349> 3g<00:02:20.830> capable<00:02:21.459> device<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.450> it's<00:02:22.569> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
actually a 3g capable device and it's a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.410 
actually a 3g capable device and it's a
full<00:02:22.810> size<00:02:23.080> phone<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:24.280> back<00:02:24.459> there's<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.000> 5

full size phone on the back there's a 5

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.059 
full size phone on the back there's a 5
map<00:02:25.599> it<00:02:25.780> could<00:02:25.900> make<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.079> pixel<00:02:26.410> camera<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.739> think

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
map it could make a pixel camera I think

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.120 
map it could make a pixel camera I think
and<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.760> looks<00:02:28.090> like<00:02:28.239> another<00:02:28.450> mic<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
and this looks like another mic it's the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.039 
and this looks like another mic it's the
back<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.459> all<00:02:30.640> plastic<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.299> got<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:31.569> glossy

flickering<00:02:32.799> busy<00:02:33.640> finish<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.780> attracts<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.709> lot

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
flickering busy finish it attracts a lot

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.250 
flickering busy finish it attracts a lot
of<00:02:36.040> fingerprints<00:02:36.670> but<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:36.970> feels<00:02:37.150> sturdy<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of fingerprints but it feels sturdy the

of fingerprints but it feels sturdy the
price<00:02:38.530> point<00:02:38.769> should<00:02:39.010> be<00:02:39.069> pretty<00:02:39.610> cheap

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
price point should be pretty cheap

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.059 
price point should be pretty cheap

Note<00:03:51.690> what<00:03:52.690> else<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.930> there<00:03:54.299> asus<00:03:55.299> is<00:03:55.450> actually

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
Note what else is there asus is actually

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.259 
Note what else is there asus is actually

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
this in the worldwide market so it

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.890 
this in the worldwide market so it
