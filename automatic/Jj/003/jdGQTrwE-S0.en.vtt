00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.870 
wheels and I did a little bit more
looking<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:04.209> what<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.390> heck<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:06.880> this

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
looking to what the heck you know this

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.410 
looking to what the heck you know this
one<00:03:08.090> came<00:03:08.329> in<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.630> set<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.970> think<00:03:11.209> that's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
one came in the set and I think that's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.400 
one came in the set and I think that's
you<00:03:12.230> know<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:12.500> pretty<00:03:12.739> plain<00:03:12.980> vanilla<00:03:13.940> with

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
you know it's pretty plain vanilla with

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.710 
you know it's pretty plain vanilla with
basically<00:03:15.410> just<00:03:15.739> white<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.390> kind<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:17.690> it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
basically just white I kind of like it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.390 
basically just white I kind of like it
though<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:19.040> think<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.180> FBI<00:03:20.360> version<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.500> pretty

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
though I think the FBI version is pretty

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.930 
though I think the FBI version is pretty
cool<00:03:23.200> so

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.000 

here<00:03:27.940> we<00:03:28.150> go<00:03:28.360> we<00:03:28.870> have<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.260> green<00:03:29.470> machine<00:03:29.680> of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
here we go we have the green machine of

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
here we go we have the green machine of
that<00:03:30.190> one<00:03:30.370> too<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.700> might<00:03:33.910> think<00:03:33.940> yeah

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
that one too and you might think yeah

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.460 
that one too and you might think yeah
nothing<00:03:37.030> too<00:03:37.180> special<00:03:37.540> about<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.020> one<00:03:38.260> but<00:03:38.739> I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
nothing too special about that one but I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.330 
nothing too special about that one but I
kind<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.590> thought<00:03:41.739> there<00:03:41.980> was<00:03:43.350> because<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:48.100> is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
kind of thought there was because it is

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.949 
kind of thought there was because it is
serial<00:03:49.270> number<00:03:49.690> one<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.580> first<00:03:52.269> one<00:03:52.600> of

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
serial number one it is the first one of

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.070 
serial number one it is the first one of
its<00:03:53.830> kind<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:58.239> there<00:03:58.450> can<00:03:58.630> only<00:03:58.720> be<00:03:58.900> one

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
its kind so and there can only be one

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.390 
its kind so and there can only be one
number<00:03:59.620> one<00:03:59.860> of<00:04:00.069> course<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.709> had<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.220> pick

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
number one of course so I had to pick

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.539 
number one of course so I had to pick
that<00:04:03.580> up<00:04:04.350> gonna<00:04:05.350> pass<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.830> one<00:04:06.040> by<00:04:06.220> how<00:04:06.489> many

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
that up gonna pass that one by how many

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.940 
that up gonna pass that one by how many
times<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.269> get<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.080> number<00:04:08.290> one<00:04:08.680> edition

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
times can you get a number one edition

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.130 
times can you get a number one edition
you<00:04:11.950> look<00:04:12.190> at<00:04:12.400> all<00:04:13.090> your<00:04:13.269> treasure<00:04:13.540> hunts<00:04:13.989> out

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
you look at all your treasure hunts out

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.319 
you look at all your treasure hunts out
there<00:04:14.440> for<00:04:14.799> hot<00:04:14.980> wheels<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.970> your<00:04:16.180> white

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
there for hot wheels and your white

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.190 
there for hot wheels and your white
lightning<00:04:16.630> cars<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.829> about<00:04:18.820> 15<00:04:19.479> 20<00:04:19.900> years<00:04:20.139> ago

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
lightning cars and about 15 20 years ago

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.490 
lightning cars and about 15 20 years ago
the<00:04:20.590> white<00:04:20.769> lightning<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.370> actually<00:04:21.880> used<00:04:22.120> to

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
the white lightning is actually used to

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.310 
the white lightning is actually used to
each<00:04:23.500> get<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> serial<00:04:24.310> number<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:26.020> could

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
each get a serial number so you could

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.129 
each get a serial number so you could
have<00:04:26.560> rear<00:04:27.070> white<00:04:27.280> lightnings<00:04:27.930> which<00:04:28.930> was

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
have rear white lightnings which was

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.320 
have rear white lightnings which was
pretty<00:04:29.350> cool<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:30.580> they<00:04:30.820> don't<00:04:31.030> do<00:04:31.180> that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
pretty cool but they don't do that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.490 
pretty cool but they don't do that
anymore<00:04:32.370> as<00:04:33.370> far<00:04:33.460> as<00:04:33.729> I<00:04:33.850> know<00:04:33.910> it's<00:04:34.320> just<00:04:35.320> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
anymore as far as I know it's just the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.409 
anymore as far as I know it's just the
green<00:04:35.710> light<00:04:35.950> products<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.700> do<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.030> serial

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
green light products that do the serial

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.860 
green light products that do the serial
numbers<00:04:37.780> on<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.050> basis<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.530> cars<00:04:38.890> right<00:04:39.010> now

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
numbers on the basis of cars right now

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.050 
numbers on the basis of cars right now
so

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.080 

that<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.620> my<00:04:47.620> green<00:04:47.980> light<00:04:48.010> green<00:04:48.520> machine

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
that is my green light green machine

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.640 
that is my green light green machine

more chat the Tim box up if I can find

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.750 
more chat the Tim box up if I can find
them<00:05:10.140> they're<00:05:11.140> not<00:05:11.290> that<00:05:11.500> easy<00:05:11.710> to<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.520> find

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
them they're not that easy to to find

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.580 
them they're not that easy to to find
anywhere<00:05:13.240> but<00:05:14.040> get<00:05:15.040> three<00:05:15.310> of<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.520> ten<00:05:16.590> that'd

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
anywhere but get three of the ten that'd

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.800 
anywhere but get three of the ten that'd
be<00:05:17.800> pretty<00:05:18.340> insane<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.090> fill<00:05:19.270> up<00:05:19.420> the<00:05:19.630> whole

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
be pretty insane to fill up the whole

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.060 
be pretty insane to fill up the whole
set<00:05:20.670> would<00:05:21.670> be<00:05:21.700> about<00:05:23.220> one<00:05:24.220> of<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.430> kind<00:05:24.670> box<00:05:24.970> I

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
set would be about one of a kind box I

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.380 
set would be about one of a kind box I
don't<00:05:27.070> think<00:05:27.280> there's<00:05:27.460> too<00:05:27.700> many<00:05:27.820> collectors

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
don't think there's too many collectors
