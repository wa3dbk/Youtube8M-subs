00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.500
 combination also complementary colors 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.829
 gta online 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.230
 the next paint is done with a little 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.690
 glitch hair us to call in to 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.370
 your car go in the main coloring 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
 colors and go to matte there 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.730
 buy navy blue and unfortunately 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.379
 we can not impose it 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.180
 mother of pearl but as I said with 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.310
 using a little buckwheat to do it 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.619
 for this we can go in metallic 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.140
 I scroll through a little list of colors and after 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.270
 what are we leaving from metallica and from painting and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.009
 choose the numbers you buy absolutely 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.259
 any random number is the main thing that was himself 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.060
 fact and the fact that you buy a new number 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.070
 skid go in color choose 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080
 primary colors and go in pearl 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.330
 and in this way we can impose on 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.640
 frosted pearl well and in nacre 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.409
 choose the color orange and buy it 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.030
 and how I think it came out 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.030
 very interesting and fun 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.960
 well, the last paint on me today 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.000
 often condemn that i will show only bright 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.890
 colors and the fact that my releases are no more 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.360
 calmly classic colors but 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.830

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.540
 cool paint just for those people 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.940

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.850

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.130

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.310
 again go paint and go to 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.730
