slow so all that's happening on that
side<00:04:29.270> travel<00:04:29.780> step<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.980> take<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.580> leg

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
side travel step is you take the leg

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.810 
side travel step is you take the leg
this<00:04:32.720> in<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:32.990> direction<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:33.470> want<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.680> go<00:04:33.860> and

foot so you can start the basic again so
you<00:04:49.790> can<00:04:50.000> do<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.270> side<00:04:50.450> travel<00:04:50.870> step<00:04:51.080> with<00:04:51.230> no

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
you can do the side travel step with no

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.790 
you can do the side travel step with no

so I just three basics and then I could
do<00:05:52.130> a<00:05:52.160> grapevine<00:05:52.900> consisting<00:05:53.900> of<00:05:53.960> four<00:05:54.320> kliks

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
do a grapevine consisting of four kliks

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.640 
do a grapevine consisting of four kliks
that's<00:05:55.550> kind<00:05:55.790> of<00:05:55.850> fun<00:05:56.030> now<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:56.990> stuff<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:57.530> I

those<00:06:38.960> were<00:06:39.170> 90<00:06:39.440> degree<00:06:39.740> pivots<00:06:41.440> so<00:06:42.440> when

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
those were 90 degree pivots so when

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.580 
those were 90 degree pivots so when
you're<00:06:43.070> on<00:06:43.300> the<00:06:44.300> third<00:06:44.570> step<00:06:44.930> of<00:06:45.230> your<00:06:45.380> side

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
you're on the third step of your side

show you what it looks like when you

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.370 
show you what it looks like when you
turn<00:06:51.680> 180<00:06:52.310> degrees<00:06:53.950> so<00:06:54.950> a<00:06:54.980> one<00:06:55.370> of<00:06:55.490> my<00:06:55.640> routines

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
turn 180 degrees so a one of my routines

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.920 
turn 180 degrees so a one of my routines
we<00:06:57.380> do<00:06:57.560> this<00:06:57.680> we<00:06:57.950> go<00:06:58.070> three<00:06:59.000> day<00:06:59.210> six<00:06:59.540> and<00:07:01.930> then

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
we do this we go three day six and then

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.880 
we do this we go three day six and then
instead<00:07:03.710> of<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:03.950> side<00:07:04.160> Travel<00:07:04.640> is<00:07:04.790> just<00:07:04.970> pivot

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
instead of the side Travel is just pivot

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.190 
instead of the side Travel is just pivot
okay<00:07:06.890> and<00:07:07.310> then<00:07:07.550> we<00:07:07.730> do<00:07:07.940> the<00:07:08.390> side<00:07:08.600> travel<00:07:08.990> and

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200 
okay and then we do the side travel and

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.140 
okay and then we do the side travel and
it's<00:07:10.010> going<00:07:10.220> to<00:07:10.280> be<00:07:10.430> left<00:07:11.360> right<00:07:12.230> left<00:07:13.150> and

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
it's going to be left right left and

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.840 
it's going to be left right left and
then<00:07:14.450> I<00:07:14.480> go<00:07:14.840> basic<00:07:15.670> basic<00:07:16.930> basic<00:07:17.930> basic<00:07:18.850> pivot

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
then I go basic basic basic basic pivot

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.250 
then I go basic basic basic basic pivot

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750 
you need to practice just turning when

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.450 
you need to practice just turning when
you're<00:07:44.870> standing<00:07:45.350> on<00:07:45.440> only<00:07:45.740> your<00:07:45.920> right<00:07:46.130> foot
