00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.739
 negotiation that I did for things that 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.329

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.540
 true was true 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.060
 during the time he remained in prison 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.160
 Marcelo managed to escape nine times from the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.569
 more different prisons and 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.340
 penitentiary 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.709
 the last time he was recaptured 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.840
 decided to serve the sentence of four years and 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.389
 11 months locked in here 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.980

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.410
 structure outside here look at 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.449
 I feel great relief because it was 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.070
 a phase that I had to go through here 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.070
 is my debt to society 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.360
 The man who applied blows tries to 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.000
 to issue a new letter to the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.520

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.560
 his new book written in prison and not 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.750
 it would be possible to end up clear without hearing 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.090
 the most famous victim of marcelo 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.630
 the amaury junior presenter mine 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.630
 conclusion is as follows that if the head 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.580
 and was directed towards the good 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.460
 he would be a great entrepreneur and 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.150
 that he wanted to grow very ingenious 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.729
 and if you have not yet corrected the 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.800
 Prison he printed can be sure 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.490
 he's going to get some of it going 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.490
 I do not know how
