that we felt that notre dame's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.910 
that we felt that notre dame's
effort<00:03:17.700> could<00:03:18.600> have<00:03:18.720> been<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> lot<00:03:19.200> better<00:03:19.260> than

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
effort could have been a lot better than

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.949 
effort could have been a lot better than
what<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.250> was<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.180> wasn't<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.720> same

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
what it was and that it wasn't the same

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.530 
what it was and that it wasn't the same
team<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.470> we've<00:03:22.590> been<00:03:22.770> seeing<00:03:23.040> all<00:03:24.000> season

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
team that we've been seeing all season

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.420 
team that we've been seeing all season
long<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.900> know<00:03:24.990> making<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.380> big<00:03:25.650> plays<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
long you know making the big plays and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.270 
long you know making the big plays and
the<00:03:26.760> goaline<00:03:27.090> stands<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.959> we<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.100> were

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
the goaline stands all that we just were

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.440 
the goaline stands all that we just were
so<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.520> just<00:03:29.670> thought<00:03:29.820> their<00:03:30.030> effort<00:03:30.330> could

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
so we just thought their effort could

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.790 
so we just thought their effort could
have<00:03:30.570> been<00:03:30.690> better<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.230> wasn't<00:03:31.410> up<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.680> par

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
have been better and it wasn't up to par

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.260 
have been better and it wasn't up to par
with<00:03:32.190> where<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.580> thought<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.060> should<00:03:33.090> have

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
with where we thought it should have

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
with where we thought it should have
been<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:34.350> by<00:03:34.500> no<00:03:34.560> means<00:03:35.150> by<00:03:36.150> no<00:03:36.209> means<00:03:36.900> were<00:03:37.140> we

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
been but by no means by no means were we

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.370 
been but by no means by no means were we
saying<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:38.220> Alabama<00:03:38.760> didn't<00:03:39.720> steamroll<00:03:40.260> us

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380
