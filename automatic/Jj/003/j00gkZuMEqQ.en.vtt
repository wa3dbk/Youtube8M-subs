00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.900
 friends here you have me to introduce you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.330
 the biggest rabbit in the world with ipic 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.630
 and here you have it but we have a small 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 problem is that not yet have a name you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.570
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the great 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.550
 difference between rabbits 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.349
 giants and the normal rabbits that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 you are used to seeing this in 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.450
 particular is the largest of all 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.329
 that we have and it is spectacular 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 already won two contests and we have you 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.199
 as daddy and player because they are very 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 recommendable as the video will last 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.429
 You can see a little that the little boy does not 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.519
 for is always around for 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:56.159
 up and down the rabbits have a 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.140
 pretty active behavior without 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.840
 But these big rabbits are 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.940
 very quiet 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.890
 and apart from being calmer than more 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.890
 things you can put harnesses even 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.159
 We use harness fixes for dogs 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 you can go for a walk are ideal for children 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.390
 because his character is very very very very 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 meek but something happens to us and it is that 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:27.050
 we have a name so guys 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.050
 helpers that we're going to do a christening 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.550
 d 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.860
 girls what name have you thought for 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.270
 that we put this big man and not 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 I think we're going to stay with dino 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.549
 What is left to him like that better than I think 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.119
 it's a dinosaur come on we're left with 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.340
 dino then here we have fresh wine 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 baptized and we are going to talk to you a bit about 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 feeding are animals that 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.060
 they need feed 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.340
 at the beginning rich in calcium 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.710
 Unlike their younger siblings 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.959
 because the growth they have over 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.959
 everything until the first six months is 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.030
 quite intense after six 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.880
 months it is true that they need 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.440
 very fibrous feeds that exceed 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.840
 20 percent of citron because it's a 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.819
 intestinal tract is excessively long 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.680
 as I said is an animal that goes 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.230
 superbly for children are 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.780
 extremely calm with the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.220
 exception that we have to have a 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.410
 very big space because we 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.569
 You daddy think that you can not get in 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.870
 a cage of a normal rabbit 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.970
 where would you put it and know 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.099
 in a box in a box 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:47.959
 and in a box how will you see 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:49.340
 and how would it be in your good garden 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.060
 you have to be careful with dogs that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.500
 yes it is true but it is an ideal rabbit 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.500
 also to have with dogs is that the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.090
 dogs usually hunt rabbits 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.769
 you have to be very careful it depends on the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.019
 type of dog but yes it is true that 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.280
 the more nervous an animal is if they see 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.480
 this little cool guy running around 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.519
 they immediately throw themselves at him 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.680
 rabbits that are calmer not 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.500
 they develop both the hunting instinct 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.420
 they have big dogs so 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.849
 good is within the types of 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.609
 rabbits the ideal to be able to have 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.470
 together with a puppy and little more than 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.780
 tell you the space already as we said 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.430
 or a lot of food too more 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.769
 food than a normal rabbit and more 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.200
 space than a normal rabbit so they 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.200
 we say goodbye to our galician friends
