00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.430
 hello i am five years m today we are going to look at a long awaited one 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.430
 system camera from know the core to the eos m 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.720
 in the box, of course, the acquaintances find a recent self 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.090
 a the rating 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.529
 a this turned out to be 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.759
 a paper loader 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.970
 with a mustache an intent flash in this case the speed seems 90 x 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.689
 carrying case for the flash 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.289
 and the case of this kit and the 18 to 55 millimeters thick 50 65 scm human 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.860
 if we take a closer look at a ball to see who is at the top 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.830
 of course, the release button 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.659
 a switch one can choose between the plus 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.159
 other exposure prodigy and the film mode and in addition the on / off switch 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.050
 to sit 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.250
 a fully-fledged option so that you can mount this on the poster 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.760
 heart soak stereo microphones 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 on the back we have a bad luck on it 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.960
 a play button 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.570
 a the now key we have here in command dial with various function keys 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.560
 one in it is true 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.940
 then here next to the three inspexx friends display 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.950
 when he is again in the microphone jack on the left side of the camera 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.160
 houses that connection nsb connection are then under the cover of course 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.830
 at the bottom rotterdam 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.920
 a tripod connection and a flap including the apple memory card 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.450
 be hidden 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.020
 and then in front of the device is now fourth natural gas lamp 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.710
 and if we pick it up, we have the 18 megapixels here 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 british english kp7 image sensor 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.340
 leersum can be seen as one of the 6 5 2 in a compact stevens that is known as 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.700
 you 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.020
 she knows each other's image quality and technology because the honor is available 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.320
 namely also the same time finance tss 50 3 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.080
 the home race capacitive in the city sensitivity similar to it 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.530
 advice from martens, for example, to browse a photo 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.640
 then you can easily so it seems 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.470
 to go around the photos 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.879
 and to zoom in 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.609
 you can pintje and then scroll again according to easy 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.840
 the grinding, however, did not whistle nicely yet because when I use the heads 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.049
 go back and forth then you see that the departments would skip 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.619
 and if that's the corner 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:25.559
 with sharpening then from now on image clearings and then that of te 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.009
 report making bigger or wanted to make and maybe that is something that may still come 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.899
 fiction in the future with a point that did 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:33.800
 set it up late 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.409
 it also goes very zoë poll 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.980
 went with the pope as you can easily close time and aperture below 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.519
 it is a true setting you tap what you want to change 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.359
 you fit 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.139
 similarly easy to 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.969
 press the shutter button halfway once 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.930
 did it work again to come back in the abrasion mode you read from it 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:03:00.069
 you can easily change too light, modes are moderate here 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.069
 you don't end up in the trainer yet 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.169
 we also have a quick menu in the display 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.599
 and you can do things like out of mode with balance or, for example, the quality of 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.809
 the photo adjust the things that you do not need immediately during shooting 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.480
 below left we also see a small book about the tax shelter 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.650
 is at this moment he is off and now he is on that is the focus that means 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.209
 that if i nac a point on a screen he point it on 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.349
 will continue to follow according to the and that point and that is very handy for that 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.919
 moving objects 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.919
 if I turn one on 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.050
 this is how it turns on if all points touch protected it will focus on that point 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.839
 and take a photo right away 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.709
 if it dives into a minimal yellow edition, then you actually see just one 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.599
 know standard now it really is a whole range and in this menu 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.019
 you can adjust seven graffel settings that you are in the top I do not now 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.389
 can adjust and camera settings 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.569
 like the Polish road users on the mind of your memory cards 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.919
 all is not happening in this now but most can just happen in rhythm 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.790
 Don't shoot through the press friend and that just works 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.129
 really super efficient 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.159
 we are going to look in one direction 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.829
 test photos of the pronunciation according to this room to see here we choose on 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.829
 800 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.779
 is every sixteen hundred 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.539
 they are also two in the top 100 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.919
 is at 64 100 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.090
 a 12,000 800 pistol and kept it usable among the high iso values ​​sinners 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.680
 photos in between 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.190
 at the moment look after a short test video what has been taken with the century 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.800
 and then we see too 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.559
 very good that the autofocus the pilots 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.559
 works very well 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.940
 I miss a second instable and / or mobile osn to set myself to size as possible 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.520
 to make 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.750
 In addition, the auto focus is acceptable but not about getting home 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.479
 to write 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.849
 Tasking gives you easy and intuitive operation 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.089
 the image quality is very high and comparable to that of acquaintances 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:11.570
 SLR cameras 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.810
 and with the optional adapter you can also just read the honor and you vs on the 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.090
 ankles and assembling and reading can simply focus on hell 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.290
 with the eat and drink and last but not least the large manufacturers system camera out 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.660
 and they have released a camera that knows how to hold its own in one 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.760
 market where other manufacturers have already found their place, he is 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.870
 so not very good that is what you can order from us we think I have 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.330
 many points on point b I thanked for looking and see you next time
