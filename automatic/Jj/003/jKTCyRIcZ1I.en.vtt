second tip is to make grocery shopping a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
second tip is to make grocery shopping a
very<00:00:35.940> regular<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> same

very regular thing you do at the same

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.340 
very regular thing you do at the same
time<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.030> every<00:00:39.270> week<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.809> if<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.200> go

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
time just about every week so if you go

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
time just about every week so if you go
you<00:00:40.800> know<00:00:40.920> Monday's<00:00:41.309> go<00:00:41.610> every<00:00:41.850> Monday<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.360> go

you know Monday's go every Monday I go
every<00:00:43.020> Sunday<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.040> usually<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
every Sunday because it's usually the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.920 
every Sunday because it's usually the
start<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:44.940> week<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.480> usually<00:00:45.629> pretty
