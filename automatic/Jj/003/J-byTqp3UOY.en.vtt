00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.339
 very but very good morning to all such 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.519
 as we promised in today's video 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.379
 we will be seeing a hidden menu for 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.719
 the last motorola devices 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.099
 generation that allows us to make a 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.660
 testing of quality and 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.550
 operation of all components 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.550
 from the phone we go right to the video 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.680
 well we are with the device 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.940
 we are going to show you the menu from which 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.880
 speak grams 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.250
 let's enter the phone we're going to 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.360
 mark asterisk numeral asterisk 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.910
 numeral 2 4 8 6 asterisk numeral 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.250
 numeraries asterisk in some countries 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.660
 we know they call 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.030
 pad but good 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.250
 are going to have below in the description by 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.270
 the doubts we have three options in this 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.480
 in this first menu to perform the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.690
 test of the phone itself that are 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.780
 phone quality test the first 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.589
 will give us access 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.259
 to the different categories 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.320
 categories that if we see the second menu 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.329
 can be run in sequence through 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.960
 of this option we this option does not 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.759
 We are going to use it because it demands 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.329
 let's say a lot of time and it's really going to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.789
 be long the video in unnecessary form 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:27.780
 and then this this option is a 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:30.869
 mode where you are testing at the level 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.649
 sequence point by point is to say that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.920
 If any of the tests failed in 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.489
 the sequence is automatically canceled 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.469
 the the test what we want to show you and 

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.689
 that we want you to indicate 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.209
 is that for example some of these 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.950
 options like being the audio can not be 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.010
 run independently but rather 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.280
 they will only be able to be executed 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.280
 in the sequence mode and notice that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.110
 we entered audio and it was canceled 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.590
 Anyway, we think it's 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.440
 extremely useful for example we can 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.140
 well the bluetooth does not work either but 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.750
 if we can try for example the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.450
 sensors if here we have the different 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.370
 types of sensor types and good when 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.370
 let's enter each of them 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.500
 we will be able to test it 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.629
 definitely a very useful tool 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.099
 to check the general condition of the 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.110
 phone this way should work 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.870
 for what are motorola devices 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.989
 last generation we would be talking about 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.840
 motogp 2013-2014 moto x also in its 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.720
 two versions as reported by many 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.470
 users and also engines although not 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.099
 we have a direct confirmation of this 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.040
 one caveat depends the tests could 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.670
 depend on the functioning of this test 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.420
 could depend on the specific firmware 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.900
 of Motorola has put for the countries 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.819
 so maybe in some other country there 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.530
 have the possibility to run our 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.290
 all today marianna a reverse we hope 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.450
 that this little one has served you 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.380
 demonstration of what the test is 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.050
 factory 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.240
 of quality for motorola devices if 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.830
 had any questions remember the 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.720
 leave below in the description and 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.600
 We will try to answer them and youtube us 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.580
 allows either the good will be through 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.200
 queries at the top and d'or point 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.290
 complex in a like to the video if you 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.690
 taste subscribe to the channel are 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.780
 absolutely welcome to all this 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.850
 moved that is growing and we 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.230
 we will be watching in a next video 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.230
 thank you very much for being there
