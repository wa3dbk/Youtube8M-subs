00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
both parts were on there so the bottom

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.900 
both parts were on there so the bottom

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
of the door about that much of the

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.640 
of the door about that much of the
bottom<00:05:28.180> of<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.330> door<00:05:28.510> was<00:05:28.900> getting<00:05:29.440> kind<00:05:29.590> of

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
bottom of the door was getting kind of

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.520 
bottom of the door was getting kind of
crunchy<00:05:30.010> but<00:05:30.340> still<00:05:30.940> solid<00:05:31.170> so<00:05:32.170> it's<00:05:32.320> kind<00:05:32.470> of

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
crunchy but still solid so it's kind of

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.200 
crunchy but still solid so it's kind of
rusted<00:05:32.830> across<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.190> bottom<00:05:33.460> of<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.580> door<00:05:33.730> and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
rusted across the bottom of the door and

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.360 
rusted across the bottom of the door and
the<00:05:35.050> fender<00:05:35.380> I<00:05:35.410> don't<00:05:35.650> know<00:05:35.740> why<00:05:35.920> that<00:05:36.190> wasn't

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
the fender I don't know why that wasn't

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.280 
the fender I don't know why that wasn't
marked<00:05:36.640> down<00:05:36.790> but<00:05:37.690> their<00:05:37.840> fenders<00:05:38.020> are

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
marked down but their fenders are

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.840 
marked down but their fenders are
usually<00:05:38.560> $95<00:05:39.520> I<00:05:40.170> don't<00:05:41.170> know<00:05:41.290> why<00:05:42.010> if<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:42.610> pull

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
usually $95 I don't know why if you pull

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.360 
usually $95 I don't know why if you pull
it<00:05:42.880> yourself<00:05:43.710> because<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.800> other<00:05:44.920> junkyard

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
it yourself because the other junkyard

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.240 
it yourself because the other junkyard
is<00:05:45.700> 35<00:05:46.540> I<00:05:46.570> think<00:05:46.780> it's<00:05:47.260> 30<00:05:47.410> bucks<00:05:47.680> for<00:05:47.860> cars<00:05:48.040> and

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
is 35 I think it's 30 bucks for cars and

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.710 
is 35 I think it's 30 bucks for cars and
35<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:48.610> trucks<00:05:49.120> or<00:05:49.270> something<00:05:49.450> like<00:05:49.510> that

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
35 for trucks or something like that

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.230 
35 for trucks or something like that
further<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.140> pull<00:05:50.290> our<00:05:50.440> parts<00:05:50.710> yard<00:05:50.940> so<00:05:51.940> it's

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
further you pull our parts yard so it's

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.240 
further you pull our parts yard so it's
kind<00:05:52.390> of<00:05:52.420> pricey<00:05:52.690> but<00:05:53.050> beings<00:05:54.010> how<00:05:54.130> they

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
kind of pricey but beings how they

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.410 
kind of pricey but beings how they
weren't<00:05:54.430> both<00:05:54.550> on<00:05:54.760> there<00:05:54.910> and<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.060> doors<00:05:55.270> are

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
weren't both on there and the doors are

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.710 
weren't both on there and the doors are
usually<00:05:55.450> 150<00:05:56.790> that's<00:05:57.790> just<00:05:58.090> unbolt<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.540> door

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
usually 150 that's just unbolt the door

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.210 
usually 150 that's just unbolt the door
and<00:05:58.840> take<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.020> whole<00:05:59.200> thing<00:05:59.440> with<00:05:59.890> the<00:06:00.010> glass

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
to 50 bucks on the door and down to 50

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.790 
to 50 bucks on the door and down to 50
bucks<00:06:09.220> on<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.550> fender<00:06:09.820> too<00:06:10.000> so<00:06:10.660> hundred<00:06:11.650> bucks

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
bucks on the fender too so hundred bucks

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.070 
bucks on the fender too so hundred bucks
for<00:06:11.920> both<00:06:12.160> my<00:06:12.310> parts<00:06:12.610> so<00:06:13.060> then<00:06:13.690> I'd<00:06:13.840> be

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
for both my parts so then I'd be

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.350 
for both my parts so then I'd be
painting<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.620> whole<00:06:14.800> door<00:06:15.150> instead<00:06:16.150> of<00:06:16.240> just

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
painting the whole door instead of just

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.930 
painting the whole door instead of just
doing<00:06:16.480> the<00:06:16.690> bottom<00:06:16.870> as<00:06:17.260> well<00:06:17.650> and<00:06:18.460> taking<00:06:18.760> the

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
doing the bottom as well and taking the

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.490 
doing the bottom as well and taking the
door<00:06:19.090> off<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.540> putting<00:06:19.750> it<00:06:19.870> back<00:06:19.900> on<00:06:20.140> and

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
door off and putting it back on and

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.080 
door off and putting it back on and
hooking<00:06:20.770> all<00:06:20.980> the<00:06:21.100> electronics<00:06:21.670> back<00:06:21.880> up

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
hooking all the electronics back up

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
hooking all the electronics back up
because<00:06:22.270> I'm<00:06:22.330> gonna<00:06:22.420> have<00:06:22.510> to<00:06:22.600> chop<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.960> wire

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
because I'm gonna have to chop the wire

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.870 
because I'm gonna have to chop the wire
harness<00:06:23.590> and<00:06:23.890> you<00:06:24.160> know<00:06:24.250> why<00:06:24.520> are<00:06:24.580> the<00:06:24.730> wires

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
harness and you know why are the wires

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.390 
harness and you know why are the wires
back<00:06:25.090> together<00:06:25.270> I<00:06:25.810> guess<00:06:26.800> that's<00:06:27.040> the<00:06:27.070> easiest

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
back together I guess that's the easiest

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.430 
back together I guess that's the easiest
way<00:06:27.580> anyway<00:06:27.880> heat<00:06:28.450> shrink<00:06:28.780> and<00:06:28.990> solder<00:06:29.200> all

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
way anyway heat shrink and solder all

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.020 
way anyway heat shrink and solder all
the<00:06:29.560> wires<00:06:29.710> but<00:06:30.040> I<00:06:30.280> wouldn't<00:06:30.610> take<00:06:30.669> that<00:06:30.850> long

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
the wires but I wouldn't take that long

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.210 
the wires but I wouldn't take that long
but<00:06:31.270> you<00:06:32.110> know<00:06:32.140> swapping<00:06:32.890> out<00:06:32.919> the<00:06:32.980> door

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
but you know swapping out the door

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.860 
but you know swapping out the door
panels<00:06:33.580> cuz<00:06:33.730> the<00:06:33.820> door<00:06:34.000> panels<00:06:34.300> crappy<00:06:34.720> and

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
panels cuz the door panels crappy and

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.080 
panels cuz the door panels crappy and
stuff<00:06:35.110> like<00:06:35.230> that<00:06:35.440> you<00:06:35.620> know<00:06:35.700> is<00:06:36.700> it<00:06:36.910> worth<00:06:37.060> the

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
stuff like that you know is it worth the

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.680 
stuff like that you know is it worth the
time<00:06:37.480> doing<00:06:37.990> all<00:06:38.230> that<00:06:38.410> or<00:06:38.830> should<00:06:39.220> I<00:06:39.250> just

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
time doing all that or should I just

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.930 
time doing all that or should I just
ordered<00:06:40.690> the<00:06:40.900> $65<00:06:41.650> packs<00:06:41.919> panel<00:06:42.370> for<00:06:42.850> the

ordered the $65 packs panel for the

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.420 
ordered the $65 packs panel for the
bottom<00:06:43.210> of<00:06:43.330> the<00:06:43.390> door<00:06:43.600> and<00:06:44.070> chop<00:06:45.070> the<00:06:45.190> old<00:06:45.310> one

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
bottom of the door and chop the old one

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.220 
bottom of the door and chop the old one
off<00:06:45.520> well<00:06:45.760> then<00:06:45.880> you<00:06:45.970> went<00:06:46.090> on<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:46.510> then<00:06:46.990> paint
