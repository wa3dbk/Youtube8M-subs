00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.540 

and<00:00:14.270> I'll<00:00:14.390> use<00:00:14.420> this<00:00:14.900> off-camera<00:00:15.140> with<00:00:15.770> enough

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
and I'll use this off-camera with enough

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.060 
and I'll use this off-camera with enough
shoe<00:00:16.760> cord<00:00:17.090> and<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:18.410> offshoot<00:00:18.740> cord<00:00:18.950> looks

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
shoe cord and the offshoot cord looks

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.530 
shoe cord and the offshoot cord looks
like<00:00:19.310> this<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.820> it's<00:00:20.450> a<00:00:20.630> Nikon<00:00:21.200> SC<00:00:21.950> 29<00:00:22.640> it<00:00:23.330> has

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
like this and it's a Nikon SC 29 it has

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.460 
like this and it's a Nikon SC 29 it has
an<00:00:23.689> infrared<00:00:24.080> sensor<00:00:24.500> on<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.130> actual<00:00:26.470> camera

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
an infrared sensor on the actual camera

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.100 
an infrared sensor on the actual camera
and<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.800> reason<00:00:28.130> why<00:00:28.340> I<00:00:28.759> like<00:00:29.540> using<00:00:29.810> this

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
and the reason why I like using this

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.670 
and the reason why I like using this
over<00:00:30.410> one<00:00:30.770> that<00:00:30.919> doesn't<00:00:31.130> have<00:00:31.310> that<00:00:31.840> is<00:00:32.840> when

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
over one that doesn't have that is when

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.560 
over one that doesn't have that is when
I'm<00:00:34.010> in<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.220> dark<00:00:34.399> environment<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> camera

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
I'm in a dark environment the camera

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.910 
I'm in a dark environment the camera
needs<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.989> infrared<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:36.620> focus<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:38.829> put<00:00:39.829> the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
needs the infrared to focus so put the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.850 
needs the infrared to focus so put the
diffusion<00:00:40.370> away<00:00:40.579> for<00:00:40.790> a<00:00:40.820> moment<00:00:41.290> if<00:00:42.290> I'm<00:00:42.590> using

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
diffusion away for a moment if I'm using

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.770 
diffusion away for a moment if I'm using
this<00:00:43.130> and<00:00:43.340> I'm<00:00:43.399> pointing<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.880> directly<00:00:44.360> to<00:00:44.750> a

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
this and I'm pointing it directly to a

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.900 
this and I'm pointing it directly to a
subject<00:00:45.110> okay<00:00:46.040> I<00:00:46.070> need<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.340> make<00:00:46.579> sure<00:00:46.760> that

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
subject okay I need to make sure that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.959 
subject okay I need to make sure that
this<00:00:47.149> is<00:00:47.449> pointing<00:00:47.719> directly<00:00:47.870> at<00:00:48.289> my<00:00:48.440> subject

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
this is pointing directly at my subject

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.910 
this is pointing directly at my subject
there<00:00:49.969> are<00:00:50.000> times<00:00:50.390> where<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.199> literally<00:00:51.649> want

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
there are times where I literally want

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.680 
there are times where I literally want
to<00:00:51.949> point<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.280> flash<00:00:52.489> away<00:00:52.670> from<00:00:53.059> my<00:00:53.210> subject

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
to point the flash away from my subject

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.709 
to point the flash away from my subject
and<00:00:53.780> catch<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:55.370> side<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.000> flash<00:00:56.269> so<00:00:56.600> that

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
and catch the side of the flash so that

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.770 
and catch the side of the flash so that
it's<00:00:56.809> not<00:00:56.929> so<00:00:57.140> hard<00:00:57.440> not<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.059> strong<00:00:59.059> but

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
it's not so hard not so strong but

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.139 
it's not so hard not so strong but
unfortunately<00:01:00.410> when<00:01:00.499> I<00:01:00.530> do<00:01:00.620> that<00:01:01.039> this<00:01:01.850> light

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
unfortunately when I do that this light

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.520 
unfortunately when I do that this light
here<00:01:02.449> is<00:01:02.600> actually<00:01:02.960> pointing<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.410> different

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
here is actually pointing in a different

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.100 
here is actually pointing in a different
direction<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.370> quite<00:01:04.970> often<00:01:05.120> sure<00:01:05.720> I<00:01:05.750> can<00:01:05.990> do

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
direction and quite often sure I can do

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.770 
direction and quite often sure I can do
this<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.670> can<00:01:07.670> point<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:08.030> at<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.330> actual

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
this I can point this at the actual

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.980 
this I can point this at the actual
person<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.100> light<00:01:10.310> just<00:01:10.640> past<00:01:10.970> them<00:01:11.330> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
person and the light just past them the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.600 
person and the light just past them the
unfortunate<00:01:12.409> thing<00:01:12.770> about<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.460> is

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
unfortunate thing about that is is

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.310 
unfortunate thing about that is is
they're<00:01:13.760> quite<00:01:13.970> often<00:01:14.180> I'm<00:01:14.900> in<00:01:15.200> an

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
they're quite often I'm in an

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.750 
they're quite often I'm in an
environment<00:01:15.440> where<00:01:16.010> it<00:01:16.159> might<00:01:16.310> be<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> really

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
environment where it might be a really

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.639 
environment where it might be a really
busy<00:01:16.909> party<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.570> Hollywood<00:01:18.080> or<00:01:18.229> something

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
busy party in Hollywood or something

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.800 
busy party in Hollywood or something
like<00:01:18.799> that<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:19.790> just<00:01:19.970> don't<00:01:20.060> have<00:01:20.270> time<00:01:20.540> to

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
like that and I just don't have time to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.770 
like that and I just don't have time to
be<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.229> know<00:01:21.350> measuring<00:01:21.950> my<00:01:22.159> line<00:01:22.369> of<00:01:22.399> sight

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
be you know measuring my line of sight

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.300 
be you know measuring my line of sight
so<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:23.990> stays<00:01:24.200> on<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.500> camera<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.130> is

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
so this stays on the camera and this is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.670 
so this stays on the camera and this is
always<00:01:25.520> pointing<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.689> same<00:01:26.720> direction<00:01:27.049> of<00:01:27.530> my

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
always pointing the same direction of my

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.010 
always pointing the same direction of my
lens<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.210> will<00:01:29.390> then<00:01:29.540> send<00:01:29.780> out<00:01:29.899> an

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
lens so this will then send out an

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.840 
lens so this will then send out an
infrared<00:01:30.320> beam<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.860> I<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.040> literally<00:01:31.520> shoot

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
infrared beam and I can literally shoot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.240 
infrared beam and I can literally shoot
in<00:01:32.479> darkness<00:01:33.079> where<00:01:33.290> I<00:01:33.320> can't<00:01:33.740> even<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:34.100> my

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
in darkness where I can't even see my

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.429 
in darkness where I can't even see my
subject<00:01:34.700> at<00:01:34.790> all<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:36.049> can<00:01:36.170> hold<00:01:36.320> this

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
subject at all and I can hold this

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.679 
subject at all and I can hold this
off-camera<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.219> can<00:01:37.369> fire<00:01:37.640> like<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.210> and

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
off-camera and I can fire like so and

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.100 
off-camera and I can fire like so and
the<00:01:39.350> way<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.500> use<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.390> hold<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.509> like<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:41.689> and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
the way I use this I hold it like so and

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.020 
the way I use this I hold it like so and
I<00:01:45.110> let<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.409> light<00:01:45.710> even<00:01:46.100> if<00:01:46.369> there's<00:01:46.549> no<00:01:46.700> area

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
I let the light even if there's no area

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.480 
I let the light even if there's no area
to<00:01:47.119> bounce<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.689> let<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.960> light<00:01:48.200> come<00:01:48.560> out<00:01:49.280> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
to bounce I let the light come out the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.550 
to bounce I let the light come out the
side<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.759> my<00:01:49.880> flash<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.509> illuminate<00:01:51.409> my

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
side of my flash and illuminate my

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.590 
side of my flash and illuminate my
subjects<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.280> tends<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.549> be<00:01:52.729> quite<00:01:52.969> soft<00:01:53.299> I

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
subjects and it tends to be quite soft I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.719 
subjects and it tends to be quite soft I
also<00:01:54.140> have<00:01:54.469> some<00:01:55.430> backup<00:01:55.700> flashes<00:01:57.579> which<00:01:58.579> are

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
also have some backup flashes which are

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.819 
also have some backup flashes which are

smaller<00:02:01.280> they're<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.789> little<00:02:02.390> bit<00:02:02.509> lighter

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
smaller they're a little bit lighter

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.050 
smaller they're a little bit lighter

the sb900 because sb900 it's just a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.630 
the sb900 because sb900 it's just a
little<00:02:15.350> bit<00:02:15.440> simpler<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.860> use<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.250> terms<00:02:16.400> of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
little bit simpler to use in terms of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.730 
little bit simpler to use in terms of
menus<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:17.420> forth<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.870> Nikon<00:02:18.260> did<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.590 
menus and so forth and Nikon did the
right<00:02:18.890> thing<00:02:19.160> there<00:02:19.490> when<00:02:20.090> they<00:02:20.210> made<00:02:20.420> that

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
right thing there when they made that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.320 
right thing there when they made that
