they're<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.759> bulbs<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.240> came<00:02:03.509> with

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
they're just the bulbs that came with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.920 
they're just the bulbs that came with
the<00:02:04.200> car<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> purchased<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:06.750> sure

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the car when I purchased it so I'm sure

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.150 
the car when I purchased it so I'm sure
they're<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.710> pretty<00:02:07.860> bog-standard

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
they're going to be pretty bog-standard

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
they're going to be pretty bog-standard
but<00:02:08.789> they're<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.090> ideal<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> roads<00:02:10.050> for

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
but they're not ideal on the roads for

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.589 
but they're not ideal on the roads for
for<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:10.800> driving<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
for my driving so I'm going to go in a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.850 
for my driving so I'm going to go in a
park<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.319> dark

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
park it on the dark

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.290 
park it on the dark
where<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> live<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.790> I'm<00:02:14.880> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> show<00:02:15.270> you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
where I live and I'm going to show you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.450 
where I live and I'm going to show you
what<00:02:15.690> those<00:02:15.870> bulbs<00:02:16.380> are<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.980> then<00:02:17.340> I'm

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
what those bulbs are like and then I'm

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.700 
what those bulbs are like and then I'm
going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> swap<00:02:17.850> them<00:02:18.000> over<00:02:18.320> okay<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.350> really

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
going to swap them over okay I really

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.020 
going to swap them over okay I really
don't<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:20.100> how<00:02:20.250> well<00:02:20.460> this<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.760> going<00:02:20.940> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
don't know how well this is going to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.270 
don't know how well this is going to
turn<00:02:21.180> out<00:02:21.410> because<00:02:22.410> I'm<00:02:22.560> recording<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:23.250> my

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
turn out because I'm recording on my

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
turn out because I'm recording on my
phone<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> performance<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
phone but this is the performance of the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.920 
phone but this is the performance of the
current<00:02:26.130> bulbs<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.630> see<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
current bulbs and as you can see it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.120 
current bulbs and as you can see it
doesn't<00:02:28.140> go<00:02:28.350> very<00:02:28.380> far<00:02:29.120> at<00:02:30.120> all

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
doesn't go very far at all

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.530 
doesn't go very far at all
now<00:02:32.130> if<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.490> activate<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.540> high<00:02:34.110> beams<00:02:35.540> that's

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
now if I activate the high beams that's

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.699 
now if I activate the high beams that's
what<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> high<00:02:36.990> beams<00:02:37.230> look<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.709> we're

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
what the high beams look like so we're

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.410 
what the high beams look like so we're
going<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.920> try<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.250> use<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.550> basically<00:02:42.270> on

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
going to try and use that basically on

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.300 
going to try and use that basically on
screen<00:02:42.780> what<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.380> see<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.100> see

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
screen what I can see is I can just see

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.520 
screen what I can see is I can just see
that<00:02:44.490> pole<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.150> left<00:02:45.330> side<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:46.320> see<00:02:46.350> it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that pole on the left side I can see it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.220 
that pole on the left side I can see it
much<00:02:46.680> better<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.040> person<00:02:47.300> but<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
much better in person but this is the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.690 
much better in person but this is the
kind<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.470> performance<00:02:49.770> I'm<00:02:50.040> getting<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.459> far

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
kind of performance I'm getting so far

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.580 
kind of performance I'm getting so far
so<00:02:51.570> now<00:02:51.840> I'm<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> head<00:02:52.230> back<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
so now I'm going to head back to the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.729 
so now I'm going to head back to the
house<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.390> change<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> bulbs<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.140> night

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
house and change the bulbs for the night

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.699 
house and change the bulbs for the night
breaker<00:02:56.010> Unlimited's<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.410> we're<00:02:58.410> gonna<00:02:58.500> give

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
breaker Unlimited's and we're gonna give

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.590 
breaker Unlimited's and we're gonna give
that<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.860> try<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.310> then<00:02:59.850> come<00:03:00.000> back<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
that a try and then come back here to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.350 
that a try and then come back here to
compare<00:03:02.150> okay

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
compare okay

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.260 
compare okay
the<00:03:03.780> bulbs<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.260> been<00:03:04.380> changed<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:06.030> is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
the bulbs have been changed and this is

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.520 
the bulbs have been changed and this is
the<00:03:06.570> difference<00:03:06.930> now<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:09.120> my<00:03:09.600> phone's

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the difference now and on my phone's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.280 
the difference now and on my phone's
camera<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.790> me<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.330> screen<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.959> looks

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
camera to me on screen it looks

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.729 
camera to me on screen it looks
identical<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.420> tell<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.230> in

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
identical but I can tell you that in

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.229 
identical but I can tell you that in
person<00:03:17.190> i<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> longer<00:03:19.920> beam<00:03:20.880> range

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
person i I do have a longer beam range

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.350 
person i I do have a longer beam range
here<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.900> does<00:03:22.200> go<00:03:22.560> further<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.850> on<00:03:24.120> high

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
here it does go further and on high

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.470 
here it does go further and on high
beams<00:03:25.100> that's<00:03:26.100> much<00:03:26.610> better<00:03:26.940> than<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.390> was

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
beams that's much better than it was

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.479 
beams that's much better than it was
before<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:28.140> don't<00:03:28.530> know<00:03:28.620> if<00:03:28.739> again<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.340> can

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
before I don't know if again if you can

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.000 
before I don't know if again if you can
tell<00:03:29.730> on<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:30.989> get<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.709> good

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
tell on that but I get a really good

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.280 
tell on that but I get a really good
stretch<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:33.540> high<00:03:33.690> beams<00:03:33.930> was<00:03:34.080> never

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
stretch on that the high beams was never

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.350 
stretch on that the high beams was never
too<00:03:34.500> much<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.799> an<00:03:34.890> issue<00:03:35.040> for<00:03:35.160> me<00:03:35.400> before<00:03:35.700> but

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
too much of an issue for me before but

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.509 
too much of an issue for me before but
it<00:03:36.510> was<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.750> dipped<00:03:36.989> beam<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:38.070> was<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
it was the dipped beam this this was the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.509 
it was the dipped beam this this was the
the<00:03:38.730> main<00:03:38.880> issue<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:40.110> think<00:03:40.140> that's<00:03:40.650> much

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
the main issue and I think that's much

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.880 
the main issue and I think that's much
better<00:03:41.880> than<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.269> was<00:03:42.390> before<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:43.170> pretty

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
better than it was before but pretty

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.460 
better than it was before but pretty
pretty<00:03:44.580> good<00:03:44.760> upgrade<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.120> think<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:46.080> only<00:03:46.170> cost

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
pretty good upgrade I think it only cost

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.930 
pretty good upgrade I think it only cost
me<00:03:46.560> about<00:03:46.709> 15<00:03:47.250> pounds<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:49.019> pair<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.940> night

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
me about 15 pounds for the pair of night

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.080 
me about 15 pounds for the pair of night
breakers<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:53.040> far<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.519> money<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.910> would

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
breakers so so far for the money I would
