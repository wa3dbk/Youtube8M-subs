00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
fun to do some more chill stuff too and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.250 
fun to do some more chill stuff too and
I<00:02:48.930> listened<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.440> lot<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:50.810> lighter<00:02:51.810> music

these<00:02:52.380> days<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:53.790> know<00:02:53.910> it's<00:02:54.270> not<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.830> metal

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
these days you know it's not all metal

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.510 
these days you know it's not all metal
and<00:02:55.950> hardcore<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.700> my<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.570> my<00:02:57.630> iPod<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
and hardcore on my on my iPod but as a

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.270 
and hardcore on my on my iPod but as a
result<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.540> kind<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.840> stuff<00:03:01.080> has<00:03:01.590> seeped<00:03:02.160> its

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
result that kind of stuff has seeped its

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.190 
result that kind of stuff has seeped its
way<00:03:02.459> into<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> music<00:03:03.360> we're<00:03:03.480> making<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
way into the music we're making now and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.780 
way into the music we're making now and
I<00:03:05.130> think<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.459> helps<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:06.570> kind<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.200> build<00:03:07.380> a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
I think it helps to kind of build a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.160 
I think it helps to kind of build a
dynamic<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> songs<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.600> between

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
dynamic in the songs you know between

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170 
dynamic in the songs you know between
the<00:03:10.410> really<00:03:11.370> heavy<00:03:11.459> stuff<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.030> more

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the really heavy stuff and the more

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.510 
the really heavy stuff and the more
chill<00:03:12.390> stuff<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.750> makes<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.800> makes<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.130> the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
chill stuff it makes it makes just the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.000 
chill stuff it makes it makes just the
extremes<00:03:15.000> feel<00:03:15.390> more<00:03:16.050> dramatic<00:03:16.500> which<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.830> fun

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
extremes feel more dramatic which is fun

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.550 
extremes feel more dramatic which is fun
for<00:03:17.160> us<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.520> I'd<00:03:17.730> say<00:03:17.910> at<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.300> point<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:19.230> my

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
for us but I'd say at this point for my

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.170 
for us but I'd say at this point for my
guitar<00:03:19.709> play<00:03:20.010> my<00:03:20.190> biggest<00:03:20.400> influence<00:03:21.000> would

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
guitar play my biggest influence would

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.400 
guitar play my biggest influence would
be<00:03:21.300> try<00:03:21.630> not<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.140> sound<00:03:22.430> like<00:03:24.230> anyone<00:03:25.230> else

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.729 
be try not to sound like anyone else
just<00:03:25.680> try<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.940> somewhat<00:03:27.540> unique<00:03:28.230> because

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
just try to be somewhat unique because

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.410 
just try to be somewhat unique because
there<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.070> certainly<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> lot<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:29.640> bands<00:03:30.239> in
