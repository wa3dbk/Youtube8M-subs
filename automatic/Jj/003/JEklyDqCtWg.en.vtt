00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.910
 video tutorial on how to install a 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.590
 Exterior 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:15.440
 in a car this is a car platina 2006 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.010
 has came with a this stereo of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.900
 agency here we have the harness that is the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.470
 agency stereo what are we going 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.890
 keep for when the car is sold 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.380
 to put the same agency study 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.569
 this is different from the one that has 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.210
 source of power this all comes all 

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:37.809
 direct this is our current a 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.809
 red cable 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.809
 red oak that is stuck here 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.620
 on the right side as I see it and 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.579
 this is my land color black 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.579
 my land is 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.190
 right next to my current is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.000
 is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.430
 these two are 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.430
 running ground current 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.940
 here we have the stereo harness 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.980
 pioneer 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.760
 these two are going to join these two 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.760
 they come separated 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.950
 yellow and red go together and we're going to 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.950
 place in our current 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.680
 so that we give power to our 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.520
 stereo 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.520
 right here 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.270
 let's tape the island 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.440
 this is my current forgiveness and earth 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.340
 we already connect current that is here 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.780
 as I said yellow and red together 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.560
 so that they are not there that putting that 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.560
 the switch that 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.370
 my land 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.960
 we will place the same in the black that 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.229
 I told them 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.280
 those two cables are indispensable for 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 this car stereo 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.650
 ready I have my current and my land 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.820
 I told them that it is essential to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.620
 over our car is ready is the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.620
 harness here 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.970
 from denver and I learned our witness to 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.170
 a dinner because we do not go sing in a 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.170
 horn but you learned
