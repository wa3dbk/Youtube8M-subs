00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
horse stopped there's a couple of

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.500 
horse stopped there's a couple of
different<00:01:35.950> ways<00:01:36.010> that<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.280> can<00:01:36.520> back<00:01:36.700> she's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
different ways that you can back she's

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.680 
different ways that you can back she's
trained<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:38.200> back<00:01:38.470> off<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:39.160> my<00:01:39.280> Spurs<00:01:39.640> so<00:01:40.390> if<00:01:40.540> I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
trained to back off of my Spurs so if I

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.540 
trained to back off of my Spurs so if I
stick<00:01:40.960> my<00:01:40.990> spurs<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.650> each<00:01:41.890> side<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.430> gently

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
stick my spurs in each side and gently

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.400 
stick my spurs in each side and gently
roll<00:01:42.970> them<00:01:43.150> up<00:01:43.300> her<00:01:43.450> belly<00:01:43.630> she's<00:01:44.020> gonna<00:01:44.140> back

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
roll them up her belly she's gonna back

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.130 
roll them up her belly she's gonna back
right<00:01:44.650> off<00:01:44.800> of<00:01:45.010> them<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.960> some<00:01:47.200> horses<00:01:47.740> are

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
right off of them now some horses are

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.320 
right off of them now some horses are
trained<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.320> just<00:01:51.100> really<00:01:51.310> easily<00:01:51.880> back<00:01:52.090> off

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
trained to just really easily back off

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.130 
trained to just really easily back off
of<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.750> light<00:01:52.990> rain<00:01:53.560> pressure<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.640> if<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.360> just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
of a light rain pressure so if I just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.660 
of a light rain pressure so if I just
apply<00:01:56.409> a<00:01:56.440> little<00:01:56.560> bit<00:01:56.800> of<00:01:56.890> calf<00:01:57.100> pressure<00:01:57.400> and
