okay<00:00:01.350> what<00:00:01.500> we've<00:00:01.589> got<00:00:01.709> here<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> picture<00:00:02.280> of

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay what we've got here is a picture of

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.299 
okay what we've got here is a picture of
a<00:00:03.330> diode<00:00:04.040> switch<00:00:05.120> and<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.210> battery<00:00:06.830> and<00:00:07.830> some

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
a diode switch and a battery and some

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.570 
a diode switch and a battery and some
leads<00:00:09.710> connecting<00:00:10.710> them<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.160> put<00:00:11.460> little

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
leads connecting them up I put little

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.120 
leads connecting them up I put little
gaps<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.030> there<00:00:12.150> that's<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.599> show<00:00:12.750> that

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
gaps in there that's just to show that

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.049 
gaps in there that's just to show that
the<00:00:14.130> individual<00:00:14.519> points<00:00:14.790> are<00:00:14.880> where<00:00:15.000> they

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the individual points are where they

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.210 
the individual points are where they
connect<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.619> an<00:00:16.710> actual<00:00:16.830> circuit

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
connect up but in an actual circuit

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.250 
connect up but in an actual circuit
diagram<00:00:17.550> they'd<00:00:18.510> all<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.750> connected<00:00:18.960> together

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
diagram they'd all be connected together

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
diagram they'd all be connected together
as<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> single<00:00:19.920> line<00:00:20.810> there's<00:00:21.810> an<00:00:21.869> important

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
as a single line there's an important

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.570 
as a single line there's an important
thing<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.710> diagram<00:00:23.100> normally<00:00:23.490> you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
thing about this diagram normally you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.300 
thing about this diagram normally you
wouldn't<00:00:23.939> put<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> diode<00:00:25.019> directly<00:00:25.949> connected

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
wouldn't put a diode directly connected

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.620 
wouldn't put a diode directly connected
to<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.849> battery<00:00:27.560> but<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:30.119> little<00:00:30.359> infrared

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to a battery but for the little infrared

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.999 
to a battery but for the little infrared
pen<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> we're<00:00:31.230> gonna<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.470> making<00:00:31.590> infrared

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
pen that we're gonna be making infrared

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.840 
pen that we're gonna be making infrared
LED<00:00:32.279> pen<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:34.260> battery<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.710> 1.5<00:00:35.309> volts<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
LED pen the battery is 1.5 volts the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 
LED pen the battery is 1.5 volts the
maximum<00:00:36.239> voltage<00:00:36.450> operating<00:00:37.260> voltage<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.649> 1.6

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
maximum voltage operating voltage is 1.6

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.190 
maximum voltage operating voltage is 1.6
of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> diode<00:00:39.360> typical<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.140> 1.3<00:00:40.739> 5<00:00:41.040> volts<00:00:42.200> with

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
of the diode typical is 1.3 5 volts with

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.410 
of the diode typical is 1.3 5 volts with
a<00:00:43.230> hundred<00:00:43.530> million<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.520> typical<00:00:45.120> operating

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
a hundred million a typical operating

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.979 
a hundred million a typical operating
current<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.039> situation<00:00:47.840> we're<00:00:48.840> pretty

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
current so that situation we're pretty

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.029 
current so that situation we're pretty
sure<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> damage<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
sure that we're not going to damage the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.790 
sure that we're not going to damage the
diode<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> say<00:00:51.840> normally<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.379> put<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
diode but as I say normally we put a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.240 
diode but as I say normally we put a
resistor<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.960> depending<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.250> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
resistor in there depending on the the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.060 
resistor in there depending on the the
voltage<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:57.500> is<00:00:58.500> from<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> battery

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
voltage that we is from the battery

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.200 
voltage that we is from the battery
source<00:01:00.949> in<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> diagram<00:01:02.280> I've<00:01:02.640> had<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> little

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
source in this diagram I've had a little

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.299 
source in this diagram I've had a little
bit<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> I've<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bit more to it I've put on here to a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.190 
bit more to it I've put on here to a
little<00:01:05.460> sort<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.330> wavy<00:01:06.540> lines<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
little sort of wavy lines here that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.690 
little sort of wavy lines here that
indicates<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.650> light<00:01:07.860> comes<00:01:08.100> off<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
indicates that light comes off it it's a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
indicates that light comes off it it's a
light<00:01:09.000> emitting<00:01:09.360> diode<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.930> also<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
light emitting diode I also put the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.200 
light emitting diode I also put the
component<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> LED<00:01:12.510> itself

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
component here this is the LED itself

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
component here this is the LED itself
this<00:01:15.210> line<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.049> indicate<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.890> lead

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this line here is to indicate this lead

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
this line here is to indicate this lead
yeah<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> put<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.400> switch<00:01:21.500> that's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
yeah so I put that on a switch that's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
yeah so I put that on a switch that's
this<00:01:22.979> part<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> next<00:01:26.340> lead<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.880> just

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
this part here the next lead here just

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.929 
this part here the next lead here just
here<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> lead<00:01:28.829> itself<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.820> you've

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
here this is the lead itself then you've

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
here this is the lead itself then you've
got<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> battery<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.530> case<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.829> know

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
got the battery in this case you know

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
got the battery in this case you know
for<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> battery<00:01:32.430> holder<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.020> find<00:01:34.229> them

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
for a battery holder and then find them

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
for a battery holder and then find them
you've<00:01:34.500> got<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> long<00:01:34.890> lead<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.790> which

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you've got this long lead here which

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
you've got this long lead here which
connects<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.900> up<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.890> lead

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
connects it all up and that's this lead

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
connects it all up and that's this lead
here<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.259> when<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.470> connect<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:40.829> up

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
here and when we connect them all up

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.260 
here and when we connect them all up
what<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.640> solder<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> bits

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
what we do is we solder the bits

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.319 
what we do is we solder the bits
together<00:01:43.610> here's<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> close-up<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> light

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
together here's a close-up of the light

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.069 
together here's a close-up of the light
emitting<00:01:45.630> diode

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
emitting diode

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
emitting diode
and<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.649> we'll<00:01:46.770> notice<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.490> leg

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and what we'll notice is that one leg

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.840 
and what we'll notice is that one leg
here<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.720> longer<00:01:49.259> than<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> other<00:01:50.220> that's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
here is longer than the other that's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179 
here is longer than the other that's
important<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.750> longer<00:01:52.110> leg<00:01:52.290> tells

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
important because the longer leg tells

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.670 
important because the longer leg tells
us<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.810> anode<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> positive

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
us that's the the anode or the positive

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.429 
us that's the the anode or the positive
side<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:57.630> means<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.200> lead

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
side and that means that it's this lead

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
side and that means that it's this lead
here<00:01:58.799> coming<00:01:59.340> off<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.850> important<00:02:00.210> we

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
here coming off here that's important we

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.209 
here coming off here that's important we
can't<00:02:00.509> let<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> right<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:00.930> around<00:02:01.219> connected

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
can't let the right way around connected

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.109 
can't let the right way around connected
the<00:02:02.310> wrong<00:02:02.430> way<00:02:02.549> around<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:02.969> easily

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the wrong way around we can easily

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.660 
the wrong way around we can easily
damage<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> negative<00:02:05.340> or

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
damage it and this is the negative or

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
damage it and this is the negative or
the<00:02:05.790> cathode<00:02:06.000> which<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.110> here

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the cathode which is this one here

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.089 
the cathode which is this one here
so<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.030> lead<00:02:09.240> here<00:02:09.509> will<00:02:10.170> connect<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.920> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so this lead here will connect to that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.020 
so this lead here will connect to that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.430 
together finally here's a close-up of
the<00:02:46.620> battery<00:02:46.950> holder<00:02:47.780> which<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:48.930> saw<00:02:49.380> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
the battery holder which we saw the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.289 
the battery holder which we saw the
battery<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:50.160> there's<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.060> plus

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
battery in here there's a little plus

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.430 
battery in here there's a little plus
there<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.569> can't<00:02:51.780> quite<00:02:51.959> see<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.170> that's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
there you can't quite see it that's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.690 
there you can't quite see it that's
important<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> make<00:02:53.010> sure<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.370> plus<00:02:53.549> is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
important to make sure that the plus is

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.100 
important to make sure that the plus is
there<00:02:54.019> -<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.110> there<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:56.459> lead<00:02:56.700> here<00:02:57.110> here's

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
there - is there that lead here here's

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.870 
there - is there that lead here here's
the<00:02:58.260> end<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.430> tag<00:02:59.670> which

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
the end of it there's a little tag which

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.430 
the end of it there's a little tag which
that's<00:03:00.090> old<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.600> -<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:01.140> push<00:03:01.290> that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that's old is on - so we push that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.830 
that's old is on - so we push that
through<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:01.890> just<00:03:02.130> soldered<00:03:02.459> on

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
through and then just soldered on

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.180 
through and then just soldered on
similarly<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.019> end<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.739> push<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> wire

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
similarly this end we push the wire

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.240 
similarly this end we push the wire
through<00:03:05.400> there<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.700> solder<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:08.160> in

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
through there and solder it up and in

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.220 
through there and solder it up and in
that<00:03:08.280> way<00:03:08.489> we<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.900> create<00:03:09.900> our<00:03:10.170> circuit<00:03:12.230> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
that way we can create our circuit and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.789 
that way we can create our circuit and
here's<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> finished<00:03:14.010> prototype<00:03:15.620> looks<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
here's the finished prototype looks a

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.539 
here's the finished prototype looks a
little<00:03:16.980> bit<00:03:17.690> each<00:03:18.690> Robinson<00:03:19.170> there<00:03:20.130> we<00:03:20.220> go

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
little bit each Robinson there we go

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.789 
little bit each Robinson there we go
it<00:03:20.970> takes<00:03:21.150> 30<00:03:21.989> minutes<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.350> put<00:03:22.470> together

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
it takes 30 minutes to put together

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.880 
it takes 30 minutes to put together
there's<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.400> LED<00:03:23.730> there's<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> switch

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
there's the LED there's the switch

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.050 
there's the LED there's the switch
there's<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.040> battery<00:03:26.190> hold<00:03:26.459> otherwise<00:03:26.820> our

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
there's the battery hold otherwise our

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.370 
there's the battery hold otherwise our
sort<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.239> internal<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.870> there<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.200> can<00:03:28.290> see

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
sort of internal in there you can see

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.170 
sort of internal in there you can see
one<00:03:28.620> sticking<00:03:28.890> out<00:03:28.980> there<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> bit<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:30.060> I've

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
one sticking out there a bit and I've

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.210 
one sticking out there a bit and I've
used<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.420> bit<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.660> plumbing<00:03:31.230> plastic<00:03:31.799> push-fit

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
used a bit of plumbing plastic push-fit

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.390 
used a bit of plumbing plastic push-fit
pipe<00:03:32.730> because<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.209> easy<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.930> manipulate<00:03:34.500> cut

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
pipe because it's easy to manipulate cut

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.539 
pipe because it's easy to manipulate cut
and<00:03:35.640> it's<00:03:36.209> quite<00:03:36.390> solid<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.280> that'll<00:03:38.280> do<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:38.489> a

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
and it's quite solid and that'll do as a

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.690 
and it's quite solid and that'll do as a
prototype<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.120> make<00:03:39.239> sure<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.450> works
