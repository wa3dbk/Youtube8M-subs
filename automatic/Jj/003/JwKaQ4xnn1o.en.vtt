 one approach we set some 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.910
 brilliance form for us which we make 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.900
 15 reps 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.050
 have established 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.510
 well here in this simulator google us won 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.650

 the picture is a growth scale 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.110
 trained muscles 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.110
 we need to make a simulator by ourselves 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:38.200
 make a tall man can do 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:44.010

 moved away from the simulator someone came up 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.239
 put the simulator under him and began to do 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.959
 exercise went away when you sit down 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.580
