 Now I have fans like your son 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.220
 a fan stopped when he ate and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.049
 let's do the unpacking of the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.809
 You are the first impressions of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.209
 a stylus for capacitive screens that 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.059
 come from the company mobile spending the 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.760
 The name of the product is the lumpen twist l 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.260
 and one of the advantages is that you go 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.029
 to be able to use not only with this 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.029
 light but also the pen 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.210
 and 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.210
 let's start by opening the box 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.540

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.690
 instructions on how to replace the ink 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.600
 here the interesting thing about this as I told you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.980
 is the fact that you are going to be able to 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.300
 write and also 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.570

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.320
 moment that you were touching him and 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.020
