00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.049
 in fact this is not us all 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.740
 we are antennae that we are the time 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.029
 Whole capturing positive and negative right 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.220
 But there are times when people 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.590
 is a little more open including 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.630
 when we make the annual forecast 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.090
 we observe this through the transitions of 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.829
 Neptune who is the ruler of fish then 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.230
 when you see what neptune is doing 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.460
 some tense aspects usually this 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.739
 It's a time you have to stay. 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.270
 mindful of the spiritual side but you 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.180
 said to protect himself 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.490
 yes this has nothing to do with religion 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.500
 not married one do the fashion test that 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.660
 it's expensive many people are learning 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.120
 throughout life protect themselves 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.620
 Well, people are not born knowing that neither 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.150
 the antibodies that we are going to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.760
 developing lifelong learning in 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.800
 relation to diseases flu vaccines that 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.739
 people take then as we go 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.930
 through dense energies and thing and 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.050
 we learn how to create a 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.910
 protection is this, even we are by 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.340
 For example, I work with people from all 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.259
 the types for example can I arrived at 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.030
 home, I stop protecting myself because 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.400
 otherwise how I go is always 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.380
 recycling energy is important and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.560
 you go with the time it is as if you 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.330
 generating one as if you were 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.940
 becoming increasingly larger community 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.799
 As you develop this 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.240
 because you need to develop for a 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.549
 need since there are people who do not 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.830
 perceive this need and invade 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.020
 A tip I give that I believe 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.540
 much from personal experience that does not 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.430
 It costs nothing ta that no one need spend 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.970
 a penny that can be made to any 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.799
 Now you know that 's prayer and there. 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.570
 The one you believe in is me 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.729
 I promised in the fanpage that the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.470
 pass on information this week too 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.970
 I'm always going through a lot of things. 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.890
 there the heart as I will spend a 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.360
 prayer for spiritual protection to 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.909
 people who feel they need 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.720
 do some cleaning with a few words of 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.850
 which are very strong for cleaning 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.830
 as long as the person also provides 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.810
 attention to your thoughts in your 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.540
 attitudes and who she is living with 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.670
 it seems Rohter lives with someone who 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.319
 you realize that that dance energy 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.790
 You're still there, it's complicated. 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.400
 especially if there is involvement 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 because when you get involved 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.960
 sexually with someone you 1 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.510
 all the chakras and energetically 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.120
 totally united and then you end up picking up 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.220
 that energy is not harder to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.000
 protect when it involves sexuality because 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.860
 like that of the feline by value reminds us that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.060
 he spoke had a question that they said 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.100
 because some people have not 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.260
 some women do not have orgasm, right? 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.330
 because it is a delivery moment where you 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.790
 loses control and if you do not want to 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.890
 lose control and then for example the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.580
 French is very interesting each 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.980
 each country right every language has a name 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.240
 for orgasm, and in the case in france 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.580
 she why im 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.560
 that is, a little death when he 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 said I remembered when it's worth it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.209
 Lives because it's the time when you go. 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
 to a place where you're going to say control 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.200
 then for example the French he speaks 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.510
 I did not arrive at the small death would be that 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.060
 nor to say that it would be super strange 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.070
 grandchild so has an energy and 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.140
 really shutting down why 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.600
 people like orgasm so much 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.459
 some people if they are here are addicted 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.260
 in sex because it's like that 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.880
 energy at that moment not 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.709
 import with many problems with much 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.390
 thing at that moment not only has people 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.330
 which can not be turned off however 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.730
 you at that moment and the person u 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.730
 there steam iron ready and the person who is 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.760
 a hybrid being is negative fall 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.700
 today you're exactly wrong energy is 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.890
 precisely because there is no way to 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.320
 not sex is fully delivered 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.630
 then you do not contain the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.380
 there is a limit to 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.290
 that 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.880
 why why it is so there is the 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.530
 promiscuity something you have to take 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.489
 be careful because there's this side 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.489
 energy too
