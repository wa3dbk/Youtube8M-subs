00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.710
 this blissful soup of chayote oil in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.590
 aerosol 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.580
 I'm going to put a little bit 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.800
 fry 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.800
 along with the onion raritos 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.070
 I'm not using onions because I'm going to 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.270
 say why the chayote is a vegetable 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.849
 very very delicate its flavor is very dim 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.220
 we almost never use it more than for the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.850
 cucheros or for the broths but 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.250
 really the chayote well I cook nothing 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.940
 more that seed of the chayote does not 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.660
 love me I love my grandmother my 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.789
 grandmother when I was doing grandmothers 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.500
 some chai or little titos is tamaris 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.379
 titles like white do not know us 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 little ones that are a delight are like 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.129
 fruits really are some fruits 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.129
 exquisite 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.660
 let's put up a little bit 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.220
 fried our chives our 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.270
 cambric onion onion habits 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.270
 I'm using 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.540
 and I'm going to add chayote chayote 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.250
 with thorns and chayotes without spi with 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.550
 thorns and without thorns 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.950
 I am using the thornless the with 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.030
 spears that is sweeter to me as far as 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.190
 staff to eat what cooked nothing more and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.900
 put it on my table so what happens if 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.930
 you eat a piece instead of eating a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.670
 piece of not being something a little leg or something 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.210
 even as snacks you can put a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.290
 little piece of chayote cocido with tantita 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.290
 salt and it is a delight the truth 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.680
 I have a head of information who does not 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.680
 like 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.460
 to hamburgers nothing more than 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.990
 burgers also has nothing of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 bad as we consume them we consume 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.440
 diary is when is the problem 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.970
 once a week is very good 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.750
 once a week is bourgeois good 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.750
 to add the chayote 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.959
 and I'm going to tell you what I'm going to use in 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.200
 instead of the chicken broth I will use 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.040
 vegetable broth these chayotes and or 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.689
 pellet in a shell a bit hard 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.629
 so what do I do I had the onion 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:35.560
 escambray had the sprigs of parsley 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:38.109
 I had the chayote skin I had 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.209
 potato peel had some peel 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.709
 are vegetables using our site 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.370
 onion 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.080
 I put all that together to make a broth and 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.390
 I got a vegetable broth 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.690
 vegetable broths almost never 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.700
 we do because we think they do not have 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.560
 nutrients and we are in a big mistake 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.710
 because because many of the vegetables that 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.690
 we use and consume the peels and when 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.350
 we peel them in the shell they go 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.260
 nutrients and that's when we water it and 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.000
 we say the nutrients went to 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.730
 Drain by the way talking drainage 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.570
 I just read something very important that 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.860
 I'll bring the oil well stop and 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.570
 I had already said it several times 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.810
 after dinner because he had read but 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.780
 now that fashion is so fashionable 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.510
 to be this 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.430
 thus conserving the environment of 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.810
 take care of each other 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.670
 because we need it all 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.380
 Mexicans all of the world by 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.920
 to leave a better world to our children 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.790
 is to start with the house you already separate 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.860
 your trash case 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.360
 we did not learn to separate garbage until 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.180
 the garbage trucks said 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.739
 organic inorganic I had it 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.000
 doing for a long time already has 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.510
 come doing a long time I was 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.340
 separated the cardboard the glass because 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.319
 I would say seeing the desert of the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.959
 lions and good we are states with relays 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.609
 They are very good to be very easy to 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.980
 do when we have the place but if not 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.060
 what we have can also be done 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.010
 then taking care of this from the middle 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.730
 environment is important to tell you about 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.230
 all the people who cook a lot because in 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.900
 the house better we are creatures 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.340
 worse we do from time to time and that 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.530
 oil that we use that is 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.110
 recommended just use it once 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.690
 it is important that when we finish it 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.360
 to use we put it in a jar of 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.070
 glass please and you know that oil 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.940
 keep it I'll see if I can contact 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.460
 to a company 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.250
 of oil to come and explain 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.680
 how can we pass them they can pass to 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.780
 pick it up or what can we do with this 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.750
 with that oil that we use because the 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:54.290
 dawned of this small data a liter 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:57.230
 of oil contaminates a thousand liters of water or 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.600
 be yes for people who make a and who 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.390
 is surprised the truth is better not 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.940
 be surprised and act if you are 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.830
 suffering for little that is and remains 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.960
 that oil don is opening his flesh from 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.460
 truth put in a jar of bits not what 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.800
 reuse because many people say 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.570
 that is toxic I'm not sure how 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.000
 toxic can do but can reach 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.500
 be toxic it seems there are people 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.270
 specialized in oils that one day 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.920
 they're going to come and talk about that, it's very 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.500
 important that you do this please 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.680
 and does not throw it into the drain by any 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.660
 reason for some excuse we do not put it 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.920
 in a glass jar and when it arrives 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.930
 the garbage truck the best 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.250
 recordings can help you hear this 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.400
 I run out of oil or I can not put it 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.840
 now better know at best we are not going to 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.639
 try to hire this company to 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.830
 give us your phones and it seems 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.590
 after a liter two liters of oil 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.870
 used to pick it up but I'm not 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.620
 sure good a lot of talk 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.460
 today we are applying with truth meat 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.590
 good 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.500
 talking about monologues that both the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.220
 monologues is first I'm in a 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.910
 stand or as they say adore good stick 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.910
 Made of veggies 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.789
 Vegetables soup 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.930
 or chicken broth 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:24.010
 remember that it is chicken stock or background 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.210
 chicken is not a consomé ok ya 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.250
 explained many times what is the 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.140
 difference and some day I'm going to 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.390
 make a consumption now that we have 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.210
 time for mothers day I 'm going 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.130
 to make a clarified consommé let's go 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.320
 to take about two hours to do it but 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.980
 we are going to do it here so that the 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.890
 difference between a consommé and a 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:49.260
 broth but fine while I'm going to start 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.260
 liquefy my selection 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.080
 nothing 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:08.260
 let's see how this perfect is 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:11.470
 a soup is not a cream I was wrong is 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.220
 a soup and while I serve the 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.980
 he killed me 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.980
 and he told me we go with the neighbor
