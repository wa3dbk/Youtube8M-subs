00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.090
 is taken 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.800
 was the whole story of glitter and glamor with a 21 year old 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.020
 never good advice she said i sometimes have anp par excellence for such a lot 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.729
 is more 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.729
 41 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.730
 He also said that there was indeed a problem not thought about that all one 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.859
 Cutter clamp would come along with it and that only a little migration the cells 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.620
 It is not known if there is just one normal 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.390
 doing her own thing within a series of craziness and so not having to hear it for a while 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 I think it's super cool 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
 she is accompanied by live on the cake of laura and she is going to do this 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 training paris appear wrong 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 so the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.900
 to have it in the future 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.690
 up to now 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.970
 the law may not be broken 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.300
 into the fog 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.920
 not anymore 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 that very much 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:49.969
 in the media 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.969
 the target 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.439
 great right great 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.439
 along the way 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.440
 by the new plans 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.830
 straight on stage again made the stage its own in the not fascinating story 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.319
 tells how you see it is all actually brilliant 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.509
 he does take a little side note to make the song most exciting 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.509
 performance of the teachers 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.389
 after a recovery and I have none with a day later an exciting performance mh 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.759
 songs are reluctant to lead 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.469
 I think it's a great song I really don't love you 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.479
 on stage and I think you have 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.649
 yes and regarding the interviews to me don't worry as a safe 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.649
 harbor music you know of course an answer to that 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:12.339
 9 ready 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:13.729
 the tip of criticism 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:18.029
 is that a poster is because and sometimes makes 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.969
 is that the keeper timing this kee something 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.669
 and more for the implementation of otherwise my story here actually nothing 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.740
 9 it was no answer here, I am also continuing 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.330
 herzele that is very risky 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.569
 there we are also starting our version of such a song 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.380
 give compliments about the opportunities for growth 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.440
 we thought to offer later in commanding my life is happy this is just one 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.300
 perfectly done who can sing very well last week because of the performance 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.340
 of refused 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.240
 and then it is pretty good when young people are in our country at the end 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.820
 not even yet 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.389
 good a great find 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.050
 find you a lot better today than last week 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.110
 but only way 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.370
 I have none of it 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.540
 I don't know I just had another song with you for the parent group though 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.040
 a special logo and a strong irish 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.370
 that belongs to you dozens of dearest 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.860
 well that is allowed 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.330
 that is allowed 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.500
 but and but you must not ignore but that happens 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.400
 no one is injured here 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.660
 and yes I think it will slowly become clear to everyone that this is one 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.660
 extremely large gap that something that your website 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:40.039
 have told myself and even percent has no problem whatsoever 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:40.919
 happens 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.599
 yes and how you then go back and forth on stage a child is just doing things and 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.710
 with a charisma in a tent, and that is how it should sing well 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.099
 yes i have a great show
