more and more they anchor our sense of

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.010 
more and more they anchor our sense of
self<00:06:22.800> a<00:06:23.040> place<00:06:23.340> but<00:06:24.240> we<00:06:24.389> project<00:06:24.570> our

self a place but we project our

self a place but we project our

fantasies into them but because they're
static<00:06:27.860> we<00:06:28.860> trust<00:06:29.190> them<00:06:29.660> in<00:06:30.660> ways<00:06:30.870> that<00:06:30.900> we

static we trust them in ways that we

can't trust memory because memory is
ephemeral
