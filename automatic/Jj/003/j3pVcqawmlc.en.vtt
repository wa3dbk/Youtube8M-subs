everything every hand that he had to win

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.270 
everything every hand that he had to win
he<00:00:59.019> would<00:00:59.170> hold<00:00:59.320> on<00:00:59.469> to<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.710> look<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.070> watch

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
and he would win that hand now we've got

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.820 
and he would win that hand now we've got
to<00:01:04.210> I<00:01:04.360> usually<00:01:04.780> do<00:01:04.870> this<00:01:04.930> with<00:01:05.050> small<00:01:05.440> cards

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
to I usually do this with small cards

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.200 
to I usually do this with small cards
but<00:01:05.950> since<00:01:06.130> we've<00:01:06.250> got<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.430> larger<00:01:06.760> group<00:01:06.790> here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
but since we've got a larger group here

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.340 
but since we've got a larger group here
I<00:01:07.240> thought<00:01:07.450> it'd<00:01:07.570> be<00:01:07.600> easier<00:01:07.689> for<00:01:07.930> these<00:01:08.140> guys

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.649 
I thought it'd be easier for these guys
to<00:01:08.409> see<00:01:08.650> if<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:08.829> had<00:01:08.979> some<00:01:09.159> bigger<00:01:09.340> cards<00:01:09.790> so

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
to see if we had some bigger cards so

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.390 
to see if we had some bigger cards so
here<00:01:10.840> could<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.170> uh<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.890> can<00:01:12.040> put<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.250> watch
