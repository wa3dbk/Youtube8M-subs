 history of the world all in relation to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.090
 You leave there all that was written in the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 past but will the revolutionaries 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.930
 know of some prophecy that has to do with 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.850
 with some poligraph will that this bunch 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.210
 of revolutionaries have some 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.000
 descending from honoring in the old 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.700
 I do not know but have some knowledge 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.250

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.619
 this knowledge of them causes 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 some of them as the frog has the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.420
 sure that some things will go 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.060
 it may be that the king of pirates 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.250
 will be one of in prophecy and the wise as 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.570
 relies heavily on UHF is betting the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.759
 on it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.979
 do the revolutionaries have this 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.630
 sure why they are working 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.869
 behind the scenes out there 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.810
 secretly to make uff the king of 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.630
 pirates because it is with error power that 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.770
 They believe 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.670
 one holds of rocking the old world is to see 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.040

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.570
 related to the final war of a ps 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.550
