00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
speeds here as you can see they are

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.569 
speeds here as you can see they are
right<00:00:35.440> there<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:35.650> front<00:00:35.770> of<00:00:35.920> you<00:00:36.010> read<00:00:36.550> right

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
right there in front of you read right

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.040 
right there in front of you read right
times<00:00:36.940> are<00:00:37.059> very<00:00:37.239> similar<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.809> each<00:00:37.930> other

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
times are very similar to each other

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.100 
times are very similar to each other
usually<00:00:38.290> you<00:00:38.589> see<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:38.800> lot<00:00:39.010> higher<00:00:39.400> of<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:40.540> read

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
usually you see a lot higher of a read

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.520 
usually you see a lot higher of a read
time<00:00:41.440> but<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.650> slower<00:00:41.949> right<00:00:42.400> time<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.780> seeing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
time but a slower right time but seeing

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.630

that<00:00:52.540> was<00:00:52.750> on<00:00:52.930> crystal<00:00:53.409> disk<00:00:53.620> mark<00:00:53.829> I<00:00:53.980> went

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
that was on crystal disk mark I went

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.310 
that was on crystal disk mark I went
ahead<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.369> ran<00:00:54.549> a<00:00:54.790> TT<00:00:55.089> 0<00:00:55.119> disk<00:00:55.540> benchmark<00:00:55.869> as

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
ahead and ran a TT 0 disk benchmark as

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.200 
ahead and ran a TT 0 disk benchmark as
well<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:57.100> see<00:00:57.250> if<00:00:57.280> we<00:00:57.430> get<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.670> same<00:00:57.699> numbers

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
well to see if we get the same numbers

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.750 
well to see if we get the same numbers
and<00:00:58.449> right<00:00:59.199> along<00:01:00.010> those<00:01:00.220> higher<00:01:00.400> numbers

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
and right along those higher numbers

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.359 
and right along those higher numbers
yeah<00:01:00.939> we<00:01:01.180> do<00:01:01.330> so<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:02.769> can<00:01:02.920> see<00:01:03.040> right<00:01:03.070> there

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:03.369 
yeah we do so you can see right there

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.030 
yeah we do so you can see right there
the<00:01:03.400> read/write<00:01:03.850> times<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:05.140> megabytes<00:01:05.590> per

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
the read/write times in megabytes per

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.859 
the read/write times in megabytes per
second<00:01:06.490> is<00:01:06.670> going<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.030> be<00:01:07.119> right<00:01:07.390> around<00:01:07.540> the

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
second is going to be right around the

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.080 
second is going to be right around the
same<00:01:08.049> about<00:01:09.010> seven<00:01:09.369> hundred<00:01:09.400> and<00:01:09.610> sixty<00:01:09.939> five

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
same about seven hundred and sixty five

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.870 
same about seven hundred and sixty five
megabytes<00:01:10.450> per<00:01:10.720> second<00:01:11.020> or<00:01:11.080> so<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.490> really

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
megabytes per second or so so really

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.550 
megabytes per second or so so really

hard disk drive for storage let's take a
look<00:01:27.850> at<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.030> book<00:01:28.179> times<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.659> computer

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
look at the book times of the computer

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.959 
look at the book times of the computer
it<00:01:29.140> should<00:01:29.289> be<00:01:29.380> pretty<00:01:29.560> quick<00:01:29.770> we<00:01:30.429> do<00:01:30.549> have<00:01:30.729> the

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
it should be pretty quick we do have the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.560 
it should be pretty quick we do have the
3<00:01:31.590> 128<00:01:32.590> gigabyte<00:01:33.100> M<00:01:33.280> SATA<00:01:33.490> drives<00:01:33.759> in<00:01:34.030> raid<00:01:34.539> 0

3 128 gigabyte M SATA drives in raid 0

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.080 
3 128 gigabyte M SATA drives in raid 0
I'll<00:01:35.530> go<00:01:35.859> ahead<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.070> start<00:01:36.490> on<00:01:36.640> my<00:01:36.759> phone<00:01:36.939> and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
I'll go ahead and start on my phone and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.300 
I'll go ahead and start on my phone and
power<00:01:37.270> at<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.689> same<00:01:38.140> time<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.740> we'll<00:01:38.920> go<00:01:39.039> three

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
power at the same time so we'll go three

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.700 
power at the same time so we'll go three
two<00:01:39.729> one<00:01:40.179> go<00:01:42.899> you're<00:01:43.899> not<00:01:44.020> do<00:01:44.170> my<00:01:44.289> best<00:01:44.530> air

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
two one go you're not do my best air

00:01:44.710 --> 00:02:02.570 
two one go you're not do my best air
stop<00:01:45.189> this<00:01:45.460> as<00:01:45.729> soon<00:01:45.909> as<00:01:45.999> it<00:01:46.119> hits<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.390> desktop

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
about 21 seconds is what we saw there so

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.060 
about 21 seconds is what we saw there so

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
showing 77 and 85 between the two so

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.360

that's<00:03:23.010> kind<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.220> our<00:03:24.410> 3dmark<00:03:25.410> fire<00:03:25.890> strike

98<00:05:09.630> 99<00:05:10.880> GPU<00:05:11.880> temps<00:05:12.890> let's<00:05:13.890> take<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.220> look<00:05:14.430> here

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
98 99 GPU temps let's take a look here

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.730 
98 99 GPU temps let's take a look here
we<00:05:16.230> got<00:05:16.350> 86<00:05:16.950> on<00:05:17.130> one<00:05:17.520> GPU<00:05:18.050> 93<00:05:19.050> on<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.350> other<00:05:19.470> so

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
we got 86 on one GPU 93 on the other so

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.490 
we got 86 on one GPU 93 on the other so
a<00:05:19.770> little<00:05:19.950> higher<00:05:20.250> temps<00:05:20.730> on<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:21.060> GPUs<00:05:21.570> even

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
a little higher temps on the GPUs even

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.640 
a little higher temps on the GPUs even
on<00:05:22.710> 3dmark11<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.540> that'll<00:05:24.780> take<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.230> look<00:05:25.500> at

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
on 3dmark11 so that'll take a look at

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.159 
on 3dmark11 so that'll take a look at
our<00:05:25.740> finish<00:05:26.490> up<00:05:26.640> our<00:05:26.730> 3dmark<00:05:28.730> results

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
our finish up our 3dmark results

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.210 
our finish up our 3dmark results
hopefully<00:05:31.169> you<00:05:31.410> get<00:05:31.500> an<00:05:31.620> idea<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:32.010> the

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
hopefully you get an idea of the

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.250 
hopefully you get an idea of the
performance<00:05:32.760> with<00:05:33.090> these<00:05:33.360> three<00:05:33.750> benchmarks

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
performance with these three benchmarks

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.790 
performance with these three benchmarks
that<00:05:34.320> we've<00:05:34.560> shown<00:05:38.900> finish<00:05:39.900> up<00:05:40.050> our<00:05:40.200> look<00:05:40.530> at
