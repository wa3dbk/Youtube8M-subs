00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello everyone I am Carlos and today I teach you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.000
 how to make a good tower 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.580
 good morning some tips for 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.100
 make a tower in conditions so 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.070
 let's start first is the outside vale 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.140
 you have to keep in mind how I wanted 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.520
 do the exterior of what material and I 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.660
 I recommend not doing it in one 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.520
 keep something that if it's not going to stay very 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.500
 bland the truth for example I used 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.970
 here the normal stone is worth the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.850
 we found on the floor and the bricks 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.820
 good 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 another thing is the way you want to do 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.850
 having a shape that you want to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.309
 have the tower 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.699
 I in my case the circular fact is worth going 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 to make it square or with bordeaux with 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.410
 the rounded corners as you like 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.489
 ok i have circulated 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.770
 another thing from the outside is that you have to 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 change what the appearance is in some 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.860
 of its parts because if it's not also going to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 be very bland for many materials 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.470
 having the tower is worth for example 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.420
 here I made a small terrace worth 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.910
 which occupies what is almost half of the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 tower and so that it is a little bit more 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.110
 realistic that does not seem to hold 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.990
 magically I have put some 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.020
 columns here I added a glass 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.660
 with water inside and now we will see 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.570
 from inside that at night you can 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.100
 illuminate then the area of â€‹â€‹night the world 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.220
 so you can see how the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.259
 tower here another one also another glass 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.390
 And here is the portal where 8 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.220
 higher up on the top of the tower 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.190
 so that the lower parts are not heard 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.230
 of the tower and then I've done here a 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.110
 dome for 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.450
 so that the tower is not so monotonous and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.410
 one that ends in a turret 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.960
 small in which we can go up and see 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.310
 the views of our world or attack 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.340
 the enemies although I see it quite 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.740
 difficult with arch here but good now 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 let's go inside the good tower 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.040
 what is the bridge that does not happen to me 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.140
 a lot because I did not feel like basically 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.140
 but good now let's go 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.660
 and well here we could put the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.870
 decoration of my did not and what 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.790
 I want to tell you here is that I add 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.690
 quite tall if your tower is 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.330
 wide like this one is quite broad 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.349
 you put enough height so that 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.650
 match the width if it will not fit 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.830
 very flat and so you can also for 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.440
 example make stairs like this from this guy 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.500
 and they are cooler no and here for example 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 I have the part d 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.520
 of rooms like my room here 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.930
 the rooms is not a room 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.380
 alone and the terrace now let's go to the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.790
 second floor 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.160
 this is in the king's room is the throne and 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.080
 this is where I have the water and behind 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.080
 I have the torches to eliminate it from 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.630
 night so that it is more more handsome not 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.430
 well let's go to the third floor the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.400
 third floor we found the room 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.000
 enchantments is worth the highest echo 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.290
 so that it can fit on the table 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.180
 enchantment that is there elevated 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.250
 surrounded by the books pallets with the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.300
 shelves and to which we access by 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.100
 a wooden slab 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.130
 and nothing here we can enchant our 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.740
 things and that 's it now we're going to go with the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.410
 fourth floor without the fourth 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.500
 what I have taught you before 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.400
 is the neider portal and the fourth 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.490
 plant we can make the tower the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.300
 teachers that is the one that is the smallest 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.130
 that has three floors and we can 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.130
 go out to the dome to attack the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.330
 enemies we go what we want good 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.580
 this is the visible part of the tower 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.410
 ok now let's do the part not 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.410
 visible that is here 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.100
 plus 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.210
 let's look at the basement of the 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.330
 of the tower 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.470
 and I do not have it finished because it's that 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.750
 inside this done in hardcore mode 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.299
 ok and the process is pretty slow if 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.810
 you do not want to die but good 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:24.669
 I have made the tower in the water like 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.120
 you see and not only because night on the water 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:32.110
 just because more handsome, no more 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.130
 because below it has a crack 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.400
 and in this crack, what I will do will be 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.040
 finish and such a kind of catacombs 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.889
 dungeons and that connect with the tower 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.490
 here with trailers and things like that 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.910
 so then I recommend doing it in 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.550
 somewhere like that 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.190
 make it special where you can do 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.700
 mines connect to the tower and such and 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.190
 I also recommend doing it in the water at 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.400
 side of the water or in the water just that not 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.450
 connect with the earth because good that 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.810
 I recommend it only if you are in 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.310
 survival or in hardcore because 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.110
 basically a tower like that was built 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.060
 high if you shut up to the lands 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.130
 mortal is in hardcore do not lose 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.950
 you all lost the map if you're in 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.110
 survival courage not to lose the 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.970
 experience and good well here we finish 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.340
 the video and I hope you liked it 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.320
 these tips to make a tower and 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.630
 if you want me to make another video 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.150
 explaining more thoroughly how to do this 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.500
 tower so put me in the comments and 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.960
 Any other class also doubt me 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.860
 put in the comments so nothing a 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.860
 hug and see you later
