Main Street to have survived the tornado
back<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:10.000> 1914<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:11.780> whole<00:02:11.930> black<00:02:12.200> burned

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
back in 1914 this whole black burned

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.580 
back in 1914 this whole black burned
down<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:14.000> SD<00:02:14.510> robinette<00:02:14.960> when<00:02:15.050> he<00:02:15.200> rebuilt

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
down and SD robinette when he rebuilt

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.620 
down and SD robinette when he rebuilt
his<00:02:16.370> building<00:02:16.730> he<00:02:16.820> wanted<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.090> make<00:02:17.210> sure<00:02:17.240> it

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
his building he wanted to make sure it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.030 
his building he wanted to make sure it
would<00:02:17.750> never<00:02:17.870> burn<00:02:18.110> down<00:02:18.290> again<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:18.800> he

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
would never burn down again so he

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.610 
would never burn down again so he
constructed<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.210> with<00:02:20.390> 3<00:02:21.020> foot<00:02:21.200> thick<00:02:21.380> walls

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
constructed it with 3 foot thick walls

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.250 
constructed it with 3 foot thick walls
so<00:02:22.250> he<00:02:23.030> was<00:02:23.180> Kai<00:02:23.330> he<00:02:23.510> built<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.840> sustainable

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
so he was Kai he built a sustainable

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.560 
so he was Kai he built a sustainable
building<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.830> know<00:02:24.920> back<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.310> early<00:02:26.180> 20th

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
building you know back in early 20th

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.040 
building you know back in early 20th
century

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.090 

Oh

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.770 

it's<00:02:37.100> terribly<00:02:37.610> important<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.330> we're<00:02:38.570> here

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
it's terribly important that we're here

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.650 
it's terribly important that we're here
in<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.230> middle<00:02:40.070> of<00:02:40.220> Kansas<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:41.420> a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
in the middle of Kansas in a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.950 
in the middle of Kansas in a
traditionally<00:02:42.560> conservative<00:02:43.010> area<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.960> the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
traditionally conservative area and the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.500 
traditionally conservative area and the
people<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.470> have<00:02:45.650> been<00:02:46.180> national<00:02:47.180> leaders

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
people here have been national leaders

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.070 
people here have been national leaders
so<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.350> think<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.800> has<00:02:48.920> tremendous<00:02:49.840> actual<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
so I think it has tremendous actual and

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:17.510 
so I think it has tremendous actual and
symbolic<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.280> class

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.580 

you
