today's<00:01:51.710> tip<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.370> me<00:01:54.530> typically<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.800> fall

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
today's tip to me typically in the fall

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.190 
today's tip to me typically in the fall
it<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:57.120> know<00:01:57.180> they're<00:01:57.300> feeding<00:01:57.480> up<00:01:57.690> heavy<00:01:57.960> on

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it you know they're feeding up heavy on

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.110 
it you know they're feeding up heavy on
shad<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.890> we're<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.220> try<00:01:59.370> to<00:01:59.460> fish<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
shad so we're going to try to fish a

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.990 
shad so we're going to try to fish a
bait<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.660> imitates<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> shed<00:02:01.850> guess<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
bait that imitates the shed guess you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.120 
bait that imitates the shed guess you
can't<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.300> get<00:02:03.660> too<00:02:03.870> much<00:02:04.050> closer<00:02:04.950> than

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
can't really get too much closer than

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.380 
can't really get too much closer than
this<00:02:06.620> they're<00:02:07.620> usually<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.190> schools<00:02:09.060> right

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
this they're usually in schools right

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510 
this they're usually in schools right
knowledge<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.990> there<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:11.100> know<00:02:11.220> fighting

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
knowledge so there you know fighting

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.550 
knowledge so there you know fighting
over<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.910> bait<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.510> thing<00:02:12.720> goes<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.140> through

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
over the bait this thing goes in through

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.990 
over the bait this thing goes in through
there<00:02:13.740> fast<00:02:14.900> can't<00:02:15.900> resist<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.730> now<00:02:17.730> that's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
there fast can't resist it now that's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.510 
there fast can't resist it now that's
saying<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.510> thinner<00:02:19.200> beats<00:02:19.500> jigs<00:02:20.010> don't<00:02:20.310> work

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
saying it thinner beats jigs don't work

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.030 
saying it thinner beats jigs don't work
because<00:02:20.670> they<00:02:20.880> do<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.710> good<00:02:22.860> way<00:02:23.010> to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
because they do this is a good way to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.550 
because they do this is a good way to
put<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> lot<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.610> fish<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.090> boat<00:02:24.330> fast<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.530> we

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
put a lot of fish in the boat fast so we

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.400 
put a lot of fish in the boat fast so we
found<00:02:26.190> out<00:02:26.400> today<00:02:28.700> what's<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:30.050> what<00:02:31.050> colors

largemouth<00:03:56.660> in<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.930> fall<00:03:57.220> yeah<00:03:59.200> we'll<00:04:00.200> catch

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
largemouth in the fall yeah we'll catch

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.530 
largemouth in the fall yeah we'll catch
them<00:04:00.560> when<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.860> gets<00:04:01.069> even<00:04:01.610> down<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.209> close

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
them when it gets even down to a close

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.690 
them when it gets even down to a close
to<00:04:02.720> 40<00:04:03.080> degrees<00:04:03.110> but<00:04:03.680> then<00:04:03.860> after<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.340> it's

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
to 40 degrees but then after that it's

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000 
to 40 degrees but then after that it's
it's<00:04:04.970> pretty<00:04:05.269> tough<00:04:05.569> to<00:04:05.630> catch<00:04:05.959> them<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.319> less

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
it's pretty tough to catch them in less

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.190 
it's pretty tough to catch them in less
than<00:04:07.160> 40<00:04:07.489> degree<00:04:07.760> water<00:04:08.000> then<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.810> got<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:08.989> go

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
than 40 degree water then you got to go

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.520 
than 40 degree water then you got to go
to<00:04:09.260> jigs<00:04:09.650> fish<00:04:10.100> real<00:04:10.400> slow<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:11.750> get<00:04:11.959> very<00:04:12.230> few
