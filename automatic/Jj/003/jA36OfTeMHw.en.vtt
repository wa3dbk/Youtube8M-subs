 good to all youtubers I'm tom act 1 and 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:09.710
 we are with the guide of the xbox one and 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.320
 this time we are going to see a little bit what is 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.240
 what so many times you worry 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.670
 because I do not talk to my friends like 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.130
 started groups and all that we're going to see 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.390
 groups for example let's start this 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.789
 what we had seen the applications 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.980
 It's worth starting a group and starting a 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.980
 group to talk to someone and 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.539
 You can add a member only if I 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.269
 right now invite more contacts you 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.339
 you can invite more contacts here and 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.690
 look for your friends worth and my friends who 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.870
 you have him there that they studied as they can 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.899
 be for example the act placed the hug 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.300
 placed and you invite him, you invite him 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.699
 he does not know what I just said 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.960
 invite valente now super important 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.579
 It's super important, you're not going to move 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.519
 to be able to speak right now or is it going to 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.499
 unite is like a team the i party and it 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.920
 is going to join and you do not have to talk to him 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:02.839
 you have a way of speaking but you 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.250
 you have to give enable group chat 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.900
 otherwise you will not be able to talk to them 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.020
 this is many times to the best invite 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.130
 someone is and it is said why 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 that's because you have not activated the chat 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.619
 of the group then you go to the button of the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.450
 half way you go to the group and here in 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.850
 group is already active and they are two 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.320
 members of the group was not yet 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.750
 activated you give active group chat 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.420
 then right now you see that it is 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.950

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.259
 It's worth the group then you see here 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.909

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.310

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.409
