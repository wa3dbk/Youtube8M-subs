so<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.820> case<00:01:15.000> enigma<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.690> worst

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
so in this case enigma is the worst

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.810 
so in this case enigma is the worst
particular<00:01:16.680> kind<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> hero<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> play<00:01:17.549> gets
