00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.840
 and clear 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.360
 until the eggs welcome once more 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.180
 to a video of baron field 4 today we are going to 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.150
 play a very special theme the great 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.270
 controversial subject of you are using mouse 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.740
 and keyboard or are you using a command 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.060
 everybody asks me all good 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.279
 the world but not many people me 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.929
 question all the time in the videos I 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.910
 leave comments and ask me in 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.130
 private and they say then is guix 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.560
 are you using the command you should 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.530
 use the mouse and the keyboard because yes 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.140
 you're not a bank panty and they tell me 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.000
 they hold it they ask me a lot and 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.730
 other people are very curious about 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.649
 how command is used in games 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.050
 of pc then I wanted to 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.930
 answer you with a video 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.539
 specific playing as always Baron 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.100
 it was a 4 completely with control or with 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.780
 control good and costa rica we say control 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.609
 in spain 'I know what they say in command 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.989
 other countries of Latin America I 'm not 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.949
 sure that here we say against 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.260
 the coal you know what I mean 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.090
 I 'm not using the mouse and the keyboard 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.700
 people ask me why and why not 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.170
 I can not use it and the best thing is when I 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.270
 they say all the time because that's what they tell me 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.310
 all the time you should change you're going to 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.110
 feel the difference of the truth 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.939
 the answer is yes, of course, feel the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.140
 difference every time I use the mouse 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.600
 and the keyboard the difference is 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.670
 very simple with small costs step 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.530
 unable to point at anyone not shot 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.990
 I can not change primary weapons 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.430
 I am against recharging is impossible 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.670
 because I have to go back to find the whore 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.110
 r on the keyboard then I do not achieve it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.929
 find the special things you 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.759
 they change 1 2 3 4 it 's impossible for me and in 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.049
 general every time I tried it the 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.720
 gaming experience has been a 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.119
 complete frustration now I understand what 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.130
 that people say the mouse by pure 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.119
 logic and pure extended of your hands 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.950
 It is much more accurate than your finger 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.810
 right let's say using the command and 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.399
 is that I use the command of xbox with 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.959
 cable cited on the pc no no no no used 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.880
 no special control and nothing 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.090
 simply buy the xbox that the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.619
 control of microsoft old xbox good in 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.530
 actually now I imagine that they see it 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.420
 like the pc xbox control because 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.489
 a strength because if you think about is no longer 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.410
 an old xbox control because nobody anymore 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.880
 has the original xbox but I think that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.620
 Microsoft just keeps selling it 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.030
 for this it is perfectly compatible 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.950
 with the pc is the best 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.209
 use most games you already saw 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.280
 as for example you have seen plants vs 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.870
 zombies most games recognize 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.760
 when you have the command 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.230
 they paint the colors and the cold embargo does not 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.610
 they do it that's why people ask me 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.200
 whether I'm using the mouse and the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.850
 keyboard 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.069
 because in variation does not appear any 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.770
 moment the little colors of the buttons 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.020
 as it says press and for this press 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.910
 go for the other electronic arts not what 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.770
 he did so although the game with the command is 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.800
 perfect and it's exactly the same as 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.630
 when you do not use it in the console anymore 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.090
 has an advantage that consoles do not 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.950
 has and is called key vending in 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.600
 games like embargo though you 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.739
 they can choose if they do not like the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.510
 configuration can choose 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.190
 simply where they want it to be done 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.720
 button on a bunch of games on consoles 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.819
 and also you do not have info in most 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.250
 of people do not use it in pc in changes 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.950
 so common to change the keys that you 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.680
 you want to use for different how you 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.840
 call for different I do not know things that 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.700
 you want me to do the game that is very 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.230
 common and one uses it the same way 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.510
 with control now 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.459
 and important with control for me is 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.750
 understand why I do it because heap 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.879
 of people will leave me and I know that it's going to 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.260
 there are a lot of people right now in 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.810
 the comments of this video saying 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.340
 that I am practicing them I felt 10,000 times 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.420
 better and after a few days that stops 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.099
 create blah blah blah because that's what 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.510
 I always feel but if you can 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.910
 see these clips and when I play and everything 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.920
 I do not believe and this is already a real opinion 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.140
 mine that I have to improve in the least 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.750
 using the mouse and keyboard the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.760
 extra aim that you believe me 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.170
 I can win with the mouse it's not going to 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.790
 make you no benefit because I from 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.290
 by themselves are means of cat and people who 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.910
 it's from afar we can not see why 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.030
 he used some you're long sights of 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.190
 four of the four x meets of four or four 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.489
 using your cards and so on when 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.049
 when I play any game and it includes 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.660
 games console one thing 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.569
 I forgot to use the console remote 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.769
 in games like call tour me or the game 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.359
 that is practically all the shooters 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.760
 when you are using the consoles 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.950
 there exists a small one file 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.229
 little thing that is called auto in and this 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.750
 car in is basically like a small 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.360
 little bag that allows you or helps you 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.860
 use the as it is called to point 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 correctly where 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.460
 the enemy in other words when you 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.569
 you raise your sights you will feel and what 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.860
 can any player try 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.680
 console in any game in any 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.879
 Southern expression in the field on cold tours 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.650
 and in any in any of the 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.360
 coauthors anywhere so 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.699
 when you point and an enemy passes 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.139
 in front of you running are going to 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.389
 realize that he looks at her like he pulls a 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.280
 little to the side where they pointed 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.580
 that's called auto and it's a way of 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.560
 help those who have console that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.389
 obviously it's the small advantage of 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.159
 console when everyone plays equal to 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.469
 be able to aim well for the lack of 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.210
 pressure that have mouse on pc that does not 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.710
 exists so where you point is 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.120
 exactly where will it go and there are 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.830
 a lot of people who have come from 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.800
 consoles and that has ever taken a 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.419
 control a command on the pc is going to give 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.949
 mind that that costs them a little 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.300
 because where you point is 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.680
 really where is pointing is not going to 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.389
 see no car and innovate any 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.639
 small machine help for 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.129
 try to pull the sights towards where 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.080
 is the enemy that is something that although 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.050
 I do not understand and I see how people say 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.669
 that would be a disadvantage nothing in how it 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.129
 call using the command yo 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.490
 strangely I got used to playing without 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.420
 car and in two males almost dyn 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.970
 from the first time I grabbed 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.280
 they went down 18 I made a video with alex vi 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.600
 he does a lot of assets with a male 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.130
 film 3 when you just bought it in the 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.030
 pc when he finishes buy my computer 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.400
 new and using the game with the mouse 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.740
 and the keyboard and you can see the 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.630
 level of suffering that I was carrying 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.300
 of being and that's how I did not feel that a 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.240
 good player of baron field 3 in the 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.250
 Play in the Xbox to be a fatal player 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.290
 in the pc and immediately I decided I'm not going to 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.040
 buy because it is a decision 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.440
 immediate 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.420
 I'm going to buy the remote and I'm not going to 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.740
 change anything now the explanation of by 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.300
 what will not change anything is not to be 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.070
 a troll with you is not because I 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.600
 believe that I will always be better with the 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.630
 keyboard or with the mouse or whatever 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.270
 the reason is very simple I have a way 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.740
 I think that I heard once 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.390
 steffi graf for those who do not know who 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.280
 steffi graf is a very famous tennis player 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.410
 that this case with andre agassi was very 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.170
 very good and not a thousand awards and it was like that 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.090
 like the Maria Sharapova of her time and 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.920
 steffi graf once said he's still in 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.450
 an interview that they did to him 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.730
 they asked why he did not practice 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.630
 more his backhand shot because it looked like 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.910
 It was him 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.070
 the weakest shot of her and she in 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.650
 change said that she practices so many 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.550
 hours a day take them out and when you 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.080
 they asked why he was not 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.420
 practicing whatever his weakness 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.130
 she said see no matter how much I 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.410
 practice the backhand shot and obviously 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.090
 it was practiced that it will never be my 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.830
 strong then I do not want to waste time 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.200
 practicing in something that is not what it is 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.790
 my specialty best practice a lot 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.030
 the serves that are what make me 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.220
 earn 90% of the games and the more 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.040
 I improve what I am good at what 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.290
 me in what I excel as it is called in 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.120
 what I do in what I exceed 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.370
 it's going to go better in my game and that's how it is 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.590
 as I think it also when I use 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.880
 my command to play for when 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.010
 practice with the command instead of 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.770
 waste time trying to improve in 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.600
 something that I already know that I am bad I do not feel 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.160
 control with the keyboard and see and you 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.690
 I say the problem for me at once 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.370
 is the mouse is never the mouse the 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.110
 problem is the keyboard the keyboard for 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.740
 It is very uncomfortable for me to use 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.320
 the fingers on the ring finger in the w 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.550
 the thumb I do not know what and squeeze each one 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.870
 of the price button very uncomfortable 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.889
 much easier to use only 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.870
 all 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:43.090
 the index and the thumb to be able to move 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.249
 and have agility in the game in the hand 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.080
 left for what am I going to practice and 

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:49.270
 try to suffer especially because to 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.310
 me the games to have fun using 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.770
 the mouse and the keyboard when I can play 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.800
 very very well and I'm sorry but the truth 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.810
 play pretty good with the mouse sorry 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.939
 with the control of the xbox in the 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.499
 computer if I can do better with 

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.759
 control the xbox and play the same as 

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:05.889
 how others play with the mouse and the 

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:07.330
 keyboard so what is the problem is not 

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:09.340
 good to leave you down 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.749
 comments please lower a little 

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.749
 the hate and until next time
