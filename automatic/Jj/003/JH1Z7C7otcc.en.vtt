00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
tragic slip those work well if you'd

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.390 
tragic slip those work well if you'd
like<00:04:43.380> wipe<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.740> board<00:04:43.950> but<00:04:44.040> they<00:04:44.160> still<00:04:44.340> have

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
a pretty strong creature out let's say

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.460 
a pretty strong creature out let's say
you<00:04:48.060> mutilated<00:04:48.510> 45<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.080> they<00:04:49.140> had<00:04:49.230> a<00:04:49.290> warm

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
you mutilated 45 and they had a warm

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.980 
you mutilated 45 and they had a warm
coil<00:04:49.730> then<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:50.940> just<00:04:51.060> try<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.300> slip<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.780> or

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
coil then you can just try to slip it or

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.490 
coil then you can just try to slip it or
whatever<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.770> want<00:04:53.010> or<00:04:53.700> actually<00:04:54.690> that's<00:04:55.350> a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
whatever you want or actually that's a

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.340 
whatever you want or actually that's a
bad<00:04:55.770> choice<00:04:56.430> because<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.810> would<00:04:57.960> get<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.200> two

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
bad choice because you would get the two

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.350 
bad choice because you would get the two
tokens<00:04:58.590> that's<00:04:59.190> pretty<00:04:59.640> dumb<00:04:59.850> I<00:04:59.910> would<00:05:00.210> never

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
tokens that's pretty dumb I would never

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.070 
tokens that's pretty dumb I would never
do<00:05:00.570> that<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.210> have<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.600> go<00:05:06.780> over<00:05:06.990> the
