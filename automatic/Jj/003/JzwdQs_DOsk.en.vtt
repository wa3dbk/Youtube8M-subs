know what are some of the common causes

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
know what are some of the common causes
of<00:00:58.289> injury<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> movements<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
of injury so that are the movements that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
of injury so that are the movements that
you're<00:01:00.570> doing<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> might<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.500> beneficial

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you're doing that might be beneficial

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
you're doing that might be beneficial
for<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:02.789> body<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.690> some<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
for your body and then some of the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
for your body and then some of the
movements<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.710> might<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.040> compromising

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
movements that might be compromising

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
movements that might be compromising
your<00:01:06.000> body<00:01:06.210> based<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.720> biomechanics<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
your body based on biomechanics and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
your body based on biomechanics and
anatomy<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> how<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.420> body<00:01:09.630> likes<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
anatomy and and how your body likes to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.969 
anatomy and and how your body likes to
move<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> second<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.590> need<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.860> know

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
move so a second thing you need to know

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
move so a second thing you need to know
to<00:01:17.159> promote<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> safe<00:01:18.360> practice<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.229> are

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to promote a safe practice is what are

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.100 
to promote a safe practice is what are
the<00:01:19.439> common<00:01:19.860> early<00:01:20.400> warning<00:01:21.150> signs<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.720> injury

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the common early warning signs of injury

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.170 
the common early warning signs of injury
so<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.549> signs<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.060> your

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
so these are the little signs that your

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.280 
so these are the little signs that your
body's<00:01:24.450> telling<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> might

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
body's telling you that you might

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
body's telling you that you might
actually<00:01:25.530> ignore<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.820> fully

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
actually ignore because you're not fully

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.960 
actually ignore because you're not fully
injured<00:01:27.689> yet<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.439> perhaps<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:29.880> we

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
injured yet but perhaps you know if we

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.460 
injured yet but perhaps you know if we
paid<00:01:30.180> attention<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.960> could<00:01:31.110> avoid

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
paid attention to them we could avoid

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.840 
paid attention to them we could avoid
injury<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:34.189> third<00:01:35.189> thing<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> know

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
injury a third thing you need to know

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
injury a third thing you need to know
are<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.479> are<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> culprits<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.259> poi

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
are what are the culprits and poi

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.319 
are what are the culprits and poi
practice<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.100> might<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.400> promoting<00:01:38.880> injury

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
practice that might be promoting injury

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
practice that might be promoting injury
so<00:01:39.960> we're<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.409> through<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so we're going to go through some of the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.039 
so we're going to go through some of the
common<00:01:41.340> point<00:01:41.579> moves<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.479> might<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.869> causing

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
common point moves that might be causing

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
common point moves that might be causing
some<00:01:43.290> shoulder<00:01:43.680> issues<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.340> example<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
some shoulder issues for example and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
some shoulder issues for example and
then<00:01:45.329> offer<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.780> some<00:01:45.960> strategies<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.890> safe

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
then offer up some strategies for safe

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
then offer up some strategies for safe
practice<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.210> avoid<00:01:48.299> injury<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
practice so that you can avoid injury in

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.970 
practice so that you can avoid injury in
yourself

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.080 

another<00:01:53.980> thing<00:01:54.220> we're<00:01:54.370> going<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.580> show<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:54.850> is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
another thing we're going to show you is

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.150 
another thing we're going to show you is
how<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.270> analyze<00:01:55.840> your<00:01:56.080> own<00:01:56.260> movement<00:01:56.830> as<00:01:56.980> well

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
how to analyze your own movement as well

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.620 
how to analyze your own movement as well
as<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> movement<00:01:57.820> of<00:01:57.910> one<00:01:58.120> of<00:01:58.240> your<00:01:58.360> friends

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
as the movement of one of your friends

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.510 
as the movement of one of your friends
so<00:01:59.290> this<00:01:59.470> will<00:01:59.620> be<00:01:59.710> done<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.160> can<00:02:00.220> identify

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
so this will be done so you can identify

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.490 
so this will be done so you can identify
what<00:02:01.030> movement<00:02:01.240> patterns<00:02:01.780> are<00:02:01.990> good<00:02:02.170> for<00:02:02.350> your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
what movement patterns are good for your

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.620 
what movement patterns are good for your
body<00:02:02.650> and<00:02:03.100> what<00:02:03.340> perhaps<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.030> might<00:02:04.150> be<00:02:04.330> able

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
to tweak in order to promote safe

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.910 
to tweak in order to promote safe
movement<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.900> we're<00:02:14.050> also<00:02:14.230> going<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.650> show<00:02:14.860> you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
movement so we're also going to show you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.010 
movement so we're also going to show you
how<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> warm<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:15.790> properly<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.720> will<00:02:16.900> be

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
how to warm up properly and this will be

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.380 
how to warm up properly and this will be
some<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> key<00:02:18.250> components<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.030> warm-up

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
some of the key components of a warm-up

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.120 
some of the key components of a warm-up
which<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.810> not<00:02:19.960> only<00:02:20.020> stretching<00:02:20.920> stretching

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
which is not only stretching stretching

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.800 
which is not only stretching stretching
is<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.490> part<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:22.000> warm-up<00:02:22.330> but<00:02:22.480> there's<00:02:22.660> much

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
is a part of a warm-up but there's much

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.690 
is a part of a warm-up but there's much
more<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.470> than<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.550> can

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
start your practice as a body that is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.550 
start your practice as a body that is
ready<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.709> move<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:31.330> finally<00:02:31.990> we're<00:02:32.290> going<00:02:32.410> to
