 hello friends welcome to this one does not 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.560
 let's go good 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.210
 this time we are going to more 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.949
 to watch a video previously and it has gone up 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.920
 but I have to explain a little 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.010
 best 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.460
 and well maybe they understood us 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.230
 nothing 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.230
 I see that much and defended 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.350
 I was supporting and well let's start 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.360
 with this problem to solve what 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.890
 Well first, let's press the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.970
 keys during your escape 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.730
 and the keys but we also have to 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.339
 press with control 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.040
 to open what would be the window for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.300
 benefit to pay everyone wants to know 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.690
 also what it says 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.540
 even though 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.409
 well once here we go to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.810
 our browser to 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.640
 execute forgiveness to download the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.580
 necessary files that we will be 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.730
 using 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.860
 we will be using what they would be 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.460
 he made it from our operating system and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.570
 do restricted or 64 bits 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.530
 and we would be also downloading 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.270
 what is in Moscow 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.490
 and if they want, we would also be 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.729
 being the author in so that it mattered 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.729
 all right 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.370
 and well those would be the files that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.170
 we need 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.010
 so we're going to do a previous 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.010
 let's write 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.509
 Thank you 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.950
 let's execute 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.759
 previously as the browser that has 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.860
 whether it's firefox 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.710
 where they have let's run with the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.660
 exception 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.660
 exit 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.819
 if we want to open another program 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.819
 thought 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.770
 here we go to the link that they leave 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.620
 video description 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.270
 to go actors are worth in my case and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.990
 I'm going to do what would be the progress 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.990
 towards his 4 a 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.560
 for this I will open what would be the 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.300
 limit 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.209
 simply click on the link and 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.770
 let him know to open the dollar in case 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.830
 that they do not have installed because they have 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.310
 to be watch before to open it 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.120
 well, we are waiting here for the one that loads 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.040
 and it is already 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.840
 here we are not going to download all 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.220
 let's go to one 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.460
 if you prefer, it's worth 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.100
 for those who have the 64-bit 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.760
 the first is 64 bits and they go to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.710
 download what it says is for jockey 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.050
 they put marking ok 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.970
 for those who have 32 bits it will be 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.970
 more work and also seek 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.170
 it is fixed on the table 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.170
 Y 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.190
 32 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.370
 good 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.670
 once this is done we are going to go 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.780
 and our file downloaded in case of 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.060
 that has already been downloaded to us if it is 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.410
 they do not know what operating system in their 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:02.360
 pc ok let's execute a new task 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.100
 and let's write about x day game this 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.250
 day to see 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.700
 our operating system 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.390
 if you look at my case it's windows 8.1 2 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.459
 64 bits 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.590
 download and 64 bit so nothing 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.900
 we go file imputed to the task we are going 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.920
 to the file downloaded in my case what 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.920
 keep here 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.650
 banesto the archives and here we will have the 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.050
 iso valen we have in floor format you 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.270
 let's give right click to see with damage 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.370
 tour 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.409
 once this is done and they do a lot 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.809
 image we go to this team 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.529
 and if they quote, we already have the unit here 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.529
 mounted 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.389
 once here you do not accept 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.989
 will be executed and we will register the 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.989
 suitcases 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.889
 We waited for what we wanted to charge 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:12.849
 we was rector and we also 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.849
 will do this if we want 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.139
 well here is our too 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.139
 no thanks 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.190
 wait for a point to load 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.869
 a second aspect the terms of 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:33.909
 leave and let's see Caesar let's go to 

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:36.219
 keep personal files and 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:38.639
 applications like some not to lose 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.639
 no file 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.550
 and lic 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.510
 well this is also a little bit maximum 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:55.230
 with about 5 to 10 minutes 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.380
 a minimum that I go or less like that is that 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.289
 I could press the video and when I 'm 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.279
 nothing 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.279
 I will resume it 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.730
 and good and now downloaded will come out 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.830
 this we can change the selection but 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.870
 I do not recommend because we already told him 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.800
 correct selection ok let's go once 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.800
 I was installing 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.840
 for installing 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:26.320
 this will also take a little bit like that 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.460
 that nothing what is going to happen is to finish 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.430
 this installation 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.350
 starting the pc normally and I'm going to 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.460
 ask for the initial settings as 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.610
 yes 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.680
 finished installing what is like that 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.070
 nothing I pause the video here 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.969
 I will be back 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.219
 the mouse 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.649
 and well once the 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:55.929
 recovery because here is everything 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:58.990

00:06:55.929 --> 00:07:01.520
 all that then 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:07.970
 that would be all for 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:11.720
