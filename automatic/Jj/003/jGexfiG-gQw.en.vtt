00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.680 

okay<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.890> i<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.670> figured<00:02:13.300> out<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
okay now i just figured out the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.870 
okay now i just figured out the
strumming<00:02:14.200> pattern<00:02:14.590> based<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.640> what<00:02:15.790> i've

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
strumming pattern based on what i've

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.190 
strumming pattern based on what i've
been<00:02:15.910> playing<00:02:16.330> but<00:02:16.599> i<00:02:16.720> don't<00:02:16.900> really<00:02:16.959> remember

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
been playing but i don't really remember

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.170 
been playing but i don't really remember
what<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.830> was<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.250> i<00:02:18.280> played<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> video

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
what it was that i played in the video

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.270 
what it was that i played in the video
and<00:02:19.510> i<00:02:20.110> can't<00:02:20.319> really<00:02:20.440> check<00:02:20.680> because<00:02:20.890> i<00:02:21.040> have

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
and i can't really check because i have

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.630 
and i can't really check because i have
to<00:02:21.400> watch<00:02:21.580> over<00:02:21.790> my<00:02:22.030> dog<00:02:22.709> has<00:02:23.709> big<00:02:23.980> doors<00:02:24.250> but

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
to watch over my dog has big doors but

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.750 
to watch over my dog has big doors but
yeah<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:26.170> yeah<00:02:26.410> i'm<00:02:26.830> gonna<00:02:27.069> tell<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.519> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
yeah so yeah i'm gonna tell you the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.460 
yeah so yeah i'm gonna tell you the
strumming<00:02:28.090> pattern<00:02:28.390> right<00:02:28.599> now<00:02:28.780> because<00:02:29.290> it

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
strumming pattern right now because it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.979 
strumming pattern right now because it
is<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.060> other<00:02:31.209> strumming<00:02:31.660> patterns

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
is like the other strumming patterns

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.020 
is like the other strumming patterns
that<00:02:32.170> I've<00:02:32.319> taught<00:02:32.800> before<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:33.849> a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
that I've taught before but it's a

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.380 
that I've taught before but it's a
little<00:02:34.269> more<00:02:34.450> confusing<00:02:35.220> ok<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:36.910> down

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390
