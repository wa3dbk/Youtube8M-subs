real that's what i was thinking I'm like

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.969 
real that's what i was thinking I'm like
uh<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.600> can<00:01:58.720> either<00:01:58.810> plan<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.530> go<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.830> try

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
uh you can either plan and go and try

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.309 
uh you can either plan and go and try
and<00:02:00.039> Kahlan<00:02:00.460> or<00:02:00.640> just<00:02:00.789> die<00:02:01.000> right<00:02:01.360> and

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
and Kahlan or just die right and

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.570 
and Kahlan or just die right and
obviously<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.830> flying<00:02:03.069> thing<00:02:03.159> isn't<00:02:03.550> working

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
obviously the flying thing isn't working

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.300 
obviously the flying thing isn't working
out<00:02:03.880> too<00:02:04.090> well<00:02:04.119> for<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.509> ready

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
out too well for you ready

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.370 
out too well for you ready
nope<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.080> end<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.319> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
nope and that is not the end of the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.720 
nope and that is not the end of the
level<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.830> think<00:02:12.100> that's<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> end<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
level but I think that's the end of the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.540 
level but I think that's the end of the
enemies<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.330> rest<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> level<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.520> I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
enemies for the rest of the level so I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.520
