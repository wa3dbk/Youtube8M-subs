00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 welcome ladies and gentlemen to the second 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.230
 video of today this is my road to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.210
 arsenal series nothing has changed since 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.320
 last episode of sentence I have not 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.540
 a new player in the meantime 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 bought but we start right away with it 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.450
 first game with that and starts one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.699
 bit must be in some places 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.289
 but the lestienne sitting in front of him on the left 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.970
 though 80 you fitness of course not really 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.080
 nie nie you but I do not much 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 choice and finance 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
 Anyway I will play the game first 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.050
 in the seasons you will know when it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.519
 in rottum it became natural and me 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.910
 gotta be in the dude in parisian but 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.700
 the logo and his team is also reasonable 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.530
 beast it is almost a full lie 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 you see, Vincent Kompany also 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 very good player is just in it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.540
 but you start pretty easily here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.340
 get listener for arrange add the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.780
 game played for 15 minutes 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.090
 paul come to bender a gang state 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.829
 completely free can therefore head in freely 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.050
 and that's how he makes it huge this is mine 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.180
 favorite celebration it's just the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.340
 dead fish is two point zero celebration 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 just keep busy x in color 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.390
 she started but the fine coupon I stand 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.969
 unicorn anyway it is just this 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 exactly what i needed 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.850
 but here he has the ball the bait 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.010
 just're sitting still gives good death 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.500
 before he forgot that is then free and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.600
 For a long time he offered himself ballarin and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.909
 he makes it one of great action 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.259
 him good attack too, pretty clever that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 before anyone out anyway 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.920
 white pepper that bloke is 160 or so 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 but well he does it and made it 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.520
 a one of nothing to say about push 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.110
 just well done of him and try 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.939
 to win this competition because I have now 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.960
 all your stress and the instrument plays 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.159
 in the lost 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.900
 so I have to start a bit of growth 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.020
 makes me here so he continues with green 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.430
 at the start of the second half one 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 absolute world code i will be tomorrow 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 freckle complain long shot or anything 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.810
 in that direction 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.670
 but this is an absolute beauty this nothing 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.750
 about to say beautiful from then with 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.220
 someone from someone with very good ones 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.540
 long shots I know that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 you can get very good for that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 and yes fantastic or nothing to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 say fine goal of m he is again 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 for that is always a shame now so you get 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.700
 a penalty for this how then how the fuck 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.829
 is busy and pebble that lays with bad note 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.530
 how good he gets one can do it 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.119
 take more but no food with a lot 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.840
 I never had why he really gives that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.459
 speed up here 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.649
 but he never shoots him again 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.590
 touches and some ball does not enter and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.239
 He bounces back like you 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.220
 what is missing on purpose, you know that there is something 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.050
 goes wrong and here you get too much 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.120
 living and way too much space with nicolas 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.160
 inside the ship inside again the pole and such 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 twisted 87 sent it on equal 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.730
 height 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.290
 very deserves in my opinion because 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.459
 anyway i'm gonna be nice anyway 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.230
 good chance of that 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.280
 and if you change such a penalty and 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.440
 express less bad play 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.090
 drug fagron a new drawn 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.090
 all the way around I score 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.650
 the winning goal in the 90th minute with 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.390
 courrier 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.920
 your god in your greenhouse and never on the other 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.480
 must pronounce the argentines 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.099
 in the middle right the address for stands bar 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.750
 little choice sticking together is bad 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.980
 but he scores the three two and so 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.760
 I find my first match in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.140
 seasons 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.459
 everything along first really serious let's go 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.920
 you naturally like what you really like 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.299
 but with someone gay the way I start 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.280
 said so i need him new players 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.989
 and i can't pay too much i have to 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.160
 of course a bit of longwear players 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.959
 to target 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.040
 we do what I just cheaper and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.269
 the only mistake I make is completely 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.489
 to the left of your screen you see an object 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.829
 seventh are also with 13 contracts on it 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.450
 and can now cost less at a 200 cost 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.650
 wonder you know i'll take it then it is 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.970
 but very few coaches on which you put it 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.459
 actually about good oxlade-chamberlain 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.620
 I bought new and that is mainly about 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.859
 that knife is actually not like that at all 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.329
 good 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.340
 stronger with her you too bad 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.139
 really the worst player is used 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.730
 it maybe i should just keep going 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.340
 also put your email address and that career 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.599
 here the laundry that did not fit us completely 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.920
 more an inch with which that one 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.450
 good connection after all 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.160
 so injured you know what I thought 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.989
 do it a little bit differently 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.500
 and this pack of dude has a village like it 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.380
 logo and the team 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.790
 yes this is getting heavy that the feels it too 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.010
 all of you just know this is coming 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.260
 and you are not going to do a single kut thing and 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.180
 I can really need it because me 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.709
 I have nothing to say framing sometimes until 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.500
 incorporating this for example this this start 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.780
 here it all starts how then you know 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.660
 the ride that blocks the fabianski ball 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.400
 ball and he just comes back 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.019
 you should almost insane it from here 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.849
 maybe those with good ravens 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.340
 keeper yes this is a bit strange 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.389
 psychological or silent and claw angle 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.069
 certainly not understand but not there 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.859
 wrong in this is no complaining 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.780
 this is just because I have observed 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.880
 it's so annoying 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.799
 I mean what's bounce who's already over the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.870
 place it's not nice it's really not 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.760
 I would also like to blast 'sikorski on here 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.620
 great deal the roads I have 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.820
 Well covered now and this is good for it 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.280
 that you do not miss anything commands this 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.170
 comprima finished from him but hereafter 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.210
 is really going to break hell and then I have 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.490
 it really about hell because look here it is 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.200
 start of the second half and he goes 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.300
 win within my child arian 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.310
 I take the ball I work and goalkeeper away 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.050
 and clash against each other 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.840
 keeper saves and then there is another good one 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.760
 band everywhere there is someone in this jar 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.170
 it's unbelievable 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.940
 during the break he had six big triplets 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.830
 I do five lap but the new goal 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.620
 I fear you for everything 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.150
 is this is so kind it happens 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.240
 so every time seven and I do n't go anymore 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.230
 stop 240 for I believe or so and it 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.210
 is pretty weird but this for example 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.320
 you also know how then 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.540
 so for them that of course perfect 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.730
 and everywhere about clumsy flickr 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.450
 flickr bye bye and until it's the game 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.100
 This is also who again because every time 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.230
 I winter Fabianski not the best keeper 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.940
 your taste that is pure nonsense 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.170
 this is nonsense this nico vermeer or 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.690
 or mulder or title still had 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.370
 how again someone 5 and behind this 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.450
 time and you feel it just now 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.070
 depend on you just know from that 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.520
 indicates weeks is not empty 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.140
 and here if yes 600 non swb band 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.140
 but again a good tire 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.280
 roberto firmino market is 6 one from me 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.050
 for you what 's really going the way 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.550
 which is just very annoying and all that 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.780
 losers with 6 one 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.250
 the build i reasonable of the fun it is 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.300
 again such a pussy at least that was 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.310
 normally been much better 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.840
 sir case thank you so much for it 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.850
 I hope you like this series 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.230
 like it and that is the reason 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.600
 why started and why taken by 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.460
 go because I know that as I 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.270
 actually have a good team then go 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.100
 I was winning my matches 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.090
 exhalations we put now it becomes 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.020
 just a feeling difficult and that will be 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.030
 then bite through 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.830
 sir case drop and like this video that 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.150

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.250
