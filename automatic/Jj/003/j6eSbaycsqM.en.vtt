starting from the front of the guitar

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.830 
starting from the front of the guitar
and<00:00:13.780> going<00:00:14.079> backwards<00:00:14.589> we've<00:00:14.889> got<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.280> volume

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
and going backwards we've got the volume

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.560 
and going backwards we've got the volume
treble<00:00:16.840> and<00:00:16.990> bass<00:00:17.620> controls<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:19.180> that<00:00:19.330> it<00:00:19.420> once

treble and bass controls do that it once
again<00:00:19.720> it's<00:00:20.290> volume<00:00:20.830> it's<00:00:21.160> just<00:00:21.310> closest<00:00:21.730> to

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
again it's volume it's just closest to

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.240 
again it's volume it's just closest to
the<00:00:22.060> front<00:00:22.630> of<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.900> guitar<00:00:23.070> travel<00:00:24.070> in<00:00:24.160> the

middle and bass towards your belly

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.529 
middle and bass towards your belly
that's<00:00:26.440> an<00:00:26.620> easy<00:00:26.770> way<00:00:26.920> to<00:00:26.950> think<00:00:27.220> about<00:00:27.430> it<00:00:27.550> the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
that's an easy way to think about it the

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.500 
that's an easy way to think about it the
all<00:00:29.530> three<00:00:29.860> controls<00:00:30.280> have<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:30.550> center<00:00:30.970> detent

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
all three controls have a center detent

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.450 
all three controls have a center detent
or<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.810> little<00:00:32.230> spot<00:00:32.559> where<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:33.010> can<00:00:33.159> feel<00:00:33.339> the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
or a little spot where you can feel the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.520 
or a little spot where you can feel the
knob<00:00:33.640> kind<00:00:33.969> of<00:00:34.059> stop<00:00:34.300> in<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.600> middle<00:00:34.899> that's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
knob kind of stop in the middle that's

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.590 
knob kind of stop in the middle that's
the<00:00:35.859> flat<00:00:36.159> position<00:00:36.399> for<00:00:36.909> the<00:00:36.999> tone<00:00:37.210> controls

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
the flat position for the tone controls

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.630 
the flat position for the tone controls
which<00:00:37.809> means<00:00:38.050> neither<00:00:38.260> boosts<00:00:38.859> nor<00:00:39.100> cut<00:00:39.370> and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
which means neither boosts nor cut and

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.259 
which means neither boosts nor cut and
on<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.390> volume<00:00:40.629> it's<00:00:40.989> about<00:00:41.230> half<00:00:41.499> way<00:00:41.739> up<00:00:42.269> now

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
on the volume it's about half way up now

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.149 
on the volume it's about half way up now
the<00:00:43.329> volume<00:00:43.510> control<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:44.079> unique<00:00:44.409> it's<00:00:44.920> more

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
the volume control is unique it's more

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.669 
the volume control is unique it's more
like<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.399> studio<00:00:45.850> fader<00:00:46.359> where<00:00:46.989> if<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.499> can

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
turn it up or down and you won't have

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.020 
turn it up or down and you won't have
any<00:00:49.510> tone<00:00:49.809> loss<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.859> feel<00:00:51.429> free<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.699> put<00:00:51.999> that

any tone loss so feel free to put that

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.849 
any tone loss so feel free to put that
where<00:00:52.300> it's<00:00:52.420> comfortable<00:00:52.659> for<00:00:53.199> performance

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
you pay attention to the the plus and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.700 
you pay attention to the the plus and
minus<00:01:44.980> on<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.370> on<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:46.360> terminals<00:01:46.900> they<00:01:47.440> fit

into the slots here only one way and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.560 
into the slots here only one way and
then<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:51.010> box<00:01:51.280> will<00:01:51.550> only<00:01:51.730> slide<00:01:52.090> back<00:01:52.330> into

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
then the box will only slide back into

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
and you're good to go

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.640 
and you're good to go
now<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.490> battery<00:01:57.880> should<00:01:57.970> last<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.600> good<00:01:59.170> 40

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650

hours<00:01:59.980> or<00:02:00.130> more<00:02:00.370> of<00:02:00.430> gigging<00:02:01.060> time<00:02:01.330> now<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.080> say

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
hours or more of gigging time now we say

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.860 
hours or more of gigging time now we say
that<00:02:02.680> because<00:02:03.159> we<00:02:03.730> have<00:02:03.850> no<00:02:04.030> idea<00:02:04.390> how<00:02:04.600> all<00:02:04.750> the

the coolest things about the expression

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.560 
the coolest things about the expression
system<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.770> Pro<00:03:02.100> ready<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.880> when<00:03:03.450> we

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
system is that it's Pro ready so when we

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.690 
system is that it's Pro ready so when we
mean<00:03:03.810> by<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.920> can<00:03:05.070> actually<00:03:05.250> run<00:03:05.580> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
mean by that is you can actually run it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.540 
mean by that is you can actually run it
in<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.910> professional<00:03:06.830> application<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.040> a

gain more signal out of the guitar and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.090 
gain more signal out of the guitar and
you<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.180> run<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.630> drive<00:03:18.959> long<00:03:19.290> cable<00:03:19.860> runs

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
you can run and drive long cable runs

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.940 
you can run and drive long cable runs
because<00:03:20.640> it's<00:03:20.820> low<00:03:21.030> impedance<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:22.769> do
