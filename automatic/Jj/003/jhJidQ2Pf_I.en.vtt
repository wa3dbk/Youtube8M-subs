00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.920
 what pretty much all runners are 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.710
 push are the so-called stabis 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.750
 stabilization exercises for 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 the body center so practically the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 hull area from under the ribs up 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.090
 direction thighs 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 this is the old apparatus where the two 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.890
 are fixed and especially at longer 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 stretch when the body tires extremely 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 important that back belly buttock and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 so on the body keeping stabilizers are 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.570
 nothing else than that just here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.360
 make sure that they are words 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.070
 Now let's have a wonderful time 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 make it on bridges too 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.930
 very important my paradise discipline them 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.690
 supported 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.360
 yes so I'm doing 800,000 pieces yes 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.100
 not why I poison this one 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.920
 middle must come to be stable 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.900
 and straight and go but just 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.420
 say because I also on his stallion 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 depended by scratch is only the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.290
 have high behind me exactly I 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.290
 enough for everyone 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.550
 Two English gamekeepers are running around the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.550
 bet how is the winner ranger
