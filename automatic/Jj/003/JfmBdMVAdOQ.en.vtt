light for a big 240 the blade length is
244<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.339> this<00:01:02.519> so<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:02.850> oversized

it's not superb fit and finish on this

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.230 
it's not superb fit and finish on this
but<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.660> good<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.550> it's<00:01:53.550> got<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.760> nice<00:01:53.970> warm

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
but it's good and it's got a nice warm

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.270 
but it's good and it's got a nice warm

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
feel to it the handle circumference on

feel to it the handle circumference on
this<00:01:56.550> right<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:56.940> here<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.720> about<00:01:58.620> seventy

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
this right about here is about seventy

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.430 
this right about here is about seventy
nine<00:01:59.730> millimeter<00:02:00.120> 3<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.480> 1/8<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:00.990> fits<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
nine millimeter 3 and 1/8 so it fits the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.160 
nine millimeter 3 and 1/8 so it fits the
sides<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.310> perfectly<00:02:02.810> pretty<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:03.990> fit

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
sides and I perfectly pretty good fit

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.610 
sides and I perfectly pretty good fit
and<00:02:04.260> finish<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.520> right<00:02:05.700> side<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
and finish on this the right side of the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.889 
and finish on this the right side of the
soil<00:02:07.620> into<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.069> Emoto<00:02:08.580> our<00:02:08.789> neck<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.300> finished

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
soil into the Emoto our neck is finished

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.899 
soil into the Emoto our neck is finished
a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.110> bit<00:02:10.229> nicer<00:02:10.619> than<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.890> left<00:02:11.160> side<00:02:11.250> so

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
a little bit nicer than the left side so

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.009 
a little bit nicer than the left side so
if<00:02:12.000> you're<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> lefty<00:02:12.510> you'll<00:02:12.629> probably<00:02:12.780> want

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
if you're a lefty you'll probably want

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.809 
if you're a lefty you'll probably want
to<00:02:13.079> sand<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.469> down<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:14.010> little<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
to sand this down just a little bit the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.610 
to sand this down just a little bit the
spine<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> think<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.540> pretty<00:02:15.689> well<00:02:15.959> okay<00:02:16.319> some

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
spine I think is pretty well okay some

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.240 
spine I think is pretty well okay some
people<00:02:16.650> might<00:02:17.010> want

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
people might want

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.010 
people might want
hit<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.820> edges<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.360> little<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> think

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
hit the edges just a little but I think

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.210 
hit the edges just a little but I think
if<00:02:19.110> you're<00:02:19.230> righty<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.860> ready<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.100> go

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
if you're righty this is ready to go

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.700 
if you're righty this is ready to go
outside<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.670> box<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.570> box<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
outside of the box out of the box the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.230 
outside of the box out of the box the
out<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.100> box<00:02:23.190> edge<00:02:23.490> on<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.000> quite

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
out of the box edge on this is quite

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.520 
out of the box edge on this is quite
good<00:02:24.450> I'll<00:02:24.570> give<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> about<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.990> six<00:02:25.260> out<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.410> ten

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
good I'll give it about a six out of ten

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.010 
good I'll give it about a six out of ten
it's<00:02:25.860> well<00:02:26.040> done<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.970> pretty<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.780> very

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
it's well done it's pretty it's very

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
it's well done it's pretty it's very
sharp<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> does<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:28.950> some<00:02:29.010> tooth<00:02:29.400> or

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
sharp and it does have some tooth or

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.490 
sharp and it does have some tooth or
bite<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.690> well<00:02:30.810> done<00:02:31.020> edge<00:02:31.200> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
bite to it so it's a well done edge and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.290 
bite to it so it's a well done edge and
I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:31.980> usable<00:02:32.820> out<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.090> box

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
I think it's usable out of the box

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.640 
I think it's usable out of the box
unless<00:02:33.540> you're<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> good<00:02:33.990> sharpener<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.440> want<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
unless you're a good sharpener I want to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410 
unless you're a good sharpener I want to
really<00:02:34.890> put<00:02:35.070> your<00:02:35.280> own<00:02:35.340> edge<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.820> here<00:02:36.300> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
really put your own edge on it here is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.080 
really put your own edge on it here is
the<00:02:36.540> profile<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> blade<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:38.730> one<00:02:38.790> is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the profile of the blade this one is

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.850 
the profile of the blade this one is
definitely<00:02:39.300> slanted<00:02:39.930> towards<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.290> continuous

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
definitely slanted towards a continuous

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.190 
definitely slanted towards a continuous
curve<00:02:41.160> even<00:02:41.430> at<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.850> heel<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
curve even at the heel this is not a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.940 
curve even at the heel this is not a
real<00:02:43.470> flat<00:02:43.830> long<00:02:44.700> heel<00:02:45.120> type<00:02:45.630> profile<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.470> if

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
real flat long heel type profile so if

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.320 
real flat long heel type profile so if
you're<00:02:47.190> looking<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.910> may<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.150> be

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
you're looking for that this may not be

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.130 
you're looking for that this may not be
your<00:02:48.570> blade<00:02:48.810> let's<00:02:49.530> put<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.040> our<00:02:50.400> little

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
your blade let's put it on our little

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.570 
your blade let's put it on our little
sample<00:02:52.140> cutting<00:02:52.890> board<00:02:53.100> here<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.160> can<00:02:56.340> see

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
sample cutting board here so you can see

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.280 
sample cutting board here so you can see
it<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:56.850> at<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.450> heel<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.810> knife<00:02:57.959> you've<00:02:58.170> got

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
it they at the heel the knife you've got

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.650 
it they at the heel the knife you've got
a<00:02:58.320> little<00:02:58.530> bit<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.770> backpedal<00:02:59.250> there<00:02:59.660> so

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
a little bit of a backpedal there so

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.320 
a little bit of a backpedal there so
it's<00:03:01.410> not<00:03:01.530> dead<00:03:01.920> flat<00:03:02.130> at<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.310> heel<00:03:02.520> at<00:03:02.730> all<00:03:03.030> so

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
it's not dead flat at the heel at all so

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.180 
it's not dead flat at the heel at all so
there's<00:03:03.510> even<00:03:03.630> some<00:03:03.959> reverse<00:03:04.530> curve<00:03:04.890> at<00:03:05.070> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
there's even some reverse curve at the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.360 
there's even some reverse curve at the
heel<00:03:05.370> some<00:03:06.120> belly<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.630> heel<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
heel some belly at the heel and so you

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.000 
heel some belly at the heel and so you
can<00:03:08.520> get<00:03:08.670> pretty<00:03:08.940> high<00:03:09.380> before<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.650> started

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
can get pretty high before you started

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.890 
can get pretty high before you started
hitting<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.280> board<00:03:11.550> I'm<00:03:11.970> boy<00:03:12.270> up<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:12.690> for

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
hitting the board I'm boy up here for

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.930 
hitting the board I'm boy up here for
you<00:03:13.020> start<00:03:13.200> hitting<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> tip<00:03:13.709> into<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> board

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
you start hitting the tip into the board

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.360 
you start hitting the tip into the board
so<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:15.930> definitely<00:03:16.380> got<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> nice<00:03:16.890> gentle

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
so it's definitely got a nice gentle

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.110 
so it's definitely got a nice gentle
curve<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.030> for<00:03:18.270> Rocking<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:21.000> you're

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
curve to it for Rocking but so if you're

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.670 
curve to it for Rocking but so if you're
again<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.750> want<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> super<00:03:22.260> flat<00:03:22.470> knife

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
again if you want a super flat knife
