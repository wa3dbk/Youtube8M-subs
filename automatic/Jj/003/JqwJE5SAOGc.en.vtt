00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello my people how are your server 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.350
 as always maricruz and today we are going to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.870
 try the song of roman saints mommy 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.690
 the guitar has several errors in the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.610
 which I do not know is not perceived a good pattern 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.400
 concrete as for the pointer of the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.320
 song and what I bring you here is a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 easier version so you can 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 touch it without any problem 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.109
 and let's start with the tutorial the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.789
 tabla tourÃ© is here below as I said 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.170
 You can do any 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.170
 type of plucking can even scratch 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.000
 they can do puntear 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.760
 they can 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.760
 and make them also the sun's logo 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.270
 to 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:04.250
 so when I start singing the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.360
 verse to itself in C major to minor a 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.860
 higher 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.860
 I am a 3rd 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.950
 there is a variation that they make in the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.010
 recording and so they can simplify it 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.710
 as it is in the recording because you leave 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.710
 in F major with 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.710
 here 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.930
 this morning 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.200
 and with the accept when it passes only the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200
 table 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.520
 i 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 ah 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.370
 now 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.110
 no no no 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.110
