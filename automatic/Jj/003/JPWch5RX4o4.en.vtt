 today about sneakers air jordan 10 100 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.180
 retro tags i.e. reissue 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.610

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.440
 cool gray or infrared 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.750
 it seems to say that is right 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.070
 cool gray and infrared if 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.830
 translate into Russian 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.519
 and of course besides these mouse colors 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.760

 of the recommended price of 170 dollars 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.830
 but in Russia it was a little less than 7,000 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.589
 rubles but now I will tell you a few words about 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.780
 creating but then in materials and other 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.020
 little things 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.440
 for the first time this model went on sale in 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.860
 1995 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.299
 Well, with a price of 125 dollars and these 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.240
 sneakers were called sneakers 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.539
 returns after all michael returned to the nba 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.070
 after the official retirement 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.640
 Joir came out in these sneakers match 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.490
 vs 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.869
 Indiana Pacers failed this 19 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.390
 march again in 1995 but in colors 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.340
 chicago but also one feature 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.299
 present now on these sneakers 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.820
 it was in this place that figure 45 was embroidered 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.929
 they are familiar to us 23 that is not the one 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.310
 the number under which jordan played before 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.049
 designers remained Tinker Hatfield 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.229
 but the main piece of sneakers can be 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.049
 count the sole in order to show the world who 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.369
 back in the game here and and listed 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.469
 merits michael to his departure well now 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.219
 let's see more at the bottom will see 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.659
 there is a newcomer of the year well and will also show us 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.710
 him 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.369
 63 points against the Boston Seltiks 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:15.540
 87 monasteries shot the most points 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.299
 for the season if not confused then 2868 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.530
 with an average of 35 points for 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:26.670
 every game in season 88 jordan won 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 slam dunk contest eighty ninth well 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.239
 how to say it was included 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.090
 in symbolic 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.739
 defensive team in the nineties 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.060
 Jordan shot sixty nine 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:41.129
 cleveland points 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.489
 but then three years in a row is 91 92 93 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:49.189
 he got the mtp that is the title itself 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:53.250
 valuable player and won the championship and here 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:56.730
 1994 is written beyond what translates as 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.260
 after or what hint that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.669
 the story is not finished yet 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.230
 Well, a lot of things ahead but the rest 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.629
 you can say sneakers simple 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.269
 it is believed that they resemble the ninth 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.959
 model, although personally I do not see much 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.450
 similarity 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.120
 Well, they say design redesigned a bit 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.540
 in order to make it more modern and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.579
 You can say fresh in this case 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.280
 his nubuck prevails 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:28.290
 we see from all directions here now 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.079
 take a close well honestly yourself add this 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.049
 The material is very pleasant to the touch and 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.949
 more abortions see our you from both 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:42.049
 sides up was fixing our foot in 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.049
 this show and involved a hidden backdrop 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.960
 above is still convincingly nylon 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.380
 loop well, everyone knows what it is for 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.210
 here actually present and here 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.700
 looks peeping another material 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.290
 now he was showing it closer to the skin 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.900
 exit black 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.500
 Well, as stated by the manufacturer that she 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.130
 natural see it still continues and 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.590
 in the field of lacing now showing where 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.320
 already seen such loops and 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.500
 but already from the ballistic grid that is 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.239
 from a very durable material they form 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.580
 such bad strips 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.260
 you see on each side well and you can 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.100
 say that they resemble technology 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.470
 flywire here tell her grandparent well 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.540
 and in total it turns out that 7 loops with 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.970
 each side 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.140
 attend 1 bamboo loop 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.000
 at the bottom now showing well 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.230
 there is such a summing up tire 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.790
 holes at the very top here it is well from 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.290
 this it can be concluded that the fixation 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.750
 these sneakers are level 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.450
 without things and take into account the height of this model 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.200
 but finally, now I'll show you how it all 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:05:00.340
 neatly and well stitched before 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:02.669
 How to take Rashn smooth sneakers so 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.620
 that's what it is 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.050
 sneakers without loop laces here 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.710
 connect as you see such gum 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.950
 but not very understanding what they are 5 pieces 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.770
 you see just two rubber bands inside 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.900
 still fix the tongue but there I am unfortunately 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.060
 no crawl 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.310
 skin upstairs you see with used 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.870
 stuffed in that stuff 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.470
 actually as well as inside this model everything 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.940
 it is for comfort well and behind it like this 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.669
 this cut is well seen 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.620
 which repeats the shape our feet can 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.340
 say tendons all this too for 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.979
 comfort 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.850
 Well as you can see here we all decorated 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.810
 in such a chess style 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.389
 Well, about the tongue left to say 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.330
 that the grids are now showing 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.100
 closer she can say some ninth 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.610
 Jordan but to the touch 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.860
 To be honest the rougher side is 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.040
 in dishwashing sponge that all 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.530
 be present in the kitchen but even if 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.280
 consider this grid which helps 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.320
 ventilation is still given aspect 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.020
 leaves much to be desired go now 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.180
 outsole 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.510
 the black stuff is filon you see he 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.100
 is such an overlap komi from all sides 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.810
 but from the inside that overlaps more 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.139
 more 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:27.220
 but inside there are closed cylinders and 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.800
 ermak all this for depreciation 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.919
 down the soles again gray and like saying 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.840
 with such red accents here 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.790
 us used rubber 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.979
 well and the same powerful 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.669
 overlap on the finger that is you see 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:47.000
 in front now the last one is left 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:49.460
 logo and the informative itself I already 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.400
 told about the sole pass the inscriptions 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:07:00.430
 now see under the heels of jackman 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.660
 embroidered and on the heel on the insoles you can 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.590
 consider the same red logo 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:09.440
 colors of the wisest on the tongue with reverse 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:13.100
 sides here stripe where you can read 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.020
 air jordan background but the same is written below 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.470
