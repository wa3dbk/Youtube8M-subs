Bobby<00:00:08.370> here<00:00:08.610> today<00:00:08.879> folks<00:00:09.240> today<00:00:09.450> we're<00:00:09.809> out

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
Bobby here today folks today we're out

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.390 
Bobby here today folks today we're out
here<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.230> garage<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.860> were<00:00:10.950> putting<00:00:11.219> up

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
here in the garage that were putting up

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.240 
here in the garage that were putting up
our<00:00:11.549> OSB<00:00:12.299> on<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.780> wall<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.980> thought<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
our OSB on the wall and I thought I

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.290 
our OSB on the wall and I thought I
would<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.519> demonstrate<00:00:15.860> how<00:00:16.860> to<00:00:16.919> find<00:00:17.490> like

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
would just demonstrate how to find like

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.029 
would just demonstrate how to find like
where<00:00:18.630> your<00:00:18.779> outlets<00:00:19.259> are<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> your<00:00:19.860> life

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
where your outlets are and your life

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.970 
where your outlets are and your life
switches<00:00:20.579> are<00:00:20.759> on<00:00:20.789> your<00:00:21.180> piece<00:00:21.360> of<00:00:21.660> OSB<00:00:22.529> before

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
switches are on your piece of OSB before

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.849 
switches are on your piece of OSB before
you<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.630> nail<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.869> there<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.679> is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you actually nail it up there this is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.410 
you actually nail it up there this is
going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.369> our<00:00:26.429> next<00:00:26.760> piece<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.000> we've

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
going to be our next piece here we've

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.320 
going to be our next piece here we've
already<00:00:27.599> got<00:00:27.900> got<00:00:28.679> it<00:00:28.800> marked<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:29.400> where

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
already got got it marked off where

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
already got got it marked off where
we're<00:00:30.509> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> cut<00:00:30.960> these<00:00:31.199> little<00:00:31.800> squares

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
we're going to cut these little squares

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
we're going to cut these little squares
or<00:00:32.430> rectangles<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> should<00:00:34.080> fit

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
right over top of our light switch and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.770 
right over top of our light switch and
our<00:00:37.379> outlet<00:00:37.979> so<00:00:38.610> stay<00:00:39.000> tuned<00:00:39.269> I'll<00:00:39.479> show<00:00:39.720> you

our outlet so stay tuned I'll show you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
our outlet so stay tuned I'll show you
how<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.559> figured<00:00:41.339> out<00:00:41.430> where<00:00:41.580> to<00:00:41.670> put

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
how we how we figured out where to put

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.390 
how we how we figured out where to put
them<00:00:41.970> in<00:00:42.379> okay<00:00:43.379> friends<00:00:43.739> let<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:43.949> show<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.190> how

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
them in okay friends let me show you how

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.130 
them in okay friends let me show you how
we<00:00:44.460> figure<00:00:44.909> out<00:00:45.030> where<00:00:45.330> to<00:00:45.360> mark<00:00:45.659> these<00:00:45.869> things

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
we figure out where to mark these things

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.719 
we figure out where to mark these things
off<00:00:46.409> the<00:00:46.619> first<00:00:46.890> thing<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.280> did

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
off the first thing we did

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.490 
off the first thing we did
since<00:00:48.000> our<00:00:48.089> plywood<00:00:48.330> doesn't<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.199> against

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
since our plywood doesn't go up against

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
since our plywood doesn't go up against
the<00:00:49.650> brick<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.400> up<00:00:50.549> off<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.909> their

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the brick we got it up off of their

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.359 
the brick we got it up off of their
approximate<00:00:51.299> inch<00:00:51.869> or<00:00:52.049> so<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:53.070> took<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:53.369 
approximate inch or so I just took the

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.609 
approximate inch or so I just took the
rough<00:00:53.640> estimate<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> center<00:00:55.019> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.409> box

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
rough estimate to the center of the box

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.549 
rough estimate to the center of the box
and<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.040> looks<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.519> 27<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:58.260> looks

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and that looks like about 27 that looks

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.950 
and that looks like about 27 that looks
like<00:00:58.710> about<00:00:58.890> 41<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> half<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:00.900> we

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
like about 41 and a half and then we

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.289 
like about 41 and a half and then we
come<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.470> over<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> our<00:01:02.159> board<00:01:02.430> in

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
come right over here to our board in

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.479 
come right over here to our board in
that<00:01:03.540> general<00:01:04.140> area<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.070> kind<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that general area that we just kind of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.070 
that general area that we just kind of
eyeballed<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.570> far<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
eyeballed you know as far as the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
eyeballed you know as far as the
distance<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.450> just

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
distance from here to here and we just

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.669 
distance from here to here and we just
put<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:10.020> scribble<00:01:10.530> mark<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:11.429> 27<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
put a little scribble mark at 27 and

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.260 
put a little scribble mark at 27 and
whenever<00:01:13.679> I<00:01:13.770> said<00:01:14.009> that<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.369> 41<00:01:14.969> and<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> half

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
whenever I said that was 41 and a half

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.029 
whenever I said that was 41 and a half
just<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> general<00:01:16.350> idea<00:01:16.439> where

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
just kind of get a general idea where

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.359 
just kind of get a general idea where
the<00:01:17.130> marks<00:01:17.429> on<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.609> board<00:01:17.929> okay<00:01:18.929> now<00:01:19.369> next

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the marks on the board okay now next

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.709 
the marks on the board okay now next
thing<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.469> took<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:23.009> measurement<00:01:23.579> from<00:01:24.420> our

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
thing is we took a measurement from our

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.870 
thing is we took a measurement from our
piece<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.320> OSP<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.039> we<00:01:26.159> already<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.670> up

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
piece of OSP that we already have up

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.859 
piece of OSP that we already have up
there<00:01:27.179> to<00:01:27.810> each<00:01:28.020> side<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> box<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:30.630> got

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
there to each side of the box and we got

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.739 
there to each side of the box and we got
twenty<00:01:31.350> nine<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.859> three<00:01:32.070> quarters<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.850> 32

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
twenty nine and three quarters and 32

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:34.969 
twenty nine and three quarters and 32
and<00:01:33.929> a<00:01:33.960> quarter<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.469> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> give<00:01:34.859> us

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and a quarter that's going to give us

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.429 
and a quarter that's going to give us
just<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.249> little<00:01:35.310> bit<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.850> gap<00:01:36.749> on<00:01:36.990> each<00:01:37.140> side<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
just a little bit of gap on each side of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
just a little bit of gap on each side of
the<00:01:37.560> box<00:01:37.799> okay<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.179> took<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.539> two

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the box okay so we took them two

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.190 
the box okay so we took them two
measurements<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.619> come<00:01:40.859> come<00:01:41.460> along<00:01:41.729> here

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
measurements and we come come along here

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.590 
measurements and we come come along here
about<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:43.229> first<00:01:43.799> mark<00:01:44.159> was<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.329> pulled

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
about our first mark was and we pulled

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.700 
about our first mark was and we pulled
the<00:01:45.749> tape<00:01:45.960> across<00:01:46.289> here<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.329> we<00:01:48.329> marked<00:01:48.749> 29

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the tape across here and we marked 29

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.399 
the tape across here and we marked 29
three<00:01:49.979> quarters<00:01:50.399> 32<00:01:50.969> into<00:01:51.119> quarters<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.689> done

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
three quarters 32 into quarters and done

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.190 
three quarters 32 into quarters and done
the<00:01:52.560> same<00:01:52.590> thing<00:01:53.219> on<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.210> box<00:01:54.539> here<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.020> took

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the same thing on this box here we took

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.129 
the same thing on this box here we took
that<00:01:55.439> measurement<00:01:55.859> and<00:01:56.630> Mark<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.020> then

00:01:58.129 --> 00:01:58.139 
that measurement and Mark them and then

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.020 
that measurement and Mark them and then
we<00:01:58.229> squared<00:01:58.590> those<00:01:58.829> two<00:01:59.069> months<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.789> get

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
we squared those two months now to get

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.599 
we squared those two months now to get
the<00:02:00.179> top<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.719> bottom<00:02:02.630> cut<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.719> off<00:02:04.549> now<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
the top and the bottom cut it off now to

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.359 
the top and the bottom cut it off now to
figure<00:02:06.030> out<00:02:06.179> where<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.810> mark<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.829> top<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
figure out where to mark the top and the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
figure out where to mark the top and the
bottom<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.789> each<00:02:08.970> box<00:02:09.390> since<00:02:09.869> our<00:02:10.020> Bible<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
bottom of each box since our Bible is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.730 
bottom of each box since our Bible is
not<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> Brickman<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.790> can't<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.180> just

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
not on the Brickman we can't really just

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.410 
not on the Brickman we can't really just
a<00:02:12.800> measurement<00:02:13.220> from<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> break-up<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.180> hear

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
a measurement from the break-up to hear

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.320 
a measurement from the break-up to hear
so<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.170> took<00:02:15.350> our<00:02:15.560> sheet<00:02:15.800> rock<00:02:16.040> square<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.240> we

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
so we took our sheet rock square and we

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.980 
so we took our sheet rock square and we
held<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.810> against<00:02:18.260> our<00:02:18.410> piece<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.810> OSP<00:02:20.810> that

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
held it up against our piece of OSP that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.450 
held it up against our piece of OSP that
we<00:02:21.080> have<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:21.560> run<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.890> up<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.280> bottom

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
we have and we run it up to the bottom

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.700 
we have and we run it up to the bottom
of<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.730> box<00:02:22.970> about<00:02:23.330> where<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:23.630> want<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.200> we

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
of the box about where we want it and we

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.930 
of the box about where we want it and we
put<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.950> mark<00:02:25.250> right<00:02:25.460> there

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
put a mark right there

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300 
put a mark right there
done<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> same<00:02:26.780> thing<00:02:27.050> at<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.260> top<00:02:27.560> put<00:02:28.280> a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
done the same thing at the top put a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.100 
done the same thing at the top put a
mark<00:02:28.580> right<00:02:28.790> there<00:02:28.850> same<00:02:29.360> thing<00:02:29.630> at<00:02:30.050> the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
mark right there same thing at the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.620 
mark right there same thing at the
bottom<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:30.890> one<00:02:31.190> put<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> mark<00:02:32.420> right

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
bottom of this one put a mark right

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.840 
bottom of this one put a mark right
there<00:02:32.690> same<00:02:33.230> thing<00:02:33.260> at<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.650> top<00:02:33.890> now<00:02:34.550> from

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
there same thing at the top now from

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.050 
there same thing at the top now from
that<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.840> those<00:02:36.080> marks<00:02:36.530> there<00:02:36.820> we<00:02:37.820> were<00:02:37.940> able

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
that of those marks there we were able

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.420 
that of those marks there we were able
to<00:02:38.210> take<00:02:38.420> our<00:02:38.450> tape<00:02:38.780> measure<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> go<00:02:40.220> ahead

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
to take our tape measure and go ahead

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.580 
to take our tape measure and go ahead
and<00:02:40.550> measure<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.810> bottom<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.350> plywood

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
and measure to the bottom of the plywood

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.810 
and measure to the bottom of the plywood
or<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.280> OSB

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
or the OSB

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.430 
or the OSB
and<00:02:44.390> then<00:02:44.570> we<00:02:44.720> could<00:02:44.870> figure<00:02:45.050> out<00:02:45.200> exactly

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and then we could figure out exactly

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.130 
and then we could figure out exactly
what<00:02:45.950> these<00:02:46.160> measurements<00:02:46.790> were<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.630> they

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
what these measurements were and they

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.980 
what these measurements were and they
come<00:02:48.380> over<00:02:48.410> here<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.610> transfer<00:02:50.270> them<00:02:50.450> onto

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
come over here and transfer them onto

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.710 
come over here and transfer them onto
our<00:02:51.710> piece<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.730> we're<00:02:52.850> going<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.060> put<00:02:53.240> up<00:02:53.420> and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
our piece that we're going to put up and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.140 
our piece that we're going to put up and
then<00:02:54.080> after<00:02:54.410> we've<00:02:54.560> done<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.820> we<00:02:55.820> squared

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
then after we've done that we squared

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.240 
then after we've done that we squared
the<00:02:56.330> marks<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.260> now<00:02:57.440> friends<00:02:57.860> were<00:02:57.980> ready<00:02:58.160> to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
the marks so now friends were ready to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.100 
the marks so now friends were ready to
go<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.490> cut<00:02:58.700> out<00:02:58.850> these<00:02:59.060> openings<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.930> then

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
go and cut out these openings and then

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:17.330 
go and cut out these openings and then
we'll<00:03:00.260> put<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.530> up<00:03:00.620> here<00:03:00.890> as<00:03:00.950> if<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.280> fits
