00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
looking at three points the first one
aim<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> little<00:00:58.170> higher<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:59.100> moving<00:00:59.370> through

of<00:02:21.240> cliche<00:02:21.660> fact<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.650> most<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.070> us<00:02:23.130> have<00:02:23.310> built

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
of cliche fact is most of us have built

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.040 
of cliche fact is most of us have built
up<00:02:23.640> bad<00:02:23.790> habits<00:02:23.820> we<00:02:24.390> aim<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.840> body

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
up bad habits we aim for the body

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.230 
up bad habits we aim for the body
because<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.740> widest<00:02:26.160> target<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.150> we

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
because it's the widest target and we

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.000 
because it's the widest target and we
don't<00:02:27.390> want<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> miss<00:02:27.750> right<00:02:28.050> more<00:02:28.590> bullets<00:02:28.890> at

don't want to miss right more bullets at
home<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.310> better<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.670> right<00:02:29.850> well<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.050> heads

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
home the better the right well the heads

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.380 
home the better the right well the heads
a<00:02:31.410> smaller<00:02:31.680> target<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.880> get<00:02:33.180> any

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
a smaller target but if you get any

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.350 
a smaller target but if you get any
habit<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.020> doing<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.620> seriously<00:02:35.400> work<00:02:36.090> on

habit of doing it and seriously work on

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.720 
habit of doing it and seriously work on
it<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.660> will<00:02:36.750> become<00:02:37.110> second<00:02:37.530> nature<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.070> then

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it it will become second nature and then

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.730 
it it will become second nature and then
every<00:02:39.540> bullet<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.020> doing<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.530> much<00:02:40.680> more

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740
