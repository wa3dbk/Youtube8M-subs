here<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.400> tutorial<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.940> know<00:03:15.030> there<00:03:15.269> are

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
here is the tutorial I know there are

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.120 
here is the tutorial I know there are
tons<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.780> minutes<00:03:16.170> without<00:03:16.320> videos<00:03:16.890> out<00:03:17.100> there

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
tons of minutes without videos out there

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.190 
tons of minutes without videos out there
and<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.910> watched<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.360> lot<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.540> them<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:18.989> could

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
and I watched a lot of them and I could

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170 
and I watched a lot of them and I could
not<00:03:19.380> get<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> technique<00:03:19.980> down<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.910> finally

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
not get to technique down but I finally

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.320 
not get to technique down but I finally
home<00:03:21.600> fix<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.440> technique<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.100> it's<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
home fix the technique so it's the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.060 
home fix the technique so it's the
invisible<00:03:24.780> root<00:03:25.050> method<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.739> can<00:03:25.860> see

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
invisible root method as you can see

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.430 
invisible root method as you can see
here<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.600> figured<00:03:27.900> out<00:03:27.959> how<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.200> make<00:03:28.380> it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
here and I figured out how to make it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.830 
here and I figured out how to make it
work<00:03:28.560> for<00:03:28.890> me<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> wanted<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.880> share<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.480> used

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
work for me so I wanted to share I used

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.370 
work for me so I wanted to share I used
two<00:03:31.320> pieces<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.739> hair<00:03:32.040> per<00:03:32.880> strand<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.720> when

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
two pieces of hair per strand and when

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.470 
two pieces of hair per strand and when
you<00:03:34.500> start<00:03:34.799> off<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.430> little<00:03:36.060> section<00:03:36.420> of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
you start off with the little section of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.509 
you start off with the little section of
hair<00:03:36.690> they<00:03:36.870> come<00:03:37.019> free<00:03:37.200> sectioned<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.280> just

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
hair they come free sectioned you just

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.930 
hair they come free sectioned you just
want<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:39.739> fluff<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.860> out<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> little<00:03:41.250> bit<00:03:41.370> not

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
want to fluff it out a little bit not

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.600 
want to fluff it out a little bit not
too<00:03:41.970> much<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.989> just<00:03:43.739> found<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.010> easier<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
too much but I just found it easier to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.810 
too much but I just found it easier to
just<00:03:44.790> untwist<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.980> pull<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.010> apart<00:03:47.190> if<00:03:47.670> you

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
just untwist it and pull it apart if you

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.470 
just untwist it and pull it apart if you
want<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.120> full<00:03:48.360> look<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.959> just<00:03:50.480> separate

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
want that full look you just separate

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.440 
want that full look you just separate
them<00:03:52.220> when<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.340> put<00:03:53.519> them<00:03:53.670> together<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.299> you

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
them when you put them together so you

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.380 
them when you put them together so you
start<00:03:54.780> off<00:03:55.580> with<00:03:56.580> some<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.180> your<00:03:57.390> moisturizer

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.710 

and<00:04:00.510> then<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.440> added<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:02.430> little<00:04:03.060> bit<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
and then I added a little bit of the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.040 
and then I added a little bit of the
equal<00:04:04.110> star-ledger<00:04:05.569> especially<00:04:06.569> around<00:04:06.630> my

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
equal star-ledger especially around my

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.809 
equal star-ledger especially around my
hairline<00:04:07.260> lens<00:04:07.800> right<00:04:07.950> now<00:04:09.380> here<00:04:10.380> as<00:04:11.370> well<00:04:11.610> as
