really really easy and i think this is
nice<00:05:34.380> if<00:05:34.590> you<00:05:34.650> do<00:05:34.800> have<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.009> drier<00:05:35.310> skin<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:36.060> think

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
nice if you do have a drier skin I think

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.230

provides<00:05:39.539> a<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:40.050> say<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.680> medium<00:05:41.159> matte<00:05:41.460> coverage

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940

I<00:05:42.090> don't<00:05:42.270> think<00:05:42.419> it's<00:05:42.539> totally<00:05:42.960> fool<00:05:43.500> because

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
I don't think it's totally fool because

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.219 
I don't think it's totally fool because
I<00:05:43.740> think<00:05:43.800> my<00:05:44.069> Mac<00:05:44.430> ones<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:45.419> pro<00:05:45.659> longwear<00:05:45.900> is

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
I think my Mac ones the pro longwear is

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.550 
I think my Mac ones the pro longwear is
a<00:05:46.259> little<00:05:46.500> bit<00:05:46.620> fuller<00:05:46.800> coverage<00:05:47.060> but<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:48.210> is

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
a little bit fuller coverage but this is

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.050 
a little bit fuller coverage but this is
amazing<00:05:49.560> if<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.949> do<00:05:50.099> have<00:05:50.279> drier<00:05:50.610> under<00:05:50.940> eyes

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
amazing if you do have drier under eyes

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.059 
amazing if you do have drier under eyes
not<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.479> it<00:05:51.599> helps<00:05:51.870> hydrate<00:05:52.110> them<00:05:52.500> but<00:05:53.039> I

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
not that it helps hydrate them but I

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.980 
not that it helps hydrate them but I
don't<00:05:53.279> think<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.610> adheres<00:05:54.090> as<00:05:54.330> much<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.960> the

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
don't think it adheres as much to the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.779 
don't think it adheres as much to the
dry<00:05:55.229> patches<00:05:55.529> even<00:05:56.009> if<00:05:56.099> i'm<00:05:56.190> using<00:05:56.460> around<00:05:56.699> my

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
dry patches even if i'm using around my

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.390 
dry patches even if i'm using around my
nose<00:05:56.849> area<00:05:57.300> i<00:05:57.659> prefer<00:05:58.440> to<00:05:58.469> use<00:05:58.800> this<00:05:58.979> one<00:05:59.159> only

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
nose area i prefer to use this one only

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.399 
nose area i prefer to use this one only
because<00:05:59.849> it<00:06:00.090> doesn't<00:06:00.539> adhere<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:01.050> any<00:06:01.139> dry

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
because it doesn't adhere to any dry

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.740 
because it doesn't adhere to any dry
patches<00:06:01.759> again<00:06:02.759> it's<00:06:02.969> a<00:06:03.029> little<00:06:03.180> bit<00:06:03.270> pricier

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
patches again it's a little bit pricier

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.029 
patches again it's a little bit pricier
but<00:06:03.810> i've<00:06:04.289> had<00:06:04.650> this<00:06:04.800> one<00:06:05.270> this<00:06:06.650> spring<00:06:07.650> will
