and I think the reason cloud nine didn't
bend<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> fresh<00:02:17.980> was<00:02:18.550> because<00:02:18.760> they<00:02:18.910> wanted

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
bend the fresh was because they wanted

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.720 
bend the fresh was because they wanted

really<00:03:33.850> is<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.239> zigs<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.260> c9s<00:03:35.920> bread<00:03:36.070> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
really is the zigs it's so c9s bread and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.850 
really is the zigs it's so c9s bread and
butter<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.579> rotations<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:38.200> normal<00:03:38.560> laws

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
zigs in there because I've had this

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.030 
zigs in there because I've had this
happen<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.660> me<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.350> force<00:03:44.650> them<00:03:44.829> in<00:03:44.950> a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
happen to me you you force them in a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.380 
happen to me you you force them in a
lane<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.370> then<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.549> rotate<00:03:45.700> driven<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.239> said

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
lane and then you rotate driven you said

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.940 
lane and then you rotate driven you said
I'm<00:03:46.480> going<00:03:46.720> mid<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.079> then<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.260> realize<00:03:47.560> ziggs

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
I'm going mid and then you realize ziggs

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.590 
I'm going mid and then you realize ziggs
has<00:03:48.130> infinite<00:03:48.579> amount<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.850> wave<00:03:49.000> clear<00:03:49.209> then

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.150 
has infinite amount of wave clear then
you<00:03:49.720> go<00:03:49.870> back<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.140> your<00:03:50.380> bottling<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:50.980> let's
