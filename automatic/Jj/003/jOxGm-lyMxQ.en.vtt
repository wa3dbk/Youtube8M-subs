 [Music] 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.740
 hello youtube friends in this tutorial 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.289
 I will show you how to download metal slug 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420
 double x for pc with the emulator of p esp 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.539
 for pc in Spanish for all my 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.099
 subscribers my future subscribers 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 I will also give you a gift that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.149
 I will teach later as always 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.800
 I will leave the link as always in the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.050
 description of the video and they give to 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.149
 download I pass it because I already have it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.829
 this would take about half an hour and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.829
 One hour depends on your internet 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.230
 well once downloaded the file 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.960
 right click and extract here 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.850
 I will ask for a password, I will leave it to you 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.079
 in the description of the video so that it does not 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.079
 bother asking 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.089
 we extract the file and I will pass the video 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.089
 so as not to lengthen it 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.409
 once extracted it will leave four 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.409
 records 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.880
 well now they go to the next link that 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.890
 I will leave them in the description of 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.869
 video and it's a file that is the gift 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.180
 that's a code so they can have 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.720
 a secret character in the metal slug what 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.720
 we unload 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.120
 Once downloaded, we give you a right click 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.410
 and extract the password here will be the 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.680
 same that I will leave them in the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.660
 description of the video will leave you this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.820
 file but therefore still not what 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.610
 we touch and we will do it to a side we enter 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.500
 to the folder that says pepe ssp esp and in 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 a white space we give him right click 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.390
 and new and the folder and we'll put it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.640
 rooms 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.830
 we minimize the folder and the file and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.390
 we will only drag to the rooms folder 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.390
 that we create as I do 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.760
 now we will still have two files 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.860
 dll and they will ask for what shits 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.870
 It serves then the answer will tell them 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.020
 video if they do not make the letter 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.250
 you can play watch if I open this 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.260
 program with the icon of the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.300
 directional will mark me an error like 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.480
 will be able to see says a dll file is missing 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.190
 and do not open the program the solution is 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.110
 we select the dll files that are 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.330
 on the desk and we dragged it into the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.990
 PSPV folder as I do it to you 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.970
 copy and replace 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.040
 now do not open the icon of the first 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.080
 because they will mark another error open 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.720
 the other one and it will work here I show you 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.580
 how can you see the second one worked 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.430
 icon but now we will convert it to 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.010
 Spanish we go where it says game 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.739
 settings and then the language 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.450
 we go down to where it says Spanish Spanish 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.610
 and we double click on it and it will be in 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.769
 Spanish and to configure the controls 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.260
 we go to game settings and assign 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.239
 buttons then they put it to erase everything and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.189
 to put your keys we click on 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.000
 the space and we put the keys in my 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.000
 case will be like this 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.130
 we look for the pause and we have to put 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.810
 the pause key that you want 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.760
 but it is mandatory or if not 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.490
 what we will do afterwards will work 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.730
 we give it back and then we give it to 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.010
 search now we look for the psp folder 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.440
 and we click on the roms folder that 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.750
 we create and accept 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.610
 and as you can see the game is ready 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.160
 to play here a gameplay that if 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.180
 it serves 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.280
 [Applause] 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.989
 here so that it looks good we give to 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.579
 game settings and we click on 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.579
 adjust screen and it will look good 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.280
 and if they want to play full screen 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.260
 just give him f11 and I do not do it because the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.190
 campus no longer records well for games 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.190
 yes, sorry 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.560
 current 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.700
 so that it looks more rendered we 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.470
 we go to game settings then to 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.320
 resolution to rendering and we give it 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.570
 where it says 1x and now if a gameplay there is 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.130
 something else again we are going to adjustments 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.410
 of game and then to know of pros 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.299
 processed and we give axa antialiasing and 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.980
 it will look much more better now yes no 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.170
 interruptions a clan gamer 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.590
 as you can see there is a space of 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.710
 characters but that right now is or several 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.710
 [Music] 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.690
 now as I said before we press the letter 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.690
 And we put him out on the menu and go out 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.770
 now we are going to the most complicated and this 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.170
 we will need the file that 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.630
 we downloaded recently we opened the folder 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.940
 again from psp we go to the folder 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.010
 where says memes triqui where it says p 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.990
 esp and now the next thing is not to open 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.850
 none of these three and we click 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.830
 right to a space and we will give 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.900
 new already folder and this time we will put 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.880
 of name chats as I do him 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.770
 we enter the folder that we created and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.900
 we drag the file to the folder and 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.200
 we go back to the beginning where is what 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.330
 First 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.790
 now we open the emulator again and 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.790
 we open the game of metal slug double x 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.860
 [Applause] 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.310
 we wait for him to load the game until 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.310
 main menu 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.289
 Peru 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.250
 [Music] 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.900
 now as far as you can see there's nothing 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.900
 and no character 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.169
 we press the letter peli and we 're going to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.419
 game settings we go to where it says 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.310
 system and we look down where you say to 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.990
 activate tricks and stick me with a 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.240
 click we press back and we give 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.430
 continue and as you can see it does not appear 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.620
 nothing again the letter p we squeeze and 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.599
 we go to tricks and if this appears 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.729
 we go well and we go back to the game and follow 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:23.349
 without appearing anything and choose a player 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.349
 and then they go back and observe 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.490
 and how can you see if the 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.500
 hidden character is the lioness and if you do not 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.540
 appears nothing is that something did something 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.220
 wrong but I showed it if it served now 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.530
 I will make a gameplay of how is your life 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.570
 then to render the more we go 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.610
 to game settings and then to know from 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.230
 Pros processor and we give it where it says 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.950
 natural colors and it will be more 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.950
 rendering 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.050
 entertaining 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.050
 but the city I recommend them more than 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.860
 [Music]
