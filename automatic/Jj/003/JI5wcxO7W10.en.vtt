00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
question about fermenting do we want to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.440 
question about fermenting do we want to
add<00:00:08.130> brine<00:00:08.519> or<00:00:08.880> not

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450

well brine is very very important part

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.299 
well brine is very very important part
of<00:00:12.030> fermenting<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.780> all<00:00:13.559> vegetables<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.190> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
of fermenting and all vegetables have to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.220 
of fermenting and all vegetables have to
stay<00:00:14.549> below<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.240> brine<00:00:15.389> level<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.870> properly

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
stay below the brine level to properly

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.890 
stay below the brine level to properly
format<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.430> if<00:00:17.730> that's<00:00:17.940> not<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> case<00:00:18.510> inside

format so if that's not the case inside

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.870 
format so if that's not the case inside
your<00:00:19.050> probiotic<00:00:19.650> jar<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.460> should<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> do

very<00:00:26.490> important<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.240> fermenting<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
very important to your fermenting and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
very important to your fermenting and
you<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.160> want<00:00:29.429> oxygen<00:00:30.000> getting<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.449> there

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660

it's a time when lactic acid bacteria
are<00:00:32.940> trying<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> populate<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> jar<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
are trying to populate the jar and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.709 
are trying to populate the jar and
subdue<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.059> microorganisms<00:00:36.059> such<00:00:36.660> as

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
subdue on one of microorganisms such as

subdue on one of microorganisms such as
mold<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.010> yeast<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> let's<00:00:39.750> say<00:00:39.930> those<00:00:40.140> three

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
mold and yeast so let's say those three

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
mold and yeast so let's say those three
days<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.860> passed<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.640> find<00:00:41.879> yourself

in a situation like this I'm making

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
in a situation like this I'm making
sauerkraut<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.329> cabbage<00:00:45.719> has<00:00:45.870> risen

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
sauerkraut and my cabbage has risen

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.549 
sauerkraut and my cabbage has risen
above<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> level<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> brine

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
above the level of the brine

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.049 
above the level of the brine
well<00:00:49.559> here's<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.760> it

we'll just go ahead and take the lid off
going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> remove<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> brine<00:00:55.410> bowl<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.300> then

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
going to remove the brine bowl and then

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
going to remove the brine bowl and then
we're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> use<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.230> clean<00:00:59.129> nonmetallic

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
we're going to use a clean nonmetallic

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.990 
we're going to use a clean nonmetallic
kitchen<00:01:00.510> utensil<00:01:01.079> such<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.129> tart<00:01:02.399> tamper<00:01:02.820> or

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
a kraut powder to push the cabbage below

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.530 
a kraut powder to push the cabbage below
the<00:01:06.990> brine<00:01:07.200> level<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.189> might<00:01:08.520> take<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> second

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.030

because as you push on one side the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.499 
because as you push on one side the
other<00:01:14.070> side<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> rise<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:16.250> let's

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
other side is going to rise up let's

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
other side is going to rise up let's
push<00:01:18.650> down<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:21.380> work<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.560> way<00:01:22.619> around

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:44.450 

until<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.880> brine<00:01:31.120> rises<00:01:32.020> above<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:33.460> cabbage

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.130

couple of minutes here and have really
worked<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.660> cabbage<00:01:50.380> down<00:01:50.650> below<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.220> brine

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
worked the cabbage down below the brine

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.890 
worked the cabbage down below the brine
level<00:01:51.850> this<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.000> looking<00:01:52.360> great

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
level this is looking great

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
most the time this is going to fix the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.520 
most the time this is going to fix the
problem<00:01:56.230> for<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.690> didn't<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.260> you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
still have bits of cabbage up above the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.950 
still have bits of cabbage up above the
brine<00:02:03.250> level<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:04.150> would<00:02:04.240> go<00:02:04.450> ahead<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:04.720> add

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
brine level you would go ahead and add

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.930 
brine level you would go ahead and add
just<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.350> little<00:02:05.380> bit<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.979> brine<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.640> want<00:02:06.850> to

get<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.300> above<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.810> cabbage<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.760> make<00:02:13.420> sure

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
get it up above the cabbage so make sure

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.360
