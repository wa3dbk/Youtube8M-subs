suggested that you do that because you

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.449

sell<00:03:43.349> anything<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.099> really<00:03:44.340> had<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.819> bit<00:03:44.970> of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
sell anything and I really had a bit of

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.240 
sell anything and I really had a bit of
money<00:03:45.599> in<00:03:45.780> my<00:03:45.900> inventory<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.129> would<00:03:47.220> have

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
money in my inventory so it would have

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.830 
money in my inventory so it would have
been<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.459> good<00:03:47.609> idea<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.090> started<00:03:48.569> doing

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
been a good idea to have started doing

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.509 
been a good idea to have started doing
the<00:03:48.930> tasks<00:03:49.440> because<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.160> pretty<00:03:50.370> much

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
the tasks because it just pretty much

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.729 
the tasks because it just pretty much
means<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.940> when<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.389> enter<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> dungeon<00:03:52.199> you

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
means that when you enter a dungeon you

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.259 
means that when you enter a dungeon you
will<00:03:52.919> have<00:03:53.099> money<00:03:53.340> waiting<00:03:53.669> in<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.000> inventory

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
will have money waiting in the inventory

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.720 
will have money waiting in the inventory
to<00:03:54.569> buy<00:03:54.750> feathers<00:03:55.290> almost<00:03:55.889> instantly<00:03:56.519> so

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
to buy feathers almost instantly so

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.819 
to buy feathers almost instantly so
that'd<00:03:56.849> be<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> pretty<00:03:57.120> good<00:03:57.419> idea<00:03:57.769> now<00:03:58.769> the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
that'd be a pretty good idea now the

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.460 
that'd be a pretty good idea now the
fish<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.639> logs<00:04:00.090> depends<00:04:00.840> greatly<00:04:00.870> on

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
fish and the logs depends greatly on

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.009 
fish and the logs depends greatly on
your<00:04:02.209> fishing<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.329> wood<00:04:03.480> cutting<00:04:03.780> level

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
your fishing on wood cutting level

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.199 
your fishing on wood cutting level
respectively<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.099> obviously<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.000> higher

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
respectively so obviously the higher

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.759 
respectively so obviously the higher
woodcutting<00:04:06.720> level<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.230> have<00:04:07.379> their<00:04:07.650> high

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
woodcutting level you have their high

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.550 
woodcutting level you have their high
chances<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.549> have<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:08.970> getting<00:04:09.560> higher

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
chances you do have of getting higher

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.360 
chances you do have of getting higher
leveled<00:04:11.549> fishing<00:04:12.150> spots<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:13.680> strongly<00:04:14.159> suggest

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
leveled fishing spots I strongly suggest

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.180 
leveled fishing spots I strongly suggest
that<00:04:14.639> you<00:04:15.090> do<00:04:15.359> take<00:04:15.659> a<00:04:15.870> few<00:04:16.109> dungeons<00:04:16.590> slowly

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
that you do take a few dungeons slowly

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.039 
that you do take a few dungeons slowly
just<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.180> know<00:04:18.209> what<00:04:18.449> you're<00:04:18.539> doing<00:04:18.840> and

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
just so you know what you're doing and

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.099 
just so you know what you're doing and
then<00:04:19.500> once<00:04:19.709> you're<00:04:19.859> ready<00:04:20.039> you<00:04:20.789> go<00:04:21.450> full-on<00:04:21.780> I

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
then once you're ready you go full-on I

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.590 
then once you're ready you go full-on I
did<00:04:22.530> do<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> couple<00:04:23.159> dungeons<00:04:23.520> beforehand

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
did do a couple dungeons beforehand

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.120 
did do a couple dungeons beforehand
and<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.900> don't<00:04:25.080> feel<00:04:25.200> like<00:04:25.260> I'm<00:04:25.440> still<00:04:25.620> ready<00:04:25.890> to

and I don't feel like I'm still ready to

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.400 
and I don't feel like I'm still ready to

should<00:04:31.380> be<00:04:31.470> close<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.860> finishing<00:04:32.130> but<00:04:32.400> I'm<00:04:32.520> not

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
should be close to finishing but I'm not

you<00:04:33.600> can<00:04:33.840> easily<00:04:34.380> do<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.560> really<00:04:35.310> fast

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
you can easily do this really fast

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.120 
you can easily do this really fast
honestly<00:04:36.240> sure<00:04:37.020> there's<00:04:37.200> people<00:04:37.320> who<00:04:37.620> do

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
kind of look at the suiciders and

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.840 
kind of look at the suiciders and
there's<00:04:42.300> pretty<00:04:42.600> good<00:04:42.780> themselves<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:43.850> they

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
there's pretty good themselves so they

get<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.700> from<00:04:47.970> experience<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:49.230> just<00:04:49.650> kind<00:04:49.980> of

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
honestly you don't you feel like you'd

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.410 
honestly you don't you feel like you'd
be<00:04:55.350> going<00:04:55.470> full<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:57.120> just<00:04:57.240> won't

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
be going full on because you just won't

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.700 
be going full on because you just won't
notice<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.050> you'll<00:04:58.200> be<00:04:58.320> pretty<00:04:58.530> much

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
notice it and you'll be pretty much

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.460 
notice it and you'll be pretty much
perfect<00:04:59.370> at<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.730> after<00:05:00.540> about<00:05:00.660> ten<00:05:00.960> tries<00:05:01.230> so

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
perfect at this after about ten tries so

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.810 
perfect at this after about ten tries so
just<00:05:01.650> don't<00:05:01.770> give<00:05:01.980> up<00:05:02.100> if<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.520> think<00:05:02.730> you're

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
just don't give up if you think you're

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.700 
just don't give up if you think you're
going<00:05:03.000> quite<00:05:03.210> slow<00:05:03.450> it<00:05:03.540> fast<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:04.290> does<00:05:04.530> take<00:05:04.680> a

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
going quite slow it fast it does take a

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.820 
going quite slow it fast it does take a
lot<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:04.920> practice<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:06.320> honestly<00:05:07.320> once<00:05:07.680> you're

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
lot of practice and honestly once you're

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.470 
lot of practice and honestly once you're
ready<00:05:08.040> you'll<00:05:08.430> know<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.790> you're<00:05:08.910> ready<00:05:09.090> and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
ready you'll know that you're ready and

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.180 
ready you'll know that you're ready and
as<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.200> can<00:05:10.320> see<00:05:10.380> here<00:05:10.590> there's<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.800> couple<00:05:10.860> of

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
as you can see here there's a couple of

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.070 
as you can see here there's a couple of
spots<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.670> we<00:05:11.910> can<00:05:12.090> use<00:05:12.120> for<00:05:12.330> fishing<00:05:12.810> which

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
spots that we can use for fishing which

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.750 
spots that we can use for fishing which
is<00:05:13.200> pretty<00:05:13.320> good<00:05:15.320> usually<00:05:16.370> woodcutting<00:05:17.370> is

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
is pretty good usually woodcutting is

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.240 
is pretty good usually woodcutting is
faster<00:05:18.540> experience<00:05:19.110> per<00:05:19.290> hour<00:05:19.470> than<00:05:19.860> fishing

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
faster experience per hour than fishing

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.280 
faster experience per hour than fishing
and<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:21.300> strongly<00:05:21.510> suggest<00:05:21.720> that<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.050> do<00:05:22.170> not

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
and I strongly suggest that you do not

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.310 
and I strongly suggest that you do not
do<00:05:22.530> them<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.670> their<00:05:24.360> own<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:24.900> do<00:05:25.050> them<00:05:25.200> both

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
do them on their own so you do them both

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.400 
do them on their own so you do them both
together<00:05:25.560> mainly<00:05:26.430> because<00:05:26.460> getting<00:05:27.410> 170,000

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
together mainly because getting 170,000

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.980 
together mainly because getting 170,000
experience<00:05:29.130> per<00:05:29.280> hour<00:05:29.460> in<00:05:29.820> fishing<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:30.870> we're

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
experience per hour in fishing and we're

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.230 
experience per hour in fishing and we're
cutting<00:05:31.290> is<00:05:31.380> pretty<00:05:31.560> decent<00:05:32.040> you<00:05:32.790> all<00:05:32.940> save<00:05:33.180> a

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
cutting is pretty decent you all save a

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.020 
cutting is pretty decent you all save a
lot<00:05:33.330> of<00:05:33.390> time<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:34.980> worth<00:05:35.250> doing<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:35.820> in

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
lot of time and it is worth doing it in

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.600 
lot of time and it is worth doing it in
the<00:05:36.090> sea<00:05:36.540> too<00:05:36.720> because<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:38.040> will<00:05:38.220> notice<00:05:38.460> that

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
the sea too because you will notice that

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.130 
the sea too because you will notice that
eventually<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.420> do<00:05:39.570> gain<00:05:39.750> more<00:05:39.900> experience

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
eventually you do gain more experience

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.410 
eventually you do gain more experience
per<00:05:40.410> hour<00:05:40.590> by<00:05:40.920> doing<00:05:41.190> this<00:05:41.280> method<00:05:41.730> instead<00:05:42.300> of

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
per hour by doing this method instead of

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.620 
per hour by doing this method instead of
the<00:05:42.600> usual<00:05:42.840> method<00:05:43.770> oh<00:05:43.800> by<00:05:44.760> pretty<00:05:45.300> much<00:05:45.420> doing

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
the usual method oh by pretty much doing

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.740 
the usual method oh by pretty much doing
ivy<00:05:46.230> or<00:05:46.680> anything<00:05:47.010> like<00:05:47.040> that<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.480> should<00:05:48.720> I

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
ivy or anything like that so I should I

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.120 
ivy or anything like that so I should I
suggest<00:05:49.080> you<00:05:49.110> do<00:05:49.290> through<00:05:49.470> this<00:05:49.560> method<00:05:49.800> you

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
suggest you do through this method you

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.500 
suggest you do through this method you
will<00:05:50.250> find<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.550> there's<00:05:50.760> a<00:05:50.820> lot<00:05:50.970> faster<00:05:51.420> than

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
will find that there's a lot faster than

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.500 
will find that there's a lot faster than
most<00:05:51.690> methods<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.470> in<00:05:52.980> case<00:05:53.280> you<00:05:54.180> want<00:05:54.450> to

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
most methods and in case you want to

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.720 
most methods and in case you want to
cook<00:05:54.810> your<00:05:54.990> fish<00:05:55.230> afterwards<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:56.010> can<00:05:56.220> do<00:05:56.460> so

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
cook your fish afterwards you can do so

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.450 
cook your fish afterwards you can do so
at<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.930> base<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:58.500> once<00:05:59.070> you<00:05:59.130> have<00:05:59.220> a<00:05:59.280> full

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
at the base and once you have a full

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.950 
at the base and once you have a full
inventory<00:05:59.670> of<00:05:59.910> cook<00:06:00.150> fish<00:06:00.390> will<00:06:00.570> settle<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:00.840> to

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
inventory of cook fish will settle it to

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.010 
inventory of cook fish will settle it to
the<00:06:01.080> trailer<00:06:01.320> and<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:02.430> will<00:06:02.610> make<00:06:02.790> or<00:06:03.270> you

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
the trailer and you will make or you

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.480 
the trailer and you will make or you
will<00:06:04.170> save<00:06:04.410> a<00:06:04.440> lot<00:06:04.530> of<00:06:04.680> time<00:06:04.890> doing<00:06:05.040> that<00:06:05.280> also

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
will save a lot of time doing that also

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.640 
will save a lot of time doing that also
so<00:06:06.330> it's<00:06:06.450> really<00:06:06.630> really<00:06:07.020> up<00:06:07.170> to<00:06:07.320> you<00:06:07.440> what<00:06:07.620> you
