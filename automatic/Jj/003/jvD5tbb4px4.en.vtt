00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.270
 hello why this bo today I 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.270
 finished with a beta fan 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.860
 coc 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.280
 until today I had picouly dig 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.280
 one week 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.899
 then I also made males run 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 now must prepare me to do 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.640
 the full the first thing that win 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.010
 more but the fact is to remove two 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.260
 sambre feet around the furniture like 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.540
 it's going to be compact and seems more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.010
 deeply we also took advantage of 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.200
 the opportunity to dig trenches 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.120
 to install vacuum hose 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.980
 now that you're digging I was 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.410
 louis a jumping jack to compact the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.320
 doubs rene's job is all wet 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.590
 to help compaction my job of everything 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.590
 compact 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.770
 everything was done in increments of two 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.329
 or three opus of sava whip a little 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.359
 mooring then a good competition 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.979
 between layers then comes the time 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:35.049
 to install the 10 inch pipes for 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:41.500
 the vacuum cleaner starts not recognized the 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:43.119
 two 45 together to make the 90 like 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 can see some chords have been 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.500
 much harder to collect 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.060
 ok it's a bigger town 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.829
 complicated then all the options 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.119
 were stuck in their place I'm sure 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.159
 that everything is done correctly 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:05.049
 there was a kind of engineers who 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.219
 shocked if everything was perfect then he 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.869
 there was time to do the preparation 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.869
 water drain pipes 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.390
 alex the drama of my daughter he has us 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.090
 helped to kaiser now contact 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.130
 below a dren during planchÃ© 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.170
 that time to animate a stripped son 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.850
 around the vacuum hose for 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.040
 eliminate the static it's probably 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.630
 useless because they are underground 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.819
 but it's not the first time 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.770
 I put more than I need after I 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.480
 can speak drain by drilling a hole 4 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:43.989
 inches since their elbow with vintage 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.410
 it is now that I will help him are 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.300
 ready 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.510
 it remains more than sticking pipes in 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.510
 square 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.040
 finally that's what saab there with 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:00.109
 air ethiopia on the right side of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.819
 the workshop then we all backfilled in 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:12.230
 layer of 2 or 3 inches that we have everything 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:13.459
 compact and that but when we finished we 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.370
 realized that there was 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.159
 really too much sand inside 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.409
 so we all allowed it was really 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.269
 fun here's what the interior had there 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.920
 after removing the excess blood 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.720
 but this time to compact the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.639
 all right we are both at rozoy's 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.470
 garden we were left markets for to 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:35.540
 about one last then I rented 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.780
 a vibrating plate compact g and all this 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.780
 law 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:56.180
 we checked this right adjusted right 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.520
 the compact touquet and again we did 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.140
 that all four times again cast a 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.910
 well contacted then right we install 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.970
 several or the other cut goes not on the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.350
 sand 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.230
 I come to know the steam step around 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.970
 pipes and sheets then I 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.090
 placed cards at door over 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.090
 below 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.700
 again the quarters of the posts 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.850
 are cut with a saw blade to 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.850
 metals 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.409
 and 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.740
 I changed the orientation of the map 

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:44.349
 brings between each row for 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.119
 to minimize the joints one thing is sure 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.169
 it's dangerous to work 

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.029
 door with string 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.649
 if you do not want you or someone 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.770
 that you like hurts do well 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:57.419
 attention here is pope with the day that 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.419
 the accident was sweeter right 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.880
 Then we covered everything with a 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.480
 canvas 40 feet by 60 feet in ass he 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.480
 will begin to wet 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.849
 next day we try to roast for the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.650
 concrete everywhere inside I cut 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.060
 toasting at each place where there is 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.060
 had a pipe or floor 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.189
 then we pike together 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.900
 roasting leaves to finish 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.879
 I installed the shapes for both 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.710
 games beyond not I drilled and davis 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.340
 of the two parts the hands cement a 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.340
 notable bond 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.430
 then cemac see him drinking standing 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.140
 for the rest of the day 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.420
 then all year the same reaches 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.940
 I was very happy to have put this 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.200
 big canvas there to cover all that 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.300
 otherwise I do not know how we could have 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.520
 to empty the water that was between 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.380
 the part goes not it is because the door with 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.630
 the fence over all that there 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.400
 had 3 inches of water everywhere that we got 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.790
 took an hour to pump all this 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.790
 water out there 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.030
 then we were ready for pouring 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.030
 ten boards 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.800
 the knee grate must be raised in 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.800
 same time that the concrete is poured 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:41.520
 like that it gives another employee said 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.520
 to start flattering the boards 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.830
 ah ah 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.389
 the last thing they did was 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:40.440
 to make me a door threshold to sell 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:42.690
 the two step openings and here 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.360
 final product right after it's 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.099
 left when the cement was hard enough to 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.500
 water them for a little more than 24 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:51.210
 hours after a little bit I got 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:57.060
 tanned in pink hand I laid my 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:58.860
 two years finally joined the work of 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.950
 concrete are finished I can finally 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.720
 started working tip 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.030
 I invite you to come back and see me 

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.860
