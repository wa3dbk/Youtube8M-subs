you'll also notice here two little holes

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.830 
you'll also notice here two little holes
it's<00:00:40.879> not<00:00:41.030> because<00:00:41.179> they<00:00:41.269> punched<00:00:41.629> in<00:00:41.719> the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
it's not because they punched in the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.080 
it's not because they punched in the
suit<00:00:42.050> its<00:00:42.649> natural<00:00:42.890> drain<00:00:43.129> holes<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:43.879> if<00:00:44.000> any

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
suit its natural drain holes so if any

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.310 
suit its natural drain holes so if any
water<00:00:44.210> does<00:00:44.510> go<00:00:44.660> through<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:44.989> back<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.260> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
water does go through the back of the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.200 
water does go through the back of the
wetsuit<00:00:45.679> there's<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.340> panel<00:00:46.670> just<00:00:46.760> about<00:00:47.059> I'll

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
wetsuit there's a panel just about I'll

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.939 
wetsuit there's a panel just about I'll
show<00:00:47.359> you<00:00:47.449> that<00:00:47.539> in<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.690> moment<00:00:47.839> but<00:00:48.620> any<00:00:48.800> water

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
show you that in a moment but any water

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.380 
show you that in a moment but any water
that<00:00:49.100> runs<00:00:49.219> down<00:00:49.489> runs<00:00:49.879> out<00:00:50.030> these<00:00:50.149> drain

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
that runs down runs out these drain

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.910 
that runs down runs out these drain
holes<00:00:50.629> instead<00:00:50.929> of<00:00:51.079> running<00:00:51.230> into<00:00:51.410> your<00:00:51.500> suit

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
holes instead of running into your suit

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.529 
holes instead of running into your suit
so<00:00:52.280> you're<00:00:52.399> minimizing<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.059> amount<00:00:53.179> of<00:00:53.329> water

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
so you're minimizing the amount of water

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.759 
so you're minimizing the amount of water
that's<00:00:53.780> actually<00:00:54.170> getting<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.499> the<00:00:54.589> suit

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
that's actually getting to the suit

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.520 
that's actually getting to the suit
itself<00:00:55.089> real<00:00:56.089> nifty<00:00:56.420> feature<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:57.379> see

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
itself real nifty feature you see

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.049 
itself real nifty feature you see
there's<00:00:57.679> slightly<00:00:57.859> different<00:00:58.429> kind<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.699> patch

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
there's slightly different kind of patch

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.649 
there's slightly different kind of patch
or<00:00:59.480> panel<00:00:59.839> that's<00:00:59.989> on<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.170> west<00:01:00.350> through<00:01:00.530> here

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
or panel that's on the west through here

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.180 
or panel that's on the west through here
this<00:01:02.659> is<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.809> performance<00:01:03.350> panel<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:03.949> it's<00:01:04.070> got

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
this is a performance panel so it's got

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.399 
this is a performance panel so it's got
the<00:01:04.250> super<00:01:04.550> stretch<00:01:04.790> neoprene<00:01:05.269> or<00:01:05.600> superlight

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.760 
inside the wetsuit and just see some of
the<00:01:41.000> key<00:01:41.180> features<00:01:41.390> just<00:01:42.170> before<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.560> do<00:01:42.740> that

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
I've just shared the zipper system this

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.890 
I've just shared the zipper system this

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
button here zip sorry this part here

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.320 
button here zip sorry this part here
just<00:01:48.050> pops<00:01:48.260> on<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.250> if<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.790> just<00:01:49.940> take<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.150> off

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.940 
just pops on and if you just take it off
it's<00:01:50.630> really<00:01:51.020> easy<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.320> get<00:01:51.530> off

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
it's really easy to get off

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.390 
it's really easy to get off
just<00:01:52.790> pull<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.030> across<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.510> of<00:01:53.840> course<00:01:54.080> I've

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
just pull it across there of course I've

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.050 
just pull it across there of course I've
hook<00:01:55.400> up

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
hook up

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.430 
hook up
but<00:01:58.060> as<00:01:58.120> you<00:01:58.210> can<00:01:58.300> see<00:01:58.360> that's<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.870> sip<00:01:59.080> system

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
but as you can see that's a sip system

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.680 
but as you can see that's a sip system
through<00:01:59.620> there<00:01:59.830> see<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.910> neoprene<00:02:01.270> goes<00:02:01.450> over

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
through there see the neoprene goes over

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.310 
through there see the neoprene goes over
the<00:02:01.750> top<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.910> zip<00:02:04.060> itself<00:02:04.450> just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the top and the zip itself just

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.810 
the top and the zip itself just
interlocks<00:02:05.800> for<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.070> next<00:02:06.280> part<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.640> zip

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
interlocks for the next part of the zip

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.730 
interlocks for the next part of the zip
so<00:02:07.270> minimizing<00:02:07.720> metal<00:02:08.140> water<00:02:08.260> didn't<00:02:08.590> pass

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
so minimizing metal water didn't pass

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.830 
so minimizing metal water didn't pass
through<00:02:09.040> and<00:02:09.850> also<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.119> neoprene<00:02:10.480> goes<00:02:10.660> over

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
through and also the neoprene goes over

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.620 
through and also the neoprene goes over
top<00:02:11.020> where<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:11.260> sealed<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:12.820> just<00:02:13.030> look<00:02:13.420> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
top where it's sealed you just look to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.700 
top where it's sealed you just look to
see<00:02:13.660> how<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.200> get<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> suit<00:02:16.710> maybe

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
can actually get into the sea what we do

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.090 
can actually get into the sea what we do
is<00:02:29.560> under<00:02:29.770> turn<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> moment

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
is under turn it so that in a moment

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.610 
is under turn it so that in a moment
before<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> hood<00:02:35.410> part

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
before I do that just with the hood part

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.110 
before I do that just with the hood part
is<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> part<00:02:36.010> comes<00:02:36.400> over<00:02:36.640> your<00:02:36.730> head

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
that's the panel I was talking about so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.070 
that's the panel I was talking about so
if<00:02:39.670> any<00:02:39.820> water<00:02:39.970> does<00:02:40.240> come<00:02:40.270> down<00:02:40.630> your<00:02:40.780> neck<00:02:40.930> or

drown the back of suit it minimizes the

drown the back of suit it minimizes the
amount<00:02:43.150> that's<00:02:43.420> actually<00:02:43.630> gonna<00:02:43.720> get<00:02:43.810> inside

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
amount that's actually gonna get inside

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.290 
amount that's actually gonna get inside
the<00:02:44.440> suit<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.430> runs<00:02:45.640> down<00:02:45.850> here<00:02:45.880> and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300

have been stitched they've also been
glued<00:03:07.630> inside<00:03:07.990> again<00:03:08.500> minimizes<00:03:09.100> amount<00:03:09.370> of

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
glued inside again minimizes amount of
