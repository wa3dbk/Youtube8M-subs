00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.100
 i 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.250
 Well once 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.120
 we have already selected the distance 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.120
 have the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.080
 in fact 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.010
 and we have centered already the point is to catch 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.010
 the two hands 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:43.019
 the thief as picking up the dust 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.019
 place it up 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.930
 and do the first holes 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.010
 once drilled 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.010
 and the streets we talk 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.879
 here and little by little 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.250
 the circle is already well marked 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.250
 and simply 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.710
 sometimes we look at a nerve in the plaster 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 when we have it that way we can also 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 give because for you 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.110
 already in him 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.080
 the bowl plaster and previously as 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.490
 always then we will have put the cables 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.490
 to put people 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.490
