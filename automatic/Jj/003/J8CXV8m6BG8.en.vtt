00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
notice that the frame although it looks

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.030 
notice that the frame although it looks
similar<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:03.139> the<00:01:03.260> old<00:01:03.379> one<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.649> now<00:01:03.769> painted

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
here on the side you'll notice that we

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.649 
here on the side you'll notice that we
still<00:01:13.189> use<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.610> same<00:01:13.820> type<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.180> connection

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
still use the same type of connection

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.209 
still use the same type of connection
for<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.930> voice<00:01:15.079> coil<00:01:15.380> it's<00:01:15.649> a<00:01:15.710> dual<00:01:15.890> 4-ohm

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
for the voice coil it's a dual 4-ohm

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.370 
for the voice coil it's a dual 4-ohm
voice<00:01:16.369> coil<00:01:16.880> like<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.270> previous<00:01:17.719> version<00:01:18.200> but

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
voice coil like the previous version but

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.990 
voice coil like the previous version but
you'll<00:01:18.740> also<00:01:18.920> notice<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.549> motor<00:01:19.759> system

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
you'll also notice that the motor system

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.840 
you'll also notice that the motor system
is<00:01:20.450> significantly<00:01:21.320> larger<00:01:21.829> this<00:01:22.430> is<00:01:22.579> actually

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
is significantly larger this is actually

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.160 
is significantly larger this is actually
so<00:01:23.000> large<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.539> getting<00:01:23.750> real<00:01:23.899> close<00:01:24.109> to

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
so large it's getting real close to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.840 
so large it's getting real close to
blocking<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.890> terminal<00:01:25.310> here<00:01:25.549> which<00:01:25.700> is

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
blocking the terminal here which is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.969 
blocking the terminal here which is
pretty<00:01:26.090> massive<00:01:26.329> it's<00:01:26.719> by<00:01:27.409> far<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.740> largest

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
pretty massive it's by far the largest

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.380 
pretty massive it's by far the largest
motor<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.460> we<00:01:28.520> can<00:01:28.670> get<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.060> speaker

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
motor that we can get on the speaker

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.510 
motor that we can get on the speaker
without<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.659> complete<00:01:30.049> redesign<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.250> if<00:01:31.429> you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
without a complete redesign and if you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.529 
without a complete redesign and if you
