00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.460 
meantime we're be putting out the team
taja<00:02:38.880> which<00:02:39.030> will<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.660> very<00:02:39.690> very<00:02:40.290> high

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
taja which will be of a very very high

taja which will be of a very very high
standards<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.210> I<00:02:42.210> think<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.290> they<00:02:43.410> will

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
standards and I think that they will

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.250 
standards and I think that they will
suffice<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> time<00:02:44.520> being<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.330> look

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
suffice in the time being so look

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.600 
suffice in the time being so look

along pretty good and you see a bunch of
comments<00:04:50.470> on<00:04:50.680> montage<00:04:51.100> you're<00:04:51.280> saying<00:04:51.490> this

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
comments on montage you're saying this

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.280 
comments on montage you're saying this
is<00:04:51.670> so<00:04:51.910> much<00:04:52.000> better<00:04:52.180> than<00:04:52.420> this<00:04:53.050> guy's

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
is so much better than this guy's

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.400 
is so much better than this guy's
montage<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.040> such<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.430> such<00:04:54.610> but<00:04:55.180> really<00:04:55.690> I

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
montage and such and such but really I

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.740 
montage and such and such but really I
think<00:04:57.280> everybody<00:04:57.850> just<00:04:58.030> tries<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.330> focus<00:04:58.630> on

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
think everybody just tries to focus on

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.480 
think everybody just tries to focus on
putting<00:04:58.930> out<00:04:59.110> good<00:04:59.260> content<00:04:59.440> it's<00:04:59.830> not<00:05:00.040> so

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
putting out good content it's not so

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.400 
putting out good content it's not so
much<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.670> competition<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.660> lot<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.110> people<00:05:02.260> I

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
much a competition is a lot of people I

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.690 
much a competition is a lot of people I
think<00:05:02.470> they<00:05:02.680> put<00:05:02.800> up<00:05:02.920> montage<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.400> just<00:05:03.580> for

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
think they put up montage is just for

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.610 
think they put up montage is just for
themself<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.960> know<00:05:05.050> be<00:05:05.230> proud<00:05:05.410> of<00:05:05.440> their

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
themself to you know be proud of their

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.780 
themself to you know be proud of their
own<00:05:05.710> montage<00:05:06.070> obviously<00:05:06.520> they<00:05:06.610> like

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
own montage obviously they like

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.040 
own montage obviously they like
recognition<00:05:07.240> from<00:05:07.330> other<00:05:07.510> people<00:05:07.780> but<00:05:07.810> it's

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
recognition from other people but it's

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.870 
recognition from other people but it's
not<00:05:08.170> a<00:05:08.200> competition<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.920> say<00:05:09.100> it's<00:05:09.580> better

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
not a competition to say it's better

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.400 
not a competition to say it's better
than<00:05:10.060> somebody<00:05:10.600> else<00:05:10.660> yeah<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:11.080> think<00:05:11.170> that's

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
than somebody else yeah I think that's

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.440 
than somebody else yeah I think that's
mostly<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.950> fans<00:05:12.220> place<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.790> say<00:05:13.000> it's<00:05:13.210> better

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
mostly the fans place to say it's better

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.960 
mostly the fans place to say it's better
