00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
ones today that I think are really going

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
ones today that I think are really going
to<00:00:43.890> make<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> difference<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> first<00:00:45.660> thing

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to make a difference so the first thing

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.490 
to make a difference so the first thing
is<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.460> d90<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> d300s<00:00:49.289> from

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
is now going from d90 and the d300s from

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170 
is now going from d90 and the d300s from
the<00:00:49.620> twelve<00:00:49.860> point<00:00:50.100> three<00:00:50.160> megapixel<00:00:50.460> sensor

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the twelve point three megapixel sensor

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.529 
the twelve point three megapixel sensor
you<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.750> how<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.219> 16<00:00:54.210> point

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you know how you now have a 16 point

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.610 
you know how you now have a 16 point
three<00:00:54.870> megapixel<00:00:55.020> CMOS<00:00:55.739> sensor<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.180> adds

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
three megapixel CMOS sensor so this adds

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
three megapixel CMOS sensor so this adds
4.1<00:00:58.620> megapixels<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.430> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> make

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
4.1 megapixels and this is going to make

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
4.1 megapixels and this is going to make
a<00:01:00.809> difference<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> photos<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.969> one<00:01:02.969> other

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
a difference in the photos and one other

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
a difference in the photos and one other
thing<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.170> file<00:01:04.350> size<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
thing is that the file size will be a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.810 
thing is that the file size will be a
lot<00:01:05.610> bigger<00:01:05.820> another<00:01:06.689> thing<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.530> 39<00:01:08.430> point

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
lot bigger another thing is the 39 point

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.450 
lot bigger another thing is the 39 point
on<00:01:09.060> focus<00:01:09.540> system<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.409> i<00:01:10.439> had<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> d50<00:01:11.310> with

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
on focus system so i had a d50 with

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.399 
on focus system so i had a d50 with
three<00:01:11.729> auto<00:01:11.909> focus<00:01:12.270> points<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.960> i<00:01:13.049> jump<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
three auto focus points then i jump to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.070 
three auto focus points then i jump to
the<00:01:13.530> d90<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.280> 11<00:01:14.670> autofocus<00:01:15.150> points<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> now

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the d90 with 11 autofocus points and now

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.450 
the d90 with 11 autofocus points and now
the<00:01:17.030> d7000<00:01:18.030> has<00:01:18.360> 39<00:01:18.950> autofocus<00:01:19.950> points<00:01:20.250> which

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the d7000 has 39 autofocus points which

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
the d7000 has 39 autofocus points which
are<00:01:20.610> incredible<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.869> means<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> can

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
are incredible so this means it can

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.710 
are incredible so this means it can
focus<00:01:22.560> extremely<00:01:23.220> quick<00:01:23.400> ma<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:24.150> focus<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
focus extremely quick ma can focus on a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.440 
focus extremely quick ma can focus on a
lot<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.140> different<00:01:25.170> things<00:01:26.119> also<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.240> means

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
lot of different things also this means

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.440 
lot of different things also this means
focus<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.020> more<00:01:28.320> stable<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.670> even

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
focus will be more stable and I even

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
focus will be more stable and I even
with<00:01:30.689> shaky<00:01:31.590> hands<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.040> should<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.340> able<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
with shaky hands you should be able to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.539 
with shaky hands you should be able to
get<00:01:32.759> some<00:01:33.000> good<00:01:33.119> footage<00:01:33.619> next<00:01:34.619> thing<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
get some good footage next thing is the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
get some good footage next thing is the
six<00:01:36.060> frames<00:01:36.570> per<00:01:36.869> second<00:01:37.200> hundred<00:01:37.470> frame

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
six frames per second hundred frame

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.429 
six frames per second hundred frame
burst<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> d90<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:40.110> shoot<00:01:40.350> up

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
burst so right now the d90 can shoot up

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.870 
burst so right now the d90 can shoot up
four<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> half<00:01:40.860> inches<00:01:41.189> per<00:01:41.369> second<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
four and a half inches per second and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.149 
four and a half inches per second and
actually<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.600> video<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> 72

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
actually have video of that in the 72

during those 20 minutes of
high-definition<00:02:41.140> video<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:42.340> before<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
high-definition video so before on the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.840 
high-definition video so before on the
d90<00:02:43.450> what<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.170> have<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.410> do<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.830> always<00:02:45.190> film

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
d90 what you have to do is always film

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.480 
d90 what you have to do is always film
in<00:02:46.090> manual<00:02:46.480> focus<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.950> kind<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.250> hard<00:02:48.310> to

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
in manual focus so it's kind of hard to

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.580 
in manual focus so it's kind of hard to
keep<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.880> focus<00:02:49.240> at<00:02:49.420> all<00:02:49.450> times<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.290> now<00:02:50.410> with

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
keep in focus at all times but now with

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.320 
keep in focus at all times but now with
full<00:02:50.800> time<00:02:50.950> autofocus<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.760> should<00:02:52.120> work

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
full time autofocus it should work

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.230 
full time autofocus it should work
pretty<00:02:52.570> well<00:02:53.310> next<00:02:54.310> feature<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.790> want<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.090> talk

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
pretty well next feature I want to talk

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.620 
pretty well next feature I want to talk
about<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.410> does<00:02:56.620> have<00:02:56.680> two<00:02:57.370> SD<00:02:58.300> card

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
about is that it does have two SD card

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.890 
about is that it does have two SD card
slot<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.380> put<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.710> two<00:03:00.240> SDXC<00:03:01.240> cards<00:03:01.780> in

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
slot so you can put in two SDXC cards in

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.050 
slot so you can put in two SDXC cards in
there<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:02.800> means<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.520> can<00:03:03.670> get<00:03:03.820> up<00:03:03.940> to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
there so that means you can get up to

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.470 
there so that means you can get up to
128<00:03:05.020> gigabytes<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.590> each<00:03:05.710> slot<00:03:06.150> thing<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.300> with

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
128 gigabytes in each slot thing is with

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.120 
128 gigabytes in each slot thing is with
that<00:03:07.540> if<00:03:07.870> one<00:03:08.020> of<00:03:08.140> them<00:03:08.260> crashes<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:08.920> always

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
that if one of them crashes you always

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.090 
that if one of them crashes you always
have<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> backup<00:03:09.550> card<00:03:09.940> already<00:03:10.210> in<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> camera

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
have a backup card already in the camera

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.860 
have a backup card already in the camera
but<00:03:12.100> this<00:03:12.370> actually<00:03:12.640> very<00:03:13.030> nice<00:03:13.180> feature<00:03:13.480> if

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
but this actually very nice feature if

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.270 
but this actually very nice feature if
you<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.470> don't<00:03:14.770> want<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.040> carry<00:03:15.190> around

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
you just don't want to carry around

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.550 
you just don't want to carry around
extra<00:03:15.760> cards<00:03:16.030> just<00:03:16.210> stick<00:03:16.450> them<00:03:16.540> both<00:03:16.720> in<00:03:16.960> or

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
extra cards just stick them both in or

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.830 
extra cards just stick them both in or
have<00:03:17.800> jpg<00:03:18.400> someone<00:03:18.850> draws<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.360> other<00:03:19.510> give

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
have jpg someone draws on the other give

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.610 
have jpg someone draws on the other give
one<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.290> client<00:03:20.680> do<00:03:21.610> something<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.180> that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
one to the client do something like that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.040 
one to the client do something like that
next<00:03:23.620> thing<00:03:23.740> is<00:03:23.770> this<00:03:24.220> does<00:03:24.580> have<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:25.050> magnesium

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
next thing is this does have a magnesium

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.680 
next thing is this does have a magnesium
alloy<00:03:26.590> top<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.160> rear<00:03:27.490> and<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:28.360> makes<00:03:28.570> this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
alloy top and rear and that makes this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.330 
alloy top and rear and that makes this
camera<00:03:29.020> extremely<00:03:29.500> durable<00:03:29.710> a<00:03:29.950> lot<00:03:30.100> of<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
camera extremely durable a lot of the

very<00:03:41.950> strong<00:03:42.520> last<00:03:43.210> thing<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.570> want<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.810> talk

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
very strong last thing I want to talk

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.460 
very strong last thing I want to talk
about<00:03:44.050> is<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.910> ISO<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:46.180> ranges<00:03:46.660> from<00:03:46.720> 100<00:03:47.440> to

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
about is the ISO that ranges from 100 to

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.100 
about is the ISO that ranges from 100 to
6400<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:48.970> means<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.240> can<00:03:49.420> shoot<00:03:49.630> in<00:03:49.810> very

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
6400 so that means you can shoot in very

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.290 
6400 so that means you can shoot in very
low<00:03:50.410> light<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.370> actually<00:03:51.610> goes<00:03:51.940> up<00:03:52.150> from

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
low light and this actually goes up from

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.170 
low light and this actually goes up from
3200<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.650> d90<00:03:54.070> so<00:03:54.670> guys<00:03:54.850> those<00:03:55.150> are
