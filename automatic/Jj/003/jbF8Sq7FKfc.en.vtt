00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:21.269
 and here we are on a country track and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 already know enjoying the Christmas of 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.070
 the christmas plot of the new year and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 be with your family that are the most 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.420
 nice that there is in the world and good we go 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.020
 to now make a water fruit of the life 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:39.390
 those of the film and that then traver 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:43.560
 let's see what is marking here 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.470
 the points 754 points we are going to put the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.450
 water to see how it works and so 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.270
 we see that we test what it is that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.710
 water resistant then well I think 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 that does not look a little good for the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 clarity of light we are passing the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.700
 truth is that a wonderful day here 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.010
 enjoying with the family with a 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.650
 family especially from my girlfriend of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.420
 gaby and good it happened very well here I am 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.479
 very happy all the love that I have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.300
 provided here and week received as a 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.490
 person a part of the family then you 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.910
 let's do the test of both the clock 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.590
 as of the signature but to the water we see that 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.410
 continues to illuminate that there is no 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 problem and now we go again it's me 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.490
 looking at me we want we put the water and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.340
 the points are also marked 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.380
 without any problem then we can see 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 which is water resistant then what 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.240
 I'm going to do now but what I'm going to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.860
 to do is that I 'm going to take a shower 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.080
 then I'm going to bathe the pool and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 I will comment on how to stop and as if 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.909
 we would have a soccer hug and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.039
 I love you very much, thanks for the support 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.960
 Merry Christmas for everyone this a 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.340
 video from my blog you already know that on the blog 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.920
 what they will find is what if in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.200
 all the feed what more in life 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.899
 real experiences 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.170
 dynamic themes you all do something to 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.890
 that people who are not going to talk 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.899
 effectively we are going to talk only 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.030
 of services and we will not talk about me 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.489
 as a person of what I think of what 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.200
 I believe what is happening 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.420
 is a playlist that the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.030
 I invite you to listen and if you do not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.730
 like it because it speaks to us fully 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.560
 exercises then listen to it then 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.959
 Greetings to all a hug please give 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.060
