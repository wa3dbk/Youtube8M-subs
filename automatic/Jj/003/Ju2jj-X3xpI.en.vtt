 achieve tangible benefits and decide 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.970
 the problem here is its deficiency it is first 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.220
 savings in this erosion prevention 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.200

 returning home decided seriously 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.850
 set up a system

 the fields of the barracks of jaba lily of the valley 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.100
 really had a desire sent from 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.840
 ideas about introducing a drip system 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.489
 irrigation when and given germany 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.739
 the intern of the year worked on one

 modern German household slaughtered 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.100

 which have machines of rotation you for 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.960
 vegetable canals were built 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.240
 previously they took into account the potential 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.940
 development of new irrigated land and 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.990
 future dependent on this channel with 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.540
 those and transition ragimov for experiment 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.520
 the young man took the most suffering from little water 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.440

 Babajanov Russian district 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.370
 today in his demonstration field 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.270
 installed a foreign system 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.190
 production 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.370
 it is easy to clean and easy to use. 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.870
 use and affordable 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.030
 the results of his experiment can 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.130
 was able to demonstrate during the open 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.050
 field day larvae not mounting mounting 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.930
 and the commissioning of the claim is enough 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.940
 fast for example installation is count by 1 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.070
 hectare of garden takes only one day 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.669
 need 12 fixed specialist 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.860
 and three simple workers absolutely everything 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.350
 trees get evenly irrigating 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.630
 water according to the norms of the amount of irrigated water 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.940
 can be considered and keep clear records 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.010
 to prevent excess or same 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.669
 lack of moisture in the root area 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.919
 system 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.530
 able to achieve more water saving 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.210
 fifty percent now have him a system 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.979
 can be safely applied for 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.979
 gardening and for vegetable growing 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.720
 local farmers due to drought and shortages 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.060
 water and electricity can't get 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.490
 decent harvest this year damage 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.460
 inflicted by drought and irrigation problem 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.650
 water is estimated at 300 thousand dollars a 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.320
 the government is unable to pay 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.450
 compensation names i which farms 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.070
 not deleted from the list of debtors 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.070
 water and electricity taxes 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.120
 so as not to deprive young scientists how can 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.800
 Sharipov desire to solve problems and 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.620
 introduce new systems in the country 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.600
 government must implement aggregates and 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.600
 support talented youth
