I want the darker color to be on the

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.770 
I want the darker color to be on the
flower<00:01:06.460> like<00:01:07.460> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.710 

and<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.830> take<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.310> aqua<00:01:14.729> painter<00:01:14.940> make

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and then I take my aqua painter make

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.990 
and then I take my aqua painter make
sure<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.409> too<00:01:16.740> wet<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.190> too<00:01:17.280> dry<00:01:17.490> if

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
sure that it's not too wet or too dry if

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.050 
sure that it's not too wet or too dry if
it's<00:01:18.299> too<00:01:18.390> wet<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.490> rub<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
it's too wet I just rub it from the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's too wet I just rub it from the
paper<00:01:21.420> towel<00:01:21.720> or<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.710> too<00:01:22.860> dry<00:01:22.979> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
paper towel or if it's too dry to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
paper towel or if it's too dry to
squeeze<00:01:23.610> water<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.320> then

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
squeeze water a little bit and then

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.160 
squeeze water a little bit and then
dried<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:28.940> just<00:01:29.940> perfect<00:01:30.509> for

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
dried so it's like just just perfect for

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130 
dried so it's like just just perfect for
me<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.409> least<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:32.000> as<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.450> practice<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.110> will

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
me at least and as you practice you will

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.490 
me at least and as you practice you will
get<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.830> fill<00:01:35.580> for<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.899> then<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.200> start

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
get more fill for it so then I start

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.420 
get more fill for it so then I start
from<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.830> edge<00:01:38.180> guess<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.420> too<00:01:39.690> much<00:01:39.720> water

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
from the edge guess it's too much water

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
from the edge guess it's too much water
and<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:42.720> blend<00:01:43.380> towards<00:01:43.860> them<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:46.289> portion

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and I blend towards them the portion

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.639 
and I blend towards them the portion
which<00:01:47.039> is<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.399> colored<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.210> does<00:01:48.649> color

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
which is not colored so does color

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.910 
which is not colored so does color
spreads<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:51.630> will<00:01:51.840> give<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.080> nice<00:01:52.320> shaded

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
spreads and that will give a nice shaded

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
spreads and that will give a nice shaded
look<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.610> will<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.909> darker<00:01:54.300> where<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
look because it will be darker where you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.540 
look because it will be darker where you
put<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> color<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.470> mean<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.369> lighter

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
put the color I mean to a little lighter

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.520 
put the color I mean to a little lighter
and<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.970> end<00:01:57.149> where<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.050> no<00:01:58.229> color

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and the end where there's like no color

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.529 
and the end where there's like no color
I<00:01:58.800> can't<00:01:59.460> let<00:01:59.580> this<00:01:59.729> dry<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.179> while<00:02:00.330> this

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
I can't let this dry and while this

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.950 
I can't let this dry and while this
dries<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.590> go<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.220> color<00:02:03.119> other<00:02:03.420> parts

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
dries you can go and color other parts

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
dries you can go and color other parts
which<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.289> not<00:02:04.470> touching<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.280> part<00:02:05.610> but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
which are not touching this part but

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.150 
which are not touching this part but
they're<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.179> further<00:02:06.509> away<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.950> ink

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
they're like further away so the ink

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.820 
they're like further away so the ink
doesn't<00:02:08.399> blend<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.360> don't<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.929> whole

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
doesn't blend and you don't get a whole

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.160 
doesn't blend and you don't get a whole
lot<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.069> mess<00:02:12.800> do<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> same<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:16.019> do

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
lot of mess do the same and you can do

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.930 
lot of mess do the same and you can do
like<00:02:16.380> few<00:02:16.620> parts<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.070> once<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:18.239> one<00:02:18.450> here

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
like few parts at once this one here

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.120 
like few parts at once this one here
color<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.209> one<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:22.170> color<00:02:22.410> inside<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
color that one I can color inside the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.740 
color that one I can color inside the
flower<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> center<00:02:26.750> controller

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
