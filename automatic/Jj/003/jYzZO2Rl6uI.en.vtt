the<00:02:00.370> London<00:02:01.000> broil<00:02:01.180> strips<00:02:01.660> make<00:02:02.560> sure

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
the London broil strips make sure

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.320 
the London broil strips make sure
everything's<00:02:03.100> coated<00:02:03.460> nice<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.760> evenly<00:02:04.060> and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
everything's coated nice and evenly and

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.880 
everything's coated nice and evenly and
then<00:02:04.510> we'll<00:02:04.780> stick<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.530> fridge<00:02:05.830> and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
then we'll stick it in the fridge and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.380 
then we'll stick it in the fridge and
let<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.310> marinate<00:02:06.760> for<00:02:06.790> 24<00:02:07.060> hours<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:09.490> I'm

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
let it marinate for 24 hours and I'm

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.900 
let it marinate for 24 hours and I'm
just<00:02:10.690> using<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.200> basic<00:02:11.470> food<00:02:12.070> dehydrator<00:02:12.730> with

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
just using a basic food dehydrator with

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.120 
just using a basic food dehydrator with
stackable<00:02:13.480> trays<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.320> I've<00:02:14.470> put<00:02:14.709> numbers<00:02:15.100> on

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
stackable trays and I've put numbers on

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.150 
stackable trays and I've put numbers on
the<00:02:15.370> trays<00:02:15.610> for<00:02:15.880> rotation<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:17.620> 24<00:02:18.130> hours

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the trays for rotation so it's 24 hours

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.520 
the trays for rotation so it's 24 hours
later<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.209> time<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.480> start<00:02:20.200> putting

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
later and it's time to start putting

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.980 
later and it's time to start putting
these<00:02:20.680> London<00:02:21.250> broil<00:02:21.430> strips<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.840> these

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
these London broil strips on to these

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.890 
these London broil strips on to these
dehydrator<00:02:23.830> trays<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.480> don't<00:02:25.690> want<00:02:25.840> to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
dehydrator trays and you don't want to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.990 
dehydrator trays and you don't want to
put<00:02:26.080> too<00:02:26.350> many<00:02:26.500> strips<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.459> each<00:02:27.610> tray

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
put too many strips on to each tray

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.310 
put too many strips on to each tray
because<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.360> don't<00:02:28.510> want<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.690> overcrowd<00:02:29.080> them

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
because you don't want to overcrowd them

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.670 
because you don't want to overcrowd them
want<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.070> let<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.459> lot<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.820> air<00:02:31.150> flow<00:02:31.680> through

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
want to let a lot of air flow through

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.610 
want to let a lot of air flow through
the<00:02:32.950> dehydrator<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.209> able<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.450> dry<00:02:34.780> these

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the dehydrator to be able to dry these

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.550 
the dehydrator to be able to dry these
strips<00:02:36.040> evenly<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.570> two-pound<00:02:38.110> London

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
strips evenly so this two-pound London

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.640 
strips evenly so this two-pound London
broil<00:02:38.800> was<00:02:39.550> able<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:39.940> fill<00:02:40.270> up<00:02:40.480> four<00:02:40.810> trays<00:02:41.260> in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
broil was able to fill up four trays in

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.130 
broil was able to fill up four trays in
the<00:02:41.830> dehydrator<00:02:42.270> once<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.480> all<00:02:43.660> filled<00:02:43.930> up

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
the dehydrator once it's all filled up

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.220 
the dehydrator once it's all filled up
put<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> lid<00:02:44.860> on<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.220> plug<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.150> for<00:02:46.360> a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
put the lid on and plug it in for a

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.050 
put the lid on and plug it in for a
dehydrator<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.489> like<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> rotate

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
dehydrator like this I like to rotate

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.690 
dehydrator like this I like to rotate
the<00:02:49.510> trays<00:02:49.840> every<00:02:50.320> four<00:02:50.530> hours<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.220> this

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
the trays every four hours and this

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.810 
the trays every four hours and this
should<00:02:51.850> take<00:02:52.030> about<00:02:52.090> 12<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:53.200> 16<00:02:53.440> hours<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.400> cook
