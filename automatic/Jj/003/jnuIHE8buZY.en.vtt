started okay so battery percent for kit
kat<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.449> essentially<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.109> app<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.320> will

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
kat is essentially an app that will

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
dot for ohio presumably now the upside

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.130 
dot for ohio presumably now the upside
is<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.460> don't<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.510> roots<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
is you don't have to have roots so you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.570 
is you don't have to have roots so you
don't<00:00:28.439> need<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.800> anything<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.279> device

people have pointed out the downside to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.830 
people have pointed out the downside to
this<00:00:49.260> app<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.760> fact<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
this app which is the fact that you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.299 
this app which is the fact that you
actually<00:00:51.989> can't<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> battery

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
actually can't see the battery

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
actually can't see the battery
percentage<00:00:53.489> until<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.600> gets<00:00:54.780> below<00:00:54.989> around

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
percentage until it gets below around

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.029 
percentage until it gets below around
fifty<00:00:56.100> percent<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.530> downside

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
fifty percent or so but so that downside

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
fifty percent or so but so that downside
i<00:00:59.070> say<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> big<00:01:00.270> deal<00:01:00.480> because

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
i say it's not really a big deal because

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
i say it's not really a big deal because
I<00:01:01.350> don't<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:01.829> care<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.460> battery

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I don't really care about my battery

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210 
I don't really care about my battery
until<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.359> gets<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.229> fifty<00:01:04.769> percent<00:01:05.070> or

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
until it gets to about fifty percent or

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
until it gets to about fifty percent or
so<00:01:05.250> until<00:01:05.700> until<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.780> start<00:01:06.960> seeing<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.290> up

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so until until I can start seeing it up

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.679 
so until until I can start seeing it up
here<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.159> when<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.510> really<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
here is really when I really when I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.060 
here is really when I really when I
start<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.260> care<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:10.680> how<00:01:10.950> much

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
start to actually care about how much

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
start to actually care about how much
better<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.549> left<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.479> once<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> install

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
better have left now once you install
