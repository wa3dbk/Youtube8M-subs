00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.930 
plan on doing to the bike you saw how
much<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:34.110> bike<00:00:34.260> costs<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> frame<00:00:35.579> fork

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
much the bike costs for the frame fork

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.750 
much the bike costs for the frame fork
in<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> wheel<00:00:36.360> set<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.949> I<00:00:37.949> actually<00:00:38.100> did<00:00:38.550> end

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
in the wheel set and I actually did end

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.900 
in the wheel set and I actually did end
up<00:00:38.820> getting<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.390> good<00:00:39.809> amount<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.910> initial

cost of the bike back so if you plan on

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.700 
cost of the bike back so if you plan on
doing<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.120> hopping<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.559> have

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I found in my experience that these 110

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.420 
I found in my experience that these 110
headsets<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:46.259> will<00:01:46.439> last<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> life<00:01:47.189> of
