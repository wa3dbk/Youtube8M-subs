00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
conduit up into here and then the meter

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.740 
conduit up into here and then the meter
box<00:01:40.430> will<00:01:40.820> hang<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:42.560> this<00:01:43.520> wall<00:01:43.790> either<00:01:44.060> right

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
box will hang on this wall either right

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.360 
box will hang on this wall either right
in<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:44.960> location<00:01:45.350> or<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.300> right<00:01:47.450> or<00:01:47.720> left

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.359 

basically<00:01:52.370> everything<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:52.940> set<00:01:53.870> for<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
basically everything is set for the

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.450 
basically everything is set for the
metal<00:01:55.640> roof<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:57.440> hopefully<00:01:57.800> we<00:01:57.920> will<00:01:57.950> get<00:01:58.190> that

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
metal roof so hopefully we will get that

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.790 
metal roof so hopefully we will get that
then<00:01:59.270> we'll<00:01:59.390> finish<00:01:59.570> out<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.990> OSB<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:00.619> this

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
then we'll finish out the OSB in this

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.280 
then we'll finish out the OSB in this
corner<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:02.630> Gable<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.840> will<00:02:06.080> spot

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
corner and the Gable and this will spot

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.380 
corner and the Gable and this will spot
right<00:02:06.440> here

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
right here

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.280 
right here
so<00:02:08.390> hopefully<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.810> weather<00:02:08.929> will<00:02:09.050> be<00:02:09.170> better

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
so hopefully the weather will be better

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.630 
so hopefully the weather will be better
tomorrow<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.070> we'll<00:02:10.700> get<00:02:10.820> more<00:02:11.239> done
