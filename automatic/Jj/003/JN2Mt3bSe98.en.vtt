00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.918
 I have known a boy, a lonely guest who did not have to leave school 

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:10.083
 He often broke and left school without a single diploma 

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:14.167
 He could go any way, but luckily he found carp fishing 

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:19.626
 Carp fishing saved me, I was that boy and have always recognized that 

00:00:19.626 --> 00:00:24.959
 I owe a great life to carp fishing and I am happy that I can give something back now 

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:29.083
 For several years I had an idea that I can now fulfill 

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:32.667
 The Nashional Carp Academy 

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.751
 What is the Nashional Carp Academy? 

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:43.417
 It means that two professional qualifications are combined in a unique way 

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.209
 It is something that, as far as I know, has never been done before 

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:52.417
 The students study BTEC fish farm and BTEC trade 

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:59.125
 In this way they learn about practical skills reflecting on the waterfront 

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.709
 and also the commercial side of fishing 

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:09.626
 So everything from marketing, finance to running a store 

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:10.626
 Those things... 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.209
 Today I'm with a group of kids from a local school at Bayeswater Fishery near Chelmsford in Essex 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.876
 who is one of our local schools in Essex, called the Greenward Acadamy 

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.417
 I have worked with this group of children for the past 10 months 

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.876
 Go to school and involve them in what we do at Nash 

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.834
 A single workday or a whole week 

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.501
 and involve them in what they do in view of their subjects 

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:40.417
 Their English, their maths and sciences 

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:43.459
 Today is actually their last day of the school year 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.751
 It's the summer vacation so we agreed to fish our first night session 

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:55.584
 Actually a bit for fun. They have worked hard all year round so it is nice to spend some time and catch a fish 

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:02.501
 My name is Henry Sadler and we are here today for a night of fishing 

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:05.876
 Do you like the course? 

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:10.918
 I thought it was going to be a normal lesson again 

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:15.167
 but when I was really working on it, I really started to like it 

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:20.083
 some parts are more difficult in class but others are quite easy 

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:27.083
 Alan has helped us well with manuals and PowerPoint presentations. Since then it has been a lot easier 

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:30.751
 So it's more than just going fishing? 

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.292
 I really believe it learns more than just learning to throw and catch 

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:40.501
 It teaches you about the countryside, the life of wild animals and its ecosystems. 

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:44.459
 It teaches you to respect not only that, but also for fellow fishermen 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.792
 It teaches you not to leave a mess, but we live in a world where it has apparently become normal 

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:54.918
 Look, fishermen don't do that 

00:02:54.918 --> 00:03:05.667
 As much as it learns about fishing, so much does it teach you about fishing friendships and I think it's a fantastic time company 

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:10.000
 Whatever you want to call it, it brings people together who share the same idea to be at the water's edge 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.417
 It is nice to see that children who have never experienced this have become fishermen in such a short time 

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.792
 What do you like about the course? 

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:35.542
 I think it's nice to do things like this on a nice day 

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:37.501
 and to come to Bayeswater fishery 

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:45.042
 We go fishing every Friday, I suppose it's better than being at school 

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:51.250
 On Monday we learn about the commercial aspect of fishing but yes, it's ok 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.292
 Learn about running your own water 

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:59.751
 I was not a fisherman myself when I first started, but soon I wanted to go fishing myself 

00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:02.375
 It's a hobby now and I love to do it 

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:07.417
 Are you going fishing yourself in your free time? 

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:14.959
 In most weekends you do. Normally I go with my older brother. It has become a big game between the two of us now 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.417
 Since this course started, he has been jealous that I am part of the Nashional Academy 

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:24.209
 What did you learn? 

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:26.792
 I have learned to throw more precisely 

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.751
 From rigs to being able to feel the water 

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:33.709
 Anything really. The basis for making your own bait 

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.667
 We also went to the Shuttleworth college 

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:42.000
 We have been to colleagues and stock exchange to teach them how it really is 

00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:46.083
 ... what was your favorite moment? 

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:55.667
 Probably the first time I went. I believe we went to Birketts Hall fishery, and I entered one of the first games. And I won it 

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:57.334
 It was a really nice experience 

00:04:57.334 --> 00:05:00.876
 My favorite experience was when we went to Nash's office water 

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.999
 And your personal records? 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.999
 17lb 8oz, that was a nice mirror 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.876
 23lb 8oz 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.209
 Mine is 17lb 8oz 

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:14.918
 I did not catch mine during the course but mine weighs 18lb 

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:20.250
 I try to catch a 20 pounder and I harassed my brother by catching that 17lb 8oz 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.626
 but when he went he caught a 22lb 6oz so now it's my turn to beat him 

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:30.999
 Do you have a dream job in fishing? 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.709
 I would probably like to design 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.709
 mine would also be designing products 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.709
 Mine will probably be the same 

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:37.584
 Design all three products? 

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:38.042
 Yes 

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:38.667
 I like it 

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:39.584
 Do you like it? 

00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:40.626
 Yes definitely 

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:41.542
 What do you like about it? 

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:52.626
 It feels good to see that it makes a difference in the lives of these children, especially at school 

00:05:52.626 --> 00:06:00.667
 You have a mass of students who distance themselves from the traditional teaching process 

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:04.417
 I feel that this course has helped to reintegrate them to a certain extent 

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:13.918
 It keeps their way from trouble at school and now have a worldwide interest outside hanging behind a computer screen all day 

00:06:13.918 --> 00:06:17.000
 They go fishing every weekend, and that's fantastic 

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:21.751
 and this is a 17lb 8oz row carp that we just caught 

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:24.876
 Awesome! 

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:31.417
 They have done an exceptional geod. They have already done their job. They have passed this year, which is very important 

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:35.375
 And it was so cool to see them change 

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:39.334
 I met the children in September. They had a fishing rod in their hands but they were not fishermen 

00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:43.667
 And to see them now, 10 months later at the end of the ride ... that's just great 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.876
 Carp fishing is a great sport 

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:53.125
 It helps children to respect the countryside and nature and more importantly, it keeps them away from misery and street life 

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:58.417
 It can only be good for the young people, their families and the community as a whole
