00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.990
 hello everyone here we are with one 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.700
 new video recipe with the recipe of 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.040
 high and we move from Italy and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.130
 in fact we are going to end up in the east 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.770
 we prepare delicious together 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.029
 Oriental rice vermicelli we see 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.029
 immediately together with the ingredients 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:37.850
 for 4 people 200 g of vermicelli di 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.000
 rice 50 g of bean sprouts sauce 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.659
 soy enough oil sesame seeds 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.019
 extra virgin olive a pinch of salt 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:51.290
 50 60 g of half scrambled tofu 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:57.050
 onion 1 clove of garlic a quarter of 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.820
 sauerkraut 2 carrots and 2 zucchini the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.309
 procedure to prepare these 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.170
 vermicelli is really very simple 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.229
 the first thing to do is to 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.929
 rinse the vegetables well and cut them 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.830
 all of them julienne 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:15.259
 in the meantime we prepare a pan 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.660
 with the garlic clove the onion and a 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.649
 spoon of extra virgin olive oil and not 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.649
 let's warm up 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.550
 after sauteing the onion with 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.200
 garlic livid and I add vegetables 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.510
 to prepare this meal the ideal 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.880
 it would be a wok since the vegetables 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.840
 They must jump quickly pan are 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.640
 five minutes and as you know the wok has 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.220
 precisely indicated to do these le 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.420
 quick cooking 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.080
 but if you don't have it in short 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.250
 used a non-stick pan 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.420
 normal I go to add the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.899
 julienne cut vegetables 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.899
 carrots 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:26.060
 these are also zucchini and sauerkraut 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:29.900
 cut into julienne lifts the flame a little 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.180
 and then I blow up five minutes later 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.160
 add a pinch of salt 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.709
 because then we will also add 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.450
 the soy sauce that already contained the e 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.340
 so don't risk putting it on 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.340
 let's just pinch it too much 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.790
 while the vegetables and cook in the pan 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.250
 we deal with rice vermicelli 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.200
 these are made for michele de riso 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.480
 with rice flour and water and can be found 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.010
 easily both supermarket and in the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.660
 Oriental food stores more than 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.299
 other Chinese real touch prepared is 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.549
 however, it must be respected 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.209
 some small rules otherwise these 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:21.010
 spaghetti will become colluded 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.450
 inedible so how we proceed 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.730
 let us boil water in one 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.500
 pot closed by a lid in the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.690
 the moment he wanted to add a 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.850
 pinch of salt dissolve and they do 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.090
 let's put out the fire so let's put the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:39.980
 our split vermicelli we shell them a 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.620
 we cover and do with a fork 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.810
 cook with hot water but over heat 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.799
 off for 3 4 minutes then drain 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.500
 spaghetti well and then rinse them 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:57.950
 very well under a jet of cold water 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.190
 this operation is very important and then 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.359
 we can skip them in a pan with the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.810
 vegetables have passed five minutes and 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.609
 as you can see the vegetables are 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.340
 soften but not too much 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.580
 in fact, they have kept quite a bit 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.420
 bright color 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.160
 slightly crunchy important for 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.300
 this recipe is not to cook too much 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:29.340
 the vegetables making them too soft but 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.340
 leave them slightly crunchy 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:41.280
 now I'm going to add a pinch of 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:41.280
 salt I recommend not too much stir 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.960
 I also add the bean sprouts not there 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.879
 added first because I don't want to do it 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:05:00.340
 cook too much I prefer these too 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:05:03.419
 that they remain a little crispy prominence 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.419
 a few seconds 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.270
 we also make rice noodles which 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.259
 he cooked like I explained in 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.689
 previously I skip them a few minutes e 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.550
 I put out the fire 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:21.090
 now all we have to do is complete the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.770
 plate with a nice round of soy sauce 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.300
 that I deliberately put out of the fire 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.610
 but if you prefer you can too 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.240
 add it while sautÃ©ing the spaghetti 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:39.060
 and make it jump for a student then 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.060
 I add the sesame seeds that I love 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:45.490
 and finally we also add tofu 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.340
 scrambled that I prepared in 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.789
 precedence as in the video four ways 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.120
 to prepare the tofu you find here 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:58.599
 in my channel I put the link here 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.050
 overlay we also add the 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:07.089
 tofu and of course optional because 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:09.699
 if you don't want to put it you can also like 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:14.110
 but now let's give another nice mix 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:18.089
 to everything to make me flavor and to make 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.089
 mix all the flavors 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:27.259
 and also make sure that the soy sauce is 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.960
 distribute evenly put it 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:32.270
 too much soy sauce but first because 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.180
 we're going to add too much salt to the 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.400
 preparation and then why we don't want to 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.319
 let our spaghetti prove too much 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:44.419
 amber here is the vermicelli are 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:48.499
 ready and now we go immediately 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:51.169
 he fulfills and here they are ours 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.939
 debtors of rice then learn if 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.580
 favorite you can complete 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.919
 further the dish with a nice one 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:04.189
 grated fresh ginger or 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:07.580
 as I do a pinch of ginger in 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:12.259
 powder to give the dish a note 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:15.949
 even more oriental these vermicelli 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:19.039
 they are really easy to prepare 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:21.169
 it takes just ten minutes on 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:24.469
 meeting really tasty and then 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:26.659
 I think it's nice to change from time to time 

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:29.379
 and also eat something a little more 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:29.379
 ethnic 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:33.710
 before concluding I would like to thank
