destroy this block and go like this and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.039 
destroy this block and go like this and
go<00:01:58.049> here<00:01:59.579> okay<00:02:00.579> so<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:02.799> are<00:02:03.100> only<00:02:03.430> for<00:02:03.789> the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.699 
go here okay so these are only for the
sound<00:02:05.049> generator<00:02:05.470> guys<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.929> it's<00:02:07.929> not<00:02:08.110> really

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
sound generator guys so it's not really

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.650 
sound generator guys so it's not really
important<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.519> can<00:02:09.729> make<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.060> without<00:02:10.239> sound

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
important you can make it without sound

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.380 
important you can make it without sound
generator<00:02:11.080> on<00:02:11.349> with<00:02:11.590> it's<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:13.000> petrol

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
generator on with it's really petrol

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.050 
generator on with it's really petrol
with<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.720> engine<00:02:14.110> area<00:02:14.819> okay

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
with this engine area okay

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.880 
with this engine area okay
and<00:02:16.860> then<00:02:17.860> once<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.459> do<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.150> take<00:02:19.540> these<00:02:19.900> put

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
then go okay okay put the same generator

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.229 
then go okay okay put the same generator
turn<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.239> sound<00:02:34.540> generator<00:02:34.870> twice<00:02:35.380> or<00:02:36.239> just

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239
