doing right now as you can see the

strategy that we're on got us to a very

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970 
strategy that we're on got us to a very
high<00:00:32.969> around<00:00:33.360> 77<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.350> think<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:34.890> now

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

high around 77 I think it's on right now
78<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.840> 78<00:00:37.380> before<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.610> strategy

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
78 but we got the 78 before the strategy

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.260 
78 but we got the 78 before the strategy
went<00:00:39.239> downhill<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.989> ran<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> ammo<00:00:40.770> my

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
went downhill we ran out of ammo my

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
went downhill we ran out of ammo my
sliquifier<00:00:42.270> ran<00:00:42.809> ammo<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.920> sliquifier<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
sliquifier ran ammo and a sliquifier is

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.610 
sliquifier ran ammo and a sliquifier is
key<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.360> strategy<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> some<00:00:46.140> will<00:00:46.590> call

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
key to the strategy and some will call

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
key to the strategy and some will call
it<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> glitch<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:47.730> glitch

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
is just garbage everything is just trash

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.310 
is just garbage everything is just trash
once<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> 50<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> only<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.659> useful

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
once you get to 50 the only thing useful

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
is the ray gun the semi useful but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
is the ray gun the semi useful but
sliquifier<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.360> hundred<00:01:36.479> percent<00:01:36.659> the

sliquifier is one hundred percent the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
sliquifier is one hundred percent the
key<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.409> strategy<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.789> to<00:01:38.880> keep

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.210 
key to the strategy if you have to keep
on<00:01:39.149> shooting<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.750> bottom<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.649> make<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> slick

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
on shooting the bottom to make it slick

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.859 
on shooting the bottom to make it slick
so<00:01:41.429> they<00:01:41.549> can't<00:01:41.759> climb<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.179> and<00:01:42.390> keep<00:01:42.750> on

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so they can't climb up and keep on

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.449 
so they can't climb up and keep on
following<00:01:43.110> them<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.069> room<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
following them down into the room and

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.279 
following them down into the room and
you<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> shoot<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> pile<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
you have to shoot the pile so it

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.199 
you have to shoot the pile so it
explodes<00:01:46.679> them<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> chain<00:01:47.580> reaction<00:01:48.030> goes

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
explodes them so the chain reaction goes

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.639 
explodes them so the chain reaction goes
on<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.569> long<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.899> possibly<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.470> without

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
on as long as it possibly can without

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.580 
on as long as it possibly can without
them<00:01:49.950> coming<00:01:50.549> back<00:01:50.580> up<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.810> after<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.439> shoot

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
them coming back up but after you shoot

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.199 
them coming back up but after you shoot
that<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:52.979> bullet<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.429> should<00:01:53.640> last<00:01:53.819> a<00:01:54.030> whole

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
that one bullet it should last a whole

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.510 
that one bullet it should last a whole
entire<00:01:54.450> round<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.799> sometimes<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> may<00:01:56.399> have

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
entire round but sometimes you may have

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.249 
entire round but sometimes you may have
to<00:01:56.640> shoot<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.209> get<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> bottom<00:01:57.780> slick<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
to shoot to get the bottom slick and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.870 
to shoot to get the bottom slick and
that's<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:58.590> makes<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.890> honor<00:01:59.039> am<00:01:59.280> i<00:01:59.310> right

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
that's what makes your honor am i right

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.749 
that's what makes your honor am i right
it<00:02:00.329> was<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> very<00:02:00.570> good<00:02:00.869> strategy<00:02:01.490> some<00:02:02.490> people

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it was a very good strategy some people

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
it was a very good strategy some people
may<00:02:02.880> say<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> doesn't<00:02:03.450> take<00:02:03.630> skill<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
may say it doesn't take skill but it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.480 
may say it doesn't take skill but it
actually<00:02:04.320> does<00:02:04.680> yet<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.039> keep<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> under

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
actually does yet they keep it under

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.520 
actually does yet they keep it under
control<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.500> your

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530

perks and you have to get all set up you
have<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.569> build<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> gun<00:02:10.170> yet<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.470> bill

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
have to build the gun yet the bill

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
have to build the gun yet the bill
trample<00:02:11.039> steam<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.790> set<00:02:12.090> up

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
trample steam you have to get all set up

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
trample steam you have to get all set up
just<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.510> even<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.900> there<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.410> does<00:02:13.530> take

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
just to even get there so it does take

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
just to even get there so it does take
some<00:02:13.920> skill<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.400> only<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.760> try<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.540> set<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
some skill so only and try and set the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.530 
some skill so only and try and set the
strategy<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:16.769> skill<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.250> because<00:02:18.060> it's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
strategy and your skill is because it's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
strategy and your skill is because it's
hard<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.900> even<00:02:18.959> get<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:20.310> once<00:02:20.400> you're<00:02:20.640> in

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
hard to even get into but once you're in

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
hard to even get into but once you're in
it<00:02:20.910> you're<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.660> long<00:02:21.870> time<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
it you're in it for a long time it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.140 
it you're in it for a long time it's
basically<00:02:23.069> like<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.310> round<00:02:23.580> skipping<00:02:23.970> glitch

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
basically like a round skipping glitch

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150 
basically like a round skipping glitch
but<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.660> even<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> glitch<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.860> just<00:02:26.040> makes

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
but it's not even a glitch it just makes

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.500 
but it's not even a glitch it just makes
the<00:02:26.310> rounds<00:02:26.430> you're<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.880> fast<00:02:27.120> coz<00:02:27.330> help

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.910 
juggernaut and then going the strategy
you're<00:02:51.810> done<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.260> should<00:02:52.410> have<00:02:52.530> all<00:02:52.739> that

a buyer on 10 it's fine you should get

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.460 
a buyer on 10 it's fine you should get
it<00:02:56.819> as<00:02:56.910> soon<00:02:57.030> as<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.690> then<00:02:57.750> go<00:02:58.349> into
