the<00:01:16.870> most<00:01:17.049> difficult<00:01:17.200> part<00:01:17.500> about<00:01:17.830> dripping

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
the most difficult part about dripping

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.080 
the most difficult part about dripping
is<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:19.890> consistency<00:01:20.890> just<00:01:21.100> trying<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.940> put

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
is the consistency just trying to put

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.840 
is the consistency just trying to put
down<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.299> same<00:01:22.479> lap<00:01:22.720> over<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:23.140> over<00:01:23.320> again

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
down the same lap over and over again

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.820 
down the same lap over and over again
changing<00:01:24.850> track<00:01:25.300> conditions<00:01:25.830> different

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
changing track conditions different

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.030 
changing track conditions different
drivers<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.479> then<00:01:29.170> even<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.590> know<00:01:29.680> sometimes

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
drivers and then even you know sometimes

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.530 
drivers and then even you know sometimes
you<00:01:30.130> have<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> problem<00:01:30.549> with<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.820> car<00:01:31.000> but<00:01:31.479> you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
you have a problem with the car but you

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.600 
you have a problem with the car but you
always<00:01:31.869> have<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.140> perform<00:01:32.530> perfectly<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.460> are

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
always have to perform perfectly you are

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.790 
always have to perform perfectly you are
to<00:01:33.850> move<00:01:34.000> on<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.390> next<00:01:34.509> rounds<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.380> it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
to move on to the next rounds so it's

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.859 
to move on to the next rounds so it's
very<00:01:35.950> difficult<00:01:36.399> to<00:01:36.670> always<00:01:37.360> be<00:01:37.690> able<00:01:37.750> to

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
very difficult to always be able to

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.090 
very difficult to always be able to
adjust<00:01:38.649> for<00:01:39.130> different<00:01:40.090> settings<00:01:40.659> however

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
adjust for different settings however

00:01:41.100 --> 00:02:19.330 
adjust for different settings however
perform<00:01:42.100> in<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.280> same

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
what are we gonna do different so I gave

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.340 
what are we gonna do different so I gave
him<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> little<00:02:57.270> bit<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.540> room<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.200> one

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
him a little bit of room in the one

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.010 
him a little bit of room in the one
section<00:02:58.590> track<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.130> Dovan<00:02:59.580> at<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.030> Horseshoe

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
section track in Dovan at the Horseshoe

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.020 
section track in Dovan at the Horseshoe
and<00:03:01.680> got<00:03:01.890> really<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:02.370> close<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and got really really close to the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.590 
and got really really close to the
Horseshoe

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
Horseshoe

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.020 
Horseshoe
however<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:06.000> his<00:03:06.750> chase<00:03:07.050> run<00:03:07.319> he<00:03:07.500> got<00:03:07.680> close<00:03:08.100> he

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
however on his chase run he got close he

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.140 
however on his chase run he got close he
wasn't<00:03:09.330> as<00:03:09.480> close<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.459> medium<00:03:11.459> close<00:03:11.760> for

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
wasn't as close but medium close for

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.840 
wasn't as close but medium close for
longer<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:12.959> makes<00:03:13.170> sense<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.580> they<00:03:14.730> gave

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
longer that makes sense and so they gave

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.470 
longer that makes sense and so they gave
the<00:03:15.000> win<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.300> him<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:17.330> couldn't<00:03:18.330> really

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the win to him so it was couldn't really

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.000 
the win to him so it was couldn't really
tell<00:03:18.690> what<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.959> judges<00:03:19.170> wanted<00:03:19.560> us<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.890> do

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
tell what the judges wanted us to do

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.680 
tell what the judges wanted us to do
differently<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.480> kept

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
differently so I just kind of kept

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.940 
differently so I just kind of kept
pushing<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:22.080> little<00:03:22.290> harder<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.620> harder<00:03:22.830> in

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
pushing a little harder and harder in

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.460 
pushing a little harder and harder in
the<00:03:23.040> horseshoe<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.900> like<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.989> said<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:25.260> kept

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
the horseshoe and like I said we kept

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.259 
the horseshoe and like I said we kept
getting<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.920> vote<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.280> vote<00:03:26.340> but<00:03:26.790> never<00:03:26.970> two

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
getting one vote one vote but never two

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.310 
getting one vote one vote but never two
and<00:03:27.600> then<00:03:27.720> finally<00:03:28.709> he<00:03:29.640> got<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.269> little<00:03:31.050> closer

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
and then finally he got a little closer

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.479 
and then finally he got a little closer
and<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.340> was<00:03:33.170> Mexico<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.230> going<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.950> New

yeah<00:03:41.010> how<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.489> difficult<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.180> drift<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.690> 16

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
yeah how is difficult to drift a 16

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.380 
yeah how is difficult to drift a 16
degree<00:03:43.739> Bank<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.519> oh<00:03:44.610> yeah<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:47.390> very

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
degree Bank and oh yeah it is a very

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.110 
degree Bank and oh yeah it is a very
difficult<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:49.350> drift<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.160> wall<00:03:50.370> it's<00:03:50.670> very

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
difficult to drift that wall it's very

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.600 
difficult to drift that wall it's very
steep<00:03:51.330> banking<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:53.160> have<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.370> kind<00:03:53.550> of

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
steep banking and you have to kind of

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.940 
steep banking and you have to kind of
pitch<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.970> car<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.319> rear<00:03:55.620> tires
