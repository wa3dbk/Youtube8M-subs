course<00:02:54.090> much<00:02:54.390> simpler<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.380> idea<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.800> that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
course much simpler the idea is that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.650 
course much simpler the idea is that
this<00:02:56.160> animal<00:02:56.610> kingdom<00:02:57.030> was<00:02:57.150> attacked<00:02:57.480> by
