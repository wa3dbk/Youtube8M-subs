there<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.770> how<00:00:43.860> does<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> work<00:00:44.160> well

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
there you go so how does it work well

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.330 
there you go so how does it work well
how<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.149> works<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:46.230> use<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> cannula<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
how it works is we use this cannula and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
how it works is we use this cannula and
what's<00:00:47.730> unique<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.450> cannula<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
what's unique about this cannula is that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.240 
what's unique about this cannula is that
it<00:00:49.500> introduces<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.730> local<00:00:51.690> anesthetic

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
it introduces the local anesthetic

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.650 
it introduces the local anesthetic
simultaneously<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.579> suctions<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.449> fat<00:00:54.629> out

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
simultaneously it's suctions the fat out

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.560 
simultaneously it's suctions the fat out
so<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.770> lot<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.070> people<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.489> seen<00:00:56.730> videos<00:00:57.539> of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
so a lot of people have seen videos of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
so a lot of people have seen videos of
traditional<00:00:58.199> lipo<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.559> looks<00:00:58.739> pretty

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
traditional lipo and looks pretty

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.430 
traditional lipo and looks pretty
aggressive<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> very<00:01:00.899> gentle

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
aggressive and this is a very gentle

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.830 
aggressive and this is a very gentle
fanny<00:01:01.800> motion<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> water<00:01:03.059> dislodges

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
fanny motion because the water dislodges

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.340 
fanny motion because the water dislodges
the fat<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:04.769> gentle<00:01:05.330> fashion<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
the fat in a very gentle fashion so you
say<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.070> redistributing<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
say it's like redistributing it is it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.580 
say it's like redistributing it is it
like<00:01:09.390> play-doh<00:01:09.659> where<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.470> of

remould in everything you moving

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
remould in everything you moving
everywhere<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.960> basically<00:01:13.380> dislodge<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> fat

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
everywhere we basically dislodge the fat

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
everywhere we basically dislodge the fat
and<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.820> suction<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> fat<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.960> fat<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and we suction the fat out the fat is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200 
and we suction the fat out the fat is
not<00:01:16.470> damaged<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.280> pure<00:01:17.520> state<00:01:17.610> guide

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
not damaged it's in a pure state guide

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
not damaged it's in a pure state guide
you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.600> take<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.080> transfer<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you can take it and transfer it back to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.730 
you can take it and transfer it back to
areas<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.280> might<00:01:20.430> want<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.350> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
areas you might want it now if you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
areas you might want it now if you
redistribute<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> though<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
redistribute it though is that good to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.120 
redistribute it though is that good to
put<00:01:24.750> fat<00:01:24.960> back<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> mean<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
put fat back in so I mean what is it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
put fat back in so I mean what is it
absolutely<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.270> own<00:01:27.420> fat<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
absolutely because it's your own fat it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200 
absolutely because it's your own fat it
goes<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:29.040> body<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.670> unlike<00:01:30.060> you
