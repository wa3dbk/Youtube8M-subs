00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
pretty tough if you are on my situation

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
pretty tough if you are on my situation
I<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> Charmander<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.219> makes<00:00:38.399> things

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I have a Charmander which makes things

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
I have a Charmander which makes things
really<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.210> difficult<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.320> mad

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
really really difficult because I'm mad

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.010 
really really difficult because I'm mad
at<00:00:40.590> iping<00:00:40.980> disadvantage<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.750> off<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
at iping disadvantage now right off the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
at iping disadvantage now right off the
bat<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.469> sure<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.890> should<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.100> Ember

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
bat I'm not sure if I should use Ember

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
bat I'm not sure if I should use Ember
or<00:00:44.910> metal<00:00:45.210> claw<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:45.989> metal<00:00:46.320> claw

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
or metal claw but I think metal claw

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.779 
or metal claw but I think metal claw
will<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.280> damage

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
will actually do more damage

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
will actually do more damage
it<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.300> super<00:00:48.690> effective<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.190> need<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it is super effective but you need to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
it is super effective but you need to
keep<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.059> mind<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.690> rocks<00:00:52.110> Pokemon<00:00:52.680> have

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
keep in mind that all rocks Pokemon have

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
keep in mind that all rocks Pokemon have
amazing<00:00:53.760> physical<00:00:54.030> defense

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
amazing physical defense

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.930 
amazing physical defense
well<00:00:55.410> amazing<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.340> point<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> game

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
well amazing for this point in the game

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.299 
well amazing for this point in the game
so<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.469> physical<00:00:58.949> attacks<00:00:59.160> like

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so you know your physical attacks like

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
so you know your physical attacks like
metal<00:00:59.640> claw<00:00:59.760> might<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.570> much<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
metal claw might not do as much but I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.540 
metal claw might not do as much but I
still<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> will<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.100> than<00:01:02.160> Ember

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
still think it will do more than Ember

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.490 
still think it will do more than Ember
just<00:01:03.120> cuz<00:01:03.300> ember<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:03.960> effective

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
just cuz ember is not very effective

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
just cuz ember is not very effective
now<00:01:05.159> Geodude<00:01:05.760> can't<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.150> too<00:01:06.270> much

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
now Geodude can't do too much

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.170 
now Geodude can't do too much
offensively<00:01:07.460> but<00:01:08.460> yeah<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
offensively but yeah it's just kind of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.090 
offensively but yeah it's just kind of
annoying<00:01:09.510> defensively<00:01:10.439> especially<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
annoying defensively especially when you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
annoying defensively especially when you
use<00:01:11.220> these<00:01:11.310> defense<00:01:11.700> curls<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.510> probably

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
use these defense curls so I'm probably

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.210 
use these defense curls so I'm probably
gonna<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> switch<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.740> Ember<00:01:14.100> now

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
gonna have to switch over to Ember now

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
gonna have to switch over to Ember now
finish<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.150> off<00:01:15.299> yeah<00:01:16.020> despite<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.530> being

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
finish it off yeah despite it not being

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.760 
finish it off yeah despite it not being
very<00:01:17.009> effective<00:01:17.100> um<00:01:18.409> okay<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.560> he's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
very effective um okay I think he's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.230 
very effective um okay I think he's
gonna<00:01:19.860> heal<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.400> turn<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:20.939> gonna<00:01:21.090> go

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
gonna heal this turn so I'm gonna go

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.780 
gonna heal this turn so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.689> use<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> potion<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.920> well<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
ahead and use a potion as well just to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.609 
ahead and use a potion as well just to
prepare<00:01:24.180> myself<00:01:24.570> better<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.350> his<00:01:25.439> next

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
prepare myself better for his next

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.249 
prepare myself better for his next
Pokemon<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.210> let's<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.720> he<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:27.930> does

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
Pokemon so let's see if he actually does

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
Pokemon so let's see if he actually does
heal<00:01:28.590> oh<00:01:28.860> no<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> didn't<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.150> kind<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
heal oh no I didn't it's kind of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
heal oh no I didn't it's kind of
surprising<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.950> still<00:01:32.159> knock<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
surprising actually I can still knock it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
surprising actually I can still knock it
out<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.670> another<00:01:32.790> ember<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.930> guess<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
out for another ember and I guess that

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.109 
out for another ember and I guess that
worked<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> bit<00:01:35.369> more<00:01:35.400> HP

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
worked out because I have a bit more HP

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
worked out because I have a bit more HP
for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.390> next<00:01:37.320> book<00:01:37.470> mine<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.829> missing<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
for the next book mine is missing that

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
for the next book mine is missing that
so<00:01:39.150> Geodude<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.900> wasn't<00:01:40.170> too<00:01:40.320> difficult

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
so Geodude really wasn't too difficult

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.880 
so Geodude really wasn't too difficult

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
find in a rock tomb now the thing I'm

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
find in a rock tomb now the thing I'm
really<00:01:52.799> afraid<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.579> rocking<00:01:54.360> because

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
really afraid of is rocking because

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
really afraid of is rocking because
that's<00:01:54.720> super<00:01:54.960> effective<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:56.520> gonna

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that's super effective so what I'm gonna

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
that's super effective so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> use<00:01:57.420> growl<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.320> that

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
do is I'm going to use growl I know that

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.060 
do is I'm going to use growl I know that
might<00:01:58.770> seem<00:01:58.979> dumb<00:01:59.280> but

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
might seem dumb but

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.980 
might seem dumb but
it's<00:02:00.610> actually<00:02:00.940> going<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.180> be<00:02:01.360> useful<00:02:01.630> because

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
it's actually going to be useful because

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's actually going to be useful because
rock<00:02:02.860> tune<00:02:03.130> might<00:02:03.310> be<00:02:03.460> able<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.700> knock<00:02:03.880> him<00:02:04.060> out

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
rock tune might be able to knock him out

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.300 
rock tune might be able to knock him out
in<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.420> couple<00:02:04.600> hits<00:02:04.960> if<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:05.440> don't<00:02:05.710> do<00:02:05.890> that

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
in a couple hits if I don't do that

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.830 
in a couple hits if I don't do that
see<00:02:06.700> now<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.910> can<00:02:07.090> see<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.330> didn't<00:02:07.510> do<00:02:07.630> as<00:02:07.810> much

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
see now you can see it didn't do as much

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.770 
see now you can see it didn't do as much
as<00:02:08.200> would<00:02:08.350> normally<00:02:08.590> do<00:02:09.040> so<00:02:09.570> okay<00:02:10.570> he's<00:02:10.690> going

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
as would normally do so okay he's going

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.660 
as would normally do so okay he's going
to<00:02:10.899> use<00:02:10.990> fine<00:02:11.230> now<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.620> use<00:02:11.830> growl<00:02:12.130> again<00:02:12.460> just

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
to use fine now I use growl again just

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.510 
to use fine now I use growl again just
in<00:02:12.760> case<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.090> rock<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.660> him<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:14.130> also<00:02:15.130> as<00:02:15.400> you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
in case you rock to him but also as you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.400 
in case you rock to him but also as you
saw<00:02:15.760> rock<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.270> can<00:02:16.450> lower<00:02:16.660> your<00:02:16.810> speed<00:02:17.170> but

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
saw rock can can lower your speed but

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.050 
saw rock can can lower your speed but
you<00:02:17.500> can<00:02:17.710> get<00:02:17.920> pretty<00:02:18.040> annoying<00:02:18.340> if<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> uses

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
you can get pretty annoying if it uses

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.390 
you can get pretty annoying if it uses
it<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.240> lot<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.470> shouldn't<00:02:20.800> really<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:21.010> that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
it a lot but it shouldn't really be that

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.040 
it a lot but it shouldn't really be that
much<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.150> problem<00:02:22.330> because<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.720> already<00:02:22.840> got

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
much of a problem because we already got

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.900 
much of a problem because we already got
our<00:02:23.170> growls<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.740> so<00:02:23.950> now<00:02:24.130> I'm<00:02:24.310> thinking<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.760> can

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
our growls and so now I'm thinking I can

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.290 
our growls and so now I'm thinking I can
feel<00:02:25.150> off<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:26.520> none<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.550> us<00:02:27.700> move<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.060> really

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
feel off and none of us move to really

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.850 
feel off and none of us move to really
be<00:02:28.420> too<00:02:28.540> much<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.810> damage<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:29.410> after<00:02:29.680> -

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
be too much of damage because after -

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.330 
be too much of damage because after -
growls<00:02:30.160> his<00:02:30.520> attacks<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.300> ad<00:02:31.630> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
growls his attacks that is ad and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.440 
growls his attacks that is ad and
luckily<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.520> rock<00:02:33.670> Coon<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.000> going<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.209> miss

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
luckily the rock Coon is going to miss

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.800 
luckily the rock Coon is going to miss
which<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.380> do<00:02:35.590> quite<00:02:36.250> often<00:02:36.459> actually<00:02:36.820> so

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
which it can do quite often actually so

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.699 
which it can do quite often actually so
we're<00:02:37.930> just<00:02:37.959> going<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.200> go<00:02:38.320> in<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.560> start

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
we're just going to go in and start

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.699 
we're just going to go in and start
metal<00:02:39.010> flying<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:40.050> I'm<00:02:41.050> pretty<00:02:41.320> sure<00:02:41.410> that

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
metal flying and I'm pretty sure that

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.980 
metal flying and I'm pretty sure that
will<00:02:41.800> do<00:02:41.950> more<00:02:42.100> than<00:02:42.160> Ember<00:02:42.580> just<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.330> with

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
will do more than Ember just like with

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.020 
will do more than Ember just like with
Geodude<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:44.770> I'm<00:02:45.070> not<00:02:45.220> really<00:02:45.370> positive<00:02:45.610> but

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
Geodude but I'm not really positive but

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.520 
Geodude but I'm not really positive but
it<00:02:46.240> looks<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.630> did<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.780> decent<00:02:47.140> amount<00:02:47.200> so

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
it looks like it did a decent amount so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.360 
it looks like it did a decent amount so
I'll<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.740> keep<00:02:47.920> doing<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:50.220> alright<00:02:51.220> he's
