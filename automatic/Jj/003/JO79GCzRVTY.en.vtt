00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
you can see better and let's have a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.610 
you can see better and let's have a
look-see<00:00:49.309> here<00:00:49.730> dispenses<00:00:50.630> can<00:00:50.960> now<00:00:51.170> fire

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
look-see here dispenses can now fire

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.380 
look-see here dispenses can now fire
prime<00:00:52.430> tnt<00:00:53.030> out<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:54.020> them<00:00:54.730> into<00:00:55.730> like<00:00:56.090> whatever

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
prime tnt out of them into like whatever

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.970 
prime tnt out of them into like whatever
they<00:00:56.600> can<00:00:56.660> fly<00:00:56.899> prime<00:00:57.200> T<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.500> T<00:00:57.590> pretty<00:00:57.770> much

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
they can fly prime T and T pretty much

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.639 
they can fly prime T and T pretty much
so<00:00:58.610> I<00:00:58.640> had<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.030> little<00:00:59.239> thing<00:00:59.360> set<00:00:59.840> up<00:00:59.870> here<00:01:00.170> this

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
so I had a little thing set up here this

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.060 
so I had a little thing set up here this
is<00:01:00.710> basically<00:01:01.309> a<00:01:01.750> fully<00:01:02.750> automatic<00:01:03.350> TNT

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
is basically a fully automatic TNT

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.810 
is basically a fully automatic TNT
launcher<00:01:04.549> besides<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.630> clicking<00:01:05.990> bit<00:01:06.729> but<00:01:07.729> of

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
launcher besides the clicking bit but of

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.920 
launcher besides the clicking bit but of
course<00:01:08.000> you're<00:01:08.150> going<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.330> need<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.600> anyway

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
course you're going to need that anyway

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.230 
course you're going to need that anyway
pretty<00:01:09.140> much<00:01:09.549> actually<00:01:10.549> how<00:01:10.640> far<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.060> this

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
pretty much actually how far is this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.130 
pretty much actually how far is this
going<00:01:12.580> hmm<00:01:13.580> not<00:01:14.210> sure<00:01:14.240> if<00:01:14.510> it's<00:01:14.600> blowing<00:01:14.869> up

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
going hmm not sure if it's blowing up

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.719 
going hmm not sure if it's blowing up
here<00:01:15.380> somewhere<00:01:15.680> or<00:01:16.010> if<00:01:16.159> it's<00:01:16.280> blowing<00:01:16.549> off

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
here somewhere or if it's blowing off

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.510 
here somewhere or if it's blowing off
somewhere<00:01:17.030> else<00:01:17.060> really<00:01:17.330> far<00:01:17.570> away<00:01:17.680> anyway<00:01:18.680> so

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
somewhere else really far away anyway so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.609 
somewhere else really far away anyway so
I'm<00:01:19.970> going<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.420> put<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:20.900> up<00:01:21.080> for<00:01:21.229> download<00:01:21.409> I

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
I'm going to put this up for download I

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.320 
I'm going to put this up for download I
don't<00:01:21.890> think<00:01:22.159> this<00:01:22.369> really<00:01:22.670> needs<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.939> tutorial

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
don't think this really needs a tutorial

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.030 
don't think this really needs a tutorial
I'm<00:01:23.659> just<00:01:23.840> going<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.020> quickly<00:01:24.409> explain<00:01:24.650> it

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
I'm just going to quickly explain it

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.039 
I'm just going to quickly explain it
though<00:01:25.180> basically<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.510> eight

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
though basically you have eight

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.289 
though basically you have eight
dispenses<00:01:27.799> here<00:01:28.310> which<00:01:28.580> are<00:01:28.760> launching<00:01:29.150> the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
dispenses here which are launching the

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.530 
dispenses here which are launching the
Prime<00:01:29.600> tnt<00:01:30.110> which<00:01:30.850> onto<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:31.970> water<00:01:32.210> stream

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
Prime tnt which onto this water stream

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.910 
Prime tnt which onto this water stream
the<00:01:32.750> water<00:01:32.960> stream<00:01:33.229> is<00:01:33.380> stopping<00:01:33.740> them<00:01:33.890> from

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
the water stream is stopping them from

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.910 
the water stream is stopping them from
blowing<00:01:34.310> up<00:01:34.640> all<00:01:34.939> this<00:01:35.150> stuff<00:01:35.270> around<00:01:35.509> here

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
blowing up all this stuff around here

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.910 
blowing up all this stuff around here
but<00:01:36.920> these<00:01:37.369> dispensers<00:01:38.030> here<00:01:38.590> which<00:01:39.590> actually

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
but these dispensers here which actually

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.010 
but these dispensers here which actually
let<00:01:40.369> me<00:01:40.460> just<00:01:40.610> explain<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:40.970> first<00:01:41.210> firstly

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
let me just explain this first firstly

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.410 
let me just explain this first firstly
when<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.259> push<00:01:42.470> this<00:01:42.650> button<00:01:43.060> these<00:01:44.060> eight

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
when you push this button these eight

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.170 
when you push this button these eight
dispenses<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.619> launched<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.100> water<00:01:46.340> tnt

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
dispenses that launched the water tnt

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.319 
dispenses that launched the water tnt
bits<00:01:47.470> firstly<00:01:48.470> get<00:01:48.770> dispensed<00:01:49.250> instantly<00:01:49.729> all

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
bits firstly get dispensed instantly all

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.390 
bits firstly get dispensed instantly all
at<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.630> same<00:01:50.780> time<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.560> they<00:01:51.650> all<00:01:51.890> blow<00:01:52.130> up<00:01:52.159> at

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
at the same time so they all blow up at

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.620 
at the same time so they all blow up at
the<00:01:52.490> same<00:01:52.670> time<00:01:52.850> as<00:01:52.909> well<00:01:53.320> but<00:01:54.970> about<00:01:55.970> four

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the same time as well but about four

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.130 
the same time as well but about four
eight<00:01:57.140> twelve<00:01:57.530> twelve<00:01:58.369> ticks<00:01:58.990> after<00:01:59.990> that

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
eight twelve twelve ticks after that

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.830 
eight twelve twelve ticks after that
twelve<00:02:00.680> ticks<00:02:00.860> after<00:02:01.220> these<00:02:01.369> are<00:02:01.520> placed

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
twelve ticks after these are placed

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.289 
twelve ticks after these are placed
these<00:02:02.840> comparatives<00:02:03.710> start<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.280> turn<00:02:04.430> on<00:02:04.670> ok

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
these comparatives start to turn on ok

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.389 
these comparatives start to turn on ok
so<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.600> camp<00:02:05.810> comparators<00:02:06.500> turn<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.860> which

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
so the camp comparators turn on which

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.249 
so the camp comparators turn on which
are<00:02:07.579> hooked<00:02:07.759> up<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.149> these<00:02:08.299> dispensers<00:02:08.989> here

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
are hooked up to these dispensers here

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.459 
are hooked up to these dispensers here
and<00:02:09.409> here<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.029> this<00:02:11.029> is<00:02:11.359> a<00:02:11.389> wooden<00:02:11.989> button<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:12.469 
and here and this is a wooden button the

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.679 
and here and this is a wooden button the
wooden<00:02:12.739> button<00:02:13.040> will<00:02:13.519> let<00:02:13.760> these<00:02:13.939> comparators

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
wooden button will let these comparators

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.880 
wooden button will let these comparators
stay<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.109> for<00:02:15.349> long<00:02:15.379> enough

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
stay on for long enough

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.090 
stay on for long enough
so<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.100> these<00:02:16.280> will<00:02:16.550> fire<00:02:16.780> 70<00:02:17.780> each<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.069> a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
so that these will fire 70 each so a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.400 
so that these will fire 70 each so a
total<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.490> fourteen<00:02:20.030> TNT<00:02:20.569> will<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.870> fired<00:02:21.230> into

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
total of fourteen TNT will be fired into

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.660 
total of fourteen TNT will be fired into
this<00:02:21.620> half<00:02:22.010> slab<00:02:22.370> there<00:02:22.580> as<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:23.600> can<00:02:23.690> see<00:02:23.870> here

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.920 

well<00:02:28.670> it's<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.819> bit<00:02:28.970> hard<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.240> account<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.780> if

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
well it's a bit hard to account it if

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.890 
well it's a bit hard to account it if
they're<00:02:30.470> both<00:02:30.620> not<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.069> same<00:02:31.220> time<00:02:31.459> but

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
they're both not on the same time but

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.420 
they're both not on the same time but
anyway<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:32.959> health<00:02:33.430> comparatives<00:02:34.430> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
anyway so health comparatives and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.910 
anyway so health comparatives and
dispensers<00:02:35.270> work<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.840> if<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.709> have<00:02:36.740> a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
dispensers work is if you have a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.560 
dispensers work is if you have a
comparator<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.590> dispenser<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:41.090> wet<00:02:41.360> whoops

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
comparator and dispenser like wet whoops

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.020 
comparator and dispenser like wet whoops
mess<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.200> up<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.380> bit<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.790> have<00:02:43.970> a

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
mess it up a bit so you have a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.590 
mess it up a bit so you have a
comparator<00:02:44.510> dispenser<00:02:45.140> like<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.709> setup<00:02:46.010> and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
comparator dispenser like this setup and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.790 
comparator dispenser like this setup and
it<00:02:47.600> just<00:02:47.720> broke<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:47.930> sorry<00:02:48.410> I'm<00:02:48.500> using<00:02:48.680> a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
it just broke that sorry I'm using a

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.100 
it just broke that sorry I'm using a
touch<00:02:49.040> pad<00:02:49.450> computer<00:02:50.450> doesn't<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:50.780> enough

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
touch pad computer doesn't have enough

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.890 
touch pad computer doesn't have enough
USB<00:02:51.530> slots<00:02:51.800> at<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.010> moment<00:02:52.510> if<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.780> hear

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
USB slots at the moment if you can hear

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.220 
USB slots at the moment if you can hear
that<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:54.709> giving<00:02:55.700> off<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:56.239> seven

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
that it's actually giving off like seven

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.350 
that it's actually giving off like seven
tix<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.709> seven<00:02:58.220> clicks<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.610> mean<00:02:58.760> not<00:02:58.940> tix<00:03:01.000> c7<00:03:02.000> so

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
tix of seven clicks I mean not tix c7 so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.940 
tix of seven clicks I mean not tix c7 so
we<00:03:02.450> got<00:03:02.570> eight<00:03:02.750> now<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.470> after<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.860> we'll

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
we got eight now then after that we'll

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.970 
we got eight now then after that we'll
get<00:03:04.070> 15<00:03:04.489> 7<00:03:04.940> plus<00:03:05.120> 8<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.360> 15<00:03:05.840> there<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.680> go<00:03:06.769> see

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
get 15 7 plus 8 is 15 there you go see

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.800 
get 15 7 plus 8 is 15 there you go see
so<00:03:07.340> each<00:03:07.489> time<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.940> hit<00:03:08.090> with<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.570> wooden

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
so each time you hit with a wooden

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.509 
so each time you hit with a wooden
button<00:03:09.110> onto<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.380> comparator<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.010> will<00:03:10.190> go<00:03:10.310> off

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
button onto a comparator it will go off

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.770 
button onto a comparator it will go off
seven<00:03:11.000> times<00:03:12.160> there<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.370> see<00:03:13.600> there<00:03:14.600> is

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
seven times there we go see there is

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.199 
seven times there we go see there is
slight<00:03:15.519> inconsistency<00:03:16.519> but<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.850> doesn't

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
slight inconsistency but that doesn't

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.600 
slight inconsistency but that doesn't
really<00:03:17.330> matter<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.130> way

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
really matter just because of way

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.610 
really matter just because of way
buttons<00:03:20.030> work<00:03:20.269> its<00:03:20.510> site<00:03:20.810> cuts<00:03:21.110> sometimes<00:03:21.500> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
buttons work its site cuts sometimes a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.090 
buttons work its site cuts sometimes a
little<00:03:21.739> buggy<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:23.480> nevertheless<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.260> still

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
little buggy but nevertheless it still

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.000 
little buggy but nevertheless it still
works<00:03:25.489> also<00:03:26.090> these<00:03:26.360> are<00:03:26.750> feeding<00:03:27.110> into<00:03:27.500> these

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
works also these are feeding into these

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.640 
works also these are feeding into these
dispenses<00:03:28.700> when<00:03:29.450> they<00:03:29.570> fire<00:03:29.840> off<00:03:29.870> these<00:03:30.260> they

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
dispenses when they fire off these they

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.520 
dispenses when they fire off these they
just<00:03:30.829> get<00:03:30.980> refilled<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.959> do<00:03:33.350> these

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
just get refilled in to do these

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.259 
just get refilled in to do these
actually<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.430> hoppers<00:03:34.670> again<00:03:34.880> filled<00:03:35.090> at<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
actually the hoppers again filled at the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.860 
actually the hoppers again filled at the
moment<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.829> these<00:03:37.340> are<00:03:37.610> always<00:03:37.910> fully<00:03:38.570> packed

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
moment so these are always fully packed

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.890 
moment so these are always fully packed
and<00:03:39.370> these<00:03:40.370> were<00:03:40.700> just<00:03:40.850> extra<00:03:41.299> storage<00:03:41.600> if<00:03:41.810> you

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
and these were just extra storage if you

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.600 
and these were just extra storage if you
want<00:03:42.110> more<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.680> mainly<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.070> adventure

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
want more this is mainly for adventure

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.949 
want more this is mainly for adventure
maps<00:03:43.790> but<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.030> guess<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:44.269> could<00:03:44.420> use<00:03:44.660> this<00:03:44.780> in

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
maps but I guess you could use this in

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.990 
maps but I guess you could use this in
your<00:03:45.049> survival<00:03:45.560> world<00:03:45.680> if<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:45.890> have<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.670> good

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
your survival world if you have a good

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.940 
your survival world if you have a good
mob<00:03:47.180> farm<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.720> good<00:03:47.870> sand<00:03:48.140> farm<00:03:48.410> going<00:03:48.709> on

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
mob farm and a good sand farm going on

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.789 
mob farm and a good sand farm going on
to<00:03:49.190> get<00:03:49.400> lots<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.670> gunpowder<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.209> TNT<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.799> yeah

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
to get lots of gunpowder in TNT and yeah

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.410 
to get lots of gunpowder in TNT and yeah
so<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.430> be<00:03:52.459> used<00:03:52.760> for<00:03:52.850> maybe<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:53.239> a

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
so this can be used for maybe like a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.660 
so this can be used for maybe like a
pirate<00:03:54.350> ship<00:03:54.560> battle<00:03:55.010> or<00:03:55.130> something<00:03:55.519> where

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
pirate ship battle or something where

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.890 
pirate ship battle or something where
you<00:03:55.730> just<00:03:55.850> have<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.090> click<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.329> single<00:03:56.690> button

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
you just have to click a single button

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.560 
you just have to click a single button
and<00:03:57.170> then<00:03:57.860> your<00:03:58.430> TNT<00:03:58.790> would<00:03:58.940> go<00:03:59.090> off<00:03:59.209> into<00:03:59.390> the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
and then your TNT would go off into the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.690 
and then your TNT would go off into the
other<00:03:59.720> battleship<00:04:00.500> thing<00:04:00.739> or<00:04:00.890> whatever<00:04:01.040> you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
other battleship thing or whatever you

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.880 
other battleship thing or whatever you
know<00:04:02.170> actually<00:04:03.170> I'm<00:04:03.410> just<00:04:03.590> going<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.739> do<00:04:03.860> a

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.479 
know actually I'm just going to do a

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.640 
put the trap door here there we go so
that's<00:04:20.510> just<00:04:20.570> going<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.900> make<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.169> slightly

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
that's just going to make it slightly

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.190 
that's just going to make it slightly
lower<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.669> goes<00:04:22.880> so<00:04:23.600> it<00:04:23.690> flies<00:04:23.930> down

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
lower so this goes so it flies down

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.070 
lower so this goes so it flies down
slightly<00:04:25.130> lower<00:04:26.030> as<00:04:26.270> well<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:26.599> it's<00:04:26.690> not<00:04:26.870> as

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
slightly lower as well so it's not as

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.620 
slightly lower as well so it's not as
high<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> air

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
high in the air

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.510 
high in the air
and<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.580> also<00:04:30.820> destroyed<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.420> whole<00:04:31.540> thing

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
and so I also destroyed the whole thing

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.600 
and so I also destroyed the whole thing
so<00:04:33.520> yeah<00:04:33.940> hope<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.630> like<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.710> I'll<00:04:36.250> see
