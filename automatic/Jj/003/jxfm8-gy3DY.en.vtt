and I think that's that's that's
important<00:00:58.810> and<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.050> think<00:00:59.079> what<00:00:59.380> I'm

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
important and I think what I'm

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.110 
important and I think what I'm
particularly<00:00:59.920> proud<00:01:00.130> of<00:01:00.220> his<00:01:00.490> 18<00:01:00.820> years<00:01:01.030> later

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
particularly proud of his 18 years later

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.060 
particularly proud of his 18 years later
he's<00:01:01.900> still<00:01:02.020> winning<00:01:02.350> awards<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.800> he's<00:01:02.890> still

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
he's still winning awards and he's still

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.799 
he's still winning awards and he's still
relevant<00:01:03.340> but<00:01:03.670> in<00:01:03.790> my<00:01:03.910> row<00:01:04.059> it's<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.360> so

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
relevant but in my row it's so so

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.420 
relevant but in my row it's so so
important<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.350> have<00:01:05.470> key<00:01:05.710> individuals<00:01:06.100> I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
important to have key individuals I

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.820 
important to have key individuals I
could<00:01:06.670> rely<00:01:06.880> on<00:01:06.910> that<00:01:07.450> are<00:01:08.229> we<00:01:08.259> within<00:01:08.500> our

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
definite vision of the type of hotels we

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.920 
definite vision of the type of hotels we
want<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.610> create<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.570> we<00:01:13.660> need<00:01:13.810> an

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
want to create and we need an

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.600 
want to create and we need an
understanding<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.740> what<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.310> I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
understanding of what that is and I

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.090 
understanding of what that is and I
suppose<00:01:15.850> Gidley<00:01:16.119> is<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.420> ultimate

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
suppose Gidley is the ultimate

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.990 
suppose Gidley is the ultimate
experience<00:01:18.100> as<00:01:18.190> far<00:01:18.250> as<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.610> is<00:01:18.790> concerned

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
experience as far as that is concerned

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.810 
experience as far as that is concerned
within<00:01:19.630> our<00:01:19.780> portfolio<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.590> could<00:01:21.399> arguably

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
within our portfolio and could arguably

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.960 
within our portfolio and could arguably
be<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.360> benchmark<00:01:22.840> for<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.740> industry<00:01:24.220> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
be a benchmark for the industry of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.120 
be a benchmark for the industry of
particularly<00:01:25.570> this<00:01:25.690> sector<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.070> the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
particularly this sector that and the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.590 
particularly this sector that and the
manual<00:01:27.399> katzie's<00:01:27.759> all<00:01:27.910> I<00:01:27.940> suppose<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.479> good

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
manual katzie's all I suppose the good

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.680 
manual katzie's all I suppose the good
examples<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:30.100> Gili<00:01:30.610> part<00:01:30.880> certainly<00:01:31.180> is<00:01:31.450> is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
examples and Gili part certainly is is

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.380 
examples and Gili part certainly is is
over<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:33.040> know<00:01:33.190> time<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.880> what's<00:01:34.240> being

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
over the you know time is what's being

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.480 
over the you know time is what's being
seen<00:01:34.570> as<00:01:34.720> one<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:34.990> top<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.440> so<00:01:36.100> we<00:01:36.280> want

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
seen as one of the top and so we want

when I say same experience so it's going

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.680 
when I say same experience so it's going

England<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.299> think<00:02:19.750> all<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.140> them<00:02:20.290> have<00:02:20.380> played

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
England I think all of them have played

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.530 
England I think all of them have played
there<00:02:21.010> their<00:02:21.400> role<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.850> influence<00:02:22.269> on<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.510> I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
there their role in influence on me I

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.900 
there their role in influence on me I
think<00:02:22.750> Blanc<00:02:23.019> was<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.380> visionary<00:02:23.769> because<00:02:24.730> he

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
think Blanc was the visionary because he

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.610 
think Blanc was the visionary because he
was<00:02:25.030> self-taught<00:02:25.420> he<00:02:25.630> had<00:02:25.720> no<00:02:25.870> boundaries<00:02:26.230> I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
was self-taught he had no boundaries I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.340 
was self-taught he had no boundaries I
think<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.970> waz<00:02:28.180> oh<00:02:28.360> when<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.600> went<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.140> France

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
think with waz oh when I went to France

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.830 
think with waz oh when I went to France
I<00:02:29.620> realized<00:02:30.040> how<00:02:30.190> important<00:02:30.579> it<00:02:30.640> was<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.880> just

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I realized how important it was to just

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.160 
I realized how important it was to just
solve<00:02:32.019> things<00:02:32.200> locally<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.739> regionally

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
solve things locally and regionally

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.490 
solve things locally and regionally
the<00:02:34.530> also<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.310> simplicity<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the also the simplicity of the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.770 
the also the simplicity of the
ingredients<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.760> importance<00:02:39.660> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
ingredients and and the importance to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.600 
ingredients and and the importance to
bring<00:02:39.990> flavors<00:02:40.500> through<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.010> then<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.370> went

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
bring flavors through and then I went

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.060 
bring flavors through and then I went
off<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.020> Paris<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.170> work<00:02:43.200> Robuchon<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.950> was

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
off to Paris to work Robuchon that was

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.460 
off to Paris to work Robuchon that was
very<00:02:44.610> hard<00:02:44.760> work<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.660> guess<00:02:45.900> SAS<00:02:46.290> have

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
very hard work and I guess SAS have

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.230 
very hard work and I guess SAS have
kitchens<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.950> many<00:02:47.100> ways<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.060> about

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
kitchens in many ways but it's all about

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.360 
kitchens in many ways but it's all about
tech<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.780> all<00:02:48.900> about<00:02:49.170> discipline<00:02:49.710> self

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
tech it's all about discipline self

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.430 
tech it's all about discipline self
discipline<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:50.910> kitchen<00:02:51.780> discipline<00:02:52.200> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
discipline and kitchen discipline and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.760 
discipline and kitchen discipline and
it's<00:02:52.890> also<00:02:53.070> about<00:02:53.690> technic<00:02:54.690> technical<00:02:55.500> skills

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
it's also about technic technical skills

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.260 
it's also about technic technical skills
that<00:02:55.980> actually<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.580> all<00:02:56.670> about<00:02:56.880> great

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
that actually it's all about great

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.060 
that actually it's all about great
flavor<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:58.110> just<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.410> happens<00:02:58.740> that<00:02:58.830> in

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
flavor but just so happens that in

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.340 
flavor but just so happens that in
embracing<00:02:59.700> great<00:03:00.209> technique<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.959> actually

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
embracing great technique can actually

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.630 
embracing great technique can actually
achieve<00:03:01.440> great<00:03:01.800> flavor<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.280> I've<00:03:02.340> always

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
achieve great flavor and I've always

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.820 
achieve great flavor and I've always
said<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:03.090> turn<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:04.050> if<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.290> work<00:03:04.470> for<00:03:04.650> great

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
said in turn that if you work for great

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.320 
said in turn that if you work for great
chefs<00:03:05.160> there's<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.580> legacy<00:03:05.790> that's<00:03:06.120> always

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
chefs there's a legacy that's always

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.810 
chefs there's a legacy that's always
passed<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.380> there's<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.740> knowledge<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.700> you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
passed on there's a knowledge that you

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.790 
passed on there's a knowledge that you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
get within those great kitchens from

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800 
get within those great kitchens from
great<00:03:11.100> chefs<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.910> just<00:03:12.120> passed<00:03:12.330> down<00:03:12.600> with

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
great chefs that just passed down with

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.040 
great chefs that just passed down with
generation<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.500> generation

generation to generation

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.050 
generation to generation
the<00:03:15.740> garden<00:03:16.040> concepts<00:03:16.370> very<00:03:16.550> important<00:03:16.940> but

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
the garden concepts very important but

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.400 
the garden concepts very important but
we<00:03:17.210> don't<00:03:17.390> have<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> big<00:03:17.720> garden<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.290> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
we don't have a big garden so the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.870 
we don't have a big garden so the
reality<00:03:18.590> there<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.460> use<00:03:19.610> everything

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
reality there is that we use everything

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.630 
reality there is that we use everything
that<00:03:20.030> we<00:03:20.210> produce<00:03:20.330> most<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.290> sense<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.680> giving

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
that we produce most a sense of giving

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.840 
that we produce most a sense of giving
us<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.910> sense<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.240> timing<00:03:24.580> telling<00:03:25.580> us<00:03:25.670> what's

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
us a sense of timing telling us what's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.540 
us a sense of timing telling us what's
in<00:03:26.000> season<00:03:26.210> we<00:03:26.990> do<00:03:27.320> use<00:03:27.530> all<00:03:27.800> of<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.010> herbs<00:03:28.190> and

Bonnie for a long time

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.060 
Bonnie for a long time
I<00:03:46.340> first<00:03:46.790> met<00:03:47.570> with<00:03:47.720> Bonnie<00:03:47.930> as<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.320> kitchen

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
I first met with Bonnie as a kitchen

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.370 
I first met with Bonnie as a kitchen
appliance<00:03:49.190> with<00:03:50.120> at<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.570> cat<00:03:50.750> stays<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.170> and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
appliance with at the cat stays on and

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.700 
appliance with at the cat stays on and
then<00:03:51.590> out<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:51.980> France<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:53.480> was<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.200> choice

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
then out to France and it was the choice

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.290 
then out to France and it was the choice
of<00:03:55.010> snow<00:03:55.460> for<00:03:56.230> Robuchon<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.610> at<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.790> time<00:03:59.030> it

of snow for Robuchon it at that time it

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.630 
of snow for Robuchon it at that time it
was<00:03:59.450> limited<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.050> creative<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.430> think
