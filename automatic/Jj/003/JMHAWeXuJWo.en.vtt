end<00:02:56.480> up<00:02:56.600> upgrading<00:02:57.140> mine<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> little<00:02:57.500> bit<00:02:57.710> not

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
end up upgrading mine a little bit not

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.680 
end up upgrading mine a little bit not
too<00:02:58.040> much<00:02:58.250> that's<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> point<00:02:59.240> going<00:02:59.450> all<00:02:59.630> the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
too much that's the point going all the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.350 
too much that's the point going all the
way<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.810> two<00:03:00.080> gigabytes<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:01.520> hey<00:03:01.640> anyway<00:03:02.090> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
way to two gigabytes but hey anyway and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.750 
way to two gigabytes but hey anyway and
so<00:03:03.820> yeah<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.180> full<00:03:05.570> gigabyte<00:03:05.690> is<00:03:06.050> upgradable

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
so yeah the full gigabyte is upgradable

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.800 
so yeah the full gigabyte is upgradable
obviously<00:03:07.760> it's<00:03:07.910> got<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> bigger<00:03:08.390> hard<00:03:08.690> drive

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
obviously it's got the bigger hard drive

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.060 
obviously it's got the bigger hard drive
and<00:03:09.400> it's<00:03:10.400> got<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.640> webcam<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.680> which<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.890> two

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
and it's got a webcam and which the two

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.400 
and it's got a webcam and which the two
gigabyte<00:03:13.430> doesn't<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.300> that's<00:03:15.140> something<00:03:15.320> to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
gigabyte doesn't so that's something to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.290 
gigabyte doesn't so that's something to
be<00:03:15.590> aware<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.550> battery<00:03:16.880> last<00:03:17.090> longer

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
be aware of the battery last longer

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.920 
be aware of the battery last longer
because<00:03:17.630> it's<00:03:17.990> got<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.320> actual<00:03:18.980> bigger<00:03:19.930> for

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
because it's got a actual bigger for

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.320 
because it's got a actual bigger for
sale<00:03:21.260> battery<00:03:21.770> then<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.580> two<00:03:22.730> gigabyte<00:03:23.120> has

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
sale battery then the two gigabyte has

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.490 
sale battery then the two gigabyte has
and<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:25.010> also<00:03:26.590> apparently<00:03:27.590> it's<00:03:28.030> got<00:03:29.030> a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
and it's also apparently it's got a

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.690 
and it's also apparently it's got a
faster<00:03:30.500> clock<00:03:30.709> speed<00:03:31.070> or<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.310> higher<00:03:31.490> clock

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
faster clock speed or a higher clock

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.350 
faster clock speed or a higher clock
speed<00:03:32.410> it's<00:03:33.490> apparently<00:03:34.490> has<00:03:34.610> got<00:03:34.790> 900

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
speed it's apparently has got 900

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.110 
speed it's apparently has got 900
megahertz<00:03:35.630> which<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:37.100> running<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.490> 630

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
megahertz which is running it 630

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.350 
megahertz which is running it 630
megahertz<00:03:39.050> now<00:03:39.860> I'm<00:03:40.220> Troy<00:03:40.850> my<00:03:41.030> announced<00:03:41.240> to

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
megahertz now I'm Troy my announced to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.520 
megahertz now I'm Troy my announced to
see<00:03:41.510> what<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.720> actual<00:03:41.959> what<00:03:42.380> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
see what the actual what the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.890 
see what the actual what the
responsiveness<00:03:43.160> feels<00:03:43.520> like<00:03:43.730> but<00:03:43.970> like<00:03:44.780> i

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
responsiveness feels like but like i

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.010 
responsiveness feels like but like i
said<00:03:44.930> i'll<00:03:45.140> be<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.380> later<00:03:45.650> video<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
said i'll be in a later video and so the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.199 
said i'll be in a later video and so the
yeah<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.800> four<00:03:48.980> gigabyte<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.580> running<00:03:49.880> at<00:03:50.000> six

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
yeah the four gigabyte is running at six

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.490 
yeah the four gigabyte is running at six
thirty<00:03:50.360> but<00:03:50.990> it's<00:03:51.140> got<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> 900<00:03:51.860> processor<00:03:52.580> and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
thirty but it's got a 900 processor and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.670 
thirty but it's got a 900 processor and
the<00:03:54.500> two<00:03:54.830> gigabyte<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.750> 571<00:03:56.750> megahertz<00:03:57.470> and

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
the two gigabyte is 571 megahertz and

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.770 
the two gigabyte is 571 megahertz and
it's<00:03:57.860> erm<00:03:58.100> it's<00:03:58.790> in<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:58.970> 800<00:03:59.570> megahertz

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it's erm it's in that 800 megahertz

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.660 
it's erm it's in that 800 megahertz
process<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> four<00:04:00.830> gigabyte<00:04:01.220> is<00:04:01.340> slightly

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
process so the four gigabyte is slightly

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.760 
process so the four gigabyte is slightly
faster<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:02.959> can<00:04:03.320> see<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.530> there<00:04:03.740> are

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
faster so you can see that there are

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.610 
faster so you can see that there are
subtle<00:04:04.220> differences<00:04:04.690> but<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:06.200> will<00:04:06.350> kind<00:04:06.500> of

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
subtle differences but it will kind of

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.070 
subtle differences but it will kind of
make<00:04:06.740> all<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.100> difference<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.989> for<00:04:08.989> that

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
make all the difference and for that

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.500 
make all the difference and for that
extra<00:04:09.410> 50<00:04:09.890> pounds<00:04:10.459> or<00:04:10.670> way<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.030> your<00:04:11.209> currency

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
extra 50 pounds or way of your currency

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.840 
extra 50 pounds or way of your currency

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
is if you're choosing between two

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.790 
is if you're choosing between two
gigabyte<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.540> four<00:04:14.720> gigabyte<00:04:15.140> there<00:04:15.620> are

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
gigabyte and four gigabyte there are

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.410 
gigabyte and four gigabyte there are
significant<00:04:16.609> differences

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
significant differences

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.770
