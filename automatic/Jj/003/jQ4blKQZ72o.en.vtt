00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.920
 talk in handsome beauty the bicheiro 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.430
 three years for you another video of this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.980
 time is not a game of the gameplay is a video 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.010
 So it's going really fast. 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.700
 only to teach you a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.170
 possible solution for this error here O 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.450
 that is to read when it puts the user 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.670
 and yes it appears the game server looks like 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.660
 being out of breath try again 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.170
 evening 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.880
 It's happened to me twice, it's a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.300
 a very annoying error and that he had 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.730
 allows play right then return 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 taught you all here what could 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.700
 you can do to solve this 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.899
 problem 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 only that business is not 100% 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.840
 guaranteed that you will be able to solve 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.680
 the problem 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.660
 it may fail because it is some 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.239
 another error then ends up not being resolved 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.850
 but out of every ten people who made 18 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.579
 even I have a problem 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.709
 solved so I hope it helps you 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:16.520
 You'll start and you can get the 

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.520
 run 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.909
 Maybe Luisa will dictate the enter 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:35.689
 command and config gives a space 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.880
 ms flash bar 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:42.979
 I'll even write here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.979
 it will get easier a little bit 160 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:58.859
 is the following to ip with an end in it did this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.829
 command there, right? 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:05.399
 if it will or will he do it 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.469
 here it will do the dns cache release 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.180
 then after doing all this procedure 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.319
 It's fast easy, it's not too late. 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.030
 seconds 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.650
 You can try to play in the game. 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.349
 again, if it does not work 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.260
 do the following in the pc on the before do 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.569
 the same thing there restart the pc with the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.799
 advertised price does this again 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.780
 process and try to play it does not work 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.920
 That's when I told you, or it's a 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.420
 error or may be a problem is in the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.170
 same specific internet was 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.000
 happening last to leave with gvt 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.430
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.549
 then there is no longer much that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.650
 waiting for a solution is already 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.799
