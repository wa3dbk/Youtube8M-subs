is ten point five millimeters tall or
something<00:04:49.270> bad<00:04:49.450> that's<00:04:49.630> why<00:04:49.780> it's<00:04:49.930> called<00:04:50.020> 105

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
something bad that's why it's called 105

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.460 
something bad that's why it's called 105

the final piece of the four piece

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.370 
the final piece of the four piece
beyblade<00:04:55.630> which<00:04:56.170> is<00:04:56.320> flat<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:58.900> alright

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
beyblade which is flat so so alright

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.010 
beyblade which is flat so so alright
attack<00:04:59.830> piece<00:05:00.100> like<00:05:00.910> one<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.330> basics<00:05:01.750> but

classify like rubber flat r2f lrf stuff
like<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:09.010> yeah<00:05:09.550> ok<00:05:10.180> now<00:05:10.450> try<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.750> assemble

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
like that so yeah ok now try to assemble

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.820 
like that so yeah ok now try to assemble
this<00:05:11.260> beyblade

this beyblade

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.909 
this beyblade
so<00:05:12.550> using<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.810> tools<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.169> came<00:05:14.500> in<00:05:14.620> clione

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
so using the tools that came in clione

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.740 
so using the tools that came in clione
so<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.340> should<00:05:15.490> click<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.640> video<00:05:15.910> here<00:05:16.060> but

okay there you have it here that was

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.440 
okay there you have it here that was
Aquarius<00:06:17.900> spin<00:06:18.620> demo<00:06:19.270> so<00:06:20.800> yeah<00:06:21.800> also<00:06:22.520> my

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
Aquarius spin demo so yeah also my

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.600 
Aquarius spin demo so yeah also my
personal<00:06:23.900> review<00:06:24.410> well<00:06:25.160> not<00:06:25.430> necessarily

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
personal review well not necessarily

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.820 
personal review well not necessarily
personal<00:06:26.420> but<00:06:26.630> if<00:06:27.260> you<00:06:27.410> want<00:06:27.560> to<00:06:27.650> buy<00:06:27.770> this

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
personal but if you want to buy this

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.130 
personal but if you want to buy this
beyblade<00:06:28.340> and<00:06:28.640> and<00:06:29.510> you<00:06:29.720> want<00:06:29.900> to<00:06:29.990> buy<00:06:30.080> for

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
beyblade and and you want to buy for

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.650 
beyblade and and you want to buy for
competitive<00:06:30.890> use<00:06:31.160> since<00:06:32.060> it<00:06:32.180> doesn't<00:06:32.510> have

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
competitive use since it doesn't have

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.280 
competitive use since it doesn't have
many<00:06:33.110> useful<00:06:33.920> parts<00:06:34.460> and<00:06:34.640> pieces<00:06:34.820> like<00:06:35.030> that

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
many useful parts and pieces like that

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.740 
many useful parts and pieces like that
so<00:06:36.290> this<00:06:37.130> really<00:06:37.730> shouldn't<00:06:38.060> be<00:06:38.240> necessary

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
so this really shouldn't be necessary

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.020 
so this really shouldn't be necessary
