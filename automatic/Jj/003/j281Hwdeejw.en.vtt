00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.289
 let's say the showgirls yesterday and we were born in the son 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.399
 let's go over the lake in all the beads 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.019
 this way 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.499
 my part 2 son hair 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.069
 that beautiful note 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.069
 in this way 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.039
 at this point I don't 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:36.000
 I also prefer a thousand heads of children leaving work 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.060
 and then I get the modem one of these second level 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.380
 up assemble to be a beautiful single child flower 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:49.859
 colnago then we enter one of two pairs of beads and indifferent if they are 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.089
 the golden ones or the best ones 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.199
 in this case I am the empire in war of the two worlds I add a couple 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.799
 of belinelli on the lake of the book 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.019
 in golden bellini 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.859
 in this way 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.839
 son 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.659
 and then back again even in black beads 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.349
 in this way 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.209
 this operation is true by inserting another pair of pears and gilded on the lake 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.939
 basically in the end we have to find the true copies of bellini - 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.569
 other couples of gavirate we must believe ourselves work we accept 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.949
 with the squat angels and finally a pair of beads I now join work a 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:38.800
 circle queen 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.169
 the hard to find lake 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.029
 first sedan 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.029
 and in the second one also inserted 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.870
 and then I go back to a lake even in colored tissue 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.240
 those of the pug - modena ask 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.759
 the circle 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 I still return to the mines 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.069
 and now they are starting to add new jobs 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.219
 to get that particular design it will be enough to remember 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:14.800
 to insert 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.410
 of cockles that the same color green glaze turns after which we should 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.339
 let's explain the cyan color 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.279
 here now there are two black beads 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.759
 so I assume around index to insert as first spring showcase 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.559
 Milan of grandmother pina duration and then a black bowl on the lake 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.210
 return to both gildings 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.419
 begging the thread 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.029
 then paste it back in
