00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
off the boards and things may be keeping

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.490 
off the boards and things may be keeping
the<00:02:03.390> ball<00:02:03.539> in<00:02:03.600> play<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.899> little<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:04.320> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
way you get a sense to me it feels a lot

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.650 
way you get a sense to me it feels a lot
lighter<00:02:09.179> than<00:02:09.330> other<00:02:09.600> ball<00:02:11.600> hopefully<00:02:12.600> they

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
lighter than other ball hopefully they

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.910 
lighter than other ball hopefully they
don't<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:12.989> same<00:02:13.049> problems<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.799> know

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.850 
don't have the same problems you know
guys<00:02:14.430> tend<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.360> sweat<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> lot<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.140> hopefully

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
guys tend to sweat a lot so hopefully

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.380 
guys tend to sweat a lot so hopefully
the<00:02:16.980> ball<00:02:17.130> don't<00:02:17.280> get<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.580> slippery<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the ball don't get it slippery as the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.060 
the ball don't get it slippery as the
other<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.900> maybe<00:02:19.410> that's<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.739> benefit

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
other one and maybe that's the benefit

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.180 
other one and maybe that's the benefit
of<00:02:20.130> changing<00:02:20.730> basketball
