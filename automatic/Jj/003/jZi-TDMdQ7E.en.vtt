00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.180 
so right now I don't know what length
you<00:02:08.300> would<00:02:08.479> consider<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:09.530> it's

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
you would consider this but it's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.620

to<00:02:15.050> get<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.530> bra<00:02:16.040> strap<00:02:16.370> length<00:02:17.020> by<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.080> end<00:02:18.470> of

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
to get to bra strap length by the end of
