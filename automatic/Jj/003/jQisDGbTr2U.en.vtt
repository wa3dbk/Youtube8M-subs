00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.200 

yeah<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.400> looks<00:01:24.550> largely<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.090> same

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.210 

yeah<00:01:42.270> there's<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.650> area<00:01:43.979> here

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
yeah there's not actually this area here

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.499 
yeah there's not actually this area here
is<00:01:44.250> completely<00:01:44.759> different<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> looks<00:01:45.360> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
is completely different it looks like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.700 
is completely different it looks like
they've<00:01:45.689> added<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.080> whole<00:01:46.290> bunch<00:01:46.530> more

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
they've added a whole bunch more

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.340 
they've added a whole bunch more
buildings<00:01:47.100> into<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.549> area<00:01:48.080> because<00:01:49.080> this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
buildings into this area because this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.280 
buildings into this area because this
used<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:51.090> building<00:01:51.689> didn't<00:01:51.930> exist

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
used to be this building didn't exist

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:05.260 
used to be this building didn't exist
here<00:01:52.470> before

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.020 

yeah<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.109> completely<00:02:06.710> different<00:02:07.030> they

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
yeah this is completely different they

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
yeah this is completely different they
added<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.629> whole<00:02:11.080> area<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.110> fight<00:02:12.349> in

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
added this whole area to fight in

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.809 
added this whole area to fight in
through<00:02:12.709> there<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.040> that'll<00:02:13.280> be<00:02:13.370> better<00:02:13.489> I

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
through there so that'll be better I

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.160 
through there so that'll be better I
think<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.420> it'll<00:02:14.569> be<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> little<00:02:14.930> bit<00:02:15.050> more

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
think that it'll be a little bit more

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.979 
think that it'll be a little bit more
balance<00:02:15.349> now<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:17.150> think<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:17.450> also<00:02:17.629> added

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
balance now and I think they also added

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.170 
balance now and I think they also added
that<00:02:18.140> house<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:19.040> under<00:02:19.340> construction<00:02:19.940> house

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that house this under construction house

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.000 
that house this under construction house
I<00:02:20.540> don't<00:02:21.050> think<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.319> used<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.680> be<00:02:21.799> there

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
I don't think that used to be there

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.520 
I don't think that used to be there
either<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:23.690> looks<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:23.930> they<00:02:24.140> gave<00:02:24.290> us<00:02:24.440> a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
either and it looks like they gave us a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.900 
either and it looks like they gave us a
hill<00:02:24.739> for<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.129> side<00:02:25.720> that's<00:02:26.720> pretty<00:02:27.019> cool

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
hill for this side that's pretty cool

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.190 
hill for this side that's pretty cool
because<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.120> Hill<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.629> team<00:02:29.840> didn't<00:02:30.049> have

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
because this Hill this team didn't have

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.380 
because this Hill this team didn't have
any<00:02:30.470> sort<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:30.950> now<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.580> actually<00:02:31.849> has<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> hill

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
any sort of now that actually has a hill

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.860 
any sort of now that actually has a hill
that<00:02:32.420> they<00:02:32.660> can<00:02:32.810> snipe<00:02:33.080> from<00:02:33.230> as<00:02:33.410> well<00:02:34.870> which

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that they can snipe from as well which

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.229 
that they can snipe from as well which
is<00:02:36.019> pretty<00:02:36.200> cool<00:02:38.349> back<00:02:39.349> over<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:39.739> oak<00:02:39.890> tree

hill<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.480> they'll<00:02:59.599> be<00:02:59.690> less<00:02:59.900> camping<00:03:00.940> which<00:03:01.940> is

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
hill so they'll be less camping which is

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.180 
hill so they'll be less camping which is
interesting<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:05.140> back<00:03:06.140> there<00:03:06.470> doesn't<00:03:06.950> look

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
interesting and back there doesn't look

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
interesting and back there doesn't look
too<00:03:07.610> different

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:20.380 

I<00:03:12.330> do<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.200> new<00:03:13.320> font<00:03:13.590> for<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.710 

for<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> chat<00:03:21.720> window<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:24.180> guy's<00:03:24.390> nice

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
for the chat window this guy's nice

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.940 
for the chat window this guy's nice
because<00:03:25.020> he's<00:03:25.140> not<00:03:25.260> actually<00:03:25.530> trying<00:03:25.830> to

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
because he's not actually trying to

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.970 
because he's not actually trying to
shoot<00:03:26.190> me<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.430> kill<00:03:26.610> me<00:03:27.560> sometimes<00:03:28.560> when<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
shoot me and kill me sometimes when you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.220 
shoot me and kill me sometimes when you
go<00:03:29.070> into<00:03:29.160> these<00:03:29.310> these<00:03:29.790> rooms<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:31.080> never

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
go into these these rooms like you never

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.350 
go into these these rooms like you never
know<00:03:31.440> what's<00:03:31.680> going<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.860> happen<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:35.000> think<00:03:36.000> this

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
know what's going to happen I think this

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.810 
know what's going to happen I think this
hard<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.230> map<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.620> largely<00:03:38.010> still<00:03:38.430> very

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
hard the map is largely still very

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.550 
hard the map is largely still very
similar<00:03:39.300> doesn't<00:03:39.930> look<00:03:40.020> like<00:03:40.200> there's<00:03:40.380> too

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
similar doesn't look like there's too

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.000 
similar doesn't look like there's too
many<00:03:40.680> changes<00:03:41.160> here<00:03:42.320> I'm<00:03:43.320> interested<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:43.830> see

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
many changes here I'm interested to see

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.860 
many changes here I'm interested to see
if<00:03:44.040> they've<00:03:44.220> done<00:03:44.400> anything<00:03:44.610> down<00:03:44.940> near<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
if they've done anything down near the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.180 
if they've done anything down near the
bridge<00:03:48.110> I'm<00:03:49.110> not<00:03:49.320> seeing<00:03:49.770> a<00:03:49.860> heck<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.160> lot

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
bridge I'm not seeing a heck of a lot

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.930 
bridge I'm not seeing a heck of a lot
different<00:03:50.340> through<00:03:50.820> here<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:53.550> can<00:03:53.670> see<00:03:53.820> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
different through here you can see the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.710 
different through here you can see the
AMX<00:03:54.240> 30<00:03:54.900> B<00:03:55.020> is<00:03:55.260> doing<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.680> 65<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.550> able<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.510> hit

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
AMX 30 B is doing a 65 it's able to hit

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.240 
AMX 30 B is doing a 65 it's able to hit
what<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:57.960> registered<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.560> which<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.280> nice

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.830 

yeah<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:02.970> doesn't<00:04:03.120> look<00:04:03.270> like<00:04:03.330> there's<00:04:03.660> too

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
yeah it doesn't look like there's too

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.080 
yeah it doesn't look like there's too
much<00:04:03.990> different<00:04:04.410> down<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:08.850> still

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
much different down in here you still

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.550 
much different down in here you still
got<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.330> same<00:04:09.480> bushes<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:11.190> use<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:13.410> it

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
got the same bushes to to use but it

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.140 
got the same bushes to to use but it
looks<00:04:13.770> like<00:04:13.860> they<00:04:14.100> actually<00:04:14.490> raised<00:04:14.880> this

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
looks like they actually raised this

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.500 
looks like they actually raised this
area<00:04:15.540> up<00:04:16.640> now<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.820> looks<00:04:17.940> like<00:04:18.180> there's<00:04:18.390> going

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
area up now it looks like there's going

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.050 
area up now it looks like there's going
to<00:04:18.600> be<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.780> dual<00:04:19.200> ridgeline<00:04:19.769> here<00:04:20.400> because<00:04:20.910> this

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
to be a dual ridgeline here because this

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.570 
to be a dual ridgeline here because this
used<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.329> be<00:04:21.480> completely<00:04:21.870> flat<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:22.580> they've

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
used to be completely flat and they've

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.730 
used to be completely flat and they've
added<00:04:23.910> another<00:04:24.210> bush<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.320> can<00:04:25.500> use<00:04:25.710> to

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
added another bush that you can use to

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.250 
added another bush that you can use to
spot<00:04:26.220> from<00:04:26.370> from<00:04:26.580> here<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.600> think<00:04:27.720> this<00:04:28.020> area

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
spot from from here so I think this area

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.510 
spot from from here so I think this area
is<00:04:28.380> going<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.590> be<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> lot<00:04:28.950> more<00:04:28.980> progressive

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
is going to be a lot more progressive

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.460 
is going to be a lot more progressive
than<00:04:29.670> it<00:04:29.880> used<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.120> be<00:04:30.270> because<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.230> can<00:04:31.380> go

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
than it used to be because you can go

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.500 
than it used to be because you can go
here<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.160> could<00:04:32.310> shoot<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.550> shoot<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:33.150> then

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
here you could shoot you shoot and then

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.300 
here you could shoot you shoot and then
it<00:04:34.110> looks<00:04:34.290> like<00:04:34.440> you've<00:04:34.680> got<00:04:34.710> another<00:04:35.070> ridge

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
it looks like you've got another ridge

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.760 
it looks like you've got another ridge
line<00:04:35.550> here<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.180> move<00:04:36.330> up<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.930> if

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
line here that you can move up to and if

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.760 
line here that you can move up to and if
you've<00:04:38.040> got<00:04:38.220> decent<00:04:38.490> gun<00:04:38.760> depression<00:04:39.770> looks

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
you've got decent gun depression looks

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.900 
you've got decent gun depression looks
like<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:41.040> should<00:04:41.280> be<00:04:41.400> able<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.610> use<00:04:41.760> this

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
like you should be able to use this

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.680 
like you should be able to use this
position<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:43.470> pop<00:04:43.890> up<00:04:43.970> take<00:04:44.970> some<00:04:45.120> shots<00:04:45.330> and

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
position to pop up take some shots and

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.220 
position to pop up take some shots and
then<00:04:45.750> pop<00:04:45.810> back<00:04:46.020> down<00:04:47.480> so<00:04:48.480> altogether<00:04:48.660> this<00:04:49.110> is

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
then pop back down so altogether this is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.670 
then pop back down so altogether this is
not<00:04:49.380> too<00:04:49.560> bad<00:04:49.710> over<00:04:49.950> here

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.860 

yeah<00:05:00.280> it's<00:05:00.430> definitely<00:05:00.610> improvement<00:05:01.240> live

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
yeah it's definitely improvement live

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.540 
yeah it's definitely improvement live
oaks<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.259> actually<00:05:02.590> it<00:05:02.830> feels<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.280> lot<00:05:03.400> more

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
oaks is actually it feels a lot more

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.870 
oaks is actually it feels a lot more
balanced<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.300> not<00:05:05.229> totally<00:05:05.880> imbalanced

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
balanced and not totally imbalanced

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:20.940 
balanced and not totally imbalanced
towards<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.330> other<00:05:07.479> team

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.180 

I<00:05:21.960> don't<00:05:22.960> think<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:23.500> area<00:05:23.740> is<00:05:23.830> any<00:05:24.070> different

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
I don't think this area is any different

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.850 
I don't think this area is any different
though<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:26.080> area<00:05:26.410> wasn't<00:05:26.590> really

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
though this area wasn't really

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.470 
though this area wasn't really
problematic<00:05:27.280> before<00:05:27.760> it<00:05:27.970> was<00:05:28.060> more<00:05:28.330> or<00:05:28.420> less

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
problematic before it was more or less

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.290 
problematic before it was more or less
just<00:05:29.040> this<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.980> was<00:05:33.130> this<00:05:33.310> hill<00:05:33.520> area<00:05:33.910> here

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
just this it was this hill area here

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.630 
just this it was this hill area here
that<00:05:35.080> was<00:05:35.230> problematic<00:05:35.710> because<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.460> area

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
that was problematic because this area

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.830 
that was problematic because this area
didn't<00:05:36.970> have<00:05:37.060> a<00:05:37.120> hill<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.480> then<00:05:37.570> they<00:05:37.660> added

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
didn't have a hill and then they added

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.840 
didn't have a hill and then they added

in all these buildings to kind of choked
out<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.210> middle<00:05:40.450> where<00:05:40.600> these<00:05:41.020> guys<00:05:41.260> could

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
out the middle where these guys could

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.170 
out the middle where these guys could
all<00:05:41.500> fire<00:05:41.920> in<00:05:42.130> through<00:05:42.430> on<00:05:42.580> this<00:05:42.730> team<00:05:43.000> and

all fire in through on this team and
then<00:05:43.300> they<00:05:43.390> we<00:05:43.480> got<00:05:43.630> all<00:05:43.750> bottled<00:05:44.170> up<00:05:44.290> in<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:45.040> 4

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370
