00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 the forehead was clean there were no injuries 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.519
 the hands were also clean but 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.340
 there were some small crosses that were not 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.380
 would describe as wounds two crosses in 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 the back of the left hand in the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.550
 upper part of the feet could still 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.970
 see the marks but when I touched them 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.039
 they were soft at that moment I do not think that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.230
 any surgeon can cure these 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.400
 wounds so smoothly in less than 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.400
 24 hours 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.860
 this back of málaga has signed lugo de 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.149
 24 hours this is what this hand is left 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.149
 two crosses in the palms 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.149
 Boys 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.200
 in the branches 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.330
 once 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.150
 from the question you say when 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.070
 see something like this more replica but 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.930
 medically this is impossible if I think 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.629
 what we saw yesterday is equally 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.390
 difficult for similar wounds to heal that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.550
 rhythm I also know 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.580
 he asks me insists the rum observes the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.800
 feet identify the place from which 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.520
 take you have taken samples of 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.770
 blood the previous day 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.899
 and if you approach them you will see that 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.049
 healing was also verified 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.810
 a rather unusual way is as if 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.720
 was healing from the inside 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.670
 synthesizing is asked what happened 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.259
 and what is it that mike would tell us 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.020
 Answer God was present 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:40.510
 surprising a miracle and that the replica 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.080
 you doubted what would happen never 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.510
 is July 28 , 1999 and they are made 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.820
 preparations for live broadcast 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.090
 of mike's program along the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.920
 USA on the Fox Television Network in 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.960
 direct communication via satellite with 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.960
 Katia here in Bolivia 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.500
 well we have three trucks with system 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.030
 satellite that will send our signal 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.830
 from inside this house 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.539
 through our cameras and it 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 they will communicate to the satellite that is in 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.980
 orbit over the Pacific to direct the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.660
 signal to Canada and the North American and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.080
 same time will continue en route to the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.080
 angels 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.339
 [Applause] 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.659
 the program was broadcast to the whole world 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.519
 realizing that this statue was 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.270
 shaping their pain by spreading 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.410
 of his own blood 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.680
 we can hire in the experiences 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.930
 painful of catia the ordeal of 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.820
 Crucifixion of Christ and finally 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.070
 check as heaven and earth a 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.590
 through the hand of cartier prints in 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.130
 the paper the call of God to the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.130
 humanity 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.390
 although we were able to verify is 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.730
 probably the most religious event 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.830
 important of our times and everything 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.260
 this has been transmitted via satellite to 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.299
 whole world inviting us to reflect 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.879
 about the works that God performs in the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.549
 man are these the most valuable goods 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.220
 that the gold to which Juan Bosco 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.920
 I was referring to affirming that I enter these 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.170
 mountains would leave the riches that 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.970
 they would arrive to the whole world is here 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.220

 Latin American brothers where the

 bishop rené fernández who with humility 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.920
 and be clean has recognized the roads 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.049

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.819
 understanding the guidelines of 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.560
 credit awaits today's man in a 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.810
 called to renew the commitment 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.209
 Christian 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.239
 this new spiritual awakening that 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.840
 springs from the heart of Bolivia from the heart 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.459
 of South America and it extends to the world 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.500
 comes from a bishop and a nation 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.090
 deeply moved by a 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.790
 sequence of extraordinary events 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.389
 it's a spiritual rebirth based 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.729
 certainly in the faith but strengthened 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.070
 by amazing signs that brings us 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.500
 significant presence of a christ 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.380
 I live and manifest to the world with 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.010
 tears of blood through pains 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.010
 from catalina 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.479
 Mr. Fernandez following the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.030
 Pope John Paul II's invitation 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.590
 to promote the new evangelization 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.020
 approved the creation of the apostolate of 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.759
 new evangelization recognizing here 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.030
 up and to your spiritual director 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.820
 father in events as managers of the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.460
 same 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.889
 apostles nine or ten steps has had 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.430
 evangelist edition i want to take 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.620
 block is thrown your job at all 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.470
 ends of the earth football corner 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.430
 about word that you can be from you can 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:15.199
 be through us you have known 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:18.490
 has not given the discovering discover and 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.490
 followed the flow 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.060
 estimated that this experience was very 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.710
 enriching and I must confess that then 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.690
 have passed my period of 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.810
 skepticism and having had a good 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.520
 number of significant experiences I 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.800
 I certainly came to the conclusion of 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.020
 that the hands of god was present in 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.060
 everything we did 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.459
 and what was predicted was verified 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.919
 While 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:47.659
 fantasy herself said finally that what 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.899
 what was happening was a desire to 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.899
 God 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.020
 He already said that Jesus revealed him later 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.820
 of the experience of their stigmas that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.370
 everything that was happening in 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.080
 previous epochs was in preparation to 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.080
 the events of that place 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.719
 Now, if that's true, Jesus was 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:15.910
 telling the world remember that 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:18.850
 that I did for you my crucifixion 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.400
 I am the son of god I was not 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.430
 forced to follow that path but I 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.270
 I submitted myself with humility to 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.150
 these penalties to save them and you what 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.289
 have forgotten and I am showing you that 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.899
 pain again through CATIA 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.499
 I do not think there is another explanation 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:39.499
 for it 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.420
 [Applause] 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.329
