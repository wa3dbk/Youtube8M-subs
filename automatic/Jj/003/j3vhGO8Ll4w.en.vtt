00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.420
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.139
 a video in front of me is the sony 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.360
 xperia z4 tablet in the lte version 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.490
 and I have the device for you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.379
 looked at about a week and a half 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 and now I want you a little bit 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:25.920
 give experience again first 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.529
 thanks once to the colleagues at 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 sparhandy de me the tablet 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.170
 kindly for a test 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.290
 have made available 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.129
 Thank you very much for coming 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 tablet itself 10 1 inch that is 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.450
 great display scary and easy 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.129
 scary slim the whole piece 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.649
 really great hand feeling even in the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.840
 overall usage does not show up 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.940
 only that the whole share real 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 but it is also nice 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.500
 design technically at least my taste 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.399
 that's exactly what we're doing 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.460
 a little bit to the hardware 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.400
 the xperia z4 tablet comes with one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.130
 qualcomm snapdragon 810 processor 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.170
 that's how i find the processor of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 the most in the last few days 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.189
 The tech blogs have been touring 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.920
 from this processor 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.830
 this is a 64 bit octa core processor 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 this works 3 gb RAM 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.200
 you donated the device and a 32 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 gb 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.130
 By the way, the whole thing is expandable 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.000
 up to 128 gigabytes by means of one 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.759
 micro-sd card slot to ensure you see 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.430
 here and that is as well the slot where as well 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.340
 the nano sim card comes in important 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.460
 a z4 tablet is that whole here 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 The certification means you 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.689
 can your tablet up to 30 minutes in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.570
 one and a half meters water depth swimming 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.329
 I'll leave that for you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.979
 me as important as that with me 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.140
 my tablet also like out there 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.090
 That's why I always work the lte 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.010
 version of equipment and if you have 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.650
 In the rain you need to be 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.000
 not big about what to worry about 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.840
 actually with the hardware 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.799
 unlock the thing for a moment you do it 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.980
 wlan and we will look at the whole 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.230
 get burned a bit together yes how 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.930
 You see, I'm still single 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.060
 homescreen user but we can do so here 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.280
 a little bit in the app store 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.319
 mend and you see that works 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.599
 everything very fast and very smoothly 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.450
 and I can also anticipate that 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.500
 also the case is in the service 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.140
 at big eps at elaborate games 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 This tablet has a lot of bucks 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.590
 that has a lot of power and you will 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.340
 this probably gets so fast 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.540
 do not bring to its performance limits 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.239
 Also excellent is the display 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.840
 very well readable sunlight like me 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.099
 find 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.989
 and yes a second play fits that too 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.780
 correspondingly high-resolution and this 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.389
 display is just phenomenal 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.930
 it's so good that it 's really fun 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:25.660
 makes work with the z4 tablet 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.480
 yes otherwise there is not the tablet 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.000
 much to say as I said which you have 32 gb 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.760
 memory after commissioning 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.620
 you guys in about 27 gb and a bit 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.410
 available and you have just like 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.650
 said the possibility here sd-cards 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.669
 insert 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.440
 the good piece is delivered with 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:49.900
 a very current android version 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.150
 namely android 5.0 point 2 and 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.049
 Otherwise , the tablet as I said lte 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.319
 connectivity bluetooth 41 onboard nfc 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.400
 on board so has virtually all 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.790
 gimmicks you want 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.099
 can 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.680
 the speakers are sitting here in this 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.239
 little rail in there and at the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.870
 loudspeakers are also my 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.530
 first major criticism because you do 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.079
 the volume of the tablet 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.810
 a value of less than 50 percent 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.359
 so 25 percent volume you hear from 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.690
 the speakers a clear white 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.380
 noise so a rush and that is very 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.440
 ugly 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.270
 since I only use my tablet and 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.310
 almost exclusively with headphones 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.770
 run falls for me not into 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.380
 weight but at the price of about 650 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.150
 to 700 euro depending on where you buy it 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.470
 and in which equipment is that 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.510
 simply unacceptable 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.460
 which, however, are completely okay 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.010
 the controls we have here 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.690
 power button and the ball loose for me 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.240
 personally on the wrong side 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.600
 Layout mistake for me because I hold 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.820
 like my tablet and then what 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.800
 It's clear if I happen to do that somehow 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.740
 Turn the tablet to the side or 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.830
 I want to do something 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.900
 like to lock here right in the middle of it 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.389
 her while playing for and block that is 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.650
 Stupid off happens to me relatively often 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:19.740
 this device of the otherwise camera front 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.900
 Rear camera despite Sony technology not 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.870
 especially with fame smears the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.270
 front camera works wonderfully for 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.160
 Video calling and does it all 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.200
 good comes with relatively fast 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.030
 Movements to the right the backs 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.789
 Camera is a typical nice weather 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.419
 I will show you this one again 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:43.020
 Shortly there she sits and up here next to 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.820
 it also uses the nfc chip nfc directly 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.919
 in a tablet for me so far too 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.740
 not so important on the smartphone 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.110
 However, I'm not angry like drum 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.910
 the technique and finds it 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.100
 Accordingly, you have good up here 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.610
 one last element namely the 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.130
 phone jack so so far so good for z4 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.910
 Tablet as I said all the dust and 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.050
 waterproof apology 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.970
 So all the dust and again 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.770
 waterproof I'm not satisfied 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.530
 am and that's actually mine 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:17.390
 main criticism after noise 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.440
 the speaker of the 6000 battery 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.039
 milliard hours otherwise I believe that 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.139
 the thing has and he runs in the stamina 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:29.370
 mode about 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.979
 because let's say 13 hours at 34 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.139
 hours display 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.210
 though I have the stamina mode 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.150
 make up and fire the tablet properly 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.069
 I have a display untime of 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.560
 maybe 45 hours and then it is 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.120
 also the complete tablet at the end would have 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.300
 i wished for more if you were 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.990
 the price is 56 700 euro 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.629
 so about the value you lie down 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.789
 Must be the latest for an ipad 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:59.069
 generation with 64 gigabytes of memory and 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:01.050
 lte there is one so at 710 euro 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.419
 So I can understand everybody 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.340
 who says the tablet is cool and that 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:07.919
 tablet is fun but for that 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.389
 I would just get an ipad money 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:14.099
 especially because the 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:17.159
 Battery life is so much longer 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:18.990
 much to z4 tablet the rest he 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:21.029
 Of course in the review and if you 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.139
 then ask me on each one 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.819
 case in the comments 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.009
 and of course I'm still trying 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:27.419
 answer and until it is as far as saying 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:30.680
 Thank you for watching and of course 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.680
 as always until next time
