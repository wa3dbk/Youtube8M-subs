something<00:02:07.170> else<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.220> sculpting<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.729> it's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
something else but the sculpting on it's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.820 
something else but the sculpting on it's
not<00:02:09.030> too<00:02:09.240> bad<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.200> steam<00:02:10.440> coming

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
not too bad I like the steam coming

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.140 
not too bad I like the steam coming
through<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.130> top<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> head<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.120> see

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
through the top of the head you can see

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.490 
through the top of the head you can see
the<00:02:12.360> ears<00:02:12.600> kind<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.990> sticking<00:02:13.290> through<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the ears kind of sticking through the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.260 
the ears kind of sticking through the
mask<00:02:13.710> on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.920> side<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.490> she<00:02:14.550> has<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.000> hair

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
mask on the side and she has this hair

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.910 
mask on the side and she has this hair
coming<00:02:15.510> down<00:02:15.690> over<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.530> does<00:02:16.800> not

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
coming down over here which does not

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
coming down over here which does not
have<00:02:17.130> any<00:02:17.310> paint<00:02:17.610> detail<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.270> but<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.630> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
have any paint detail in it but it is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.020 
have any paint detail in it but it is
colored<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.290> nice<00:02:19.530> red<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:20.400> almost<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.730> brown

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
colored a nice red it's almost a brown

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.270 
colored a nice red it's almost a brown
color<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:22.080> it's<00:02:22.290> red<00:02:22.620> enough<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.040> me<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
color but it's red enough for me the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.980 
color but it's red enough for me the
hair<00:02:23.430> sculpt<00:02:23.760> isn't<00:02:24.090> too<00:02:24.210> bad<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.630> do<00:02:24.690> like

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
hair sculpt isn't too bad and I do like

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.850 
hair sculpt isn't too bad and I do like
that<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> doesn't<00:02:25.410> really<00:02:25.650> hinder

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that it doesn't really hinder

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.770 
that it doesn't really hinder
articulation<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:26.910> that's<00:02:27.150> pretty<00:02:27.510> cool<00:02:27.660> it's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
articulation so that's pretty cool it's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
articulation so that's pretty cool it's
actually<00:02:28.110> really<00:02:28.290> dark<00:02:28.860> over<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.640> little

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
actually really dark over here a little

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000 
actually really dark over here a little
too<00:02:30.330> dark<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.230> know<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.380> feel<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:31.890> I'm

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
too dark but you know I feel like I'm

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.590 
too dark but you know I feel like I'm
being<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.280> little<00:02:32.310> nitpicky<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.360> can

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
being a little nitpicky because you can

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.390 
being a little nitpicky because you can
see<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> shading<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.620> yellow<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.040> really

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
see the shading and yellow is really

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.160 
see the shading and yellow is really
hard<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.090> work<00:02:36.270> with<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.510> I'm<00:02:36.780> sympathetic

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
hard to work with so I'm sympathetic

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.059 
hard to work with so I'm sympathetic
towards

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
towards

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.429 
towards
that<00:02:38.249> but<00:02:38.700> when<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:38.999> look<00:02:39.150> at<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.390> fist<00:02:39.689> I<00:02:39.959> see

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
that but when you look at the fist I see

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.349 
that but when you look at the fist I see
two<00:02:40.680> very<00:02:40.950> different<00:02:41.280> colors<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
two very different colors you know it's

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.640 
two very different colors you know it's
a<00:02:42.450> much<00:02:42.599> brighter<00:02:42.810> yellow<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.379> then<00:02:43.469> you<00:02:43.530> have

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
a much brighter yellow and then you have

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.860 
a much brighter yellow and then you have
straight-up<00:02:44.069> orange<00:02:44.549> over<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.480> don't

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
straight-up orange over here so I don't

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.509 
straight-up orange over here so I don't
know<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.499> boat<00:02:46.680> doesn't<00:02:46.980> look<00:02:47.099> too<00:02:47.249> bad

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
know and the boat doesn't look too bad

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.489 
know and the boat doesn't look too bad
I<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.909> this<00:02:48.090> gold<00:02:48.450> plastic<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.139> they<00:02:49.200> used

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:49.499 
I like this gold plastic that they used

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:50.989 
I like this gold plastic that they used
for<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.829> belt<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.639> move<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:50.909> around

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:50.999 
for this belt and you can move it around

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.390 
for this belt and you can move it around
if<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:51.450> want<00:02:51.689> to<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.139> we<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.920> giant

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
if you want to and we have the giant

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.550 
if you want to and we have the giant
hand<00:02:53.639> the<00:02:53.939> giant<00:02:54.329> Jean<00:02:54.540> Grae<00:02:54.750> Han<00:02:55.019> which<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.469> am

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
hand the giant Jean Grae Han which I am

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.800 
hand the giant Jean Grae Han which I am
NOT<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:55.889> fan<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.760> kind<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.329> sucks<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.659> see

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
NOT a fan of so kind of sucks to see

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.660 
NOT a fan of so kind of sucks to see
that<00:02:57.989> come<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.560> kind<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.040> just<00:02:59.250> wish<00:02:59.489> that

was<00:02:59.819> gone<00:03:00.180> forever<00:03:00.510> they<00:03:01.200> could<00:03:01.379> have<00:03:01.469> given

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
was gone forever they could have given

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.259 
was gone forever they could have given
us<00:03:01.829> some<00:03:01.980> paint<00:03:02.250> shading<00:03:02.519> on<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.700> blue<00:03:02.879> areas

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
us some paint shading on the blue areas

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.659 
us some paint shading on the blue areas
but<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.780> did<00:03:03.959> not<00:03:04.200> as<00:03:05.040> far<00:03:05.280> as<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> paint

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
but they did not as far as the paint

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.879 
but they did not as far as the paint
applications<00:03:06.209> go<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.659> not<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.989> best<00:03:07.319> but

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
applications go it's not the best but

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.920 
applications go it's not the best but
definitely<00:03:08.579> I<00:03:08.790> don't<00:03:09.090> know<00:03:09.180> probably<00:03:09.540> not<00:03:09.749> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
definitely I don't know probably not the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.420 
definitely I don't know probably not the
worst<00:03:10.139> anyway<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.680> haven't<00:03:10.919> gone<00:03:11.129> through<00:03:11.189> all

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
worst anyway I haven't gone through all

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.699 
worst anyway I haven't gone through all
the<00:03:11.760> figures<00:03:12.150> yet<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.719> they<00:03:13.230> did<00:03:13.409> give<00:03:13.590> us

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
the figures yet and they did give us

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.770 
the figures yet and they did give us
some<00:03:13.859> angle<00:03:14.189> pivot<00:03:14.459> which<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.760> cool<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.060> and

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780

hair doesn't really hinder that

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.240 
hair doesn't really hinder that
articulation<00:03:30.389> so<00:03:30.599> much<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> ball<00:03:31.919> peg

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250

articulation so much it's on a ball peg
over<00:03:32.430> here<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:32.969> it<00:03:33.120> can't<00:03:33.359> really<00:03:33.449> look<00:03:33.989> too

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
over here so it can't really look too

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.649 
over here so it can't really look too
far<00:03:34.650> up<00:03:34.919> anyway<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.969> look<00:03:36.180> down<00:03:36.389> a<00:03:36.419> little

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
far up anyway it can look down a little

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.209 
far up anyway it can look down a little
bit<00:03:36.870> though<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.500> get<00:03:37.620> shoulders<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.069> move

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
compared to Spider Girl and I really

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.080

think they could have gotten away with
it<00:04:33.990> they're<00:04:34.530> about<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.039> same<00:04:35.190> height<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.460> guess
