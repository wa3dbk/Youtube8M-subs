they could be bar set they could

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
they could be bar set they could
alternate<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:02.280> could<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.550> different<00:01:02.879> shapes

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
alternate we could have different shapes

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.450 
alternate we could have different shapes
and<00:01:03.359> different<00:01:03.690> styles<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.070> copy<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and different styles you could copy the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390 
and different styles you could copy the
style<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.119> shape<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.350> center<00:01:07.830> stone<00:01:08.040> for

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
style of the shape the center stone for

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.190 
style of the shape the center stone for
them<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.640> engagement<00:01:08.939> ring<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.080> could

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
them an engagement ring or we could

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.560 
them an engagement ring or we could
alternate<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.799> different<00:01:11.369> shapes<00:01:12.330> for

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
alternate it with different shapes for

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
alternate it with different shapes for
instance<00:01:12.869> your<00:01:13.110> stone<00:01:13.320> could<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.619> round<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
instance your stone could be round and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
instance your stone could be round and
so<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.210> could<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.420> alternating<00:01:15.900> rounds<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so we could have alternating rounds and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.460 
so we could have alternating rounds and
squares<00:01:16.790> anything<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.960> try<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.320> much

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
squares anything at all we try as much

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.499 
squares anything at all we try as much
as<00:01:19.530> possible<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> wedding<00:01:20.909> band<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
as possible to get the wedding band to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
as possible to get the wedding band to
lie<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.960> against<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> engagement<00:01:23.189> ring<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.939> we

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
lie up against the engagement ring so we

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
lie up against the engagement ring so we
eliminate<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.960> space<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.770> can

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
eliminate as much space as we can

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.210 
eliminate as much space as we can
between<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.210> rings<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.890> not

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
between the two rings but it is not

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.039 
between the two rings but it is not
necessary<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.570> absolute<00:01:30.900> view

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
necessary to have an absolute view

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
necessary to have an absolute view
watertight<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> there's<00:01:32.490> no<00:01:32.640> air

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
watertight so that there's no air

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
watertight so that there's no air
between<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.500> fact<00:01:34.560> most

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
between the two at all in fact most

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.069 
between the two at all in fact most
times<00:01:35.159> even<00:01:35.970> though<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> engagement<00:01:36.720> ring<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
times even though the engagement ring is

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.929 
times even though the engagement ring is
a<00:01:37.110> flush<00:01:37.470> foot<00:01:37.740> which<00:01:38.310> means<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> wedding

own and doesn't look like it's a half of
a<00:04:17.400> pair<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.970> something<00:04:18.359> else<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:19.229> looks
