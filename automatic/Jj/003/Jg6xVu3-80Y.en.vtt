00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello vincent riou of the two musics 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.300
 and sounds to yverdon so here we are 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.400
 in front of magnificent saxophone selmer series 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.860
 mark 7 which unfortunately fell 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.220
 on the grid here so life is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.490
 depressed is the key does not move anymore and in 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.260
 the more he was poorly cleaned with a 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.180
 product that has flowed into clae so 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.070
 you have to clean this product it was flowing 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 also on the pads probably 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.000
 very badly set a long time buffer 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.840
 on the other hand are not bad we can 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.840
 definitely keep them 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.270
 the instrument is dismounted we will proceed 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.040
 now or a wise cleansing of the body 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.809
 that I'm going to do in a bath with a 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.270
 special soap to clean everything 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.700
 and then I will not read all the keys 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.360
 first in the machine then by hand and 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.220
 we will polish the body too 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.420
 now here at the exit of the bath and 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 now polishing by hand what we 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.920
 will do everything where the instrument like that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.619
 being careful of punctured pass on 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:37.539
 and then comes out it's a job 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:39.090
 long breath of course then that's it 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.770
 as can be seen here 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.000
 I am passing a ball to 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.670
 inside to remove some 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.670
 small bumps in the body 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.900
 the keys came out the first font 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.150
 buy a machine cleaning so 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.630
 now it still takes the arrivals to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:27.760
 the hand ie clean them 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.760
 with a product is this way 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.970
 so every key is going to be carefully 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.590
 cleaned up like this until he stays 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.269
 no more trace of soiling 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.940
 now that all our keys are 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.040
 clean it will have to be carefully 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.950
 degrease the inside of the axes for 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.680
 remove all traces of life 'greece 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.360
 things that could alter the good 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.360
 operation of the key thereafter 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.890
 so we'll do that to all the keys and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.790
 also take advantage of degreasing 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.370
 all the swims we see that after the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.720
 polishing 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.720
 there may be black marks 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.400
 now that we have degreased the interior 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.550
 axes clean the nacres what are we going 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.540
 do we will clean the buffers 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:33.000
 with a cleaner for the well 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:38.819
 with my little sponge and I'm doing it on 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.030
 each stamp we can already see just 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.420
 cleaning that the buffer is again 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.489
 perfectly clean that's then 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.630
 now I made a selection of and 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:58.940
 pre-cut a whole series of 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:04.110
 felt cork as seen here here 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:07.230
 or for example that will allow me to 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:12.750
 change the cork markers that are 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:16.229
 defective then so now that 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.489
 everything is clean that all my felts and 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:27.450
 cork without have been changed I'm going 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:29.640
 start their assembly take care to 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.620
 each time to well oil each axis 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.620
 before reassembling the key 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.830
 so I'm going to make a first 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.770
 check what height 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.140
 the distance between the buffer you are the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.250
 fireplace so I'm doing this by means of a 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.470
 gauge here and I see here 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.660
 the setting I made at the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.160
 may change me cork it's 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.160
 perfect it pastique early 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.450
 we are obviously now that 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.230
 does not mean that the buffer will close 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:32.520
 so I check that the buffer closes 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.710
 all around it also control at 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.020
 level of correspondence kif who 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.870
 close all around 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.080
 so here onan correspondence and I 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.890
 note that it does not close 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.850
 enough so individually 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:54.390
 here the buffer closes but in 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.090
 correspondence it does not close what 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.930
 means that this key must be 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:06.450
 corrected and we will correct it since 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:10.260
 behind that is to say here we will lower 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.740
 slightly 7 7 bat up spa at this 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.190
 advice 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.950
 the necessary closure then i'm going 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.750
 go around each stamp and I 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:24.360
 will fix them I'll do some 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:29.090
 punctual corrections with small 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:33.090
 call like this and so I 'll rectified 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:36.750
 correct the six the seat of my stamp 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.180
 depending on where it does not close 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:45.030
 not I'm going to do that for each of 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.980
 buffers the settings we already made their 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.830
 mounting both all 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.230
 keys of most keys is here 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.390
 again with the light I control that 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.510
 each stamp be tench 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.950
 he makes the necessary corrections 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.950
 until the end of editing 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.800
 Oh 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:30.450
 and here are dear friends of saxophone selmer 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.910
 marx is silvery after that complete 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:37.140
 review I thank for following this 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:39.570
 short video that is only the tip of 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.520
 the iceberg of repair at all 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.800
 young sax lovers go here 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.030
 at music and his studio 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.930
 repair of musical instruments 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.760
 vincent liot des yverdon in switzerland 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.760
 see you again and see you soon 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.760
 thank you
