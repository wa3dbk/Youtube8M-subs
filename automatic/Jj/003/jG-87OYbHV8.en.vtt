really<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.610> an<00:01:32.850> online<00:01:33.000> map<00:01:33.509> because

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
really if there is an online map because

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
really if there is an online map because
on<00:01:34.799> GTA<00:01:35.310> 4<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.729> had<00:01:35.850> sections<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> map

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
on GTA 4 they had sections of the map

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.530 
on GTA 4 they had sections of the map
but<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.189> why<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
but I don't see why not that they on the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780 
but I don't see why not that they on the
bridge<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.079> bridge<00:01:40.290> war<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.520> team

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
bridge like a bridge war like one team

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.789 
bridge like a bridge war like one team
one<00:01:41.970> side<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.479> team<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> other<00:01:42.990> almost<00:01:43.439> got

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
one side one team the other almost got

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770

hit<00:01:43.950> by<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> car<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
hit by the car then but if there is a
