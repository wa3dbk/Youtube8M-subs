locators and the products and how they

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.220 
locators and the products and how they
react<00:00:08.830> to<00:00:08.860> various<00:00:09.700> steel<00:00:10.450> targets<00:00:11.080> or

the can at the top this is the volume
switch<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.600> sensitivity<00:01:34.990> that

therefore has the shortest tube and has

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.280 
therefore has the shortest tube and has
the<00:01:47.530> least<00:01:47.890> amount<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.430> sensitivity<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.990> is

the opposing end the magnetic field goes
the<00:04:20.530> opposite<00:04:21.070> direction<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:21.700> now<00:04:22.060> we<00:04:22.120> have<00:04:22.360> a

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 
locator not all steel objects have

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.200 
locator not all steel objects have
ferrous<00:06:56.680> content<00:06:57.280> therefore<00:06:57.580> don't<00:06:57.970> have<00:06:58.180> a

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
ferrous content therefore don't have a

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.300 
ferrous content therefore don't have a
magnetic<00:06:58.870> field<00:06:59.020> one<00:06:59.470> of<00:06:59.590> those<00:06:59.770> is<00:07:00.009> stainless

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
content within it at all and therefore

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.980

would<00:07:06.159> not<00:07:06.340> be<00:07:06.520> detectable<00:07:07.150> by<00:07:07.449> a<00:07:07.479> magnetic

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
would not be detectable by a magnetic

because<00:07:32.740> they<00:07:32.919> contain<00:07:33.310> steel<00:07:33.819> they'll<00:07:34.659> have

this<00:07:38.259> is<00:07:38.440> the<00:07:38.590> technique<00:07:39.069> that<00:07:39.340> you<00:07:39.460> would<00:07:39.610> use

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 
this is the technique that you would use

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:42.749 
this is the technique that you would use
to<00:07:40.150> locate<00:07:40.930> a<00:07:41.169> buried<00:07:41.710> facility<00:07:42.340> that's<00:07:42.520> made

to locate a buried facility that's made

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.089 
to locate a buried facility that's made
out<00:07:42.909> of<00:07:43.060> steel<00:07:43.360> and<00:07:43.659> try<00:07:44.169> to<00:07:44.229> avoid<00:07:44.800> the

out of steel and try to avoid the
