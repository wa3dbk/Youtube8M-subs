back<00:01:30.689> arrow<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.500> completely<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.430> back<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
back arrow I could completely go back to

in vsco cam I'm not going to go into all
of<00:01:44.340> them<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.380> go

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
of them but what I want to do is go

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.260 
of them but what I want to do is go
ahead<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> play<00:01:47.340> around<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.149> get

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
ahead and play around see if I can get

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
ahead and play around see if I can get
this<00:01:48.420> photo<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.899> look<00:01:49.079> even<00:01:49.680> closer<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
this photo to look even closer to what I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.630 
this photo to look even closer to what I
would<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.880> look<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:52.470> first

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
would like it to look like the first

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.219 
would like it to look like the first
option<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.729> exposure<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:55.049> mess<00:01:55.200> around

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
option is exposure I can mess around

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.929 
option is exposure I can mess around
with<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> exposure<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:56.100> raising<00:01:56.369> exposure

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
with the exposure by raising exposure

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.850 
with the exposure by raising exposure
which<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> adds<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> cool<00:01:58.170> high

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
which kind of adds this cool high

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.539 
which kind of adds this cool high
contrast<00:01:59.549> effect<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> photo<00:02:01.130> or<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.219> can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
contrast effect to the photo or I can

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.370 
contrast effect to the photo or I can
reduce<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.270> exposure<00:02:03.659> making<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> little

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
reduce the exposure making it a little

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.830 
reduce the exposure making it a little
bit<00:02:04.530> darker<00:02:05.130> overall<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.299> really<00:02:06.479> depends

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
bit darker overall so it really depends

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.449 
bit darker overall so it really depends
on<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
on what I want to do I think that I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.070 
on what I want to do I think that I
actually<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> raise<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.450> contrast<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
actually want to raise the contrast I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680 
actually want to raise the contrast I
like<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.530> maybe<00:02:10.830> maybe<00:02:11.580> plus<00:02:11.970> three<00:02:12.330> looks

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
like it maybe maybe plus three looks

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.520 
like it maybe maybe plus three looks
looks<00:02:13.260> pretty

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
looks pretty

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
looks pretty
cool<00:02:13.740> I'm<00:02:13.920> losing<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> detail<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.120> of

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
cool I'm losing the detail and some of

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.809 
cool I'm losing the detail and some of
those<00:02:15.300> clouds<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.400> doing

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
those clouds but I like what it's doing

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.530 
those clouds but I like what it's doing
to<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:19.530> photo<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.160> general<00:02:20.819> by<00:02:20.970> raising<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
to the photo in general by raising it to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300 
to the photo in general by raising it to
plus<00:02:21.720> three<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:22.770> going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.920> go<00:02:23.040> ahead<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
plus three so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.309 
plus three so I'm going to go ahead and
press<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.670> checkmark<00:02:23.940> accept<00:02:24.900> those<00:02:25.020> changes

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
press the checkmark accept those changes

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.290 
press the checkmark accept those changes
and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> next<00:02:26.670> thing<00:02:26.850> I'm<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> do

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
and then the next thing I'm going to do

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.460 
and then the next thing I'm going to do
is<00:02:27.600> go<00:02:27.900> into<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.980> fade<00:02:29.790> mode<00:02:30.390> which<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.020> this

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
is go into the fade mode which is this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.740 
is go into the fade mode which is this
one<00:02:31.739> right<00:02:32.069> here<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> fade<00:02:33.450> moments

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
one right here and the fade moments

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.729 
one right here and the fade moments
starting<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:34.080> zero<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.410> it's<00:02:34.560> not<00:02:34.620> actually

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
starting at zero so it's not actually

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.720 
starting at zero so it's not actually
doing<00:02:35.310> anything

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
doing anything

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
doing anything
the<00:02:35.910> moment<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.239> start<00:02:36.420> raising<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.170> plus

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the moment you start raising it to plus

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.970 
the moment you start raising it to plus
one<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.790> starts<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.980> essentially

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
one and so on it starts to essentially

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.190 
one and so on it starts to essentially
make<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.760> photo<00:02:42.000> faded<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.720> look<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.020> little

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
make the photo faded and look a little

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.930 
make the photo faded and look a little
bit<00:02:43.440> more<00:02:43.620> old<00:02:43.920> or<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> little<00:02:44.489> bit<00:02:44.610> more<00:02:44.760> low

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
bit more old or a little bit more low

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.630 
bit more old or a little bit more low
contrast<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.110> like<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.620> look<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.160> for

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
contrast and I like the look of that for

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.670 
contrast and I like the look of that for
my<00:02:47.700> black<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.120> white<00:02:48.239> photos<00:02:48.660> typically<00:02:49.530> when

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
my black and white photos typically when

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.199 
my black and white photos typically when
I'm<00:02:49.800> creating<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.340> black<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.730> white<00:02:50.820> photo<00:02:51.030> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
I'm creating a black and white photo I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.520 
I'm creating a black and white photo I
want<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.600> feel<00:02:51.780> timeless<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.040> nostalgic<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
want to feel timeless and nostalgic and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.650 
want to feel timeless and nostalgic and
feel<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:56.010> could<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.220> from<00:02:56.489> any<00:02:56.820> era<00:02:57.090> so

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
feel like it could be from any era so

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.720 
feel like it could be from any era so
maybe<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.350> bit<00:02:58.620> much<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:59.130> +12

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
maybe this is a little bit much with +12

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.120 
maybe this is a little bit much with +12
so<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.269> could<00:03:00.510> go<00:03:00.630> ahead<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:00.959> dial<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.680> fade

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
so I could go ahead and dial the fade

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.699 
so I could go ahead and dial the fade
back<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.760> let's<00:03:03.090> say<00:03:03.239> around<00:03:03.510> plus<00:03:03.810> eight<00:03:04.110> it's

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
back to let's say around plus eight it's

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.259 
back to let's say around plus eight it's
really<00:03:05.069> up<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.519> where<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.880> want<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.120> leave

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
adds darkening around the edges so I'm

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.610 
adds darkening around the edges so I'm
gonna<00:03:21.299> go<00:03:21.420> ahead<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.630> experiment<00:03:22.049> with<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
gonna go ahead and experiment with that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.250 
gonna go ahead and experiment with that
and<00:03:22.920> just<00:03:23.070> see<00:03:23.310> how<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.519> like<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:23.910> by<00:03:24.870> adding<00:03:25.049> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
and just see how I like it by adding a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.870 
and just see how I like it by adding a
little<00:03:25.410> bit<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.620> vignette<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> photo<00:03:26.579> I

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
little bit of vignette to the photo I

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.520 
little bit of vignette to the photo I
think<00:03:27.269> that's<00:03:27.420> cool<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.900> adds<00:03:28.049> kind<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.380> an

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
think that's cool it adds kind of an

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
think that's cool it adds kind of an
overall<00:03:28.829> vibe<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:30.299> made<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
overall vibe to it it's it's made the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.270 
overall vibe to it it's it's made the
photo<00:03:30.930> darker<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.829> around<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.160> edges

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
photo darker just around the edges

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.729 
photo darker just around the edges
instead<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.420> entire<00:03:33.510> picture<00:03:34.350> itself

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
instead of in the entire picture itself

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.830 
instead of in the entire picture itself
I<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.250> where<00:03:35.430> it's<00:03:35.549> ended<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:36.000> here<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.540> think

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
I like where it's ended up here I think

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.560 
I like where it's ended up here I think
I<00:03:36.930> might<00:03:37.170> reduce<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.799> little<00:03:37.860> bit<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:39.180> plus

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
I might reduce it a little bit to plus

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.900 
I might reduce it a little bit to plus
eleven<00:03:40.019> which<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.230> just<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.860> tad<00:03:41.190> lighter<00:03:41.670> in
