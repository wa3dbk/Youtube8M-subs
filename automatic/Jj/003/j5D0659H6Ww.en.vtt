00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.349
 the petals more or less in half of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.000
 the strawberry we make a straight cut and what 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.460
 knife remember not to make such a cut 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.500

 it is simply a cut 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.039
 not so deep and we open with our hands 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.559

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.909
