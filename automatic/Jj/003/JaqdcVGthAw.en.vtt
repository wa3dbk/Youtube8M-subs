10 mile-per-hour wind

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.440 
10 mile-per-hour wind
so<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:14.009> tied<00:00:14.219> off<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> line<00:00:14.730> while<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> got

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450

the rig set up the objective of this rig
is<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.240> hold<00:00:18.359> two<00:00:18.600> cameras<00:00:19.050> pointed<00:00:19.439> straight

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
is to hold two cameras pointed straight

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.740 
is to hold two cameras pointed straight
down<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.490> they<00:00:20.609> both<00:00:20.699> capture<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> same<00:00:21.420> scene

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750

I set it up with both cameras recording

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.390 
I set it up with both cameras recording
video<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.390> check<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> alignment

eventually<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> hope<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.790> use<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.180> rig<00:02:23.420> for

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
eventually I hope to use this rig for

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.720 
eventually I hope to use this rig for
matched<00:02:23.930> infrared<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.890> visible<00:02:24.920> cameras

matched infrared and visible cameras

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.460 
matched infrared and visible cameras
which<00:02:26.120> will<00:02:26.300> simultaneously<00:02:26.450> capture<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
which will simultaneously capture the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.590 
which will simultaneously capture the
same<00:02:27.650> scene<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.610> pointing<00:02:29.000> both<00:02:29.120> cameras<00:02:29.510> in

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
same scene so pointing both cameras in

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.560 
same scene so pointing both cameras in
exactly<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.050> same<00:02:30.230> direction<00:02:30.380> as<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.800> goal<00:02:31.570> so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
exactly the same direction as a goal so

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.390 
exactly the same direction as a goal so
the<00:02:32.660> alignment<00:02:32.840> looks<00:02:33.200> good<00:02:33.440> but<00:02:34.190> not<00:02:34.340> perfect

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
the alignment looks good but not perfect

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.580 
the alignment looks good but not perfect
it<00:02:35.120> seemed<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.480> me<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:35.630> during<00:02:36.200> this

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it seemed to me that during this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.020 
it seemed to me that during this
particularly<00:02:37.010> bumpy<00:02:37.400> part<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.820> flight

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
particularly bumpy part of the flight

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.390 
particularly bumpy part of the flight
the<00:02:38.540> motion<00:02:38.900> recorded<00:02:39.410> by<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.620> two<00:02:39.890> cameras

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the motion recorded by the two cameras

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.450 
the motion recorded by the two cameras
was<00:02:40.850> not<00:02:41.030> identical<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:42.980> because<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
was not identical so is that because the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.860 
was not identical so is that because the
center<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.760> gravity<00:02:43.850> is<00:02:44.270> closer<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
center of gravity is closer to the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.080 
center of gravity is closer to the
heavier<00:02:45.200> upper<00:02:45.770> camera<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.730> spinning

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
heavier upper camera and the spinning

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.880 
heavier upper camera and the spinning
motion<00:02:47.240> is<00:02:47.480> amplified<00:02:47.990> in<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.260> lower<00:02:48.410> camera

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
motion is amplified in the lower camera

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:59.100 
motion is amplified in the lower camera
or<00:02:49.670> maybe<00:02:50.000> I'm<00:02:50.270> just<00:02:50.300> imagining<00:02:50.720> this

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.300 

after<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.200> video<00:03:00.319> flight<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.740> sent<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.130> rig

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
after the video flight I sent the rig

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.180 
after the video flight I sent the rig
back<00:03:01.490> up<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.849> capture<00:03:02.180> some<00:03:02.330> stills<00:03:06.190> because

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
back up to capture some stills because

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.569 
back up to capture some stills because
that<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.849> what<00:03:08.270> it's<00:03:08.420> all<00:03:08.540> about
