00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.750
 hello i'm just a movie robert gibbs 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.970
 and we're at the cebit at can t 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.610
 2013 it is a typical Chinese 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.740
 from kansas originating manufacturers and the 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.119
 build cheap tablets as usual 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.349
 However, things are here 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.999
 a little different than the others 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.380
 Of course there are other providers 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.149
 but it's not basically just 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.009
 mediatek and hotpot chip on board but 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:27.769
 that here are samsung based tablets 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.559
 So here is the same samsung cortex 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.530
 a9 this is the 44 12 from the samsung 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:36.260
 galaxy s3 with 1.4 gigahertz so one 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.500
 quad-core cpu the current 9 7 inches 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.760
 display 1024 x 768 display resolutions 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.200
 running currently, nor end with 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.180
 android 4.0 ice cream sandwich becomes 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.520
 however soon updated and that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.340
 special is the places until the end of april 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.400
 was the announcement on the new cortex a15 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.710
 So that should be 1 54 12 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.230
 whether cora or maybe 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.239
 rather the quad-core the smaller one 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.550
 the 54 10 had to be, I think 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.009
 In any case, they will soon be on the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.749
 victim core cpu s of samsung um is 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.799
 at least the announcement and then should 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:11.630
 from the end of april with 1000 pieces decrease 210 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.670
 dollar costs about that, however 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.200
 The announcement still means to know 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.329
 not exactly what those things cost 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.399
 But they are very very timely 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.109
 suppose samsung then itself 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.219
 with his galaxy s 4 is out there and 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.960
 maybe his tablets too 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.220
 updated 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.390
 but we'll see you shortly 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.580
 here in front have a normal 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.140
 little webcam that probably has one 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.760
 vga resolution is, however, after 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.130
 customer request to configure so the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.229
 manufacturer the brand provider the dinger 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.460
 then to europe and for example 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.240
 configure it according to your needs 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.759
 to let 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.979
 n wlan it on board one or two gb 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.580
 RAM and it goes off 32 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.920
 gigabyte flash breaker 32 and 64 gb 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.960
 we are planning to watch some tricks 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.759
 rum as we have here that looks like 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.030
 the headphone jack a micro usb 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.330
 port a mini hdmi this is probably the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.580
 I think power connection 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.130
 and micro sd port and why is that 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.990
 quite bald on the left side 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.019
 just like that and up here we still have 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.519
 I'll see if I can get a house 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.610
 do not know if that is in antenna but 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.690
 I think it might be an antenna 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.310
 either then everything is in there where you are 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.900
 is that he did not believe but it is 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.820
 probably an antenna for remseck 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.709
 or maybe dvb-t depending on 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.140
 where the manufacturer then has it off 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.819
 Here we have the volume rocker 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.860
 on and off switch and a 5 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.720
 megapixel camera can be said after 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.130
 be configured by 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
 the one who then imports 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.290
 would like to have a speaker and 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.010
 down here we also find one 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.010
 sim card slot 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.080
 even with you, that's what the thing is 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.269
 then probably with 3g 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.519
 available and possibly soon too 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.080
 with lte depending on whether you have the module 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.250
 can be installed for it 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.110
 this is the few 10s of can t 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.269
 are exhibiting and here we have 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.130
 I believe the k 10 g as far as I am concerned 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.019
 in principle I am informed the same 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.610
 platform and same configuration 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.140
 if you look at the side 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.140
 The same ports are also there 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.180
 as far as I can tell now is here 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.710
 no sim card slot provided 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.090
 the rounds there is a dock and that 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.040
 even looks like being as a holder 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.900
 for either the docking station or even 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.910
 a hotdog the keyboard dock is here 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.260
 not yet on the stand but that will be 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.680
 then certainly in the coming months 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.770
 demonstrate 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.840
 okay those are the cats the k10 row 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.050
 pentaho's are with samsung tvs 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.750
 from the end of april with cortex a15 quad core 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.130
 and hopefully even if there could 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.260
 we are not sure yet 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.260
 not until then not 100 at this time
