 enjoy riding a bicycle in the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.490
 city is increasing and also the taste 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.099
 for mountain biking and today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.020
 Juan Carlos Perez Castro Director of the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.170
 mountain bike team of the unam 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
 welcome to juan carlos today you come with 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.140
 all your team you also as they are 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 good morning good morning divide 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.760
 fake tie one face and that's how you tell me 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.640
 you need a person to practice 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.079
 it has to be unaccompanied 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.940
 necessarily in the case of the team of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.469
 we do not necessarily have many 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.379
 other teams that can participate what 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.210
 they need is desire and desire will 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 good to move to nearby places 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.079
 to the city for mountain biking 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.850
 that this has to be in a place where 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.469
 the forest for example I judge it the hill 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.719
 of the star in the north by chiluca 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.690
 there are several places in the city of a 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.250
 thing is expensive I say there are bicycles all the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 People sometimes have the idea that a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.079
 sport like this is expensive by the team 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.890
 the uniform the bikes maybe 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.460
 glances 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.810
 when the recreational can be economic 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 complete carry a cheap bicycle 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.050
 it can cost you 45 thousand pesos ok 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.850
 a helmet 200 pesos the gloves 150 pesos 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.580
 You can also invest as 67 thousand 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.320
 weights in a basic team and so you get 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.240
 to compete good there are 100 pieces there 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.250
 bicycles up to 100 50 thousand pesos 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 but finally here what is going 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.720
 importing is that both practices and that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.119
 give you security a bicycle that costs 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 more expensive sometimes people shy away but it's 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.750
 your safety is your life that is in 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.610
 game because he starts being more daring 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.440
 then you have to invest a little more 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 in your safety after four years of 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.160
 started you can start practicing 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.960
 this sport since little ones the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.520
 brother of felipe for example has 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.950
 four years since I believe that weight 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.210
 also started at age five and not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.800
 matter how old I thought I was going 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.370
 bicycle at 39 years old by 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 example 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.820
 there are women's teams there are also 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.680
 female teams with us there is a 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.870
 female group and there are others who participate 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.120
 also with women and if it's for both 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.550
 sexes children men women and so on 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.040
 tell a thing that you get to the unamid 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.770
 where questions or want to register me 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.110
 Where do I find them good? 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.510
 We have a blog page 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.910
 internet and download more mtb and there I 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.080
 I think the data will come out in 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.520
 screen and no more is to contact us and 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.280
 how much time do you train to be able 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.320
 practice it already the sport already in form 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.780
 good depends on the time we have 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.380
 some who train daily other 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.920
 we train 34 days a week but what 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.810
 If you want to compete low, you have 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.970
 to be daily or six days a week and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.770
 they have to take a training 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.930
 previous if you do in addition to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.360
 mountain biking make this not 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.450
 they run to the gym they have to 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.190
 complement or only the bicycle 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.530
 come as such is heated a little 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.350
 they get on the bike and right now we're 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.910
 in pre-season already aha and there you have to 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.460
 do other things gym 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.380
 run swimming how many hours of time 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.450
 you dedicate it so that more or less 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.720
 person who has never done an exercise 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.730
 and it says good this year as a purpose of 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.500
 Christmas I will start that exercise and 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.140
 maybe mountain biking is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.240
 listen very attractive because you find 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.150
 a different picture you're not in the 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.160
 city ​​and it says good I'm going to winnow that 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.910
 it's how much time I have to invest 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.400
 if you work in an office this to 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.410
 to be able to practice it in a way, if it is 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.960
 in zero at zero I think that first there is 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.080
 what to practice in plan and toot bike lanes 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.930
 in the dashboard alba if it is flatter and 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.180
 pavement because I already go to the mountain 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.860
 requires technique and strength and 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.680
 physical condition then if they are going to 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.800
 start from scratch about fifteen minutes and go 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.900
 advancing little by little in the flat and 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.270
 after going to the mountain ok 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.190
 Today we are going to ask you here that everything is 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.650
 what motivates you the most 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.020
 to do mountain biking 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.110
 welcome thank you for the emotion that 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.510
 cause the careers I'm very fond of 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.140
 the racing and the adrenaline of running 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.820
 it is the main motivation, do you hear 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.820
 Lin you say to people like 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.620
 motivates arias why 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.050
 decided to opt for this sport 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.890
 difference from any other hello what 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.560
 such good morning 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.160
 -Would first motivate what is a 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.920
 very complete sport 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.580
 you exercise the heart exercises the 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.110
 legs the benefits of the mind very 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.390
 very very important the mind in a 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.020
 race above all more than the physical more 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.500
 that nothing is the mind 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.020
 there are races of up to 150 km for a 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.479
 stage that are not difficult at all and 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.389
 who ultimately who take the 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:52.150
 chaste and claw cougar so to speak is 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.820
 the mind more than the physical is the mind 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.270
 we can start from very young 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.270
 until now very big as my partner 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.780
 we three are we students of 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.340
 moon if they are graduates in gap oma and 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.770
 so then go this sport is 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.470
 open to all ages and all in 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.570
 screen in some images that we have 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.060
 the average team are explained by the team 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.650
 there are girls in the team there is no everything 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.320
 in the team very well today and this this 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.730
 they did here in the adjust here in that 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.260
 is what we are seeing on the screen is 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.760
 in the adjustment is the first race of 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.430
 invitation that we organize 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.680
 and it was good to invite teams of several 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.600
 surrounding states of the city ​​and it was 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.120
 very very pretty very attractive the place is 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.560
 precious is very safe and another of the 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.970
 things that can motivate people to 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.400
 participates is that this is extremely 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.900
 easy everyone we can have fun is 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.250
 very safe contrary to what people 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.170
 think about what you're going to give 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.490
 It's worse to stay in the 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.440
 pavement including accidents 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.060
 fatal in pavement thing that does not happen in 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.130
 the mountain 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.050
 somehow if after some 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.940
 hollows the technique then good already learn 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.040
 how is it healing 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.480
 a fall exactly I think it has 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.310
 also some functions of 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.750
 stimulation of the transmitters 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.120
 in the brain and it helps you be more 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.340
 creative you are healthier you are more 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.770
 propositive everyone we have less 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.450
 stress goes better something we have 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.610
 noticed that besides that we are doing well in 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.170
 the races are going well in school 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.940
 we do well at work and we are a 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.440
 group that if it is distinguished by the 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.840
 cycle that mountain biking has been 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.370
 common denominator then there will be 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.530
 that cheering up is not a lot of time 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.070
 you have to indicate at the beginning and 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.780

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.490
