00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
one is a little more runny than the

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.670 
one is a little more runny than the
cashmere<00:06:07.280> curl<00:06:07.580> jelly<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.900> that's<00:06:09.350> what<00:06:09.590> it

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
cashmere curl jelly and that's what it

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.680 
cashmere curl jelly and that's what it
looks<00:06:09.740> like<00:06:10.130> and<00:06:10.580> so<00:06:10.910> I'll<00:06:11.030> pour<00:06:11.300> a<00:06:11.330> little<00:06:11.510> bit

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
looks like and so I'll pour a little bit

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.460 
looks like and so I'll pour a little bit
on<00:06:11.900> my<00:06:12.050> finger<00:06:12.500> so<00:06:12.680> you<00:06:12.740> can<00:06:13.010> see<00:06:13.720> how<00:06:14.720> tacky<00:06:15.170> it

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
on my finger so you can see how tacky it

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.500 
on my finger so you can see how tacky it
is<00:06:15.650> it's<00:06:16.370> more<00:06:16.640> like<00:06:16.910> a<00:06:16.940> serum<00:06:17.900> sorry<00:06:18.830> styler

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
is it's more like a serum sorry styler

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.750 
is it's more like a serum sorry styler
rather<00:06:20.510> than<00:06:20.900> a<00:06:20.930> jail<00:06:21.380> so<00:06:22.130> it's<00:06:22.280> a<00:06:22.370> really

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
rather than a jail so it's a really

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.760 
rather than a jail so it's a really
really<00:06:22.910> light<00:06:23.240> whole<00:06:23.510> but<00:06:24.380> it<00:06:24.500> actually

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
really light whole but it actually

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.430 
really light whole but it actually
clumps<00:06:25.550> my<00:06:25.700> curls<00:06:26.120> really<00:06:26.390> really<00:06:26.810> well<00:06:27.020> but

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
clumps my curls really really well but

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.550 
clumps my curls really really well but
it<00:06:27.620> still<00:06:27.890> gives<00:06:28.190> you<00:06:28.400> the<00:06:28.430> big<00:06:29.090> volume<00:06:29.750> if<00:06:29.990> you

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
it still gives you the big volume if you

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.140 
it still gives you the big volume if you
choose<00:06:30.830> to<00:06:30.860> have<00:06:31.040> a<00:06:31.190> lot<00:06:31.430> of<00:06:31.460> volume<00:06:31.790> this<00:06:32.090> is

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
choose to have a lot of volume this is

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.300 
choose to have a lot of volume this is
what<00:06:32.480> I<00:06:32.510> definitely<00:06:33.230> used<00:06:33.530> if<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:33.890> was<00:06:34.040> looking

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
what I definitely used if I was looking

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.180 
what I definitely used if I was looking
for<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.520> lot<00:06:34.700> of<00:06:34.850> volume<00:06:35.120> and<00:06:35.840> then<00:06:36.680> I<00:06:36.710> think

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
for a lot of volume and then I think

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.399 
for a lot of volume and then I think
this<00:06:37.460> one<00:06:37.700> problem

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
this one problem

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.710 
this one problem
second<00:06:39.409> to<00:06:39.560> taming<00:06:40.069> and<00:06:40.580> then<00:06:40.879> this<00:06:41.180> gives<00:06:41.509> me

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
second to taming and then this gives me

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.350
