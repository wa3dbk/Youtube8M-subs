00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
turns it on or off and this the only

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.479 
turns it on or off and this the only

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
thing I had a bob said the speaker's was

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.460 
thing I had a bob said the speaker's was
this<00:01:01.670> battery<00:01:02.120> it's<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:03.339> was<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.460> 18<00:01:04.970> amp<00:01:05.210> hour<00:01:05.470> 12

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
this battery it's a was a 18 amp hour 12

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.280 
this battery it's a was a 18 amp hour 12
volt<00:01:06.680> battery<00:01:07.130> gel<00:01:07.399> self<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.060> doesn't

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
volt battery gel self so it doesn't

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.010 
volt battery gel self so it doesn't
strapped<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.470> with<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.799> tie<00:01:10.040> down<00:01:10.780> he<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.930> be

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
strapped in with the tie down he can be

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.039 
strapped in with the tie down he can be
tipped<00:01:12.259> outside<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.450> it'll<00:01:14.450> last<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:14.930> about

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
tipped outside and it'll last for about

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.800 
tipped outside and it'll last for about
six<00:01:15.380> hours<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.670> these<00:01:17.000> are<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.240> back<00:01:17.540> side

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
six hours and these are the back side

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.330 
six hours and these are the back side
speakers<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.649> don't<00:01:21.799> need<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.950> car

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
speakers and so you don't need a car

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.039 
speakers and so you don't need a car
stereo<00:01:22.490> deck<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:23.840> plays<00:01:24.170> straight

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
stereo deck you just this plays straight

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.889 
stereo deck you just this plays straight
from<00:01:27.049> iPod<00:01:27.439> right<00:01:27.740> into<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:29.149> amplifier<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:29.810> it

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
from iPod right into the amplifier so it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:30.969 
from iPod right into the amplifier so it
saves<00:01:30.079> a<00:01:30.140> lot<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.259> weight<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:30.649> there's<00:01:30.829> no

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
saves a lot of weight and there's no

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.010 
saves a lot of weight and there's no
need<00:01:31.369> for<00:01:31.399> a<00:01:31.610> deck<00:01:31.759> because<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.299> don't<00:01:32.450> play<00:01:32.689> CDs

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
need for a deck because I don't play CDs

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.749 
need for a deck because I don't play CDs
so<00:01:34.060> that's<00:01:35.060> pretty<00:01:35.240> much<00:01:35.420> it

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
so that's pretty much it

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.609 
so that's pretty much it
then<00:01:37.759> I<00:01:37.820> built<00:01:37.969> mine<00:01:38.240> kind<00:01:38.539> of<00:01:38.600> small<00:01:38.840> but<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
then I built mine kind of small but the

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.029 
then I built mine kind of small but the
handle<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.640> wanted<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.829> have<00:01:42.829> it<00:01:42.950> be

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
handle because I wanted to have it be

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.410 
handle because I wanted to have it be
really<00:01:43.250> portable<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:43.729> know<00:01:43.850> take<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:44.390> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
really portable you know take out a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.980 
really portable you know take out a
little<00:01:44.600> boat<00:01:44.899> there<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:47.420> know<00:01:47.509> it's<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.719> small

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
little boat there you know it's a small

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.020 
little boat there you know it's a small
boat<00:01:48.229> gets<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.009> flash<00:01:49.250> from<00:01:49.490> time<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.850> time

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
boat gets the flash from time and time

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.560 
boat gets the flash from time and time
and<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.270> didn't<00:01:50.479> want<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.899> wanted<00:01:51.439> a<00:01:51.500> waterproof

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.599 
and I didn't want I wanted a waterproof
stereo<00:01:53.570> sits<00:01:54.500> beside<00:01:54.680> me<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.430> have<00:01:55.549> to

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
stereo sits beside me and I have to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.389 
stereo sits beside me and I have to
worry<00:01:55.789> about<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.060> getting<00:01:56.210> wet<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.680> like<00:01:58.369> I

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
worry about it getting wet and like I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.889 
worry about it getting wet and like I
said<00:01:58.609> it's<00:01:58.729> play<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.179> players<00:01:59.420> really<00:01:59.630> loud

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
said it's play the players really loud

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.349 
said it's play the players really loud
too<00:02:00.200> loud<00:02:00.229> actually<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:00.979> amp<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.939> turned<00:02:02.240> all

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
too loud actually that amp is turned all

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.370 
too loud actually that amp is turned all
the<00:02:02.450> way<00:02:02.539> down<00:02:02.719> and<00:02:04.929> you<00:02:05.929> know<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.079> could<00:02:06.229> even

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
the way down and you know I could even

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.350 
the way down and you know I could even
have<00:02:06.500> smaller<00:02:06.829> amp<00:02:07.070> because<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.340> think<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:07.939> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
have smaller amp because I think if the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.300 
have smaller amp because I think if the
iPod<00:02:08.660> turned<00:02:08.929> all<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.110> way<00:02:09.229> up<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:09.920> thing<00:02:10.160> is

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.770 
there's a screw here and can it's in the
left<00:04:20.870> position<00:04:21.190> straight<00:04:22.190> up<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:22.430> down<00:04:22.750> right

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
left position straight up and down right

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.310 
left position straight up and down right
so<00:04:24.260> this<00:04:24.430> handle<00:04:25.430> obviously<00:04:25.789> rotates<00:04:26.320> three

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
so this handle obviously rotates three

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
so this handle obviously rotates three
different<00:04:27.530> positions<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.190> tractor<00:04:28.550> son

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
different positions the tractor son

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.160 
different positions the tractor son
and<00:04:29.640> it's<00:04:30.600> about<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:32.510> so<00:04:33.510> there<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.840> go

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
and it's about it so there you go

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.380 
and it's about it so there you go
that's
