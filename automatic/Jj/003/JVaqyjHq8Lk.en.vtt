00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello today we are going to make a delicious 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.480
 Japanese dessert that is filled with 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.280
 chocolate 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.259
 the main element that we are going to 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.970
 use is going to be rice flour 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.910
 glutinous 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.610
 to start we take a bowl and go to 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.980
 add hot water 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.980
 together with a little bit of oil 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.800
 and sweetener to taste and in this case I have 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.329
 used stevia but you can use sugar 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.100
 normal 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.100
 we also add milk 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.710
 and when we have it all we are going to add 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.710
 rice flour 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.690
 we are going to mix everything until 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.239
 let's have a fairly compact mass 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.239
 let's go putting thinner is needed 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.990
 then on a flat surface we are going to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.990
 take out all this mass 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 and we are going to knead it 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.180
 you see that it is a mass that does not stick 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.890
 when we have it right we will go 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.340
 dividing the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.940
 and we created some balls for later 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.940
 fill them 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.060
 once we have it, we are going to crush it 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.540
 and this is where we're going to introduce in 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.030
 this case the nutella 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.040
 and we are closing it by the edges 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.110
 and when everything is closed 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.250
 we go around 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.320
 as if we made meatballs 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.460
 when we prepared the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.430
 we reserve 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.690
 then on a plate with a little bit of 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.760
 oil or if you do not want no need 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.760
 let's go spreading the balls 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.080
 and we are also going to raise the fire 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.200
 when we have them on, we leave them 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.640
 about 34 minutes until they're 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.640
 golden on both sides 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.050
 we are moving it 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.890
 and when they are already transparent as 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.050
 you can see here you can already see the chocolate 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.530
 we can remove them to a plate 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.100
 as you see here you have the final result 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.380
 with all the chocolate undone 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.150
 I recommend that you do it and if it has 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.150
