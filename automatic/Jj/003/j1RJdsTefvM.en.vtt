what<00:01:43.510> you<00:01:43.810> just<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.350> is<00:01:44.620> about<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.280> minute<00:01:45.730> and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
what you just see is about a minute and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.270 
what you just see is about a minute and
a<00:01:45.940> half<00:01:45.970> with<00:01:46.570> nothing<00:01:47.020> removed<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.890> what<00:01:48.160> it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
a half with nothing removed of what it

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.070 
a half with nothing removed of what it
must<00:01:48.490> have<00:01:48.550> been<00:01:48.670> like<00:01:49.000> for<00:01:49.060> anyone<00:01:49.570> still<00:01:49.900> in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
must have been like for anyone still in

fraction of those in the original fire

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.650 
fraction of those in the original fire
and<00:02:00.190> they<00:02:00.760> would<00:02:00.940> have<00:02:01.000> been<00:02:01.120> contained

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
and they would have been contained

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.000 
and they would have been contained
inside<00:02:02.170> making<00:02:02.890> conditions<00:02:03.160> eaten<00:02:03.610> worse

inside the rig showed the death would
have<00:02:09.880> been<00:02:10.090> very<00:02:10.360> Swift<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.590> even<00:02:11.800> diluted<00:02:12.220> by

ten<00:02:12.670> times<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.270> they<00:02:13.390> might<00:02:13.570> have<00:02:13.690> been

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
ten times as they might have been

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.510 
ten times as they might have been
further<00:02:14.080> away<00:02:14.290> from<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> fire<00:02:14.890> they<00:02:15.400> were

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
further away from the fire they were

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.570 
further away from the fire they were
still<00:02:15.730> highly<00:02:16.270> dangerous<00:02:17.280> events<00:02:18.280> happened

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
still highly dangerous events happened

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.370 
still highly dangerous events happened
so<00:02:18.700> fast<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.270> we<00:02:19.540> need<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.720> look<00:02:19.930> at<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.170> film

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so fast that we need to look at the film

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.750 
so fast that we need to look at the film
in<00:02:20.530> slow<00:02:20.830> motion<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.400> fully<00:02:21.640> appreciate<00:02:21.820> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
in slow motion to fully appreciate it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.390 
in slow motion to fully appreciate it
but<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.880> all<00:02:25.090> there<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.600> see<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:27.100> spread<00:02:27.370> of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
but it all there to see the spread of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.800 
but it all there to see the spread of
flame<00:02:27.790> across<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.450> wall

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.320 

then<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.860> spontaneous<00:02:35.580> ignition<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:36.150> other

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
then the spontaneous ignition of other

00:02:36.330 --> 00:03:13.809 
then the spontaneous ignition of other
seats<00:02:36.630> as<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> fire<00:02:37.140> left<00:02:37.500> forward

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.149 

but<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.629> wasn't<00:03:14.810> only<00:03:15.049> fast<00:03:15.530> this

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
but it wasn't only fast this

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.280 
but it wasn't only fast this
investigation<00:03:16.999> showed<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.329> its<00:03:17.689> mechanism

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
investigation showed that its mechanism

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.429 
investigation showed that its mechanism
was<00:03:18.409> very<00:03:18.769> complex<00:03:19.629> standard<00:03:20.629> tests<00:03:21.139> alone

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
was very complex standard tests alone

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.720 
was very complex standard tests alone
could<00:03:21.680> never<00:03:21.920> have<00:03:22.099> established<00:03:22.340> what

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
could never have established what

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.489 
could never have established what
happened<00:03:23.060> because<00:03:23.389> they<00:03:23.749> were<00:03:23.810> interactions

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:24.499 
happened because they were interactions

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:30.089 
happened because they were interactions
between<00:03:24.650> all<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.159> various<00:03:25.549> components<00:03:26.090> a

comprehensive look at these interactions

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.240 
comprehensive look at these interactions
was<00:03:32.540> only<00:03:32.989> possible<00:03:33.170> by<00:03:33.530> using<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.980> wide
