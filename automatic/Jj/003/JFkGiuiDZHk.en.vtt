00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
will probably be on that area so it's

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.340

think about all these features so far we

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.940 
think about all these features so far we
still<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.480> date<00:02:48.660> for<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.290> hopefully

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
still have a date for it but hopefully

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.430

out<00:02:52.590> during<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.400> holidays<00:02:53.820> but<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.570> fact

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
out during the holidays but the fact
