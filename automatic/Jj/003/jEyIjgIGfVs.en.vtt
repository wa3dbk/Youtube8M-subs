00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.970
 and very raw welcome to her 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.869
 very well 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.500
 I did not have time 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.520
 here I bring you another video guys and this 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.380
 we are in chapter two of 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.480
 frei burning our parkour of 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.450
 sprint mode and we are on a map 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.490
 made by z carlos sainz eta a map that 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.650
 it is very very well done and very integrated 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.680
 to a topic that the sender has chosen 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.150
 man the world of on the portal at all 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.280
 that theme is what we're going to see in 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.870
 this map the truth that decoration 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.370
 It's great there you see a little 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.440
 coordinates where the subject of the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.940
 parkour if you download the map that you 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.070
 I remember leaving in the description for 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.300
 that you try it good guys we are going to 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.130
 analyze a little what the map is 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.900
 here we have a small box where we have 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.509
 our quick options to be able 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.880
 play it you know you just do not 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.680
 we took a sprint and we could move forward 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.330
 so it's the map in what is the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.800
 fast lap is not appreciated very well 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.300
 theme of decoration that is very 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.190
 worked on this map 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.440
 I finished the map more or less in 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.490
 46 seconds if I'm not wrong I hope that 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.100
 leave your time in the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.660
 comments and let's see a little bit the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.759
 decoration the issue of the output is 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.800
 made with blocks from the lower world with 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.690
 a face of creepers there is a zone of 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.030
 pretty simple parkour to start 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.200
 with black wool that is very good there for 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.510
 the air 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.760
 As you can see, we arrived at the first change of 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.739
 area here we have it with black wool 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.950
 also and combined with the girlfriend 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.390
 to give a spiral effect until the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.890
 face of a in there man in what is the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.360
 fast turn as I tell you it is not appreciated 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.220
 very good so let's see those 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.410
 great details that this map has 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.510
 they fixed the little face of lenderman that remains 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.790
 very well we fall from here here we have 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.440
 an entry with lence blocks even 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.750
 there are some blocks of what would be the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.459
 portal at the end and this already transports us 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.650
 let's say to the next area that they are 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.450
 stairs areas the truth that there 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.250
 areas that are quite simple but 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.099
 beware for this area guys that we have 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.569
 a small obsidian obstacle and a 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.130
 little bit of water that can stop us 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.319
 pretty good doing a little 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.870
 zig-zag can be passed and here we have 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.700
 a little parkour with water would tell you that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.860
 this first jump that we see here 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.299
 do not fall, do not jump because if not 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.040
 you are going to fall directly into the water here 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.959
 we passed and we dropped that would be the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.370
 small advice when you get to the next 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.140
 platform with a small jump 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.329
 we would reach this other area of 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.799
 stairs and be careful because we have 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.569
 also a water obstacle that we 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.670
 can brake quite a bit in the right area 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.190
 of those stairs now yes when 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.470
 we come to the end of that area we have 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.570
 a kind of water lift the subject 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.890
 of the exit of the elevator is in the 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.360
 left side so as we have seen 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.560
 in the fast lap I advise you that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.630
 put directly on the side 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.420
 left to be able to leave as soon as possible 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.040
 of the elevator in this direction is worth a 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.600
 once we get out of here I would recommend that 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.910
 You stop a little bit to go back to 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.130
 catch the sprint we would jump 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.020
 over here as you see these platforms 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.290
 they release potions that gives a very 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.820
 good to what is the race itself and not 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.240
 it has a lot of complication they are just 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.910
 two little jumps we fall to this area and this 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.140
 would be very well set this the portal 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.030
 when we can find in the 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.370
 you know strengths have seen 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.750
 example in the tutorial world an area 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.640
 like this the truth is very good 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.440
 done and there the end of the map that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.480
 it is below the water is very very very 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.220
 cool entering into what is the portal to 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.720
 we would arrive to the last area 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.240
 recommendation is that in this last 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.550
 drop us forward as we 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.530
 You can fall into the water I want to say 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.940
 well imagine that we come running if 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.170
 we are going forward not 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.820
 will give us time to react and we will fall 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.440
 in that area it's worth 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.810
 better we do not touch anything we fall in this 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.910
 area and we could already lay out the last 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.830
 three little jumps around here 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.200
 because there are also areas of water that we 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.240
 can slow down or even fall by 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.920
 these areas but making a small zig 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.200
 zag quite carefully you can spend 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.060
 easily worth here we would have what 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.340
 is the final part that says thank you for 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.470
 Play I wanted to send a little health aceta 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.030

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.130
 who sent us this map I hope that what 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.500
 enjoy guys I remind you that you have 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.150
