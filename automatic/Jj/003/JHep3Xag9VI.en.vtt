just one in one of these pods here and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.130 
just one in one of these pods here and
then<00:01:28.650> you'd<00:01:29.100> run<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> your<00:01:29.729> chest<00:01:30.140> over

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

then you'd run up to your chest over
here<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.880> open<00:01:33.299> them<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:34.110> would<00:01:34.229> be

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
here you open them and there would be

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.289 
here you open them and there would be
stuff<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.640> randomly<00:01:35.970> placed

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
stuff in there they get randomly placed

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.789 
stuff in there they get randomly placed
