00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.980
 Mario can do more than just jump'n'run that 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.860
 nintendo proved in 1993 with the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.900
 release of super mario kart in the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.639
 be super nintendo title clown mario 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 Brother Luigi and six others 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.960
 Contenders from the mint end and versus 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.359
 in go karts to bet the game becomes 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 have been a huge success fun racer ever since 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.710
 a very popular part of the racing game 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.539
 genre and so good us all previous ones 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.519
 We liked successors 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 no game as intriguing as the real one 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 super mario kart for months we go 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.910
 at that time in front of the tube we show 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.860
 you in the next few minutes why today 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 knows the game principle every five years 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.210
 At that time it totally hits us 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 unprepared eight cards boards over 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.110
 the route the drivers ignite with mushrooms 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.960
 and star the turbo throw themselves 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.360
 with banana peels or 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.980
 turtles armor 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.700
 Here I am with a red one 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.350
 armor still on square one violent 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.390
 such action a few meters before 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.180
 the finish line is what makes mario kart attractive 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.760
 and all that in a graphic 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.890
 somehow looks three-dimensional too 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.560
 if the engine technology only one 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.810
 skillful illusionist the driver 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.610
 Mario Kart play an important role 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.770
 Toni, for example, is very agile 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.660
 while big boobs was like a kit 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.850
 fast but are bad in the curve 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.310
 lie and a good curve is 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.440
 extremely important though the distances in the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.479
 Comparison to play modern mario kart 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.240
 look simple ask us everything 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.950
 off in browsers kassel for example can 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.580
 to hang on all sorts of corners 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.170
 stay 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.390
 that makes the fight for survival 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 tricky then we will not get under the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.340
 first four we lose an extra 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.380
 There are points for placements 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.119
 who in most of the four cups 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.100
 collects each one wins a pretty 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.930
 cup 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.530
 the 50 kubik class is just the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.020
 Beginning 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.290
 you follow the 100 and for whole 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.850
 die-hard the 150 class who is 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.680
 at these higher levels of difficulty 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.360
 he tries not only with 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.509
 precious metal but also with new ones 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.910
 Stretching rewards the last of the bonus 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.800
 stretch is the rainbow red she is 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.039
 the highlight and a very special one 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.039
 Challenge 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.000
 on the map below it looks like that 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.730
 not so complicated 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.099
 the rainbow runway has its time 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.049
 but not a single gang 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.849
 if then the cursed too 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.910
 stomping gray stones on the trail 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.040
 the nightmare is perfect for yourself 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.680
 strong allround driver like Mario makes 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.780
 Already the departure 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.299
 the royal discipline in super mario kart 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.370
 is of course the multiplayer mode 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.079
 because nothing is more fun than me 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.150
 human opponents really nice 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.819
 on the route to cable at 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.160
 finish then play partially 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.109
 dramatic scenes from here luigi with 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.840
 only a tenth of a second ahead 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.250
 Gruber on the pedestal 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.769
 that will be natural in front of the goggle 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.349
 extensively and celebrated with malicious joy 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.250
 even more intense are the duels in the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.680
 battle mode 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.040
 two human drivers are fighting in it 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.480
 my wife alice is closed 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.940
 Cooper on the bottom screen 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.010
 while more often smokes the band because 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.209
 But then I have targeted a red 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.400
 armor on the cap the revenge follows 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.769
 the foot or better the mature 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.310
 I position myself and ignite 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.440
 then I take the star in the visor 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.440
 cross your path and hit you 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.430
 About the meaning of super mario kart 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.720
 it takes for the world of video games 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.340
 not many words anymore 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.260
 the game has not only 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.180
 Sold a million times but also 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.739
 various successors for all 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.720
 get nintendo consoles 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.880
 the competition has become fun racer 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.130
 genre on the other hand, the teeth hatched 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.890
 at most diddy kong racing came on the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.340
 nintendo 64 in the neck at mario kart 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.980
 zoom 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.560
 but the original series is ultimately 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.840
 unbeatable and have been for ever 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.680
 super mario kart on the time-honored 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.680
 great nintendo
