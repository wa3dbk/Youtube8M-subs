people<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.110> Africa<00:01:24.530> twofold<00:01:25.310> one<00:01:25.550> I<00:01:25.730> think

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
people in Africa twofold one I think

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.580 
people in Africa twofold one I think
that<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.390> builds<00:01:26.540> awareness<00:01:27.080> people<00:01:27.440> put

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
that it builds awareness people put

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.200 
that it builds awareness people put
those<00:01:27.710> red<00:01:27.920> laces<00:01:28.130> on<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.880> begins<00:01:29.090> to

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
those red laces on and it begins to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.790 
those red laces on and it begins to
build<00:01:29.390> awareness<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:30.020> there<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:30.530> need

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
build awareness that there is this need

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.620 
build awareness that there is this need

and there is this pandemic and the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.940 
and there is this pandemic and the
