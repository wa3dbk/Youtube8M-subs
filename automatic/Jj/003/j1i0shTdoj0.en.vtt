00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
is going to get one flag on dusa land

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
is going to get one flag on dusa land
one<00:00:44.489> flag<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.000> vat<00:00:45.300> iraq<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.200> we're

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
one flag on vat iraq and then we're

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.139 
one flag on vat iraq and then we're
going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> roll<00:00:46.739> four<00:00:47.160> dice<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
going to roll four dice for all the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
going to roll four dice for all the
flags<00:00:48.329> i<00:00:48.480> currently<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.500> sol<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.920> on

flags i currently have on do sol and on

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
flags i currently have on do sol and on
any<00:00:50.489> role<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.000> 6<00:00:51.329> i'm<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.899> getting

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
any role of a 6 i'm going to be getting

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
any role of a 6 i'm going to be getting
another<00:00:52.649> flag<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> place<00:00:53.250> somewhere<00:00:53.520> adjacent

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
another flag to place somewhere adjacent

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.569 
another flag to place somewhere adjacent
to<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.660> existing<00:00:55.020> flags<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.070> let's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to one of my existing flags so let's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
to one of my existing flags so let's
take<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> look<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.360> happens<00:00:58.250> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
take a look and see what happens so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130 
take a look and see what happens so
starting<00:00:59.579> off<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.910> vat<00:01:00.149> iraq<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
starting off with vat iraq just going to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.020 
starting off with vat iraq just going to
place<00:01:01.320> an<00:01:01.469> additional<00:01:02.039> flag<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.969> there

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
place an additional flag right there

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
place an additional flag right there
just<00:01:03.600> adjacent<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> power<00:01:04.650> station<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
just adjacent to the power station and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.510 
just adjacent to the power station and
spaceport<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:07.170> over<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.890> sol<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
spaceport and over on do sol going to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.190 
spaceport and over on do sol going to
add<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.670> more<00:01:09.090> flag<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> head

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
add one more flag just going to head

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
add one more flag just going to head
right<00:01:10.560> back<00:01:10.740> towards<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> those<00:01:11.430> hive

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
right back towards one of those hive

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.550 
right back towards one of those hive
cities<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.080> i<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.380> back

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
cities and see if i can take it back

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.820 
cities and see if i can take it back
eventually<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:14.250> closer<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> because<00:01:16.710> i

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
eventually get closer to it so because i

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.710 
eventually get closer to it so because i
was<00:01:16.950> able<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> add<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.820> more<00:01:18.030> flag<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.509> here

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
was able to add one more flag on here

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140 
was able to add one more flag on here
that<00:01:18.900> does<00:01:19.080> grant<00:01:19.380> me<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:20.220> d6<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.939> roll

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that does grant me one more d6 to roll

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.660 
that does grant me one more d6 to roll
and<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.900> an<00:01:22.049> extra<00:01:22.320> chance<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.770> another<00:01:22.920> 6

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and just an extra chance at another 6

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.179 
and just an extra chance at another 6
plus<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> here's<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> 5d6<00:01:26.670> looking<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.450> 6<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
plus so here's the 5d6 looking for 6 is

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.420 
plus so here's the 5d6 looking for 6 is
not<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> single<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:30.439> now<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.280> couple

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
not a single one now I do have a couple

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.100 
not a single one now I do have a couple
spaceports<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.540> does<00:01:33.750> give<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:33.960> an

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
spaceports so that does give me an

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.170 
spaceports so that does give me an
option<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> move<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:34.979> flags<00:01:35.220> around<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.090> I'm

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
option to move some flags around so I'm

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.929 
option to move some flags around so I'm
going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> take<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.540> flag<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.579> moon<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
going to take one flag from the moon of

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
going to take one flag from the moon of
finet<00:01:39.299> right<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.619> move<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.040> on

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
finet right here and just move it up on

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.270 
finet right here and just move it up on
to<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.470> can<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> they're<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to I can do it they're just going to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.530 
to I can do it they're just going to
move<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> onto<00:01:44.700> VAT<00:01:45.030> Iraq<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.420> some

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
move it onto VAT Iraq for some

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:54.090 
move it onto VAT Iraq for some
reinforcements

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.279 

so<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.640> round<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.210> recap<00:01:56.719> we<00:01:57.020> solve

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
so there is the round to recap we solve

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.260 
so there is the round to recap we solve
lots<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.890> war<00:01:58.100> zone<00:01:58.280> apothic<00:01:58.729> there's<00:01:59.149> going

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
lots of war zone apothic there's going

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.789 
lots of war zone apothic there's going
to<00:01:59.329> be<00:01:59.359> lots<00:01:59.659> more<00:01:59.869> games<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.320> everyone

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
to be lots more games for everyone
