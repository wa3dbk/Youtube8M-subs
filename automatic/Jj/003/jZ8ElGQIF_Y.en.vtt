00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.900
 hello friends and welcome to another tuto 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 Tuesday today I brought you to the highs and I'm 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.000
 looking for a view to paint the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.940
 tutorial today here I'm skiing there 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.700
 cut this is not what I wanted 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.129
 teach my friends but it's okay 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.340
 because this tutorial is about tips for 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.340
 painting is not about how to ski 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:45.159
 and on a new day this is magnificent me 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.399
 they love the lights and shadows and the sky 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.399
 blue 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.280
 like new so much last night the snow is 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.280
 very soft 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 wonderful 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.030
 I'm going to stay here to do a 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.030
 sketch 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.250
 it will only be a quick sketch and I will take 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:17.759
 some photos to then do the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.759
 watercolor 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.150
 very well let's do it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.550
 we start by tracing the snow planes 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.550
 and then the mountains 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.000
 and clear 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.580
 and an indication of where the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.580
 arcs I do not put detail 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.480
 hit the notebook and mojo the sky what 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.100
 I turned around because I do not want the water to 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.100
 drain inside others 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.900
 first we wet the area where the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.000
 sky you see that it is a bit blue because 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.500
 the brush already has some paint 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.950
 when I was mixing it 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.910
 and now we apply the ass 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.910
 and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.930
 with absorbent paper we can make the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.790
 clouds and when it dries sufficiently 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.790
 we turn it back 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.150
 now we make the shadow of the mountain 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.190
 which is a blue gray or like the sun 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.520
 is back slightly towards the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.470
 left said some blank edges 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.990
 to indicate the reflection 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.010
 I'm using windsor watercolors to 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.960
 Newton on watercolor paper pair watercolor 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.030
 the complete list of materials the 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.020
 you can find in the information under 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.330
 the video 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.430
 I make some white spots because 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.690
 I want the trees have some 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.690
 snow on them 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.760
 do not 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.939
 we go back to wet the paper 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.770
 and when it dried a little and it's wet 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.710
 we can paint the shadows of the arcs 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.819
 I love this effect of painting over 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.189
 wet paper 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.780
 certainly the painting is going to be 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.780
 clearer when dry 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.650
 when I know we can reinforce them if 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.650
 we want 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.810
 we painted some small trees to the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.810
 remoteness 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:30.320
 i 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.320
 some pine trees a little closer 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.940
 and others even closer 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.789
 ah 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.419
 ah 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.060
 Now, this is fun 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.700
 When everything is dry, we wet the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.890
 paper again to remove the lines 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.100
 that sometimes are formed when the 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:21.260
 paint and to add some color with 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.260
 the effect that occurs on wet 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.810
 let's flip it one more time for 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.810
 reinforce the blue of the sky 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.570
 i 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.289
 all right 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.669
 i 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.669
 while we wait for it I know I'm going to 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.669
 continue painting head does not matter 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.400
 let's redo some of the details 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.450
 that could have been erased with the 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.450
 last wash 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.930
 to better give the effect of distance 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.960
 I feel we need something first 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.300
 flat and also to compensate all the 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.180
 empty space that is down to the 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.130
 right so he invented some twigs that 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.030
 they are not really in the landscape 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.790
 original very well I like 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:26.020
 and I'm going to darken the 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.020
 shadows nearby 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.980
 well it 's ready 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:43.510
 if you liked the ride please give it a like 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:46.680
 and subscribe to the channel and I'll see you 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.680
 next Tuesday
