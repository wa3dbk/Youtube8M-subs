00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Casarrubios del Monte Airfield, Toledo

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We are in the airfield of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Casarrubios del Monte which is the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
nearest private airfield to Madrid

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and with the greater number of operations

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In this airfield we have the biggest microlight

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
school of Spain

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we have a fleet of eight planes and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
now also we have

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
private pilot lessons

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which includes heavier planes

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The microlight lessons are

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the most basic way

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to learn how to fly

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It consists on between 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
fifteen and twenty-five  hours depending on

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the student. The age

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to accede to the lessons is from

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
sixteen years old, which is when is allowed to pilot

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to the age

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that a medical certificate allows you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You have to pass a test

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which consists on a electrocardiogram and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
a sight and a ear test

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It is a simple test

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The lessons consists on a theoretical part

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and a practice part. Both parts

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
are combined

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This means that as you do the theory

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
you also fly. Normally

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the lessons last three months and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in that time the student is qualified to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
fly alone, in fact the final exam

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
is done alone. The schedule of the lessons is very

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
flexible, the theoretical

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
part is imparted on weekends

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and the flight part can be any day

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of the week , we fly every day

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of the week at any hour

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
All the instructors have the licenses

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
they can have, from commercial pilot

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
transportation etc

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This allows the school to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
transmit that knowledge to the students

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Here mainly

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the approach is

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to do a very personalized monitoring to the student

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
because is what they want

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I work in a aeronautical company

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and I have always liked

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the fly matter

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and I want to try it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I live in Madrid and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
this is one of the nearest schools

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so I decided

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to take the lessons here

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I have passed the theory and now

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I am preparing the practical exam

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The learning is quite good

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Theory and practice are well combined

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and the instructors

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
are very nice. It is a little bit

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
hard because the dimensions

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
are different from driving a car but

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
little by little you learn and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
you are more secure

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
To touch down is very difficult

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the instructors insist very much on that

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
because is the most critical part

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but you just have to practice

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It is a very good experience

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I recommend everybody to do it and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to learn to fly

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
When the students finish the lessons

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
they ask us what do they should do

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They have some fear

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because they have the license so what do I do now?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Is it expensive or cheap?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Well, we have searched many solutions

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The one that has worked better

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is that some students join

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and they buy a plane

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And it is a solution

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that at the beginning didn't convinced the students but now it is working

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
very good. Other solution

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is to rent a plane of the school

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You don't have to buy a plane

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
but you can use the planes of the school

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
obviously they are supervise

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and you have to adjust yourself to the school schedules

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
but it is another

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
option which is also working

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And the third option is to buy a plane by yourself

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The average price

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is about 30.000 thousand euros

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The are second hand planes

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that cost around

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
20.000 euros and then

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
depending on the instrumentation, the finishing touch and the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
model there are prices to

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
140.000 euros. It is like

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the cars. There is a huge

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
variety. If you buy

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
a last model plane or car

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it is going to be more expensive

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The school microlight fleet is

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
of Tecnam

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and we have eight planes that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are from P-92

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to P-2002

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
These planes have shaken up the market

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
they are last generation planes

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
they have 100 horsepower

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
its cruising speed

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is about

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
118 miles per hour

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
which allows

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
us to move form Madrid to Alicante

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
in about just two hours.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
They are achievable planes

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
regarding the maintenance

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
The price of the lessons is about

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
2.000 euros

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which includes 15 flight hours

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the didactic material

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the manuals

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
manual tracking and the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
theoretical part during

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the time that the lessons last which is about three

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
months and a half. And the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
license of private

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
pilot which

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
allows to fly with heavier planes to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
5.000 kg 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
costs 5.800 euros

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It can be paid little by little

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
You can pay it as you want

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
regarding your convenience

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I invite every one to try

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
the feeling, in Spain

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
we are not used to the fact that someone pilots

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
because it is seeing as a exclusive activity

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So I encourage everyone to come here

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and try it

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
mainly if you are trying

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
to decide if you like it or not

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
if you would be able to pilot a plane

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
We have economic

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
spreading flights which

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
cost form 37 euros

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
15 minutes to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
100 euros per hour

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so you can have the feeling

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of freedom and

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
you can experiment how easy

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
is to pilot a plane

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:21.000
