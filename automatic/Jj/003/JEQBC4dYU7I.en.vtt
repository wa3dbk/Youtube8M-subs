rundown<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.359> my<00:00:06.870> solar<00:00:07.230> kit<00:00:07.580> I'd<00:00:08.580> be<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> little

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
rundown of my solar kit I'd be a little

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.250 
rundown of my solar kit I'd be a little
windy<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:09.360> we'll<00:00:09.480> see<00:00:09.599> how<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.780> goes

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
windy so we'll see how this goes

windy so we'll see how this goes
get<00:00:10.740> up<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.700> 150<00:00:12.210> watt<00:00:12.389> solar<00:00:12.870> panel

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
get up here have 150 watt solar panel

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.560 
get up here have 150 watt solar panel
that<00:00:14.070> was<00:00:14.580> really<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.179> well<00:00:15.360> especially

if<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.780> twig<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.500> this

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
if you get like a little twig on this

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.160 
if you get like a little twig on this
guy<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.640> over<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.149> say<00:00:38.719> it's<00:00:39.719> reduce<00:00:40.020> by

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
guy like over like say it's reduce by

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.440 
guy like over like say it's reduce by
70%<00:00:40.530> any<00:00:41.190> type<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.520> shade<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> panel<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
70% any type of shade on that panel and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.610 
70% any type of shade on that panel and
completely<00:00:44.719> completely<00:00:45.719> mess<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> power

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
completely completely mess up the power

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
completely completely mess up the power
coming<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.640> can't<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.180> but

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
coming in you can't see it right now but

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639 
coming in you can't see it right now but
underneath<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> cord<00:00:49.410> running

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
of my I GoPros but my solar controller

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.250 
of my I GoPros but my solar controller
up<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.520> they<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:12.030> power<00:01:12.360> solar

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
up here it is they go power solar

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.109 
up here it is they go power solar
controller<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:13.950> basically<00:01:14.490> transfer<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
controller these basically transfer the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.730 
controller these basically transfer the
power<00:01:15.299> from<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> solar<00:01:15.990> panel<00:01:16.350> coming<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
power from the solar panel coming in

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.890 
power from the solar panel coming in
down<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> batteries<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.450> batteries<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
down to the batteries the batteries I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560 
down to the batteries the batteries I
have<00:01:19.080> stored<00:01:19.320> under<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570

solar kits and they've worked really
well<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:38.759> charging<00:01:39.090> my<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.810> laptop

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
well right now I'm charging my my laptop

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.760 
well right now I'm charging my my laptop
and<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.960> thirteen<00:01:42.960> point<00:01:43.200> six<00:01:43.380> amps

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and I have thirteen point six amps

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.319 
and I have thirteen point six amps
whenever<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> laptop<00:01:44.610> isn't<00:01:45.000> plugged<00:01:45.119> in

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
whenever the laptop isn't plugged in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.569 
whenever the laptop isn't plugged in
like<00:01:45.509> earlier<00:01:45.780> dave<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.229> reading<00:01:46.590> 14<00:01:47.009> point<00:01:47.280> 6

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
like earlier dave is reading 14 point 6

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.510 
like earlier dave is reading 14 point 6
so<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.780> has<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> lot<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> power<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.189> particular

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
so it has a lot of power this particular

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.499 
so it has a lot of power this particular
solar<00:01:50.880> controller<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.720> shows<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:53.329> get<00:01:54.329> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
solar controller it shows you get this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.770 
solar controller it shows you get this
lined<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.790> batteries<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> higher<00:01:57.450> percent

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
lined up so batteries a higher percent

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.190 
lined up so batteries a higher percent
charge<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:59.299> 2.5<00:02:00.299> amps<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.780> coming<00:02:01.079> in

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
charge right now 2.5 amps is coming in

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130 
charge right now 2.5 amps is coming in
from<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> from<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> solar<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.869> reason

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
from the from the solar and the reason

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.830 
from the from the solar and the reason
why<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.380> only<00:02:04.439> two<00:02:04.649> point<00:02:04.860> five<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.250> because

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
why it's only two point five is because

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.620 
why it's only two point five is because
it's<00:02:06.840> full

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
it's full

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.930 
it's full
shows<00:02:08.870> the<00:02:09.200> complete<00:02:09.650> readout<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.700> pretty

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
shows the complete readout so pretty

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.910 
shows the complete readout so pretty
