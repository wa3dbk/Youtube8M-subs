00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.569
 another of the options we have today when making collections 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.030
 smart 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.940
 percent and mono image that equips an intelligent collection allows 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.660
 the step is full of love called we shut up that formerly as 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.279
 portfolio 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.880
 and these predefined settings that we already have 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 we want you to keep 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.159
 as predefined to apply it aoc dexter intelligent collections and kill it 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.730
 other any other catalog 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.960
 then it gives us the option to follow the right button does not say sport 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.150
 adn settings of the smart collection if I give you to accept us 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.420
 it opens 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.750
 in box and wolf where they tell me where he wants us to keep those 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 settings 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.420
 the settings 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.370
 of the smart collections in my case I'll save it right there 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.080
 oppose 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.240
 common guard 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.240
 in the portfolio by the way 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 predefined fair 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.150
 the citizenship 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 let's read 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.340
 not then and we already have this is due to portfolio adjustments 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.350
 saved sciara would like 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.850
 percent applicable these adjustments to any other 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.009
 another question to the ceremony 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.320
 simply what I would have to do is 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.820
 percent of the right button I made 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.650
 im 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.520
 tadeu smart collection settings 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.210
 read more here we had looked for a day had saved before ss adjustments 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.260
 I made portfolio adjustment 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.900
 it is due to whom 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.450
 and I tell him matter 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 liberman would matter 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.320
 I'll do it but we know that sidor we bequeath there would 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.510
 this as for export import of some adjustments 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.010
 small or two we want to save for in the future use it in any other 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.120
 other things so important that we can do with collections both in the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.119
 smart 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.209
 as normal the general 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.340
 to import 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.909
 all at school like a catalog this is important after the tumult 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.309
 especially to problems in the world 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.799
 and we every time our catalog for one hundred 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.820
 momentarily to 90no 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.590
 until we get to a time when we have too many photos of your operating system 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.139
 our ram memory 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.070
 percent 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.840
 is no longer able to support as many images as in my case I have 30 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.290
 milligrams less brave to each subject rather memory 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.039
 no government 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:44.849
 if we already have in a collection suppose 10 thousand photos and the requirement 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.119
 moss percent and imported be 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.939
 bring to another catalog endowed to manage another independent tied that 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.249
 way we have a catalog 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:56.949
 a photo is determined 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.659
 of 10 thousand photos and the other catalog 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.309
 jeter we would do the the 20 thousand remaining not then another one of the options that 9 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.259
 lets I am affirming that I have 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.960
 this collection and the columbretes 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.639
 yes today to the right button 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.909
 of g exporting this collection as a catalog you see it here is not something 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.229
 had happened in two 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.969
 cruise as I want to be called this new catalog 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.229
 the defeat to a new catalog disappeared 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.489
 I did not say 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.499
 Negative export includes the prizes available 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.719
 This means, he says, that it is a catalog of 70 photos and that 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:34.529
 usual 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.939
 and here yes I select this 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.249
 what it does is catch all the negative of genoa gold original photos 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.149
 and they are already attending where this catalog will create me 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:49.539
 and also include the available buts say sc those thumbnail image 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.989
 I think 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.370
 When we import the images, it will also be carried there in such a way 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.059
 that already had a catalog 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.629
 with the images with the negative and with the real estate 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.449
 if you were not injured in stock that is going to happen 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.099
 who will I care 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.550
 this Catalan is going to export this catalog to a new place 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.659
 but the original images 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.789
 lab has kept in the same place where they were right now 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.900
 in such a way that I do not think it's the most 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.840
 appropriate faith 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.640
 on the part of the illusion in a problem because a day of the week or a site 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.090
 to another for him is indifferent kan in ours I think it's a little 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.610
 well I'm not going to 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.889
 to export this catalog was simply at the level of explanation that we know 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.030
 that all the options we have is to export any collection of those 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.960
 we have 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.740
 a new catalog
