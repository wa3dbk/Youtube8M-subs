and now let's take a look at it as I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.219 
and now let's take a look at it as I
unpackage<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.969> these<00:01:26.299> figures<00:01:26.780> are<00:01:26.869> not<00:01:26.930> that

problem with these toys I mean but these

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.330 
problem with these toys I mean but these
