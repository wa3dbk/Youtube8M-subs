 recalls to do on what we have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.359
 seen today including the adam record 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.840
 apt we said it was a succession 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.760
 of emotions to see the comparison first 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.890
 with the European record and then the comparison 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
 with the world record lost 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.510
 also the German graphics do not exist 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.059
 they didn't even believe their loans 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.820

 number 6 to 100 meters 48 and 70 62 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 cents worse than Russia that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.590
 competes in three lanes in the middle so 4 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.189
 for the dashboard lane 5 for Turkey 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 change to 0 17 Russia after Greece 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.040
 also the Russians with two men 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.689
 in the first two fractions russia that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.159
 try to make the most of the train 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.250
 composed to men will also have one 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.040
 big and pop or in the third fraction and them 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 they will no doubt try to leave and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.450
 French who resist in a pair of 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.329
 sprinters that have not been deployed 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.280
 in the individual test million and bad 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.290
 moro game that confirms his 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.040
 difficulty and Italy that passed in 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.390
 high and for the podium we see how it goes to 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 finish for now we are in at first 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.800

 to the final of the 100 freestyle 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.550
 despite the labors confirms one 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.850
 condition that allows him to obtain 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.820
 a decent time in the tub for us there is 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.280
 erika ferraioli well the change to 0 15 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.510
 for now we're doing pretty well 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.460
 25 86 to the turn of its 50 meters well 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.220
 Russia as anticipated with veronica 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.220
 really proves a great test from 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.110
 part both reduced and of veteran Leonards 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.870
 very shortly from the individual race 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.720
 they responded in the best way 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.460
 better than fresh Russians and today they are not 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.650
 entered the water ferraioli still 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.020
 in front of him a big test on his part 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.000
 italy still in command france ha 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.210
 never very detached we play with the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.520
 Russia in exchange is fine 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.130
 time at 0 20 so it should be 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.740
 all regular for the bosses of 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.100
 blue jade relay galizi last 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.680
 fraction if he sees it against the Russian 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.750
 nesterova in courses at number 4 there is the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.000
 dangerous France trying to 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.220
 recover with still there baldi 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.140
 Turkey is out of the game we are 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.930
 on the pony you have to see which one 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.030
 medal we are going to take 65 watts and of 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.570
 advantage over russia with a big one 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.520
 formerly a worker fraction of 53 83 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.130
 jade galizi that is responding 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.040
 very well with the acceleration of the redheads 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.430
 in low Italy towards the title 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.650
 jade Galician to 20 meters from the end 15 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.660
 meters from the end of 10 hour Italy to the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.030
 command is the recovery attempt 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.700
 great speed of the machata russia 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.140
 can hold we take the medal 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.330
 gold 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.880
 European record because we improve the 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:41.000
 time limit that had been established for 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.050
 this primacy 3 29 and 10 the limit 3 25 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.180
 is 0 2 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.480
 for the blue relay that is also 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.010
 Italian record because it is better in the three 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.980
 20700 established by the federation 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.709
 we opened the day with gold and the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.800
 we close the step again 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.800
 silver on the podium for Russia 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.250
 and the bronze for france is one 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.980
 beautiful proof that rewards the self 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.989
 we want speed growth 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.230
 Italian in this European championship 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.730
 always under the eye of the storm i 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.410
 males who struggled to 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.940
 find a dimension after being 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.669
 been one of the strongest 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.290
 actually in the world about speed and here 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.480
 in europe they found themselves both as 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.320
 team both at the individual level and the 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.850
 women who have done a wonderful job 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.970
 breakthrough 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.500
 there is great balance on the part of 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.540
 inside the blue team ono 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.150
 women and as we have seen in this 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.130
 relay itself is true is a title if 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.320
 you want a first time is a race that is 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.210
 many have been underestimated with solo 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.490
 four teams but we could 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.270
 Russia and France the best of the best in 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.940
 this discipline 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.919
 and then there would be so many stories from 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.100
 tell of our blue you think 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.430
 to the jade fable galizi was not 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.710
 not even sure of being called for 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.800
 the European selected at the last second 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.200
 if you pass it the term goes away with 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.930
 two medals one of produces a gold in 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.660
 relay race with a European record 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.540
 in short, it's my age from daddy 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.630
 while we're at it and above all with one 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:20.510
 remarkable performance series today over 78 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:22.810
 78 product 48 01 for leonards 50 33 a 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.919
 beautiful fraction of erika ferrari 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.169
 noli the one that determined the 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.260
 advantage of the Italy and then jade 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:36.160
 galizi which is closed with a brilliant 54 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.560
 and the Azzurri are really very good there 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.490
 they believed in this relay too 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.510
 all here is Italy 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.650

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.210
 leonardi jade galizi and erika ferraioli 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.370
 and for the satisfaction, close with one 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.160
 gold medal after that of gregorio 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.800
 paltrinieri in opening also the 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.110
 freshman ta jade galizi to one 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.490
 hair that gold is though 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.590
 fm radio shades became green 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.070
 evil smiles more and more from day to 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.740
 day 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.950
 it was an incredible championship for 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.290
 she from the playoff of the first morning 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:22.110
 and then a scholar with satisfaction 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.990
 contained and leonardi with day from 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.290
 memorable 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.840
 to put on the notice board is a this is a 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.260
 grande is a great quartet beyond 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.350
 a new test and therefore always a little 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:39.080
 open and if we want easier respect 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.500
 at the other European races this grand 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.500
 nice sign
