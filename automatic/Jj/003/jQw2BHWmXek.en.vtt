00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.110

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.680

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.090
 wandmixer take no problem with the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.100
 use days like today 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.619
 Let's start with the first shift we 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.189
 Take mango and yogurt I have now 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.700
 in it 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.649
 mango and one and a half tablespoons 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.780
 greek yogurt the whole now 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.880
 first mixed the first layer is 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.789
 already finished and you need at all 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.899
 no extra sweetheart since nobody 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:01.069
 really very mature 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:02.569
 I want that now down here for 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.810
 the second layer you need yours 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:09.440
 then tied a tablespoon of Greek 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.709
 yoghurt again about 40 milliliters 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.709
 milk 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.160
 so also the second layer is now 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:31.060
 finished that is actually pretty fix 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:33.490
 for the time being here for the third and third 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.160
 last shift he needs yours now 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.500
 Heath learn and another two 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.930
 tablespoons of Czech yogurt eight times 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.550
 now everything is pure then I have also 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.550
 once gone and it works 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.580
 and so the day can start great 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.570
 they are delicious or and it tastes good 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.040
 also really tasty 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.050
 I will definitely do it now 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.380
 take away climate on the go, these are 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 which ones are there, among other things 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.780
 at star wars 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.880
 if you do not have those fruits there anymore 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.680
 can you take what you want that is 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.290
 the good 1 mode just takes what you 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.240
 there just got something to go home and 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.220
 used if you do not milk milk 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.400
 I just take coconut water away 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.600
 For example, you are also super happy you can 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.910

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.940

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.660

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.160

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.320
