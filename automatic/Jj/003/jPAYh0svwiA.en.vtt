00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
do the double planking in the front end

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.060 
do the double planking in the front end
of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> airplane<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.649> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of the airplane which is a kind of a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.010 
of the airplane which is a kind of a
step<00:00:41.370> which<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.660> take<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
step which is really going to take the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
step which is really going to take the
beating<00:00:43.730> landing<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:46.950> we'll<00:00:47.280> cover

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
beating landing and and then we'll cover

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.940 
beating landing and and then we'll cover
it<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.079> recovering<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> wing<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.620> starting

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it and recovering the wing is starting

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
it and recovering the wing is starting
to<00:00:50.010> cover<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> wings<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.750> hope<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
to cover the wings now and we hope to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
to cover the wings now and we hope to
have<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.289> ready<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> fly<00:00:52.949> next<00:00:53.789> next

away it's coming along right now and the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
away it's coming along right now and the
proof<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> pudding<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.650> get

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
proof of the pudding will be when we get

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.030 
proof of the pudding will be when we get
all<00:01:08.010> done<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> 3,000<00:01:10.530> pound<00:01:10.740> weight

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
all done is it in the 3,000 pound weight

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
all done is it in the 3,000 pound weight
plus<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.790> minus<00:01:12.090> area<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.020> what

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
plus or minus area because that's what

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
plus or minus area because that's what
the<00:01:13.439> published<00:01:14.130> weight<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> original<00:01:15.330> one

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the published weight of the original one

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.370 
the published weight of the original one
in<00:01:15.530> 1914<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:18.299> thing<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.990> guess<00:01:19.200> I've

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
in 1914 was the thing I I guess I've

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.620 
in 1914 was the thing I I guess I've
mentioned<00:01:19.619> before<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> difference

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
mentioned before that just a difference

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
mentioned before that just a difference
between<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.530> earlier<00:01:22.890> airplanes

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
between this and the earlier airplanes

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
between this and the earlier airplanes
is<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.180> they're<00:01:24.330> ready<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> cross<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> North

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
is here they're ready to cross the North

Atlanta
kind<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.710> just<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:27.070> few<00:01:27.310> years<00:01:27.520> after<00:01:27.820> they

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
kind of just a few years after they

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.920 
kind of just a few years after they
learn<00:01:28.300> how<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.480> get<00:01:29.200> up<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.500> here<00:01:29.530> at<00:01:29.860> all<00:01:30.040> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
learn how to get up in here at all and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.000 
learn how to get up in here at all and
maybe<00:01:31.930> there's<00:01:32.230> a<00:01:32.290> question<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.740> some

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
maybe there's a question in some

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.190 
maybe there's a question in some
people's<00:01:33.370> mind<00:01:33.640> whether<00:01:33.930> would<00:01:34.930> have<00:01:35.050> made

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
people's mind whether would have made

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.660 
people's mind whether would have made
the<00:01:35.380> distance<00:01:35.770> from<00:01:35.920> Newfoundland<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.580> the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
the distance from Newfoundland of the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.510 
the distance from Newfoundland of the
Azores<00:01:37.090> but<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:38.410> certainly<00:01:38.680> lifted<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.280> fuel

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
Azores but it certainly lifted the fuel

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.790 
Azores but it certainly lifted the fuel
load<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.940> do<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:41.050> that's<00:01:41.290> kind<00:01:41.620> of<00:01:41.650> what

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
load to do it so that's kind of what

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.560 
load to do it so that's kind of what
we're<00:01:41.979> going<00:01:42.220> on<00:01:42.460> we're<00:01:42.970> not<00:01:43.120> going<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.450> let

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
we're going on we're not going to let

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.600 
we're going on we're not going to let
these<00:01:43.750> guys<00:01:44.050> take<00:01:44.410> it<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.860> Azores<00:01:45.400> for

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
these guys take it to the Azores for

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.730 
these guys take it to the Azores for
nuclear<00:01:46.000> even<00:01:46.690> though<00:01:46.750> Lee<00:01:46.930> wants<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.290> do<00:01:47.500> that

than<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.119> original<00:01:52.150> pilots<00:01:53.020> but<00:01:53.200> once<00:01:53.500> we<00:01:53.650> got

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
than the original pilots but once we got

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.580 
than the original pilots but once we got
the<00:01:54.180> aligning<00:01:55.180> jig<00:01:55.540> out<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.960> way<00:01:56.110> that's

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
the aligning jig out of the way that's

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.230 
the aligning jig out of the way that's
what<00:01:56.800> I'm<00:01:56.950> noticing<00:01:57.250> here<00:01:57.820> we're<00:01:58.060> going<00:01:58.149> to

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
what I'm noticing here we're going to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240 
what I'm noticing here we're going to
have<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.570> bar<00:01:58.780> with<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> control<00:01:59.740> wheels<00:01:59.979> on<00:02:00.220> it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
have the bar with a control wheels on it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.630 
have the bar with a control wheels on it
and<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.750> feels<00:02:02.020> very<00:02:02.170> roomy<00:02:02.770> actually<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:03.399> here

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
and it feels very roomy actually in here

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.540 
and it feels very roomy actually in here
and<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:05.020> think<00:02:05.740> what

also it's nice being inside yeah it's
out<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.170> weather<00:02:36.319> you've<00:02:36.530> been<00:02:36.650> flying

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
out of the weather you've been flying

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.559 
out of the weather you've been flying
the<00:02:37.010> rain<00:02:37.280> that's<00:02:37.730> retraction<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.269> but

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
the rain that's retraction so it but

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.140 
the rain that's retraction so it but
it's<00:02:42.379> going<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:42.799> very<00:02:43.220> good<00:02:43.760> i'm<00:02:43.879> looking

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
it's going to be very good i'm looking

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.900 
it's going to be very good i'm looking
forward<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.599> think<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.840> will<00:02:44.900> be<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:45.079> big<00:02:45.910> slow

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
forward I think it will be a big slow

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.400 
forward I think it will be a big slow
and<00:02:47.359> stable<00:02:47.930> aircraft<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:50.000> will<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.720> very<00:02:50.930> nice

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
and stable aircraft it will be very nice

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.839 
and stable aircraft it will be very nice
to<00:02:51.470> fight<00:02:52.840> because<00:02:53.840> why<00:02:54.260> I'm<00:02:54.829> delighted<00:02:55.459> with

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
to fight because why I'm delighted with

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.069 
to fight because why I'm delighted with
the<00:02:55.940> amount<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.180> shoulder<00:02:56.510> room<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.810> we<00:02:56.900> have

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
the amount of shoulder room that we have

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.000 
the amount of shoulder room that we have
in<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.470> leg<00:02:57.980> room<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.409> pretty

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
in here leg room it's it's pretty

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.530 
in here leg room it's it's pretty
comfortable<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.609> I<00:03:01.640> think<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:01.970> will<00:03:02.060> fly<00:03:02.299> like

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
comfortable and I think it will fly like

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.000 
comfortable and I think it will fly like
it<00:03:02.659> looks<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.140> think<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.680> will<00:03:03.739> be<00:03:03.859> a<00:03:03.890> little

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
it looks I think it will be a little

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.530 
it looks I think it will be a little
heavy<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.549> think<00:03:04.730> it'd<00:03:04.819> be<00:03:04.849> very<00:03:04.970> stable

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
heavy but I think it'd be very stable

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.839 
heavy but I think it'd be very stable
and<00:03:07.090> certainly<00:03:08.090> will<00:03:08.930> be<00:03:09.079> secure<00:03:09.859> inside<00:03:10.250> oh

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
and certainly will be secure inside oh

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.740 
and certainly will be secure inside oh
yeah<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.640> it's<00:03:13.640> going<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:13.909> be<00:03:14.030> great<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.510> think

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
yeah and it's going to be great I think

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.860 
yeah and it's going to be great I think
it<00:03:14.870> will<00:03:14.930> handle<00:03:15.260> very<00:03:15.470> very<00:03:15.709> well<00:03:16.720> we<00:03:17.720> were

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
it will handle very very well we were

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.030 
it will handle very very well we were
looking<00:03:18.290> at<00:03:18.459> things<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:19.609> wing<00:03:20.030> loading

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
looking at things like wing loading

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.259 
looking at things like wing loading
compared<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.130> other<00:03:22.280> airplanes<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.090> this

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
compared to other airplanes and this

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.150 
compared to other airplanes and this
one's<00:03:23.480> got<00:03:23.630> less<00:03:23.930> than<00:03:23.959> five<00:03:24.470> pounds<00:03:24.950> per

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
one's got less than five pounds per

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
the weight of 3,000 pounds it's twice as

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.420 
the weight of 3,000 pounds it's twice as

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
update line comparison I think it's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.180 
update line comparison I think it's
straight<00:03:50.299> lines<00:03:50.540> right<00:03:50.870> with<00:03:51.139> the<00:03:51.379> with<00:03:52.160> the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
straight lines right with the with the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.909 
straight lines right with the with the
volleyball<00:03:52.910> for<00:03:53.569> weight<00:03:53.780> which<00:03:54.470> flew<00:03:54.739> very

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
volleyball for weight which flew very

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.789 
volleyball for weight which flew very
well<00:03:55.160> which<00:03:55.400> slow<00:03:55.790> real<00:03:56.030> well<00:03:56.269> yeah<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:57.440> this

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
well which slow real well yeah and this

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.939 
well which slow real well yeah and this
will<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.190> since<00:03:59.120> it's<00:03:59.269> got<00:03:59.449> the<00:03:59.599> bigger

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
will be just since it's got the bigger

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.710 
will be just since it's got the bigger
wingspan<00:04:00.949> on<00:04:01.160> 72<00:04:01.730> feet<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.359> it<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.599> will<00:04:02.660> be

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
wingspan on 72 feet of it it will be

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.740 
wingspan on 72 feet of it it will be
much<00:04:03.079> more<00:04:03.290> stable<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.150> steady<00:04:05.150> with<00:04:05.480> two

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
much more stable and steady with two

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.099 
much more stable and steady with two
engines<00:04:05.980> even<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.099> close<00:04:07.250> as<00:04:07.519> they<00:04:07.699> are<00:04:08.109> it

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
engines even as close as they are it

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.230 
engines even as close as they are it
adds<00:04:09.319> stability<00:04:09.530> to

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
adds stability to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.020 
adds stability to
so<00:04:11.770> as<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.040> said<00:04:13.100> I'm<00:04:13.430> really<00:04:13.640> looking<00:04:14.000> forward

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
so as I said I'm really looking forward

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.100 
so as I said I'm really looking forward
to<00:04:14.390> finding<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:14.960> is<00:04:15.230> Lee<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:16.459> Lee<00:04:17.270> also<00:04:17.480> be

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
to finding it so is Lee and Lee also be

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.070 
to finding it so is Lee and Lee also be
an<00:04:18.200> aircraft<00:04:18.650> commander<00:04:19.480> at<00:04:20.480> points<00:04:20.930> he'll

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
an aircraft commander at points he'll

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.190 
an aircraft commander at points he'll
fly<00:04:21.320> himself<00:04:21.590> as<00:04:21.980> well
