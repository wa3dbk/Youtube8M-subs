00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
washers that's one of them's concave and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.730 
washers that's one of them's concave and
one<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.700> them's<00:02:34.820> convex<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.080> ball<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.650> a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
one of them's convex like a ball in a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.100 
one of them's convex like a ball in a
socket<00:02:37.040> like<00:02:37.400> your<00:02:37.580> joint<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.690> then<00:02:38.900> that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
socket like your joint and then that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.870 
socket like your joint and then that
moves<00:02:39.440> accordingly<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.460> we'll<00:02:40.580> get<00:02:40.700> into

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
moves accordingly and we'll get into

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880 
moves accordingly and we'll get into
that<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.330> minute<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.230> sandwich<00:02:42.710> the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
that in a minute and you sandwich the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.720 
that in a minute and you sandwich the
break<00:02:43.100> in<00:02:43.370> between<00:02:43.760> those<00:02:44.060> two<00:02:44.330> right<00:02:44.570> there

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
break in between those two right there

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.580 
break in between those two right there
so<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.850> have<00:02:46.910> one<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.570> ball<00:02:47.810> facing<00:02:48.170> in

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
so you have one that's a ball facing in

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.920 
so you have one that's a ball facing in
one<00:02:48.950> that's<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.280> ball<00:02:49.490> facing<00:02:49.760> out<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.240> convex

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
one that's a ball facing out a convex

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
one that's a ball facing out a convex
and<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> convex<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.160> then<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.150> break<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
and a convex and then the break in the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.750 
and a convex and then the break in the
middle<00:02:54.110> for<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.500> break<00:02:54.770> sandwich<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.520> then<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
middle for the break sandwich and then a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.670 
middle for the break sandwich and then a
washer<00:02:56.240> on<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.480> outside<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.200> nut<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.650> hold

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
washer on the outside and a nut to hold

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.680 
washer on the outside and a nut to hold
everything<00:02:58.400> all<00:02:58.580> day<00:02:58.790> nice<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.510> tidy
