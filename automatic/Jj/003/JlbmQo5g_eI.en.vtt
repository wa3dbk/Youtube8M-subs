00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.210

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.099
 yes how is life without s oh it is 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 too quiet zoom lens very quiet like that 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.820
 simply there 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.809
 children's parties it's just in the air 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.150
 also the little bit in the difficult 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.539
 does it can i just sit and sx-5 it 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.130
 stuff between things i got from here 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.840
 he is actually in princess i got there 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 I literally about three minutes play 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.490
 went in princess 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.399
 it's easy play this jesus me 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 have a golden star but without dennis 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.070
 god says and looks with his food there 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.350
 I think for CuraÃ§ao or in Barbados 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 and normally if dennis would go away in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
 a production time the audience a bit 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.710
 so cucumber time is like a house after it 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.379
 new year then we can deduce 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 yes that's why we just do that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.410
 time to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.410
 and a CD player 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.470
 with a trot yourself you have to say that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 I do not mega nice drive 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.880
 all it is us that literally 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.830
 just go to child better is also reasonable 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530
 according to my other I am going just as well 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.610
 if you were a girl amateur would be faster 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.000
 be allowed to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.409
 more precisely between a second yes it did 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.040
 I do not know 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.280
 oh how would we now have 585 seconds 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.860
 now what i want no idea wholeheartedly 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.869
 my own color 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.049
 well then you and your die from the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 not to read for politics but to be 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.369
 It is only these games that are these games and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.290
 he can all think in every way 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.200
 do challenges and with those challenges 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.020
 can you be a 100 remix 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.509
 we would be difficult issues 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.180
 remix albert this what this football club 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.770
 these are your response 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.310
 indeed much the more difficult versions 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.130
 of fire you just change oh 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.289
 with the labor sailing suit in the west dennis 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.369
 is not yet for me for my me 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.289
 not even with it nor with it 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.509
 agree then maybe it will know how 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.780
 long i do n't even have movement 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.399
 from air and water to it is we have 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.510
 now the time to chill things up 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.920
 maybe that is also secretly 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.480
 because Dennis didn't even know it was just there 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.890
 can chill 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.060
 that we have one that we normally like if they take them 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.590
 we didn't even think it was that busy 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.239
 but we just don't have it there 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.549
 can chill because dennis shifts 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.650
 and other than sleep you may be different 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.630
 well again mission counter dennis yes come quickly 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.630
