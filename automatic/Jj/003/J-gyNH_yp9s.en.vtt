00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
perfectly blood like this is the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.550 
perfectly blood like this is the
blackest<00:02:06.100> anything<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.270> own<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:08.140> problem<00:02:08.440> is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
blackest anything I own the problem is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.900 
blackest anything I own the problem is
is<00:02:08.800> when<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.009> put<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.220> in<00:02:09.310> their<00:02:09.399> lips<00:02:09.640> and

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
is when you put it in their lips and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.580 
is when you put it in their lips and
because<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.570> move<00:02:10.780> your<00:02:10.960> lips<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.260> lot<00:02:11.380> it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
because you move your lips a lot it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.130 
because you move your lips a lot it
actually<00:02:11.890> starts<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.310> peel<00:02:12.700> which<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.810> thought

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
actually starts to peel which I thought

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.480 
actually starts to peel which I thought
was<00:02:14.260> really<00:02:14.470> strange<00:02:14.800> because<00:02:15.040> i<00:02:15.190> was<00:02:15.310> using

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
was really strange because i was using

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.800 
was really strange because i was using
this<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> while<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:16.270> my<00:02:16.360> lips<00:02:16.570> but<00:02:16.720> it

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
this for a while for my lips but it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.110 
this for a while for my lips but it
actually<00:02:16.960> peels<00:02:17.410> off<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> you'll<00:02:18.760> be<00:02:18.910> left

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
actually peels off and you'll be left

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.300 
actually peels off and you'll be left
with<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.720> very<00:02:19.900> unattractive<00:02:20.170> inner<00:02:20.740> lid<00:02:21.070> like

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
with a very unattractive inner lid like

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.540 
with a very unattractive inner lid like
i<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.670> now<00:02:21.850> like<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:23.770> stuff<00:02:24.070> where<00:02:24.370> it's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
i have now like this stuff where it's

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.070 
i have now like this stuff where it's
starting<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> come<00:02:25.090> off<00:02:25.209> but<00:02:25.420> not<00:02:25.600> quite<00:02:25.810> this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
starting to come off but not quite this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.160 
starting to come off but not quite this
does<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.010> very<00:02:27.220> quickly<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:28.840> even

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
does that very quickly so this even

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.270 
does that very quickly so this even
though<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.290> seems<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.620> good<00:02:29.740> idea<00:02:29.800> does

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
though it seems like a good idea does

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.610 
though it seems like a good idea does

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
immensely well and I'm betting that it

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
because I almost never use it this is

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.290 
because I almost never use it this is
what<00:04:44.680> in<00:04:44.800> wilds<00:04:45.190> h2o<00:04:46.470> proof<00:04:47.970> liquid<00:04:48.970> liner<00:04:49.150> it

what in wilds h2o proof liquid liner it

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.580 
what in wilds h2o proof liquid liner it
was<00:04:49.390> like<00:04:49.510> four<00:04:49.780> dollars<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.169> think<00:04:50.380> it's

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
was like four dollars I think it's

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.710 
was like four dollars I think it's
really<00:04:50.919> good<00:04:51.100> for<00:04:51.340> everything<00:04:51.820> like<00:04:52.450> small

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
really good for everything like small

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.659 
really good for everything like small
details<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.260> whatnot<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.710> it's<00:04:53.890> super<00:04:54.430> black

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
details and whatnot and it's super black

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.880 
details and whatnot and it's super black
and<00:04:54.970> it's<00:04:55.090> not<00:04:55.240> too<00:04:55.480> shiny<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.440> it<00:04:56.560> doesn't

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
and it's not too shiny and it doesn't

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.180 
and it's not too shiny and it doesn't
peel<00:04:57.160> off<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:58.030> stays<00:04:58.419> put<00:04:58.630> so<00:04:59.320> this<00:04:59.740> probably

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
peel off it stays put so this probably

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.030 
peel off it stays put so this probably
would<00:05:00.370> work<00:05:00.610> pretty<00:05:00.820> well<00:05:01.000> for<00:05:01.150> your<00:05:01.390> lips<00:05:02.040> so

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
would work pretty well for your lips so

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.560 
would work pretty well for your lips so
if<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.460> want<00:05:03.700> you<00:05:03.880> can<00:05:03.970> give<00:05:04.120> liquid<00:05:04.360> liner

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
if you want you can give liquid liner
