00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 skin problems increased according to the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.490
 veterinarian owners need to stay 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.260
 attentive warm weather requires care 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.870
 We have to be very close to the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.529
 amount of water I do not advise 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.990
 sun from 10 am to 4 pm 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.039
 we thought I left scout in that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.220
 asphalt 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.789
 I'm going to burn my father's foot, your dog. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 also the hair should always be very dry 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.590
 even at the high temperatures 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.510
 you can expose the animals and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.870
 skin related diseases 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.710
 already the cough will depend on each race in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.739
 races that really have to take off the fur 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.149
 to make a m 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.640
 the amount by and has other races that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.579
 has a better adaptation and is not only 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 in the heat that the animals suffer during the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.930
 Many cold care is essential to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 to avoid the risk of small 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.329
 the frequency of bathing 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.820
 example, care should be 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.670
 with colossus ita for example are well 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.060
 different during the winter I like 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.340
 cover the cage mostly at night 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 avoiding is to avoid leaving the cage in 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.060
 balcony in open spaces that has 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.930
 air current 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.180
 The bath I also like is not to leave 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
 water vessels at night only by day and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.360
 even if it is not too cold 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.060
 intense 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.020
 also changes in the house of Ana when 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.000
 cool 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.000
 she follows a list of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 guidelines for preserving the health of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 pets with some clothes 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 hotter 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.869
 I even made a walk for them to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.890
 miniature of mine that has a 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.009
 blanket we shower on them 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.170
 bathtub why get less cold trapped 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.500
 this dog that this breed is very 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.360
 easy to catch cooling these things 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.040
 but this proposition is to take care of a 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.040
 animal and has to be careful can not
