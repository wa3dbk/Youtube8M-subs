00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it on molested so we're gonna mess with

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.759 
it on molested so we're gonna mess with
this<00:00:21.990> thing<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.410> what<00:00:22.500> you're<00:00:22.619> saying

and by that I mean ten years ago and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.790 
and by that I mean ten years ago and
this<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.809> new<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> factory<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.770> was

this was new out of the factory it was

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.729 
this was new out of the factory it was
producing<00:00:38.399> 300<00:00:38.910> horsepower<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.739> 520

140,000<00:00:43.410> miles<00:00:43.530> later<00:00:43.860> Nathan<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.430> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
140,000 miles later Nathan what do you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.010 
140,000 miles later Nathan what do you
think<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.760> putting<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.719> with

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
think it's putting out you know with

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
think it's putting out you know with
these<00:00:46.170> diesels<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:47.039> last<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.579> bloody<00:00:47.820> ever

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
these diesels they last for bloody ever

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569 
these diesels they last for bloody ever
140,000<00:00:48.930> miles<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.649> nothing<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.309> you're

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
140,000 miles is like nothing but you're

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.160 
140,000 miles is like nothing but you're
going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.969> lose<00:00:51.120> power<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> lose

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
going to lose power you're going to lose

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
going to lose power you're going to lose
torque<00:00:52.469> especially<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:52.980> high<00:00:53.100> altitude<00:00:53.579> so

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
torque especially in high altitude so

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.420 
torque especially in high altitude so
how<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.980> hmm

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
how do we make up for that hmm

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:09.830 
how do we make up for that hmm
we'll<00:00:56.610> find<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.149> hold<00:00:57.510> on

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040 

this<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:11.050> enough<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:12.250> not<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:13.060> the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
this is enough it is not it is the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.190 
this is enough it is not it is the
Diablo<00:01:14.740> Trinity<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.760> is<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:16.120> performance<00:01:16.750> tuner

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
Diablo Trinity it is a performance tuner

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.500 
Diablo Trinity it is a performance tuner
that<00:01:17.410> you<00:01:17.650> plug<00:01:17.920> into<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.340> pickups<00:01:18.790> brain<00:01:19.150> and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
that you plug into the pickups brain and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.390 
that you plug into the pickups brain and
guess<00:01:19.900> what<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.140> does<00:01:20.290> I'm<00:01:20.830> guessing<00:01:21.310> it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
guess what it does I'm guessing it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.830 
guess what it does I'm guessing it
doesn't<00:01:21.670> make<00:01:21.760> it<00:01:21.850> slower<00:01:22.060> no<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.570> makes<00:01:22.690> it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
doesn't make it slower no it makes it

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.570 
doesn't make it slower no it makes it
faster<00:01:23.200> it<00:01:23.290> was<00:01:23.380> sent<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.650> us<00:01:23.860> by<00:01:24.040> our<00:01:24.070> friends

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
faster it was sent to us by our friends

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.000 
faster it was sent to us by our friends
at<00:01:24.640> Otto<00:01:24.910> anything<00:01:25.570> calm<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.620> we're<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:26.950> to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
at Otto anything calm and we're going to

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.920 
at Otto anything calm and we're going to
test<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.370> today<00:01:27.490> because<00:01:28.330> it's<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:28.570> very

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
test it today because it's a very

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.190 
test it today because it's a very
inexpensive<00:01:29.440> well<00:01:30.010> $600<00:01:30.729> way<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.660> increase

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
inexpensive well $600 way to increase

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.900 
inexpensive well $600 way to increase
horsepower<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:33.070> fact<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.520> swing<00:01:33.729> will

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
horsepower in fact this swing will

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.630 
horsepower in fact this swing will
increase<00:01:34.240> horsepower<00:01:34.390> by<00:01:34.930> 60<00:01:35.440> 80<00:01:35.680> or<00:01:35.920> 120

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
increase horsepower by 60 80 or 120

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.850 
increase horsepower by 60 80 or 120
that's<00:01:37.510> impressive<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.260> guess<00:01:38.380> what<00:01:38.620> this

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
that's impressive and guess what this

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.190 
that's impressive and guess what this
unit<00:01:39.250> also<00:01:39.640> works<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:40.120> domestically<00:01:40.810> built

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
unit also works on domestically built

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
plug in the obd2 connector right there

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.380 
plug in the obd2 connector right there
fire<00:01:47.259> it<00:01:47.440> up<00:01:47.560> follow<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.460> instructions<00:01:49.030> put

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
fire it up follow the instructions put

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
this and whammo you can play I just read

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.749 
this and whammo you can play I just read
the<00:01:53.500> directions<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.040> cool<00:01:54.220> thing<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.580> you

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
the directions and the cool thing is you

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.160 
the directions and the cool thing is you
can<00:01:54.910> program<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.509> thing<00:01:55.720> not<00:01:55.899> just<00:01:55.930> for

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
can program this thing not just for

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.170 
can program this thing not just for
added<00:01:56.380> horsepower<00:01:56.920> but<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.250> can<00:01:57.369> make<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.670> so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
added horsepower but you can make it so

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.639 
added horsepower but you can make it so
that<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.479> pickup<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.869> more<00:01:59.020> fuel<00:01:59.259> efficient

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
that the pickup is more fuel efficient

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.380 
that the pickup is more fuel efficient
there's<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.009> towing<00:02:00.550> mode<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.000> best<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.270> all

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
there's a towing mode and best of all

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.150 
there's a towing mode and best of all
when<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.660> unplug<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.590> can<00:02:02.710> return<00:02:02.830> the
