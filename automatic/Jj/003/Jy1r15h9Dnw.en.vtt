00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.200 
will be the next ultimate zombie game
first<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> diamond<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.650> not<00:02:01.920> our<00:02:02.580> IP

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
first of all the diamond is not our IP

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.140 
first of all the diamond is not our IP
anymore<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:05.040> were<00:02:05.190> forced<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.730> create

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
anymore so we were forced to create

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.940 
anymore so we were forced to create
something<00:02:06.420> else<00:02:07.110> something<00:02:07.920> different<00:02:08.100> I

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
something else something different I

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.760 
something else something different I
think<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.040> was<00:02:11.190> December<00:02:11.760> 2011<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:13.200> we<00:02:13.320> when

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
think it was December 2011 when we when

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.740 
think it was December 2011 when we when
we<00:02:13.800> really<00:02:14.250> started<00:02:14.700> working<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.240> dying<00:02:15.480> light

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
we really started working on dying light

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020 
we really started working on dying light
so<00:02:16.350> there<00:02:16.500> were<00:02:16.560> lots<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.860> ideas<00:02:17.040> lots<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.850> lots

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so there were lots of ideas lots of lots

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.670 
so there were lots of ideas lots of lots
of<00:02:18.150> crazy<00:02:18.420> ideas<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.410> most

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
of crazy ideas and one of the most

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.040 
of crazy ideas and one of the most
important<00:02:20.130> ideas<00:02:20.280> was<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.660> players

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
important ideas was that we want players

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.050 
important ideas was that we want players
to<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.530> able<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.160> move<00:02:23.280> freely<00:02:23.580> around<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
to be able to move freely around the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.700 
to be able to move freely around the
world<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.570> that's<00:02:24.690> that's<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.500> core

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
world so that's that's like the core

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.500 
world so that's that's like the core
idea<00:02:25.980> from<00:02:26.250> which<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.610> whole<00:02:26.790> project<00:02:27.210> grew

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
idea from which the whole project grew

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.400 
idea from which the whole project grew
from<00:02:29.090> basically<00:02:30.090> after<00:02:30.300> playing<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.990> island

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
from basically after playing the island

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.150 
from basically after playing the island
to<00:02:31.560> me<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:33.000> didn't<00:02:33.300> achieve<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.140> effect<00:02:34.950> of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
to me we didn't achieve the effect of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.100 
to me we didn't achieve the effect of
surviving<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:36.720> want<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
surviving in this this what we want to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.440 
surviving in this this what we want to
we<00:02:37.680> wanted<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.040> achieve<00:02:38.340> something<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
we wanted to achieve something like the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.530 
we wanted to achieve something like the
the<00:02:39.690> real<00:02:39.930> feeling<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.980> outbreak<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:41.790> so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the real feeling of the outbreak so so

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.960 
the real feeling of the outbreak so so
basically<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.740> real<00:02:43.920> life<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.640> probably

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
basically in the real life you probably

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.780 
basically in the real life you probably
find<00:02:45.660> out<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.350> better<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:47.640> move

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
find out that it's better to to move

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.360 
find out that it's better to to move
around<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.390> climb<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:49.140> obstacles<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.070> avoid

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
around to climb on obstacles and avoid

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.790 
around to climb on obstacles and avoid
fighting<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.570> can<00:02:51.750> climb<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.290> anything<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
fighting you can climb on anything you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800 
fighting you can climb on anything you
can<00:02:52.980> do<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.250> very<00:02:53.460> fast<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.300> use<00:02:54.570> this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
can do it very fast you can use this

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.680 
can do it very fast you can use this
advantage<00:02:55.200> against<00:02:55.710> your<00:02:56.010> enemies<00:02:56.850> that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
advantage against your enemies that

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.130 
advantage against your enemies that
gives<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.260> lot<00:02:58.770> more<00:02:59.480> situation<00:03:00.480> area<00:03:00.870> for

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
gives a lot more situation area for

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.290 
gives a lot more situation area for
creativity<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:02.040> how<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.430> want<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> handle<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
situation there was this feeling that we

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.930 
situation there was this feeling that we
could<00:03:06.510> do<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.959> much<00:03:07.170> more<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.520> zombie

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
could do so much more with it a zombie

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.699 
could do so much more with it a zombie

project and that those people working
here<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.160> verse<00:03:26.370> 12<00:03:26.640> they<00:03:26.880> work<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.270> our<00:03:27.390> studio

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
here in verse 12 they work in our studio

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.600 
here in verse 12 they work in our studio
or<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.290> they<00:03:28.530> work<00:03:28.739> in<00:03:28.920> our<00:03:29.040> studio<00:03:29.459> in

ways to collaborate together so we're

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.670 
ways to collaborate together so we're
going<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:39.650> another<00:03:41.150> place<00:03:42.150> where<00:03:42.680> our

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
and we didn't have enough spice to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.400 
and we didn't have enough spice to
handle<00:03:55.410> all<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.920> our<00:03:56.510> employees<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.140> place
