00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
to me literally it's a prototype they

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.370 
to me literally it's a prototype they
sent<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.330> me<00:00:18.420> last<00:00:18.449> week<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.960> said<00:00:19.109> Steve

sent it to me last week it said Steve
learn<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> use<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.880> thing<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.420> did

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
learn how to use this thing and I did

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.670 
learn how to use this thing and I did
and<00:00:21.720> I'll<00:00:21.779> show<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.199> things<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and I'll show you some things on it in

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.290 
and I'll show you some things on it in
just<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> moment<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> prototype<00:00:23.910> this

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
just a moment this is a prototype this

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.450 
just a moment this is a prototype this
is<00:00:24.420> shipping<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.810> believe<00:00:25.050> April<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.529> May<00:00:25.560> price

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
is shipping I believe April or May price

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.269 
is shipping I believe April or May price
point<00:00:26.730> should<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.029> similar<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.830> mk2

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
point should be similar to what the mk2

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.730 
point should be similar to what the mk2
was<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.929> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.230> successor<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
was so this is kind of the successor to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.819 
was so this is kind of the successor to
the<00:00:31.830> mk2<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:32.759> showing<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.239> deliberately

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
the mk2 and I'm showing it deliberately

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.010 
the mk2 and I'm showing it deliberately
with<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> our<00:00:35.399> Hercules<00:00:35.910> brand<00:00:36.210> netbooks

with one of our Hercules brand netbooks

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
with one of our Hercules brand netbooks
just<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.829> show<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> small

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
just to show that if you have a small

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.810 
just to show that if you have a small
controller<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.620> run<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> small

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
controller you can run it with a small

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.610 
controller you can run it with a small
computer<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.870> not<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> run<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.469> fast

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
computer it's not going to run as fast

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
computer it's not going to run as fast
clearly<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> dual-core<00:00:44.789> something<00:00:45.239> or

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
clearly as a dual-core something or

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
clearly as a dual-core something or
other<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.320> single<00:00:46.649> core<00:00:46.829> atom

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
other because it's a single core atom

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
other because it's a single core atom
processor<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.539> fine

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
processor but it's going to do just fine

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
beat loop which is a little more

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.650 
beat loop which is a little more
palatable<00:01:40.190> than<00:01:40.580> one<00:01:40.850> beat<00:01:41.000> loop<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.270> just<00:01:41.480> had

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
palatable than one beat loop I just had

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.240 
palatable than one beat loop I just had
but<00:01:41.930> it's<00:01:42.170> all<00:01:42.350> just<00:01:42.620> a<00:01:42.680> matter<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:42.920> trial

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
but it's all just a matter of trial

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.680 
but it's all just a matter of trial

error and preference for beat Lu kind of

error and preference for beat Lu kind of

to<00:01:50.480> hit<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.840> forward<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:57.730> that's<00:01:58.730> kinda<00:01:58.940> good

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
to hit the forward but that's kinda good

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.660 
to hit the forward but that's kinda good
and<00:02:00.350> then<00:02:00.530> if<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:00.740> press<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.160> shift<00:02:01.400> button

and then if you press the shift button

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.160 
and then if you press the shift button
on<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.060> effects<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.570> get<00:02:02.720> for<00:02:02.960> more

okay and then for we've got set for a
backspin<00:02:45.320> which<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:46.220> good<00:02:46.820> way<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.000> get<00:02:47.150> out

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
becomes you go or you could spin it out

backspin<00:04:23.290> get<00:04:23.500> up<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.960> that's<00:04:26.110> kind<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.320> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
backspin get up and that's kind of the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.620 
backspin get up and that's kind of the
basics<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:26.940> everything<00:04:27.940> else<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.330> a
