00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.480
 welcome circle 11 12 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.400
 today we see the recipe as 650 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.470
 watt 80plus bronze network 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.210
 That should be a pretty decent pace 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 for the price so be well first 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.019
 I will remove the box first 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.019
 the plastic on the shaft is good again 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.910
 this is about 650 watts 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 power supply which 80 plus bronze 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.270
 is certified and with a guarantee 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 for a period of three years 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.900
 The box looks like this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 side and hands is one 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.379
 simple description about the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.300
 functions this thesis and this is too 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.070
 So ready, that's good 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.899
 as well on this side you get the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.940
 main technical data to see 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.140
 my parents from the 52w on the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.789
 post 12 volt rail 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.289
 that's pretty good and the amper are 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.359
 By the way, the box also looks up 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.949
 very professional at first thought 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.719
 I am dealing with a more expensive 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.949
 the power supply but now we had 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.109
 they fight and then see us 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.879
 Halter otz is for friendly supplies 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.739
 four screws to fix the peso 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.030
 with very nice but I still have it 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 better found if the screws 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.720
 would have been black then there is also 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.250
 a note from otz and they thank you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 for the purchase of this product and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.210
 explain how and where to put the net ln 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 should bring if broken here who 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.369
 is the manual and yes now I take 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.049
 Take the pace out of yourself like you 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.460
 it's a bit difficult to see 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.110
 but I managed the job 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 the power adapter once on the table and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.140
 so that I can show you the power cord 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.579
 looks very chic 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.200
 I can not complain and yes 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.299
 sometimes I have complaints about 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 power cord pay here is the csu itself 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.360
 I have to remove that quickly 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 yes yes, I can fit you immediately 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.920
 say it looks very complete it will 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.570
 a 135 mm fan for cooling these 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 unit also used on this page 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.079
 Everything looks very chic and orderly 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.909
 but you still notice that it is 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.320
 Here is a cheaper network 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.299
 Here are the technical data again 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.079
 one has on the plus 12 volt rail 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.270
 a maximum of 46 rp around 552 was on the plus 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.420
 3.3 slash seemed plus 5 volt 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.799
 one has 22 rp 130 so that was 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.060
 actually looks pretty good and 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.070
 I can not complain, especially 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.810
 if you consider the price so 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.340
 looks at this unit on this page 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.410
 and hands are many were 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.880
 holes for ventilation this ps and comes 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.470
 also with a large mains switch and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.440
 I think this is good now I will 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.840
 open the wire 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.370
 the cable can see it please 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.890
 a decent number of connections 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.710
 offered here is for example the 20 to 40 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.960
 Power connection of the four +4 polar tags 12 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.940
 volt power connection of the six pci 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.520
 Express connection of the six plus two 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.110
 points series a castle 4 satan 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.970
 I noticed something there and 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.470
 Although the cables are nice down here 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.090
 new and used but up here 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.320
 are they no longer related to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.730
 Of course, that's what makes power good 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.440
 difference but beauty is one 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.280
 other thing so that has me already 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.140
 little disturbed 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.400
 Here is the next cable with four sata 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.050
 Connect and here you can see again 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.610
 the same with the braid and too 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.570
 last good will be on four molex 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.010
 conclusive offers 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.630
 and here it is not 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.220
 finished and I'm already there 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.990
 little disappointed but now i would 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.270
 like to repeat the connections 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.910
 gets a 20 to 40 power connection 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.210
 a 4 + 4 pole ex 12 volt 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.700
 power a 6 pin pci to the 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.070
 six plus two pci four molex 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.720
 Followers and files thus concludes the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.860
 Number of connections is pretty good 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.960
 I can not complain 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.610
 nude connections are are ground anyway 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.500
 but I would like that now I would 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.020
 like to demonstrate the cable length here 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.930
 is the 20 + 4 pohl connection here 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.470
 the 4 + 4 polat extra volt connection of the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.630
 pci 6 pin connection of the pci 6 to 2 pohl 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.489
 connection here is a cable with sata 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.870
 Connections is very very long 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.970
 I have never had such a long cable 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.620
 but that's great here 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.270
 another cable with sata connections 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.190
 and this one is a bit shorter as well 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.050
 not very short and last but not least 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.520
 cable with the molex connect it is 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.080
 also quite long and I like it 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.410
 that very much but now we come to the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.870
 technical data of the zzf 650 watts 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.209
 Power adapter provides 650 watts of power and 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 is 80 plus bronze certification to 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.280
 Cool this unit back to 135mm 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.019
 fan uses the active pfc function 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.670
 is also supported so power factor 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.820
 correction and there will be an input from 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.200
 90 to 264 volts allowed of course offers 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.140
 these places also have protective measures 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.239
 against overvoltage and the voltage over 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.850
 current and short-circuit the power supply has 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.270
 one plus 12 volt rail which 46 rp 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.630
 has deliver to 552 watts 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.250
 the plus 313 of rails have 22 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.010
 ampere and a combined 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.840
 maximum power of 130 watts this 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.760
 power supply should be 650 watts at one 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.040
 outdoor temperature of 40 degrees celsius 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.900
 deliver that sounds pretty good 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.670
 design of the csu does not look good either 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.350
 for the price it is here 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.740
 around the standard size of power supplies and 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.940
 compared to qsc x600 v2 headset 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.360
 this should bring more power 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.840
 can 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.490
 the zsw 650 watt power supply is a good one 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.440
 Choice if you have a tight budget 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.920
 or not spend a lot of money on the net 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.480
 want 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.950
 this unit will be able to 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.490
 decent system with power too 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.170
 supply 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.540
 but do not expect it to be high either 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.560
 end systems with eg several graphics cards 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.390
 can operate 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.190
 that will not happen but for the 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.010
 Average pc would be perfect if 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.900
 this power supply against the cx 602 of 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.390
 Courses comparison wins this verdict 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.760
 in terms of performance because more bad 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.200
 but otz has something to offer 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.390
 Saved money that did not end 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.040
 braided at the sata molex cable 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.720
 As far as the molex connections are concerned 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.670
 not very shaky and that can be a lot at times 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.410
 his short time has become frustrating 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.360
 eugh can produce better connections 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.700
 but not so bad for the price 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.940
 The lift is also very quiet advantages 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.570
 would be good value for money 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.460
 great design 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.560
 then it is very quiet and you get 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.990
 even long cables last but not least are the 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.090
 Most cables with new and used ones 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.650
 I can at least disadvantage that first 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.440
 no hurry maybe at the end of the 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.880
 secondly, sata molex park the molex 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.470
 connections are shaky and that can 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.390
 sometimes be very frustrating 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.680
 Nevertheless, I rate this power supply with 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.610
 eight out of ten and definitely would 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.080
 recommend 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.560
 thanks for watching and do not forget 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.560
