00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.380
 hello herald is that as they go more 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.780
 of 150 km we have traveled from Managua 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.240
 until we reach woods beaches only we 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.880
 one kilometer left as you can see we are going 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.189
 to see if a good Samaritan passes and we 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.840
 wants to ride to see if we can 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.650
 get surfing today 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.650
 the wood 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.040
 it's not pure coincidence but I tell you 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.650
 that the rebel is so well known here in 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.530
 wood beach that is tends to have you 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.420
 put our name and you can see 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 rebels surf school let's see to see 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.240
 if you come to the beach of wood and not 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.030
 I walk a table like I do not worry 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.590
 because here is a store where we can 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.590
 find a good table 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.140
 Oscar Perez is worried because he 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.520
 says size does not matter but I 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.800
 I think that to surf, you import the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.630
 size does matter depends the level of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.409
 zero that you have for example mine that 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.069
 it is medium advanced 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.270
 advanced medium advanced on the road 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.340
 let me explain you half advanced because 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.789
 we are close to the beach but good i am 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.619
 good apprentice we give you a big one like 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.420
 those that we have there sometimes that you give me 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.319
 a big one is worrying me I want 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.240
 a median know that level but 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.679
 I wonder you have to wear some style of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.420
 shirt that has some colors 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:50.819
 specific 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:51.629
 at the time they talk to you at 10 dollars per 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.579
 day 

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:57.750
 anything for you in the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.349
 choice 25 hours I do not get tired I get tired 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.349
 with the gp 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.560
 we will have a class session 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.000
 of how to learn to surf of course 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.040
 that must be difficult and we are not going to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.989
 learning on the first day is not having 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.000
 Take time at least you need 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.660
 practice about three days to be able to 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.500
 although we started we started with finding 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.500
 the stability 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.930
 of the table when standing as 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.490
 important to understand the common stability 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.630
 in this position 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.210
 this is the table one foot back one foot to the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.250
 center of the table beyond never again 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.190
 there you always have to have a space 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.040
 more or less of that for half for 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.200
 have stability in the back foot you 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.510
 gives stability in the center a balance 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.750
 it's just that's what it's about 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.480
 martha's ready to paddle you arrive number 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.069
 1 in your hands to the chest because there is 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.499
 where is the stability 2 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.749
 well I was back here if your skin is 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:43.139
 back 3 up 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.139
 4 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.320
 good rebels the truth that is not easy 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.120
 learn to surf less in a day or the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.660
 first time the coach says there 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.790
 to spend at least a month or about 40 days 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.510
 in order to learn what I do want to be 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.419
 someday he's surfing coach because 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.669
 as we can see there are many beautiful girls 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.500
 who want to learn to surf in the 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.220
 Nicaraguan beaches and that's very good 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.220
 we are 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.789
 they say that people come to surf but 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.409
 is not one kilometer let through 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.409

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.620
