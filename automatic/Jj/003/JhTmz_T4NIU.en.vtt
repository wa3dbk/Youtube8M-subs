somewhat lauraball but otherwise loved
the<00:02:12.860> base<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:13.580> been<00:02:13.700> working<00:02:13.850> great<00:02:14.060> for

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
the base and it's been working great for

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.920 
the base and it's been working great for
me<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:14.900> clan<00:02:15.140> wars<00:02:15.410> thus<00:02:15.890> far<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.360> do<00:02:17.540> want<00:02:17.870> to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
replays not just staring at the base all

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.710

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
day but you can see the flow of the base

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.570 
day but you can see the flow of the base
is<00:02:23.960> really<00:02:24.260> nice<00:02:24.620> as<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> Hogs<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:25.370> go

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
is really nice as the Hogs will go

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.190 
is really nice as the Hogs will go
around<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.090> center<00:02:26.420> compartment<00:02:26.750> if

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
around the center compartment if

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.070 
around the center compartment if
hogged<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.310> Dragons<00:02:28.940> like<00:02:29.599> I<00:02:29.720> said<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
hogged and the Dragons like I said the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.330 
hogged and the Dragons like I said the
air<00:02:30.230> defenses<00:02:30.650> are<00:02:30.770> pretty<00:02:30.980> well<00:02:31.160> protected

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
air defenses are pretty well protected

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.280 
air defenses are pretty well protected
especially<00:02:32.030> by<00:02:32.180> Splash<00:02:32.540> Damage<00:02:32.569> Lee<00:02:33.080> if<00:02:33.200> you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
especially by Splash Damage Lee if you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.710 
especially by Splash Damage Lee if you
do<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.500> like<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.709> drag<00:02:34.010> loon<00:02:34.430> for<00:02:34.730> example<00:02:35.209> it's

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
do is like a drag loon for example it's

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.020 
do is like a drag loon for example it's
hard<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.170> get<00:02:36.349> at<00:02:36.530> more<00:02:36.950> than<00:02:37.190> one<00:02:37.700> air<00:02:38.000> defense

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
hard to get at more than one air defense

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.300 
hard to get at more than one air defense
at<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.540> time<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:39.860> actually<00:02:40.129> really

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
at a time so it's actually really

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.690 
at a time so it's actually really
effective<00:02:40.840> base<00:02:41.840> versus<00:02:42.769> so<00:02:43.160> many<00:02:43.340> popular

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
effective base versus so many popular

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.009 
effective base versus so many popular
strategies<00:02:44.180> right<00:02:44.300> now<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.630> go<00:02:44.750> ahead<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
strategies right now so go ahead and

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.110 
strategies right now so go ahead and
screenshot<00:02:45.560> right<00:02:45.769> now<00:02:46.010> or<00:02:46.280> use<00:02:46.550> right<00:02:46.849> there

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
screenshot right now or use right there

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.660 
screenshot right now or use right there
and<00:02:47.410> I'll<00:02:48.410> go<00:02:48.590> ahead<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.920> hop<00:02:49.069> into<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> couple

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
and I'll go ahead and hop into a couple

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.780 
and I'll go ahead and hop into a couple
replays<00:02:50.000> from<00:02:50.120> our<00:02:50.330> last<00:02:50.510> clan<00:02:50.870> war<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:52.370> got

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
replays from our last clan war and I got

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.210 
replays from our last clan war and I got
two<00:02:53.060> one-star<00:02:53.870> defenses<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.650> one

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
two one-star defenses and one

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.620 
two one-star defenses and one
out-and-out<00:02:55.910> win<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:56.720> let's<00:02:56.900> go<00:02:57.049> ahead<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
out-and-out win so let's go ahead and

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.259 
out-and-out win so let's go ahead and
hop<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.810> that<00:02:59.930> last<00:03:00.140> clan<00:03:00.500> war<00:03:00.739> right<00:03:00.980> now<00:03:01.269> so

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
hop to that last clan war right now so

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.210 
hop to that last clan war right now so
like<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.599> said<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.500> pretty<00:03:03.890> effective

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
like I said this is a pretty effective

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.569 
like I said this is a pretty effective
base<00:03:05.680> against<00:03:06.680> every<00:03:06.980> attack<00:03:07.310> this<00:03:07.459> is

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
base against every attack this is

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.190 
base against every attack this is
another<00:03:07.790> reason<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.120> like<00:03:08.329> it<00:03:08.390> against<00:03:08.870> hogs

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
another reason I like it against hogs

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.809 
another reason I like it against hogs
and<00:03:09.590> Dragons<00:03:10.040> which<00:03:10.190> are<00:03:10.340> pretty<00:03:10.519> much<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
and Dragons which are pretty much the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.390 
and Dragons which are pretty much the
two<00:03:10.970> main<00:03:11.180> attacks<00:03:11.540> here<00:03:12.410> at<00:03:12.709> Town<00:03:13.040> Hall<00:03:13.250> level

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
two main attacks here at Town Hall level

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.490 
two main attacks here at Town Hall level
eight<00:03:13.670> now<00:03:13.819> of<00:03:13.970> course<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.750> not<00:03:14.900> going<00:03:15.230> to

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
eight now of course it's not going to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.370 
eight now of course it's not going to
work<00:03:15.950> against<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> Town<00:03:16.579> Hall<00:03:16.790> level<00:03:17.540> nine<00:03:17.930> like

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
work against a Town Hall level nine like

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.479 
work against a Town Hall level nine like
go<00:03:18.769> lava<00:03:19.160> l'union<00:03:19.730> or<00:03:19.880> lava<00:03:20.060> l'union<00:03:20.480> attack

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
go lava l'union or lava l'union attack

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.160 
go lava l'union or lava l'union attack
because<00:03:22.489> that's<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:22.910> too<00:03:23.120> powerful<00:03:23.329> any<00:03:23.810> for

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
because that's just too powerful any for

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.650 
because that's just too powerful any for
any<00:03:24.319> Town<00:03:24.620> Hall<00:03:24.860> base<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.549> townhall<00:03:26.180> 8<00:03:26.329> base

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
any Town Hall base a townhall 8 base

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.600 
any Town Hall base a townhall 8 base
let's<00:03:27.260> go<00:03:27.380> ahead<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.890> hop<00:03:28.099> right<00:03:28.130> into<00:03:28.430> it

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
let's go ahead and hop right into it

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.250 
let's go ahead and hop right into it

he's not gonna live up my whole clan

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.740 
he's not gonna live up my whole clan
castle<00:03:42.859> so<00:03:43.069> these<00:03:43.609> might<00:03:43.850> not<00:03:43.880> be<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.299> best

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
castle so these might not be the best

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.690 
castle so these might not be the best
attacks<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.769> is<00:03:45.889> all<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.010> have<00:03:46.250> available

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700

dragons as they get close to the center
there<00:04:45.620> even<00:04:46.129> if<00:04:46.219> the<00:04:46.310> clan<00:04:46.490> castle<00:04:46.789> troops

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
there even if the clan castle troops

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.700 
there even if the clan castle troops
weren't<00:04:47.270> there<00:04:47.569> there's<00:04:48.050> just<00:04:48.199> a<00:04:48.289> pretty<00:04:48.499> high

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
weren't there there's just a pretty high

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.040 
weren't there there's just a pretty high
concentration<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.759> defensive<00:04:50.389> units<00:04:50.840> with

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
concentration of defensive units with

concentration of defensive units with
those<00:04:51.199> air<00:04:51.439> defenses<00:04:51.469> that<00:04:52.189> Archer<00:04:52.789> towers

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
those air defenses that Archer towers

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.939 
those air defenses that Archer towers
along<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.479> outside<00:04:53.659> and<00:04:54.199> then<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.740> wizard

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
along the outside and then the wizard

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.070 
along the outside and then the wizard
towers<00:04:55.430> Tesla's<00:04:55.999> and<00:04:56.240> air<00:04:56.389> defenses<00:04:56.900> all

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
towers Tesla's and air defenses all

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.899 
towers Tesla's and air defenses all
around<00:04:57.379> the<00:04:57.469> middle<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.310> it's<00:04:58.460> really<00:04:58.669> tough

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
around the middle so it's really tough

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.279 
around the middle so it's really tough
to<00:04:58.939> even<00:04:59.240> get<00:04:59.389> to<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.599> center<00:04:59.870> compartment

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
to even get to that center compartment

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.499 
to even get to that center compartment
here<00:05:00.740> so<00:05:01.129> it's<00:05:01.279> going<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.550> be<00:05:01.789> as<00:05:02.029> I<00:05:02.240> fast

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
here so it's going to be as I fast

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.110 
here so it's going to be as I fast
forward<00:05:02.930> it's<00:05:03.050> gonna<00:05:03.169> be<00:05:03.379> a<00:05:03.610> one-star<00:05:04.639> attack

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
forward it's gonna be a one-star attack

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.540 
forward it's gonna be a one-star attack
so<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:06.139> is<00:05:06.259> definitely<00:05:06.529> a<00:05:06.889> win<00:05:07.219> anything

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
so that is definitely a win anything

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.920 
so that is definitely a win anything
that's<00:05:07.699> not<00:05:07.819> a<00:05:07.849> three-star<00:05:08.360> is<00:05:08.449> considered<00:05:08.870> a

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
that's not a three-star is considered a

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.989 
that's not a three-star is considered a
win<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.169> hasn't<00:05:09.620> even<00:05:09.710> been<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.159> start<00:05:10.520> yet

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:10.999 
win that hasn't even been to start yet

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:13.779 
win that hasn't even been to start yet
as<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.749> said<00:05:12.020> small<00:05:12.439> sample<00:05:12.860> size<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.069> farm<00:05:13.669> you

there's<00:05:26.449> another<00:05:26.509> one<00:05:26.750> start<00:05:27.289> attacking<00:05:27.529> it

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
there's another one start attacking it

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.360 
there's another one start attacking it
was<00:05:27.860> a<00:05:27.889> golem<00:05:28.520> based<00:05:28.849> attack<00:05:29.330> but<00:05:29.599> it<00:05:29.689> was<00:05:29.870> very

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
was a golem based attack but it was very

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.420 
was a golem based attack but it was very
not<00:05:31.370> not<00:05:31.729> supremely<00:05:32.719> executed<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:33.830> I'm<00:05:34.219> not

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
not not supremely executed so I'm not

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.439 
not not supremely executed so I'm not
sure<00:05:34.580> if<00:05:34.669> I<00:05:34.729> want<00:05:34.879> to<00:05:34.939> show<00:05:35.060> you<00:05:35.150> that<00:05:35.270> as<00:05:35.389> an

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
sure if I want to show you that as an

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.589 
sure if I want to show you that as an
example<00:05:36.139> of<00:05:36.439> the<00:05:36.560> base<00:05:36.860> defending<00:05:37.639> this<00:05:38.210> is

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
example of the base defending this is

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.589 
example of the base defending this is
another<00:05:39.199> golem<00:05:39.680> based<00:05:39.860> attack<00:05:40.279> a<00:05:40.610> little<00:05:41.389> bit

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
another golem based attack a little bit

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.390 
another golem based attack a little bit
better<00:05:41.749> executed<00:05:42.439> but<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.620> can<00:05:42.770> see<00:05:42.979> he<00:05:43.129> still

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
better executed but you can see he still

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.279 
better executed but you can see he still
failed<00:05:43.849> so<00:05:44.180> let's<00:05:44.330> go<00:05:44.449> ahead<00:05:44.509> and<00:05:44.900> see<00:05:45.080> what

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
failed so let's go ahead and see what

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.869 
failed so let's go ahead and see what
went<00:05:45.469> wrong<00:05:45.740> here<00:05:46.009> for<00:05:46.219> him<00:05:46.339> so<00:05:46.400> he<00:05:46.490> does<00:05:46.639> pull

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
went wrong here for him so he does pull

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.450 
went wrong here for him so he does pull
off<00:05:46.969> the<00:05:47.120> full<00:05:47.449> lure<00:05:47.870> this<00:05:48.169> time<00:05:48.469> he<00:05:49.009> has<00:05:49.129> four

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
off the full lure this time he has four

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.309 
off the full lure this time he has four
golems<00:05:49.909> but<00:05:50.060> they're<00:05:50.150> all<00:05:50.270> level<00:05:50.599> one<00:05:50.870> golems

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
golems but they're all level one golems

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.399 
golems but they're all level one golems
I<00:05:51.529> wouldn't<00:05:52.129> go<00:05:52.250> this<00:05:52.460> heavy<00:05:52.759> golem<00:05:53.389> into<00:05:54.020> a

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
I wouldn't go this heavy golem into a

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.339 
I wouldn't go this heavy golem into a
Town<00:05:55.189> Hall<00:05:55.430> level<00:05:55.580> eight<00:05:55.960> attack<00:05:56.960> is<00:05:57.199> because

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
Town Hall level eight attack is because

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:58.839 
Town Hall level eight attack is because
you<00:05:57.469> have<00:05:57.620> limited<00:05:57.830> troop<00:05:58.219> size<00:05:58.490> especially

you have limited troop size especially

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.939 
you have limited troop size especially
if<00:05:59.210> they're<00:05:59.300> only<00:05:59.389> level<00:05:59.659> one<00:06:00.020> so<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.680> can<00:06:00.800> see

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
if they're only level one so you can see

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.010 
if they're only level one so you can see
is<00:06:01.069> having<00:06:01.339> difficulties<00:06:01.909> taking<00:06:02.389> care<00:06:02.719> of

of policing rage on top of golems alone
that's<00:06:31.759> not<00:06:31.969> gonna<00:06:32.120> help<00:06:32.360> at<00:06:32.689> all<00:06:32.719> golems<00:06:33.620> are

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
that's not gonna help at all golems are

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.889 
that's not gonna help at all golems are
barely<00:06:34.339> affected<00:06:34.939> by<00:06:35.060> rage<00:06:35.389> and<00:06:35.419> so<00:06:35.839> they

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:35.899 
barely affected by rage and so they

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:38.320 
barely affected by rage and so they
don't<00:06:36.020> do<00:06:36.259> much<00:06:36.409> damage<00:06:36.649> output<00:06:37.009> anyway<00:06:37.550> so

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
don't do much damage output anyway so

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.149 
don't do much damage output anyway so
you<00:06:39.020> can<00:06:39.199> see<00:06:39.349> maybe<00:06:39.560> this<00:06:39.710> wasn't<00:06:39.949> the<00:06:40.099> best

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
you can see maybe this wasn't the best

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.040 
you can see maybe this wasn't the best
attack<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.639> show<00:06:40.819> either<00:06:41.089> as<00:06:41.389> an<00:06:41.509> example<00:06:41.960> of

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
attack to show either as an example of

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.200 
attack to show either as an example of
the<00:06:42.139> base<00:06:42.289> holding<00:06:42.680> up<00:06:42.800> but<00:06:43.009> I<00:06:43.219> will<00:06:43.699> have<00:06:43.909> more

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
the base holding up but I will have more

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.379 
the base holding up but I will have more

on this base coming to you soon the
third<00:06:47.599> attack<00:06:47.839> wasn't<00:06:48.289> too<00:06:48.800> much<00:06:48.979> better

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
third attack wasn't too much better

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.249 
third attack wasn't too much better
