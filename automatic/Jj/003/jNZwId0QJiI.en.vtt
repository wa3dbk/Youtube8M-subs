this<00:01:55.970> could<00:01:56.180> give<00:01:56.330> him<00:01:56.450> some<00:01:56.480> resistance<00:01:57.260> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
this could give him some resistance and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.080 
this could give him some resistance and
therefore<00:01:57.950> won't<00:01:58.250> shove<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.670> immediately

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
therefore won't shove you immediately

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.660 
therefore won't shove you immediately
into<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.420> pit<00:01:59.890> when<00:02:00.890> he<00:02:00.980> gets<00:02:01.130> at<00:02:01.250> least<00:02:01.400> about

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
into the pit when he gets at least about

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.520 
into the pit when he gets at least about
being<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:02.000> quarter<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.540> way<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:03.080> being<00:02:03.260> pushed

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
being a quarter the way to being pushed

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.340 
being a quarter the way to being pushed
in<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:07.280> see<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:08.420> long<00:02:08.600> as<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.840> keep<00:02:09.020> tapping

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
in you see as long as you keep tapping

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.560 
in you see as long as you keep tapping
it<00:02:09.650> there's<00:02:10.100> nothing<00:02:10.430> he<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.730> do<00:02:10.910> you've

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
it there's nothing he can do you've

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.210 
it there's nothing he can do you've
built<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.900> some<00:02:12.110> momentum<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.770> there's<00:02:13.040> no

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
built up some momentum and there's no

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.240 
built up some momentum and there's no
way<00:02:13.520> he's<00:02:13.730> going<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.090> able<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.360> overcome<00:02:14.810> it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
way he's going to be able to overcome it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.740 
way he's going to be able to overcome it
however<00:02:16.250> if<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.640> begin<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.450> stop

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
however if you just begin to stop

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.960 
however if you just begin to stop
tapping<00:02:18.080> near<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> end<00:02:18.740> then<00:02:19.460> must<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.820> put

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
tapping near the end then must have put

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.450 
tapping near the end then must have put
the<00:02:20.120> start<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.660> push<00:02:20.900> even<00:02:21.080> harder<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.860> when

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
the start to push even harder and when

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.950 
the start to push even harder and when
you<00:02:22.580> get<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.030> point<00:02:23.270> where<00:02:23.480> you're<00:02:23.600> standing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
you get to a point where you're standing

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:32.530 
you get to a point where you're standing
still<00:02:24.290> there's<00:02:24.860> absolutely<00:02:25.250> no<00:02:25.640> way<00:02:31.540> there

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
still there's absolutely no way there

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.140 
still there's absolutely no way there
are<00:02:32.660> two<00:02:33.020> rather<00:02:33.740> strange<00:02:34.340> ways<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:34.880> order<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
are two rather strange ways in order to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.970 
are two rather strange ways in order to
be<00:02:35.300> able<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.570> try<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:35.930> beat<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.410> test<00:02:36.740> which

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
be able to try and beat this test which

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.880 
be able to try and beat this test which
people<00:02:37.400> have<00:02:37.610> said<00:02:37.880> work<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:39.080> first<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.680> like

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
people have said work the first is like

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.490 
people have said work the first is like
I'm<00:02:40.100> demonstrating<00:02:40.310> here<00:02:41.030> by<00:02:41.660> getting<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.170> biro

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
I'm demonstrating here by getting a biro

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.250 
I'm demonstrating here by getting a biro
or<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.190> ballpoint<00:02:43.670> pen<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.330> rubbing<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.990> across

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
or a ballpoint pen and rubbing it across

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.520 
or a ballpoint pen and rubbing it across
the<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> button<00:02:46.090> however<00:02:47.090> I'm<00:02:47.630> any<00:02:47.900> experienced

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the a button however I'm any experienced

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.199 
the a button however I'm any experienced
at<00:02:48.620> this<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.040> I've<00:02:49.250> got<00:02:49.280> absolutely<00:02:49.520> no<00:02:50.030> idea

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
at this and I've got absolutely no idea

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.810 
at this and I've got absolutely no idea
how<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.690> works<00:02:50.900> as<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.770> certainly<00:02:52.160> can't<00:02:52.459> do<00:02:52.670> it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
how it works as I certainly can't do it

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.550 
how it works as I certainly can't do it
and<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.360> find<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.750> lot<00:02:53.900> easier<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.290> just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and I find it a lot easier to just

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.310 
and I find it a lot easier to just
button<00:02:54.920> tap<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.340> by<00:02:55.670> myself<00:02:55.910> if<00:02:56.750> there<00:02:56.989> are<00:02:57.170> any

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
button tap it by myself if there are any

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.050 
button tap it by myself if there are any
people<00:02:57.530> out<00:02:57.830> there<00:02:58.070> who<00:02:58.220> know<00:02:58.459> how<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.670> do<00:02:58.910> this

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
people out there who know how to do this

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.930 
see how it works if it does indeed work
finally<00:03:21.260> there's<00:03:21.860> always<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.310> cheaters<00:03:22.760> way

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
finally there's always the cheaters way

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.820 
finally there's always the cheaters way
for<00:03:23.870> those<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.230> who<00:03:24.380> bought<00:03:24.590> an

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
for those of you who bought an

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.740 
for those of you who bought an
unofficial<00:03:25.160> controller<00:03:25.730> have<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.390> look<00:03:26.570> on<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
unofficial controller have a look on the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.870 
unofficial controller have a look on the
back<00:03:26.780> or<00:03:27.290> possibly<00:03:27.650> even<00:03:27.739> on<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.070> front<00:03:28.370> there

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
back or possibly even on the front there

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.310 
back or possibly even on the front there
might<00:03:29.030> be<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.180> thing<00:03:29.360> called<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.660> turbo<00:03:30.110> button

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
might be a thing called the turbo button

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.130 
might be a thing called the turbo button
what<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.400> do<00:03:31.550> is<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.090> assign<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.690> button

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
what you do is you assign the a button

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.110 
what you do is you assign the a button
to<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.410> turbo<00:03:33.770> button<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.670> basically

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
to the turbo button and this basically

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.650 
to the turbo button and this basically
acts<00:03:35.480> as<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> button<00:03:36.110> bashing<00:03:36.680> kind<00:03:37.489> of

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
acts as a button bashing kind of

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.570 
acts as a button bashing kind of
mechanism<00:03:38.660> type<00:03:38.989> thing<00:03:39.590> yeah<00:03:40.220> whatever<00:03:40.520> I

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
mechanism type thing yeah whatever I

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.979
