00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.330
 hello to all I am want to know that 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.040
 anand there are lists and this is a tutorial 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.320
 what am I doing for the beauty channel 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.720
 very easy this tutorial I have it 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.610
 Order in the comments is not original 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.260
 mine have found a picture of 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.330
 internet and you asked me theresa 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.180
 why do not you do a tutorial of this 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.730
 drawing is a terrific bear so yes 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.130
 It will be very easy to do it alone 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.050
 you will need a tincture or punch to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.270
 neila is a tool with a little ball 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.739
 in the tip to make polka dots I'm not going 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.670
 to roll more if I leave you with the step to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.070
 He passed 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.950
 we started by putting a base 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.620
 yes 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.620
 and then let's choose a pastel pink 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.280
 and we're going to give the little finger the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.280
 heart and thumb 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:00.250
 Then, as you can see, we are going to paint the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 remaining fingers is very likely that 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.870
 you need to put two layers of color 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.010
 and you 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 yes 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.700
 then we will take the tincture or 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.700
 wishbone 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.150
 and with its finest part we are going to start 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.159
 to draw polka dots on the nails with the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.159
 color contrary to what we have base 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.429
 so in those with pink base we are going to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.530
 put beige dots and on those that have 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.920
 beige base let's put colored dots 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 pink 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.850
 but let's leave the ring finger free 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.850
 to draw the bear 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.410
 with the own pink enamel brush 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.410
 let's draw the head of the bear 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.790
 and with the thick part of the side team tool 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.310
 let's make the ears now with 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.620
 beige and the thick part of the adult intur 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.620
 let's make the bear's snout 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 and with black let's paint the nose and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.480
 the eyes as a final touch let's give it 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.329
 a little beige to the ears and for 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.680
 Last we are going to seal our manicure 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.680
 with shine top coat 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.950
 I have chosen because I know it is a glaze 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.950
 transparent secant 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.819
 and that's how our manicure will look 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.180
 disappeared you have liked the bear 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.219
 which is simple because you already know that if you 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.560
 you liked you can write so much this 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.200
