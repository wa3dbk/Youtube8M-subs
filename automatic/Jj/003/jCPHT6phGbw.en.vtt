00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.780
 dedicated to the shoe yes in period 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.090
 of parties we say good things I'm going 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.970
 buy a new pair of shoes 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.740
 and unfortunately we are doing crazy things and 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.050
 we realize that in fact the 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.880
 shoe is not going where she is too 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.800
 small and we have the beautiful sea saying 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.989
 she's going to get bigger I know she's going 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 without saying and she will not expand where 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.780
 you went on a pair of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 shoes a little bit too big 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.720
 and more behind you had too much foot 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.010
 which flop flop flop and you can 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.740
 not the master because you can not get 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.360
 not walk for you I have some 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.310
 little tips first tip for them 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.220
 shoes that are too small so 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.430
 you know of course the old 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.810
 wet newspaper technique that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.910
 we're getting into the pair of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 shoes all night and the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.720
 next morning be saying the pair of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.340
 shoes has grown if you're there 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.960
 arrive so much better I'm not 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.930
 arrived I think it must work 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.060
 only with leather shoes you have 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.979
 otherwise it's okay, yes, I'm listening to you 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.530
 I bought a little bit more 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.470
 big that my shoes like that I 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.840
 can slide inside the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 shoe and of course that's not the big 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.110
 island 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.060
 sid is safe I have foot pain at 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.680
 level sim is safe I mean 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.780
 my shoe at the level of the tyne years there 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.760
 there is another nice little thing but 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.280
 the same that only works on 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.479
 shoes or the interior is leather the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.830
 plastic it did not happen that's it 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.040
 it's a softener so you 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.680
 spray that inside your 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.270
 shoe released the inside of the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640
 shoe put the shoes after 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.799
 have sprayed the product and the guards 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.070
 and 30 minutes for it to shape itself to 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.769
 your foot so I tell them about them 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.239
 synthetic shoes inside 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.160
 synthetic it did not work on 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.680
 shoes or the interior was in 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.989
 copper yes it works I comment 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.079
 it's a relaxation last 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.820
 really technical when you have more 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.709
 more ideas on hand is the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.330
 bring to a shoemaker some 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.120
 cobbler have machines that can 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.030
 move your shoe in that direction 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 where in that sense there after if you have 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.970
 bought a pair of shoes that cost 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.500
 5 euros 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.630
 it would be a little pissy nam lick a 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.090
 attic pay it that skin of the buttocks 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.010
 what I think it is better to think 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.830
 and leave to sell on the right corner 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.860
 do not go like I did I did them 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.050
 sold on the right corner between small 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.010
 worries with the shoes I said in 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.050
 the presentation 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.940
 is it you a pair of shoes so 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.190
 this one yes at once everywhere the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.950
 shoes too big 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.319
 yes I bought at home his shoes 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.520
 I put them on a day and after 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.500
 of the day actually they were 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.459
 completely relaxed that is to say that there 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.319
 I have a space of deng it's game 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.910
 basically it looks like a little girl who 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.250
 try the shoes to his mom I 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.890
 floats inside so I found 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.390
 several tips to fill this void 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.230
 and to be more comfortable in my 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.769
 shoes 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.209
 the first tip is the soles 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.420
 in me I bought weeks to 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.640
 cut out so you cut out of course to 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 your size at least if you went 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.140
 with that you can win a little bit 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.000
 in your pair of shoes 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.099
 So that's soles cuts 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.260
 and other little tips when you 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.940
 do not have a very wide space behind 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.239
 but how good do you feel that it makes a 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.190
 little do you have that which is small 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:04:00.569
 pads that you put behind the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.090
 shoe you have a little hake at 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.159
 books that you remove behind between 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.200
 parentheses I galley for the 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.620
 city ​​had to tear me apart with a 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.040
 free water 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.599
 a tweezers that with peace it's 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.860
 people rise all the towns because 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.329
 in fact I was destroying 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.680
 completely the pad to tear off the 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.350
 glue that holds the little pad 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.910
 the inside good little parenthesis so 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.570
 what you do you take your 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.930
 shoe 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:30.139
 you must have removed it you 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:32.690
 just stick it inside your 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.550
 shoe that makes you have some 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.470
 small pads on the sides that 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.970
 go down you have two little co 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.550
 sign on the sides that allow for 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.349
 hold your shoe must not have the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.880
 foot slipping too much knowing that 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.370
 this replica the church too much that makes 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.270
 super bad what's behind the friction 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.310
 is very unpleasant 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.620
 so what I do besides is that I 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.259
 add a little here is actually a 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.060
 little veil of care is visible is the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.280
 protect it from friction from the 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.780
 shoe keeps feet cool and dry 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.360
 may have a little bit of a breeze 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.710
 marine as it makes a cool effect 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.360
 it is the very pleasant smell on the other hand 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.030
 that's a bit of a lacc 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.380
 so that's so general I use a 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.949
 little silk veil when of course I 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.210
 put no debate is my last is 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.099
 really two last tricks so there 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.479
 it's really before putting your 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.150
 shoes on sale because eventually 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.539
 they really do not really 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.780
 that's it no it's not 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.780
 puppets 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.940
 no these are simply spikes 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.789
 silicon tips that we put in the 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.960
 shoes of two classics one of 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.320
 classic ballerinas so I'm going to you 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.510
 show 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.449
 so you see that there is a sense you 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.889
 have a side that is slower than batch 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:51.530
 so the longer side of course this 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:54.199
 mitsou and that's it makes you a little 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.270
 add silicone so you win 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.130
 some still a little bit in 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.430
 your shoes when you go the m 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.440
 so if with the soles the little ones so 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.880
 cushioned behind and small spikes 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.610
 silicone that you find at 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.480
 decathlon I think in stores 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.770
 specialized a whole 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.840
 who dances classical and all that you 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.180
 will also find but maybe not 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.140
 same price because there I paid his 10th 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.140
 0.95 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.820
 it is not given anyway but it 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.840
 works it allows you here are two steps 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.930
 guide in your shoes 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.180
 and here you flashed on a loss 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.440
 it would be serious lyon blow to have the 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.110
 put on sale because everything 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.700
 she simply grew 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.930
 that's it or just because you 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.620
 have bought plays on too serious we soon 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.210
 the departure if with that you do not arrive 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.000
 to see pretty shoes that you 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.970
 are going great at the foot I do not know 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.060
 cut stolen foot or some graves 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.980
 you will have no worries about this I you 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.060
 make big kisses and I tell you to 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.060
 next year lease
