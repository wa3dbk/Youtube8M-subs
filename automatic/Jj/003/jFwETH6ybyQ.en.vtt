00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
kidnappings no ransom note so that's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
kidnappings no ransom note so that's
good<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:23.490> where<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.119> in

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
good I think because where we are in

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.740 
good I think because where we are in
Mexico<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.990> lower<00:01:25.290> down<00:01:25.970> in<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Mexico is lower down in the in the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.399 
Mexico is lower down in the in the
foothills<00:01:28.189> the<00:01:29.360> taxes<00:01:30.360> were<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.689> unfortunate

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
foothills the taxes were an unfortunate

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.330 
foothills the taxes were an unfortunate
development<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.650> hope<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.920> Mexican

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
development and I would hope the Mexican

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
development and I would hope the Mexican
government<00:01:35.759> would<00:01:35.880> riad<00:01:36.270> rest<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
government would riad rest those and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
government would riad rest those and
lower<00:01:37.350> them<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> industry<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.970> it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
lower them for the industry because it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
lower them for the industry because it's
an<00:01:39.240> important<00:01:39.630> industry<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> country

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
an important industry for the country

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.609

talk a little bit about that we've seen
just<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.480> huge<00:02:15.480> depreciation<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> currencies

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
just a huge depreciation of currencies

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.100 
just a huge depreciation of currencies
against<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> dollar<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.420> been<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.989> very

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
against the dollar it's been a very

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
against the dollar it's been a very
strange<00:02:19.560> development<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.630> as<00:02:22.140> say<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
strange development but so as say the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.640 
strange development but so as say the
Canadian<00:02:23.580> dollar<00:02:23.760> dropped<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.989> cost<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
Canadian dollar dropped the cost the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.220 
Canadian dollar dropped the cost the
production<00:02:26.340> has<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.120> effect<00:02:27.239> been<00:02:27.810> lowered

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
production has in effect been lowered

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.610 
production has in effect been lowered
and<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.730> think<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> app<00:02:31.019> for<00:02:31.349> year-end

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and so I think in the app for year-end

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.820 
and so I think in the app for year-end
we<00:02:32.130> may<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.730> some<00:02:33.120> more<00:02:33.239> write<00:02:33.480> downs<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.620> in

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
we may see some more write downs but in

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.620 
we may see some more write downs but in
the<00:02:35.040> second<00:02:35.489> first<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.970> second<00:02:36.269> quarter<00:02:36.540> of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the second first and second quarter of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.570 
the second first and second quarter of
this<00:02:36.750> year<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.200> think<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.830> lot<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.160> investors

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
this year I think a lot of investors

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.330 
this year I think a lot of investors
will<00:02:38.850> suddenly<00:02:39.450> say<00:02:39.630> I'm<00:02:39.810> surprised<00:02:40.319> by<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
will suddenly say I'm surprised by the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.100 
will suddenly say I'm surprised by the
numbers<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> gold<00:02:42.420> producers<00:02:42.959> are

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
numbers that the gold producers are

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.470 
numbers that the gold producers are
churning<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.160> because<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.269> this

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
churning out because it's this

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.130 
churning out because it's this
depreciation<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.470> dollar<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.840> going

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
depreciation of the dollar that is going

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.229 
depreciation of the dollar that is going
to<00:02:49.260> lead<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.530> much<00:02:49.980> stronger<00:02:50.400> cash<00:02:50.700> flow<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
to lead to much stronger cash flow and

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.300 
to lead to much stronger cash flow and
earnings<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.010> probably<00:02:53.010> bring<00:02:53.130> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
earnings and probably bring the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.030 
earnings and probably bring the
investors<00:02:53.790> back<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.330> sector<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:55.709> also

company a B and C what's your criteria

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.090 
company a B and C what's your criteria
well<00:05:03.479> I'd<00:05:03.720> like<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:03.990> see<00:05:04.289> production<00:05:04.530> but<00:05:05.070> I

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
well I'd like to see production but I

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.939 
well I'd like to see production but I
also<00:05:05.669> like<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.000> see<00:05:06.240> exploration<00:05:06.930> upside<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
also like to see exploration upside the

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.529 
also like to see exploration upside the
problem<00:05:08.280> with<00:05:08.370> just<00:05:08.400> buying<00:05:08.880> production

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
problem with just buying production

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.779 
problem with just buying production
right<00:05:09.720> now<00:05:09.900> is<00:05:10.169> you<00:05:11.100> probably<00:05:11.400> have<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.639> pay<00:05:11.669> a

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
right now is you probably have to pay a

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.450 
right now is you probably have to pay a
premium<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.449> if<00:05:13.380> you<00:05:13.470> pay<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.680> premium

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
premium and if you pay a premium

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.610 
premium and if you pay a premium
then<00:05:14.850> when<00:05:15.030> once<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:15.479> own<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:15.870> you're<00:05:16.440> going

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
then when once you own it you're going

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.089 
then when once you own it you're going
to<00:05:16.680> be<00:05:16.740> discounted<00:05:17.280> by<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.000> premium<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.539> paid

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
to be discounted by the premium you paid

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.159 
to be discounted by the premium you paid
so<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:21.150> need<00:05:21.360> something<00:05:21.630> to<00:05:21.840> counterbalance

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
so you need something to counterbalance

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.890 
so you need something to counterbalance
that<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:23.070> that's<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.460> exploration<00:05:24.180> upside<00:05:24.630> I

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
that and that's the exploration upside I

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.330 
that and that's the exploration upside I
like<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.560> Americas<00:05:26.840> for<00:05:27.840> our<00:05:28.020> company<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:28.770> do

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
like the Americas for our company I do

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.100 
like the Americas for our company I do
think<00:05:29.639> some<00:05:29.940> companies<00:05:30.300> in<00:05:30.450> West<00:05:30.630> Africa<00:05:31.080> are

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
think some companies in West Africa are

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.680 
think some companies in West Africa are
quite<00:05:31.410> attractive<00:05:31.979> just<00:05:32.580> in<00:05:32.849> terms<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.539> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
quite attractive just in terms of the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.930 
quite attractive just in terms of the
the<00:05:33.990> valuations<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.889> the<00:05:35.039> market<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.610> the

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
the valuations in the market and the

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.690 
the valuations in the market and the
amount<00:05:36.180> of<00:05:36.270> gold<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.750> grades<00:05:37.050> they<00:05:37.320> have

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
amount of gold and the grades they have

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.219 
amount of gold and the grades they have
you<00:05:38.700> just<00:05:38.880> have<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.210> balance<00:05:39.389> that<00:05:39.690> with<00:05:39.840> the

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
you just have to balance that with the

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.219 
you just have to balance that with the
political<00:05:40.560> risk<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.400> some<00:05:42.389> other<00:05:42.539> matter<00:05:42.870> but

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
political risk and some other matter but

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.320 
political risk and some other matter but
right<00:05:43.770> now<00:05:43.889> I<00:05:43.919> think<00:05:44.070> they're<00:05:44.310> there<00:05:44.610> there

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
right now I think they're there there

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.580 
right now I think they're there there
are<00:05:45.419> a<00:05:45.450> number<00:05:45.479> of<00:05:45.720> stories<00:05:46.110> out<00:05:46.260> there<00:05:46.320> that

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
are a number of stories out there that

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.400 
are a number of stories out there that
would<00:05:47.310> probably<00:05:47.639> look<00:05:48.060> nice<00:05:48.570> when<00:05:49.080> we<00:05:49.200> put

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
would probably look nice when we put

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.719 
would probably look nice when we put
them<00:05:49.530> together<00:05:49.680> with<00:05:49.979> us<00:05:50.099> well<00:05:50.280> a<00:05:50.310> number<00:05:50.550> of

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
them together with us well a number of

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.279 
them together with us well a number of
deals<00:05:50.940> are<00:05:51.180> made<00:05:51.210> at<00:05:51.510> this<00:05:51.660> conference<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:52.229> I

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
deals are made at this conference so I

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.900

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910
