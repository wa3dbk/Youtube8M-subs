00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you get a tiny little container here it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.100 
you get a tiny little container here it
is<00:01:14.400> compared<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> big<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.840> I'm

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
is compared to the big one see I'm

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
is compared to the big one see I'm
totally<00:01:16.439> losing<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.790> go

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
totally losing it here there we go

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.020 
totally losing it here there we go
so<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.140> tiny<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> 10<00:01:20.310> day<00:01:20.460> trial<00:01:20.759> and
