00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.540 
think there is some battery left in this
one<00:01:27.630> let<00:01:28.170> me<00:01:28.200> turn<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.770> on

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.850 

awesome<00:01:36.550> okay<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:37.960> i'm<00:01:38.440> going<00:01:38.620> to<00:01:38.680> actually

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
awesome okay so i'm going to actually

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.910 
awesome okay so i'm going to actually
review<00:01:39.370> this<00:01:39.820> radio<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.620> i'm<00:01:41.620> going<00:01:41.860> to

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
review this radio and i'm going to

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.840 
review this radio and i'm going to
compare<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:42.610> radio<00:01:43.080> with<00:01:44.080> while<00:01:44.830> cara<00:01:45.100> 2801

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
compare this radio with while cara 2801

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.870 
compare this radio with while cara 2801
pro<00:01:46.600> radio<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.260> of<00:01:47.979> course<00:01:48.280> we<00:01:48.610> are<00:01:48.700> also

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
pro radio and of course we are also

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.150 
pro radio and of course we are also
going<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.180> compare<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.750> one<00:01:50.010> with<00:01:52.110> dx7<00:01:53.160> okay

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
going to compare this one with dx7 okay

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.060 
going to compare this one with dx7 okay
so<00:01:54.490> comparison<00:01:55.390> doesn't<00:01:55.540> mean<00:01:55.930> actually<00:01:56.530> that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
so comparison doesn't mean actually that

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.890 
so comparison doesn't mean actually that
we<00:01:57.310> are<00:01:57.430> going<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.790> put<00:01:57.970> one<00:01:58.000> product<00:01:58.540> down<00:01:58.660> or

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.320 
we are going to put one product down or
one<00:01:59.110> product<00:01:59.470> up<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.800> just<00:02:00.340> simply<00:02:00.970> speaking

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
one product up is just simply speaking
