this clip we're going to show you how to
hook<00:00:05.430> up<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.700> standard<00:00:06.120> weight<00:00:06.300> distribution

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
hook up a standard weight distribution

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.170 
hook up a standard weight distribution
hitch<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.500> sway<00:00:07.710> control<00:00:07.890> device<00:00:08.460> first

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180

of<00:00:09.330> all<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.690> want<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.870> make<00:00:10.019> sure<00:00:10.139> our<00:00:10.170> trailer

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
of all we want to make sure our trailer

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.560 
of all we want to make sure our trailer
wheels<00:00:10.800> are<00:00:10.980> blocked<00:00:11.220> and<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:12.269> back<00:00:12.419> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
wheels are blocked and going back the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.089 
wheels are blocked and going back the
truck<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> ball<00:00:13.379> is<00:00:13.410> directly<00:00:13.889> under

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
truck up so the ball is directly under

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.919 
truck up so the ball is directly under
the<00:00:14.219> coupler<00:00:14.580> okay<00:00:15.480> now<00:00:15.629> we're<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the coupler okay now we're going to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.660 
the coupler okay now we're going to
lower<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.350> coupler<00:00:16.710> down<00:00:16.890> onto<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> ball<00:00:19.670> you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
lower the coupler down onto the ball you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.650 
lower the coupler down onto the ball you
don't<00:00:20.820> want<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> put<00:00:21.150> any<00:00:21.269> weight<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
don't want to put any weight on the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.740 
don't want to put any weight on the
truck<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.140> yet<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:23.340> put<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> down<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.570> far

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
truck just yet just put it down just far

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.089 
truck just yet just put it down just far
enough<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.109> where<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.349> lock<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> coupler

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
enough to where you can lock the coupler

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.599 
enough to where you can lock the coupler
down<00:00:27.650> then<00:00:28.650> we're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> take<00:00:29.130> our<00:00:29.279> spring

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
down then we're going to take our spring

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.620 
down then we're going to take our spring
bar<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.980> insert<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.180> bottom<00:00:33.330> of<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
bar and insert it into the bottom of the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.670 
bar and insert it into the bottom of the
hitch<00:00:33.750> head<00:00:34.520> making<00:00:35.520> sure<00:00:35.580> that<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.940> locks<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
hitch head making sure that it locks in

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.780 
hitch head making sure that it locks in
securely<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.010> doesn't<00:00:38.220> fall<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.460> when

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
securely so it doesn't fall out when

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.040 
securely so it doesn't fall out when
you're<00:00:38.940> traveling<00:00:40.040> back<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.310> the<00:00:41.400> bar

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
you're traveling back into the bar

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.980 
you're traveling back into the bar
we<00:00:43.050> take<00:00:43.260> our<00:00:43.410> chain<00:00:44.600> attach<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
we take our chain attach it to the

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.270 
we take our chain attach it to the
appropriate<00:00:46.140> link<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.220> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
appropriate link and that's going to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
appropriate link and that's going to
vary<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.730> little<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.060> depending<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.720> your

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
vary a little bit depending on your

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.650 
vary a little bit depending on your
exact<00:00:49.320> setup<00:00:50.000> I'm<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> hook<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.540> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
exact setup I'm going to hook it on the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.490 
exact setup I'm going to hook it on the
bottom<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.560> the<00:00:52.860> spring<00:00:53.100> hanger<00:00:54.500> generally

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
bottom of the spring hanger generally

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.740 
bottom of the spring hanger generally
snap<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> position<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.030> then

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
snap this up the position and then

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
snap this up the position and then
insert<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.200> safety<00:00:58.410> catch<00:00:58.770> into<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.430> spring

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
insert the safety catch into the spring

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.620 
insert the safety catch into the spring
hanger<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.820> attach<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.270> bar<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
hanger and then we attach the bar on the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.770 
hanger and then we attach the bar on the
other<00:01:03.750> side<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> same<00:01:04.710> way<00:01:05.570> okay<00:01:06.570> once

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
other side in the same way okay once

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.569 
other side in the same way okay once
both<00:01:06.990> spring<00:01:07.259> bars<00:01:07.469> are<00:01:07.590> attached<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.490> we

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
both spring bars are attached then we

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.539 
both spring bars are attached then we
can<00:01:08.729> lower<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> weight<00:01:09.799> down<00:01:10.799> onto<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> truck

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
can lower the weight down onto the truck

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.899 
can lower the weight down onto the truck
all<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.789> way<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.719> hitch<00:01:12.840> jack<00:01:13.640> up<00:01:14.640> off

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
