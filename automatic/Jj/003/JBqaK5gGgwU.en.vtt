00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
stretch and stretch the string a little

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.610 
stretch and stretch the string a little
bit<00:00:08.570> still<00:00:09.570> does<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> little<00:00:09.990> Twain<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.410> said

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
bit still does a little Twain you said

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.190

then<00:00:10.800> what<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> heck<00:00:11.870> it<00:00:12.870> made<00:00:13.170> a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
then what the heck it made a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.169 
then what the heck it made a
contributing<00:00:13.950> factor<00:00:14.009> maybe<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.940> there's<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
contributing factor maybe that there's a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.689 
contributing factor maybe that there's a
brass<00:00:15.710> nut<00:00:16.710> right<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:18.109> that<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.670> mean<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
brass nut right here that I mean a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
brass nut right here that I mean a
breath<00:00:20.939> exactly<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> screw<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.170> screwed<00:00:22.769> in

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
breath exactly a screw that I screwed in

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980 
breath exactly a screw that I screwed in
there<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.310> I'm<00:00:23.580> using<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.480> running<00:00:24.779> through

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
there and I'm using I'm running through

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.529 
there and I'm using I'm running through
the<00:00:25.289> string<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.830> through<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> slot<00:00:26.539> which

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the string right through the slot which

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.120 
the string right through the slot which
could<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.380> making<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.800> brats

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
could be that it's making that brats

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.930 
could be that it's making that brats
have<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.880> Queen<00:00:30.179> clean<00:00:31.130> well<00:00:32.130> sounds

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
have a little Queen clean well sounds

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
have a little Queen clean well sounds
like<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.899> somebody's<00:00:34.350> raring<00:00:34.920> back

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
like a I like somebody's raring back

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.840 
like a I like somebody's raring back
with<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> bow<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.610> arrow<00:00:37.430> but<00:00:38.430> doesn't<00:00:38.700> sound

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
with a bow and arrow but doesn't sound

00:00:38.850 --> 00:01:00.099 
with a bow and arrow but doesn't sound
you<00:00:38.969> burying<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.329> plan

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.590 

maybe<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.309> I<00:01:01.370> could<00:01:01.550> swap<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:01.999> for<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.179> nylon

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
maybe that I could swap it for a nylon

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.079 
maybe that I could swap it for a nylon
string<00:01:02.929> or<00:01:03.559> who<00:01:03.710> knows<00:01:03.890> what<00:01:04.129> or<00:01:04.460> even

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
string or who knows what or even

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.149 
string or who knows what or even
actually<00:01:05.390> redo<00:01:06.140> it<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.350> do<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.619> right<00:01:06.860> you

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
actually redo it and do it right you

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.350 
actually redo it and do it right you
know<00:01:07.250> this<00:01:07.460> was<00:01:07.610> kind<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.850> an<00:01:07.970> experiment<00:01:08.979> boy

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
know this was kind of an experiment boy

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.600 
know this was kind of an experiment boy
just<00:01:11.360> making<00:01:11.659> me<00:01:11.750> laugh<00:01:11.899> boring<00:01:12.649> it's<00:01:13.369> gotta

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
just making me laugh boring it's gotta

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.060

stop<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.030> yeah<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:15.470> kind<00:01:15.649> of<00:01:15.680> an<00:01:15.799> experiment

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
stop it yeah it's kind of an experiment

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.950 
stop it yeah it's kind of an experiment
I<00:01:16.369> thought<00:01:16.549> I'd<00:01:16.670> give<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:17.000> try<00:01:17.030> probably<00:01:17.840> if

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
I thought I'd give it a try probably if

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.420 
I thought I'd give it a try probably if
I<00:01:18.080> didn't<00:01:18.289> do<00:01:18.350> over<00:01:18.560> again<00:01:18.619> I'd<00:01:18.950> do<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.130> right

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
I didn't do over again I'd do it right

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.770 
I didn't do over again I'd do it right
but<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.850> know<00:01:19.970> you<00:01:20.030> never<00:01:20.270> know<00:01:20.509> unless<00:01:20.689> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
but you know you never know unless you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.240

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
and put a nylon string on here the nylon

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.250 
and put a nylon string on here the nylon
string<00:03:21.460> was<00:03:21.610> too<00:03:21.790> playing<00:03:22.390> E<00:03:22.540> -<00:03:22.780> it's<00:03:23.080> kind<00:03:23.230> of

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
string was too playing E - it's kind of

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.120 
string was too playing E - it's kind of
like<00:03:23.380> pointing<00:03:24.000> south<00:03:25.000> ah<00:03:25.210> hmm<00:03:26.200> what<00:03:26.890> if

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
like pointing south ah hmm what if

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.030 
like pointing south ah hmm what if
instead<00:03:27.460> of<00:03:27.870> going<00:03:28.870> for<00:03:29.050> something<00:03:29.380> smaller

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
instead of going for something smaller

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.470 
instead of going for something smaller
and<00:03:30.280> lighter<00:03:30.490> what<00:03:30.760> if<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:30.940> went<00:03:31.090> for<00:03:31.300> something

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
and lighter what if I went for something

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.740 
and lighter what if I went for something
heavier<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.140> got<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.680> had<00:03:32.830> this<00:03:32.950> pack<00:03:33.250> of

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
heavier so I got this I had this pack of

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.840 
heavier so I got this I had this pack of
strings<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:34.990> here<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.890> had<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.100> third<00:03:36.430> string

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
strings on here that had a third string

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.990 
strings on here that had a third string
that<00:03:37.090> was<00:03:37.270> a<00:03:37.300> fourteen<00:03:38.760> fourteen<00:03:39.760> millimeter

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
that was a fourteen fourteen millimeter

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.210 
that was a fourteen fourteen millimeter
now<00:03:40.420> normally<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.959> first<00:03:41.470> string<00:03:41.770> is<00:03:41.800> is

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
now normally a first string is is

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.920 
now normally a first string is is
somewhere<00:03:42.640> between<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:43.209> nine<00:03:43.420> ten<00:03:43.750> or

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
somewhere between just nine ten or

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.600 
somewhere between just nine ten or
eleven<00:03:44.200> millimeters<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:44.920> they<00:03:45.040> get<00:03:45.220> heavier

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
eleven millimeters and they get heavier

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.520 
eleven millimeters and they get heavier
as<00:03:45.730> they<00:03:45.880> go<00:03:46.030> up<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:46.870> was<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.230> light

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
as they go up but this was the light

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.250 
as they go up but this was the light
gauge<00:03:48.370> set<00:03:48.820> of<00:03:48.940> strings<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.570> never<00:03:49.989> did<00:03:50.110> like

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
gauge set of strings I never did like

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
gauge set of strings I never did like
them<00:03:50.470> very<00:03:50.500> much<00:03:50.739> because<00:03:50.830> they<00:03:51.010> were<00:03:51.100> too

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
them very much because they were too

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.150 
them very much because they were too
light<00:03:51.520> but<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.330> took<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.600> third<00:03:53.140> string<00:03:53.590> 14

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
light but I took that third string 14

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.400 
light but I took that third string 14
millimeter<00:03:54.550> put<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.480> here<00:03:55.720> with<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.020> idea

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
millimeter put it on here with the idea

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.949 
millimeter put it on here with the idea
that<00:03:56.709> since<00:03:57.430> I've<00:03:57.640> got<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.209> string<00:03:58.540> shorter

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
that since I've got a the string shorter

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.680 
that since I've got a the string shorter
if<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.620> made<00:03:59.830> it<00:03:59.950> heavier<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:01.120> wouldn't<00:04:01.450> it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
if I made it heavier it wouldn't it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.060 
if I made it heavier it wouldn't it
wouldn't<00:04:01.840> have<00:04:02.020> that<00:04:02.170> weird<00:04:02.440> noise<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.040> I

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
wouldn't have that weird noise and I

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.830 
wouldn't have that weird noise and I
think<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.670> think<00:04:03.970> I've<00:04:04.090> done<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:04.300> I<00:04:04.510> think<00:04:04.750> I've

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
think I think I've done it I think I've

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.540 
think I think I've done it I think I've
made<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.050> work<00:04:05.260> just<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:06.040> me<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.340> sounds

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
made it work just to me this sounds

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.229 
made it work just to me this sounds
about<00:04:07.239> right<00:04:07.270> that's<00:04:07.780> about<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.140> way<00:04:09.239> that's

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
about right that's about the way that's

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:10.890 
about right that's about the way that's
where<00:04:10.480> fist

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
where fist

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.399 
where fist
I<00:04:11.049> play<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.470> fist

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:28.439 

but<00:04:15.409> with<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.830> string<00:04:16.100> should<00:04:16.280> sound

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:51.170 

okay<00:04:29.449> I'm<00:04:29.660> okay<00:04:29.930> with

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.189 

which<00:04:52.180> is<00:04:52.360> still<00:04:52.570> stretching<00:04:53.050> too

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
which is still stretching too

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.510 
which is still stretching too
I<00:04:55.210> think<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.719> a<00:04:56.779> fix<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.439> good<00:04:57.650> fix<00:04:57.979> and<00:04:58.460> a

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
I think that is a fix a good fix and a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.909 
I think that is a fix a good fix and a
workable<00:04:58.849> fix<00:04:59.180> for<00:04:59.419> it<00:04:59.469> just<00:05:00.469> thinking<00:05:00.830> about

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
workable fix for it just thinking about

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.890 
workable fix for it just thinking about
redoing<00:05:01.279> the<00:05:01.490> net<00:05:01.669> putting<00:05:02.029> the<00:05:02.120> fist<00:05:02.479> tag

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
redoing the net putting the fist tag

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.700 
redoing the net putting the fist tag
back<00:05:03.110> up<00:05:03.289> here<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:06.229> I<00:05:06.319> think<00:05:06.379> with<00:05:06.680> that

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
back up here and I think with that

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.769 
back up here and I think with that
heavier<00:05:07.460> string<00:05:07.759> I'm<00:05:08.029> fine<00:05:08.270> with<00:05:08.539> it

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
heavier string I'm fine with it

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.450 
heavier string I'm fine with it
I<00:05:08.810> don't<00:05:09.050> think<00:05:09.199> oh<00:05:09.289> I<00:05:09.590> don't<00:05:10.189> think<00:05:10.279> I'll

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
I don't think oh I don't think I'll

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.189 
I don't think oh I don't think I'll
change<00:05:10.669> anything<00:05:11.120> else<00:05:11.330> except<00:05:11.719> I'll<00:05:11.840> cut<00:05:12.080> off

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
change anything else except I'll cut off

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.959 
change anything else except I'll cut off
this<00:05:12.379> long<00:05:12.590> piece<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:12.889> string<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.340> don't<00:05:13.789> poke

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
this long piece of string so don't poke

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:20.140 
this long piece of string so don't poke
me<00:05:13.999> in<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.300> eyeball<00:05:18.340> my<00:05:19.340> job<00:05:19.639> and<00:05:19.849> I<00:05:19.939> stay<00:05:20.120> out

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
me in the eyeball my job and I stay out

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.599 
me in the eyeball my job and I stay out
but<00:05:20.449> now
