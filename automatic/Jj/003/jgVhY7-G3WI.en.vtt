00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello good morning I'm paco montoro and os 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.719
 I will explain how to change a camera 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.059
 of bicycle for this we will need a 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.339
 new camera with the same addresses 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.070
 that the camera punctured or broken that 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.220
 we can observe well on the cover of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.699
 the one with the flat tire comes in the box 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.340
 of the new camera we will also need 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.039
 two removable to facilitate the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.279
 Removing the cover and a rag 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.090
 to clean us last too 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.969
 we will need a foot pump or a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.469
 mobile manual for filling the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.469
 camera replaced 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.950
 for removing the old camera 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.950
 is unmolding the wheel of the bicycle 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.760
 we will have to dismantle the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.180
 Later loosen the lever or system 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 screws that it carries and for another from is 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.950
 bet the braking system 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.299
 in this way the cave is released and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.299
 we can extract it easily 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.979
 once we have the skin outside 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.630
 with the help of the detachable 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.630
 we extract the cover 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.310
 we have to remember also about 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.220
 remove the cap, otherwise it will not let us 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.610
 then extracting the camera system 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.610
 the wheel 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 little by little with the second removable 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.540
 we are removing the cover with care 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.880
 not to damage the inner chamber 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.300
 although in this case the camera that we're going 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 to extract we are not going to repair it because 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.560
 what we want is your silhouette 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.580
 once we have part of the cover 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.780
 out of the and annotated we can already 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.629
 help us from our hand to extract 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.900
 both the cover and the camera 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.900
 inside 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.310
 we separated the goal on the one hand 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.620
 cover 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.620
 and camera has changed 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.320
 to facilitate the assembly of the new 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.280
 swelling camera we have with the help of 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.280
 manual fighter 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.439
 but only to this woman that of her 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.439
 capacity approximately 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.709
 once we have a little bloated 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.280
 it will be easier to place it inside the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.280
 convert 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.840
 once discovered camera are together 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.030
 again we proceed to place it in the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.220
 wheel 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.000
 For this we will have to first 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.959
 place the air valve in its hole 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.959
 correspondent 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.370
 and so that it does not escape we will put the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.370
 plug 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.840
 now we will think the reverse operation to 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.129
 dismantling the cover 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.129
 first with the bad 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.170
 and finally with the help of the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.170
 removable 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.670
 we will see them on camera inside 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.820
 the truth 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.010
 now you just need to put it back 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.250
 on our bike and puffed up his 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.250
 Recommended pressure 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.760
 we have already placed the wheel in its place 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.620
 keep in mind that in the tail from behind 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.600
 to carry the pinion system always 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.820
 the assembly is more complicated and 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.590
 disassembly but hey you can always 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.900
 ask for help 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.060
 lenin once assembled we have to 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.380
 invest the operations that we have done 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.479
 for disassembly 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.270
 that is, we will place the system 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.320
 generator and we will tighten the system in 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.320
 this case of levers 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.949
 once the rope is placed we will proceed 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.260
 to your total bloated up to the pressure 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.090
 recommended that as in the case of 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.660
 measurements also appear on the cover 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.660
 of the truth 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.650
 we check 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.960
 and it's ready now we can go to 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.529
 visit our yuki friend with our 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.149
 bike 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.149
 a greeting, thank you
