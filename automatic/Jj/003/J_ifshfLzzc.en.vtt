00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
worth picking up even if you're just a

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.850 
worth picking up even if you're just a
casuals<00:05:26.270> turbo<00:05:26.510> fan<00:05:26.720> these<00:05:27.290> are<00:05:27.530> what<00:05:27.740> they

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
casuals turbo fan these are what they

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.830 
casuals turbo fan these are what they
