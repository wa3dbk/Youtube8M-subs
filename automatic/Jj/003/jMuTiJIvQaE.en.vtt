00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 today the fence will concentrate his 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.550
 attention on the keyboard case for 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.550
 sony xperia tablet s 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.930
 greetings to all readers of 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.060
 androidworld.it today we make a beautiful one 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.460
 review of an accessory that can 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.360
 turn your tablet into a 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.550
 laptop has already happened that 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.720
 we have seen with asus transformer 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.360
 transformers prime tf 300 and infinites 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.910
 these are very large accessories though 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.730
 so we can say that they transform the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.190
 your tablet by inserting it into the keyboard 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.500
 in a real laptop 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.140
 the peculiarity of the solution 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.630
 adopted by sony is to be one 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.280
 case with keyboard will also arrive 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.040
 other tablets similar to this for example 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.380
 that of microsoft but not stop surface 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.400
 but this has certainly come first 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.600
 of all it is something a little false in the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 meaning that there are enclosures and accessories 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.460
 not original in the of of third parts with 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.810
 similar functions but as we will see 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.579
 this is definitely a solution 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.189
 truly innovative 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.790
 this is a folder folder then 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.830
 it looks like a diary once 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.140
 open looks like this is the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.970
 this is the very thin keyboard 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.280
 operating system with docking 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.100
 for the doc 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.870
 this is the door for recharging in 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.510
 packaging we also find this cable 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.409
 what it takes to load is a pity that 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.440
 this is a proprietary gateway for 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.299
 this involves having to still have a 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.620
 additional cable for refills 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.760
 we would have preferred it to be done 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:57.140
 with the same head of the tablet then 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.640
 I want to see what else quickly 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.030
 is present in the package 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.930
 another launch for your agenda 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.850
 instead of black light brown that i 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.940
 manuals 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.660
 this is the Italian also Italian 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.930
 practically 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.570
 a giant poster the only thing 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.760
 deserves a note is these directions for 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.590
 use accented letters or 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.470
 however, letters with characters in 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 particular this is our xperia 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:41.070
 tablet s that must be supported and then pushed 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.220
 with a click inside what happens 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.830
 happens that now let's go 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.590
 incline a little 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:56.930
 now if I go on google 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:01.110
 here it is how we see the keyboard 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.930
 is still the virtual one because this 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.140
 because this evening is activated here 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.960
 only when we pull 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.260
 on the tablet and hook it into this one 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.260
 position 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.590
 see right away that there is a baby 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.880
 basic problem the underlying problem 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.700
 lies in the fact that it is present here 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.260
 this small scale nature that is 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.620
 perfect and holds the tablet very firm 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.520
 I can assure you that it is by plane and 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.740
 on the train the tablet is really still 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.150
 in the housing the problem there 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.160
 I show from this angle is 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.920
 that the tablet stands very long 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.290
 promotional images of the keyboard 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.450
 actually show how the tablet is 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.640
 much more inclined something like that 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.970
 which would be much more comfortable though as 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.790
 see but rest on the keys instead of 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.380
 keep it so we can still approach it 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.920
 a little bit on the keys but more than that 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.970
 just it is not possible for example a 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.910
 practical example on a train 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.910
 red arrow will be almost perfect 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.040
 because the tables are very tall then 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.740
 is more likely to be up to ad 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.600
 an acceptable height on a table 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.610
 normal from a desk instead is a lot 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.660
 the view is unlikely to be 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.660
 optimal 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:31.470
 apart from this we can see how 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:34.140
 instead the keyboard works very much 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.580
 well it is a touch keyboard so not 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:46.680
 feels the rosy pressure does not feel not 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:48.980
 no need to press it 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.980
 touch 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:58.730
 as you can see the keyboard is complete 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.730
 we have the possibility to add 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.720
 accented characters by pressing first 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.740
 the accent and then the character of the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.810
 central 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.190
 we have the keys to increase lower 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:16.770
 the volume with the function key key 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.960
 with key for multitasking and for the 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.730
 uppercase 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.320
 we also have a small light for the 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:31.450
 caps lock is not active because I have 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:43.880
 attracted to here it is 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:47.360
 and closed it becomes a comfortable oops 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.610
 very very elegant agenda before 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.550
 conclude we want to show you how the 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.710
 keyboard battery that we already have 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.480
 long duration so we have we 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.070
 recharged sporadically when we are 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:05.000
 back we say between visits to the base but 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:08.510
 has never let us walk and is almost 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.640
 just a little more than the level left 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.590
 highest pine May in the lower part 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.570
 in the particular tablet then the 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.760
 size is really really reduced 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.650
 at a minimum and that's why we consider 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.550
 this completely different keyboard 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.350
 from the competition because if already won 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.670
 they remained in custody you wo n't go to 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.050
 add more thickness 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:33.980
 an example that we want to show you this 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:39.380
 is an asus transformer prime with keyboard 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:43.390
 you see the thickness and you see the thickness 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.460
 of the sony tablet which is lower 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.900
 despite having the case of course 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.240
 if we go to add to transforms the 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.730
 brain also a case the thickness 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.440
 one will become much higher 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.930
 very interesting solution that costs 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.020
 99 euros 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.250
 certainly twenty euros less 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.560
 perhaps even 30 would have been 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.680
 definitely welcome anyway a 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.240
 quality accessory so it is 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.550
 understandable how sony wants to do it 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.170
 pay if the physical evening for you is a lot 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.700
 important can be an excellent one 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.400
 solution because it is very elegant 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.400
 also keeps elegant at the idea of 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.160
 tablet that in fact is very aesthetically 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:29.660
 beautiful obviously can not disagree but 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:33.250
 certainly more particular than the 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.930
 competition with some small defect 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.830
 which we saw together in particular 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:41.890
 way lando 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:44.890
 of the tablet a greeting to all decided for 

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.890
