hearts<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.300> good<00:00:42.450> enough<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> jump<00:00:43.590> on

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
hearts really good enough to jump on

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
hearts really good enough to jump on
them<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.550> maybe<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.149> kill<00:00:45.480> them

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
them and you know maybe just kill them

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.190 
them and you know maybe just kill them
with<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:45.870> fists<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.440> something<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:48.200> would

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
with your fists or something but I would

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.439 
with your fists or something but I would
assume<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.620> good<00:00:49.770> strategy<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
assume a good strategy for this is to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
assume a good strategy for this is to
build<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.809> big<00:00:51.989> column<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.710> people<00:00:53.039> sometimes

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
build a big column like people sometimes

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
build a big column like people sometimes
do<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.149> then<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:54.989> come<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.379> look<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.739> at

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
do and then when they come to look up at

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
do and then when they come to look up at
you<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.070> try<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> kill<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.120> jump<00:00:57.539> on

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you and try to kill you just jump on

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.069 
you and try to kill you just jump on
right<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.719> kind<00:01:00.989> of

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
right on them and I'm really kind of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840

would edson your mph as you say that

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.810 
would edson your mph as you say that
like<00:04:16.540> over<00:04:16.930> there<00:04:17.050> and<00:04:17.290> all<00:04:17.800> go<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.489> my

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
like over there and all go to my

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.820 
like over there and all go to my
original<00:04:19.060> position<00:04:19.750> like<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.350> farther<00:04:20.650> up

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
original position like the farther up

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.900 
original position like the farther up
one<00:04:21.180> alright<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:24.250> you're<00:04:24.520> going<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:24.700> land

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
right there and I'm four blocks away so

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.890 
right there and I'm four blocks away so
you<00:04:28.510> can<00:04:28.720> jump<00:04:28.960> down<00:04:29.140> when<00:04:29.410> you're<00:04:29.560> ready

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
you can jump down when you're ready

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
you can jump down when you're ready
alright<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.200> four<00:04:32.710> blocks<00:04:33.100> is<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:35.320> looks<00:04:35.710> like

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
alright so four blocks is it looks like

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.340 
alright so four blocks is it looks like
that'll<00:04:36.580> do<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.510> actually<00:04:37.870> took<00:04:38.050> away

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
that'll do it that actually took away

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.500 
that'll do it that actually took away
once<00:04:39.130> again<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.490> think<00:04:39.730> four<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.480> half

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
once again I think four and a half

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.840 
once again I think four and a half
hearts<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.920> wow<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.590> he<00:04:44.890> was<00:04:45.220> probably<00:04:45.490> up

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
hearts so wow so and he was probably up

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.339 
is 19 blocks all right okay wow so that
actually<00:05:22.970> took<00:05:23.120> away<00:05:23.389> eight<00:05:23.659> of<00:05:23.810> my<00:05:23.960> hearts

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
actually took away eight of my hearts

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.640 
actually took away eight of my hearts
and<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.919> was<00:05:25.099> just<00:05:25.310> five<00:05:25.699> blocks<00:05:25.940> away<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:27.199> there

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
and I was just five blocks away so there

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.890 
and I was just five blocks away so there
wasn't<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.949> lot<00:05:27.979> to<00:05:28.190> consist<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.909> consistency

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
wasn't a lot to consist you consistency

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.260 
wasn't a lot to consist you consistency
in<00:05:30.139> that<00:05:30.319> which<00:05:30.560> i<00:05:30.680> think<00:05:30.740> is<00:05:30.979> weird<00:05:31.159> but<00:05:31.490> the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
in that which i think is weird but the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.360 
in that which i think is weird but the
ultimate<00:05:32.419> radius<00:05:33.139> for<00:05:33.409> getting<00:05:33.650> hit<00:05:33.860> is<00:05:34.099> if

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
ultimate radius for getting hit is if

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.770 
ultimate radius for getting hit is if
you're<00:05:34.520> five<00:05:34.759> blocks<00:05:35.060> away<00:05:35.270> then<00:05:35.659> you're

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
you're five blocks away then you're

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.480 
you're five blocks away then you're
gonna<00:05:35.930> get<00:05:36.139> damaged<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:36.860> you're<00:05:37.280> going<00:05:37.430> to

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
gonna get damaged and you're going to

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.140 
gonna get damaged and you're going to
get<00:05:37.639> damaged<00:05:38.030> quite<00:05:38.330> a<00:05:38.360> bit<00:05:38.629> so<00:05:39.190> i<00:05:40.190> think<00:05:40.819> it's

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
get damaged quite a bit so i think it's

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.969 
get damaged quite a bit so i think it's
however<00:05:41.659> close<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.139> are<00:05:42.289> to<00:05:42.319> our<00:05:42.620> however

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
however close you are to our however

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.800 
however close you are to our however
tall<00:05:43.969> he<00:05:44.539> jumps<00:05:45.319> from<00:05:45.469> is<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:47.180> amount<00:05:47.569> of

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
tall he jumps from is the amount of

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.499 
tall he jumps from is the amount of
damage<00:05:48.349> you<00:05:48.379> get<00:05:48.710> so<00:05:49.280> that<00:05:49.550> timing<00:05:49.940> was<00:05:50.060> a<00:05:50.120> he

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
damage you get so that timing was a he

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.439 
damage you get so that timing was a he
was<00:05:50.539> up<00:05:50.840> a<00:05:51.020> lot<00:05:51.379> taller<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.940> know<00:05:53.000> i<00:05:53.060> was<00:05:53.210> five

was up a lot taller you know i was five

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.270 
was up a lot taller you know i was five
blocks<00:05:53.719> away<00:05:53.870> i<00:05:54.020> got<00:05:54.379> eight<00:05:54.620> hearts<00:05:54.860> so

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
blocks away i got eight hearts so

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.300 
blocks away i got eight hearts so
overall<00:05:56.120> this<00:05:56.300> is<00:05:56.360> pretty<00:05:56.719> powerful<00:05:57.310> it

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
overall this is pretty powerful it

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.059 
overall this is pretty powerful it
seemed<00:05:58.969> much<00:05:59.750> less<00:05:59.780> powerful<00:06:00.379> when<00:06:00.740> i<00:06:00.770> read

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
seemed much less powerful when i read

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.200 
seemed much less powerful when i read
the<00:06:01.099> description<00:06:01.729> online<00:06:01.969> even<00:06:03.969> but<00:06:04.969> yes

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
alright so for next testing here i need

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.600 
alright so for next testing here i need
to<00:06:08.870> test<00:06:09.169> if<00:06:09.440> you<00:06:09.469> can<00:06:09.740> get<00:06:09.889> damaged<00:06:10.430> on

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
to test if you can get damaged on

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.249 
to test if you can get damaged on
different<00:06:11.120> elevations<00:06:11.719> so<00:06:11.930> go<00:06:12.080> ahead<00:06:12.139> and

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
different elevations so go ahead and

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.490 
different elevations so go ahead and
jump<00:06:12.530> down<00:06:12.740> at<00:06:13.009> soon<00:06:13.250> i<00:06:13.849> am<00:06:14.539> in<00:06:14.870> fact<00:06:15.080> close
