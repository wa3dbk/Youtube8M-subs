00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
you can say I'm insecure and I don't but

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.310 
you can say I'm insecure and I don't but
because<00:03:32.980> um<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.330> think<00:03:35.330> people<00:03:35.900> would<00:03:36.080> make<00:03:36.260> fun

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320

because um I think people would make fun
of<00:03:36.530> me<00:03:36.709> I've<00:03:37.040> grown<00:03:37.459> up<00:03:37.489> with<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.760> same<00:03:37.880> people

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
of me I've grown up with the same people

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.060 
of me I've grown up with the same people

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
all came up to me and you know I was at

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.870 
all came up to me and you know I was at
school<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.350> they're<00:04:12.500> like<00:04:12.680> oh<00:04:13.040> hey<00:04:13.340> Ryder<00:04:13.610> and

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
school and they're like oh hey Ryder and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.640 
school and they're like oh hey Ryder and
I'm<00:04:13.940> like<00:04:14.120> what<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.390> hell<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:15.019> then<00:04:15.170> no<00:04:15.410> and

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
I'm like what the hell and then no and

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.530 
I'm like what the hell and then no and
then<00:04:15.800> I<00:04:16.370> kind<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.790> put<00:04:17.030> two<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.330> two<00:04:17.359> together

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
then I kind of put two and two together

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.840 
then I kind of put two and two together
and<00:04:17.830> figure<00:04:18.830> that<00:04:18.979> Thomas<00:04:19.310> would<00:04:19.430> tell<00:04:19.700> them

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
and figure that Thomas would tell them

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.030 
and figure that Thomas would tell them
but<00:04:20.630> um<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.109> thought<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.560> was<00:04:21.620> kind<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.830> funny

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
but um I thought it was kind of funny

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.130 
but um I thought it was kind of funny
because<00:04:22.310> they<00:04:22.820> watched<00:04:23.090> my<00:04:23.330> videos<00:04:23.660> like<00:04:23.900> 10

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
because they watched my videos like 10

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.480 
because they watched my videos like 10
times<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.740> don't<00:04:25.010> know<00:04:25.070> they're<00:04:25.250> still
