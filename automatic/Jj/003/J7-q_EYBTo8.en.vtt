pretty much I go 47 to one with the
commando<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.020> people<00:00:22.470> think<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.130> this

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
commando and people think that this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
channel after that so pretty much I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.940 
channel after that so pretty much I
think<00:01:19.400> personally<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.670> black<00:01:21.150> ops<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.950> not

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
think personally that black ops and not

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
think personally that black ops and not
well<00:01:23.340> ok<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.000> better<00:01:24.180> game<00:01:24.270> overall<00:01:24.840> but

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
well ok it's a better game overall but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
well ok it's a better game overall but
it's<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:25.890> better<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.460> everything<00:01:27.030> such<00:01:27.659> as

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's not better with everything such as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's not better with everything such as
may<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.500> last<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.210> called<00:01:30.299> last<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.840> second

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
may be last is it called last no second

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
may be last is it called last no second
chance<00:01:31.500> sometimes<00:01:32.280> second<00:01:32.610> chance<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.970> get

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
chance sometimes second chance can get

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
chance sometimes second chance can get
real<00:01:33.990> annoying<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.950> call<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.490> thing

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
real annoying like I I call this thing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.550 
real annoying like I I call this thing
this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> most<00:01:37.409> annoying

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
this is this one of the most annoying

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.590 
this is this one of the most annoying
things<00:01:37.799> almost<00:01:37.920> broken<00:01:38.159> control<00:01:38.729> over<00:01:39.060> second

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
things almost broken control over second

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
things almost broken control over second
chance<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.619> fact<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.979> second

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
chance and just the fact that second

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.249 
chance and just the fact that second
chance<00:01:41.430> happens<00:01:42.030> every<00:01:42.689> time<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.079> person

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
chance happens every time the person

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.469 
chance happens every time the person
dies<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.460> running<00:01:44.729> second<00:01:45.299> chance

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
dies so so it's running second chance

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.030 
dies so so it's running second chance
you're<00:01:45.960> pretty<00:01:46.200> much<00:01:46.259> screwed<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> whole

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you're pretty much screwed for the whole

you're pretty much screwed for the whole
game<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.520> ridiculous<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.649> realized

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
game like it's ridiculous and I realized

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.719 
game like it's ridiculous and I realized
that<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.600> model<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.780> 3<00:01:52.020> as<00:01:52.229> bed<00:01:53.009> man<00:01:53.189> tan<00:01:53.460> and

that on model for 3 as bed man tan and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.630 
that on model for 3 as bed man tan and
final<00:01:54.689> stand<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:55.829> don't<00:01:56.189> happen<00:01:56.369> on

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
final stand but those don't happen on

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.280 
final stand but those don't happen on
every<00:01:56.909> single<00:01:57.030> death<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.659> person<00:01:58.110> only

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
every single death of that person only

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
every single death of that person only
happens<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.430> die<00:01:59.579> four<00:01:59.850> times<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.210> a

happens when they die four times in a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.080 
happens when they die four times in a
row<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.799> after<00:02:01.799> they<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.549> kill<00:02:02.820> in

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

row and after they get that up kill in
final<00:02:03.570> stand<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.079> before<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.100> understand<00:02:05.369> or

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
final stand or before if I understand or

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.550 
final stand or before if I understand or
whatever<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> goes<00:02:06.570> away<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.960> that'd<00:02:07.439> by

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
whatever then it goes away in that'd by

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
whatever then it goes away in that'd by
four<00:02:07.799> times<00:02:08.009> again<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.759> final<00:02:09.360> stand<00:02:09.569> at

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
four times again so final stand at

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.619 
four times again so final stand at
Manhattan<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.259> less<00:02:10.679> likely<00:02:10.790> but<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.270> very

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
Manhattan is less likely but it is very

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
and the final stand so I know what

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.470 
and the final stand so I know what
people<00:02:20.410> really<00:02:21.099> find<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.520> register<00:02:22.120> both

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
people really find out register both

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.420 
people really find out register both
those<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.020> there<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:23.860> if<00:02:23.950> we<00:02:24.040> can<00:02:24.220> deal

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
those in in there but if we can deal

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.059 
those in in there but if we can deal
with<00:02:24.700> second<00:02:25.120> chance<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.690> how<00:02:26.140> often<00:02:26.440> second

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
with second chance and how often second

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.710 
with second chance and how often second
chance<00:02:27.250> came<00:02:27.459> along<00:02:27.700> then<00:02:28.090> i'm<00:02:28.180> pretty<00:02:28.480> sure

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
chance came along then i'm pretty sure

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.360 
chance came along then i'm pretty sure
that<00:02:28.750> we<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.080> deal<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:29.800> dead<00:02:29.950> man's<00:02:30.160> hand

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
that we can deal with dead man's hand

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.300 
that we can deal with dead man's hand
and<00:02:30.670> final<00:02:31.060> stand<00:02:31.269> but<00:02:31.780> I'm<00:02:32.019> damned<00:02:32.830> final

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
and final stand but I'm damned final

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.220 
and final stand but I'm damned final

ridiculous<00:02:35.800> though<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:35.980> actually<00:02:36.459> watched<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
ridiculous though I actually watched the

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.880 
ridiculous though I actually watched the
video<00:02:37.090> where<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> guy<00:02:37.330> got<00:02:38.110> killed<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:38.650> at

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
video where a guy got killed like at

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.890 
video where a guy got killed like at
least<00:02:39.069> 50<00:02:39.640> meters<00:02:39.880> realistic<00:02:40.300> oh<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.750> dead

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
least 50 meters realistic oh the dead

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.059 
least 50 meters realistic oh the dead
man<00:02:41.080> time<00:02:41.230> was<00:02:41.349> prepped<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> predator

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
man time was prepped was a predator

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.100 
man time was prepped was a predator
missle<00:02:42.519> actually<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
missle actually think that it is the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.380 
missle actually think that it is the
same<00:02:44.260> radius<00:02:45.100> as<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.640> predator<00:02:46.000> missile<00:02:46.299> which

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
same radius as a predator missile which

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.479 
same radius as a predator missile which
is<00:02:46.510> kind<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.720> ridiculous<00:02:46.870> for<00:02:47.470> Destry<00:02:47.980> but

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
is kind of ridiculous for Destry but

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.740 
is kind of ridiculous for Destry but
they<00:02:48.700> might<00:02:48.819> have<00:02:48.940> dumbed<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.239> down<00:02:49.299> in<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
they might have dumbed it down in the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.890 
they might have dumbed it down in the
latest<00:02:50.500> package<00:02:50.860> whatever<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.090> find<00:02:52.780> that

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
latest package whatever but I find that

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.170 
latest package whatever but I find that
that's<00:02:53.110> one<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.650> main<00:02:53.890> flaws<00:02:54.280> amar<00:02:54.580> 43<00:02:54.970> is

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
that's one of the main flaws amar 43 is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.000 
that's one of the main flaws amar 43 is
the<00:02:55.239> desk<00:02:55.840> reeks<00:02:56.110> that's<00:02:56.680> something<00:02:56.890> else

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
the desk reeks that's something else

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.830 
the desk reeks that's something else
that<00:02:57.069> really<00:02:57.489> pissing<00:02:57.849> me<00:02:57.880> off<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:58.360> or<00:02:58.510> 43

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
that really pissing me off in one or 43

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.190 
that really pissing me off in one or 43
is<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.380> fact<00:02:59.799> that<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.390> killstreaks<00:03:01.390> aren't

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
is the fact that the killstreaks aren't

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.559 
is the fact that the killstreaks aren't
the<00:03:02.560> way<00:03:02.709> they<00:03:02.739> should<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.640> been<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:04.360> don't

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
the way they should have been I don't

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.330 
the way they should have been I don't
know<00:03:04.720> how<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.870> put<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.140> but<00:03:05.260> likes<00:03:05.920> for

don't<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.430> could<00:03:10.299> get<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.870> lot<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.110> kills

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
don't like it could get a lot of kills

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.110 
don't like it could get a lot of kills
it<00:03:11.650> could<00:03:11.920> help<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.340> get<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.519> little<00:03:12.790> but<00:03:12.970> for

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
it could help you get a little but for

it could help you get a little but for
me<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.530> blows<00:03:14.830> up<00:03:14.860> too<00:03:15.280> quick<00:03:15.549> for<00:03:15.580> me
