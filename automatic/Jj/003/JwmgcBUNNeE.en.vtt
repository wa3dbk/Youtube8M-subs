00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
it because i guess a lot of the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.449 
it because i guess a lot of the
GameCubes<00:02:55.620> had<00:02:56.400> um<00:02:56.790> disk<00:02:57.240> read<00:02:57.540> problems<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.430> i

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
GameCubes had um disk read problems so i

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.430
