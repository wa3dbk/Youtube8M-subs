00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
get this as a chance to get it in a log
and<00:01:15.150> reward<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.259> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> be

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and reward which it's not going to be

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
and reward which it's not going to be
too<00:01:16.950> likely<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:18.150> likely<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
too likely and more likely it's going to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.620 
too likely and more likely it's going to
be<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.320> three<00:01:19.890> day<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> seven<00:01:21.060> day<00:01:21.210> reward

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
be if a three day or a seven day reward

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.260 
be if a three day or a seven day reward
so<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:23.159> won't<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.610> your<00:01:23.729> first<00:01:23.939> day<00:01:24.119> or

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so you won't get it on your first day or

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.660 
so you won't get it on your first day or
second<00:01:24.600> day<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.560> definitely<00:01:26.250> gonna<00:01:26.580> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
second day so it's definitely gonna be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
second day so it's definitely gonna be
hard<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> from<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.380> log<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.829> award<00:01:29.040> but

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
hard to get it from a log of award but

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
hard to get it from a log of award but
you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.640> from<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.820> log<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.060> reward<00:01:30.360> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
you can get it from a log in reward so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.319 
you can get it from a log in reward so
that's<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.430> third<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.240> get

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that's that so the third way you can get

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.600 
that's that so the third way you can get
this<00:01:33.479> format<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:35.100> an<00:01:35.280> alert

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this format is going to be from an alert

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.730 
this format is going to be from an alert
reward<00:01:36.150> pretty<00:01:36.810> self-explanatory<00:01:37.049> if

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
reward pretty self-explanatory if

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560 
reward pretty self-explanatory if
there's<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.009> alert<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.520> has<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.000> form<00:01:39.210> or

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
there's an alert that has this form or

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.390 
there's an alert that has this form or
the<00:01:39.990> form<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.290> blueprint<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.189> play

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the form of blueprint you can go play

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.300 
the form of blueprint you can go play
that<00:01:41.549> mission<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.970> get<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.479> yeah<00:01:43.310> alrighty

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that mission and get it so yeah alrighty

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
that mission and get it so yeah alrighty
now<00:01:44.490> comes<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.270> nitty<00:01:45.479> gritty

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
now comes the the nitty gritty

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.100 
now comes the the nitty gritty
now<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.689> fourth

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
now this is the the for the fourth

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
now this is the the for the fourth
fourth<00:01:49.710> way<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> believe<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.270> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
fourth way I believe you can get this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.679 
fourth way I believe you can get this
it's<00:01:51.659> actually<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.110> three<00:01:52.500> different<00:01:52.590> ways

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
it's actually from three different ways

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.580 
it's actually from three different ways
now<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> void

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
now this is going to be in the void

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
now this is going to be in the void
obviously<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.969> couple<00:01:57.180> missions

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
obviously and there's a couple missions

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.940 
obviously and there's a couple missions
in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> void<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.770> have

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
in the void that you can do that I have

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
in the void that you can do that I have
usually<00:01:59.310> gotten<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.820> former<00:02:00.119> almost<00:02:00.420> every

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
usually gotten a former almost every

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.230 
usually gotten a former almost every
time<00:02:00.869> I'm<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:01.979> through<00:02:02.189> these<00:02:02.310> guys<00:02:02.430> so

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
time I'm gonna go through these guys so

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
time I'm gonna go through these guys so
the<00:02:03.840> first<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.290> you'll<00:02:04.439> probably<00:02:04.469> try<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the first one you'll probably try out is

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
the first one you'll probably try out is
a<00:02:05.340> defense<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.079> t1<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:09.479> you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a defense that is going to be t1 and you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.600 
a defense that is going to be t1 and you
have<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.379> you're<00:02:10.560> doing<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.800> t1<00:02:11.250> you'll<00:02:11.430> have

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
have to if you're doing a t1 you'll have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.350 
have to if you're doing a t1 you'll have
to<00:02:11.760> least<00:02:12.090> survive<00:02:12.450> until<00:02:12.900> leaks

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
to least survive until leaks

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.550 
to least survive until leaks
20<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:14.260> 15<00:02:14.680> minutes<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:16.000> get<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.450> drop<00:02:16.990> for<00:02:17.380> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
20 to 15 minutes to get the drop for the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.900 
20 to 15 minutes to get the drop for the
you<00:02:17.650> live<00:02:17.980> award<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.920> Performa<00:02:20.920> or<00:02:21.280> for<00:02:21.820> my

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
you live award for a Performa or for my

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.600 
you live award for a Performa or for my
blueprint<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:23.500> within<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> void<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.400> tier

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
blueprint in within the void and a tier

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.900 
blueprint in within the void and a tier
one<00:02:24.880> if<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.450> do<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.570> tier<00:02:25.900> 3<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:27.640> want<00:02:27.850> it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
one if you do a tier 3 and you want it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.430 
one if you do a tier 3 and you want it
to<00:02:27.940> survived<00:02:28.330> at<00:02:28.480> least<00:02:28.630> 5<00:02:28.930> minutes<00:02:29.170> or<00:02:29.410> 10

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
to survived at least 5 minutes or 10

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.810 
to survived at least 5 minutes or 10
minutes<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.130> you'll<00:02:30.250> public<00:02:30.520> get<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> reward

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
minutes and you'll public get a reward

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.050 
minutes and you'll public get a reward
for<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:32.020> form<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.680> blueprint<00:02:32.980> or<00:02:33.160> formula<00:02:33.820> itself

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
for a form a blueprint or formula itself

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.750 
for a form a blueprint or formula itself
so<00:02:34.390> definitely<00:02:35.050> if<00:02:35.260> defenses<00:02:36.040> those<00:02:36.550> are

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
so definitely if defenses those are

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.800 
so definitely if defenses those are
really<00:02:36.940> good<00:02:37.090> ways<00:02:37.210> to<00:02:37.240> do<00:02:37.360> it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
really good ways to do it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.560 
really good ways to do it
another<00:02:38.290> thing<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:39.150> captures<00:02:40.150> actually

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
another thing to do is captures actually

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.720 
another thing to do is captures actually
a<00:02:40.600> t1<00:02:41.140> captures<00:02:41.560> t2<00:02:41.890> captures<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.430> t3

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
a t1 captures t2 captures and t3

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.550 
a t1 captures t2 captures and t3
captures<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.330> found<00:02:43.959> out<00:02:44.050> those<00:02:44.170> are<00:02:44.260> pretty

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
captures I found out those are pretty

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.170 
captures I found out those are pretty
good<00:02:44.680> ways<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.100> if<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.790> won't<00:02:45.940> get<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
good ways to do it if you won't get a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.199 
good ways to do it if you won't get a
blueprint<00:02:46.600> usual<00:02:47.110> either<00:02:47.440> get<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.860> key<00:02:48.340> or<00:02:48.610> you

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
blueprint usual either get a key or you

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.420 
blueprint usual either get a key or you
will<00:02:49.330> get<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.780> blueprint<00:02:50.080> part<00:02:50.380> or<00:02:50.860> you'll<00:02:51.250> get

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
will get a blueprint part or you'll get

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.760 
will get a blueprint part or you'll get
a<00:02:51.660> forma<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:52.900> definitely<00:02:53.290> if<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.500> some

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
a forma so definitely if you have some

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.470 
a forma so definitely if you have some
capture<00:02:54.100> keys<00:02:54.670> definitely<00:02:55.270> use<00:02:55.360> those

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
capture keys definitely use those

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.440 
capture keys definitely use those
capture<00:02:55.810> keys<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.500> those<00:02:56.850> those<00:02:57.850> are<00:02:57.910> really

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
capture keys so those those are really

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.690 
capture keys so those those are really
good<00:02:58.600> ways<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.780> get<00:02:59.050> this<00:02:59.230> model<00:02:59.440> as<00:02:59.560> well<00:02:59.709> so

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
good ways to get this model as well so

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.820 
good ways to get this model as well so
guys<00:03:01.060> those<00:03:01.420> are<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.989> ways<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.620> get<00:03:02.770> the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
guys those are the ways you can get the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.940 
guys those are the ways you can get the
forma<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.610> warframe<00:03:04.380> now<00:03:05.380> I<00:03:05.410> did<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.709> video

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
forma in warframe now I did this video

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.590 
forma in warframe now I did this video
because<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.190> guys<00:03:06.340> really<00:03:06.820> there<00:03:07.180> was<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.330> lot

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
because you guys really there was a lot

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
because you guys really there was a lot
of<00:03:07.630> videos<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.200> there<00:03:08.320> was<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.440> couple

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
of videos on it there was a couple

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.040 
of videos on it there was a couple
videos<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:09.040> what<00:03:09.280> war<00:03:09.459> formers<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.600> think

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
videos on what war formers do I think

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.140 
videos on what war formers do I think
one<00:03:11.350> video<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.680> how<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.250> actually<00:03:12.640> get<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.120> I

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
one video on how to actually get it so I

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.699 
one video on how to actually get it so I
decided<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.690> give<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.840> guys<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.050> video<00:03:14.350> for
