00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
embraced every element of that I think

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.869 
embraced every element of that I think
it<00:02:04.910> is<00:02:05.269> the<00:02:05.660> biggest<00:02:06.369> spider-man<00:02:07.369> movie<00:02:07.670> today

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
it is the biggest spider-man movie today

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.369 
it is the biggest spider-man movie today
but<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.629> this<00:02:08.750> movie<00:02:09.019> he's<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.319> to

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
but I think in this movie he's going to

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.440 
but I think in this movie he's going to
have<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.500> confront<00:02:09.739> evil<00:02:10.310> for<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.000> first<00:02:11.239> time

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
have to confront evil for the first time

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.910 
have to confront evil for the first time
