00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 good evening eye doctors go to the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.180
 european union into a fireworks ban 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.950
 the Netherlands 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.820
 for years these doctors have been advocating such 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.290
 prohibition 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.480
 The Hague does not like it 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.370
 in the meantime the number remains 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.740
 fireworks victims are on the rise 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.910

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.930
 try to look through it but I stand 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.930

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:11.479
 percent can be no pilot can more 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.530
 fit that together so one can too 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.530
 no internet browsing 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.240
 boxes full you go full 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.310
 shares 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.110
 I am still going to participate in one 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.000
 primary school 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.560
 hundreds of fireworks glasses shared julian 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.960
 from the student is a place of residence 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.380
 to protect 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.060
 it's that simple 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.740
 there is a man in opheusden gelderland 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.329
 seriously injured by fireworks 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.340
 according to the police, hundreds 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.770
 kilos of fireworks so many illegal fireworks 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.640
 that it tidy up the of days 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.869
 takes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.820
 in the hague is a boy of twelve 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.590
 seriously injured in his hand 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.360
 by a firework bomb 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.340
 the number of victims of illegal 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.729
 legal fireworks is the last ten 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.930
 increased sharply in 2003 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.229
 the emergency department 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.420
 630 fireworks victims last year 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.369
 there were 810 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.310
 the number of hospital admissions is in that 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.630
 period even doubled to cause more suffering 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 Joerie only wants to prevent it 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.190
 professional shows he is fighting for one 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.620
 ban on consumer fireworks 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.780
 by his mother and his eye doctor okay 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.140
 here is good to see that you are there 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.000
 And here is you have not completely finished 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.450
 and I have a piece of art there 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 iris then put in and also an artificial lens 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.280
 I often wonder if they are reflected 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.500
 like fireworks hater i think fireworks 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.150
 taken by professionals and one of 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.190
 The nicest things are you with you 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.200
 eyes can see but not be the last 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.310
 what yo see for tens of millions 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.530
 which is the air annually 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.200
 shot the consequences of it they see 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.270
 here at the eye hospital in rotterdam 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.590
 they count around 300 at the end of the year 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.269
 victims 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.590
 with these numbers in hand, the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.540
 doctor at politics the hague 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.040
 but a ban on fireworks 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.720
 more sensitive than expected 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.470
 the problem is if you are there so 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.239
 shows pictures of the injuries and then 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.010
 seven out of nine politicians turn that 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.310
 photos to slide it off of itself 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.870
 away and they want it to be the real problem 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.209
 the injuries just do not look into the eyes 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.040
 Research by Eenvandaag shows that 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.480
 there is certainly support from society 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.830
 is for a ban 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.819
 a vast majority of the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.860
 adults want from it 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.480
 consumer fireworks 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.130
 we also asked young people for their opinion 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.209
 the group that most fireworks 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.880
 stands out 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.400
 40 percent support to ban but that 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.500
 also means that 60% of the youth del 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.269
 like fireworks the most 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.950
 heard argument it is simply 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.680
 tradition and if you have that fireworks the sky 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.530
 go north what do you think than I think 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.920
 just that can just be a victim again 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.590
 to be 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.049
 what bothers me the most is that half 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.120
 of those victims bystanders he it 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.519
 are people who are not themselves with fireworks 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.290
 busy and who are actually victims 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.370
 be by someone's step package 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.290
 different 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.190
 by a fireworks tradition that mine 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.799
 in my opinion 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.090
 completely out of control is the 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.100
 ophthalmologists lift heavy them 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.750
 social responsibility and 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.769
 if the hague does not listen then just 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.420
 higher on 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.340
 she wants the ban now via europe 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.829
 therefore we are like 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.880
 European eye doctors this year for it 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.070
 first started at 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.250
 eye damage from fireworks in european 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.289
 You can only measure the connection in Brussels 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.720
 knock on if you have data 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.459
 Have details of what the damage is due to 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.259
 fireworks 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.150
 first and we are going ahead this year 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.590
 do it first 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.190
 Here it is sometimes kept awake at 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.319
 floating blow here besides personal injury 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.300
 there is also a lot of nuisance from fireworks 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.979
 something that Groenlinks is excited about 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.319
 party leader in rotterdam arno 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.910
 colorful takes us to the old west 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.650
 this is such a neighborhood where indeed very 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.080
 a lot of fireworks are lit. 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.669
 well before old and new and we whole 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.449
 many complaints on our reporting point also about 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.729
 enter 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.099
 throw mailboxes very often there 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.979
 we grow as much as possible 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.449
 damage can focus 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.639
 just like last year, the party has one 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.020
 hotline opened there are already more than 11,000 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.389
 complaints within 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.610
 last year the counter ticked the 80,000 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.229
 The purpose of the list is also a 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.610
 ban on consumer fireworks 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.410
 and that is why we like that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.070
 reporting point started to be shown 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.440
 bring 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.789
 no matter how big the nuisance is to leave 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.490
 see him what needs to happen 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.169
 but last year they got you 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.150
 results just put aside why 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.729
 they would not do that this year 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.610
 well i hope the second room also sees 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.070
 that there is more and more among the Dutch 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.199
 support comes for a change to the 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.699
 fireworks tradition and no longer for everyone 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.370
 set off that firework because that 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.900
 gives those big problems central 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.180
 professional and fireworks show 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.070
 organize in every municipality 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.690
 groenlinks continues with the hotline and 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.650
 will continue to press for the coming years 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.900
 a ban 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.539
 just like jury and his eye doctor i have one 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.130
 long breath i said i hope i will 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.650
 for retirement this is this 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.259
 is settled or do you still have 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.830
 still people c 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.179
 how much you will soon old and new 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.179
 hopefully not hurt now 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.160
 you can already hear it from researching it 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.229
 even days opinion panel below more than 20,000 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.629
 members show that nearly two-thirds of the 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.509
 is for adults such fireworks ban 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.509
