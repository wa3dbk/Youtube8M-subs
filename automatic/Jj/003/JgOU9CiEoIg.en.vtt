00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.280
 Nevertheless, what was delicious pack was

 that you try my trees 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.270
 but after packing and because 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.430
 There are multiple wishes today 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.280
 low in calories and then off to the kitchen 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.600
 and let's go and see here where 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.040
 all our ingredients we 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.579
 need butter like cocoa powder 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.090
 icing walnuts flour eggs and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.559
 brown sugar then we put too 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.540
 Let's get started with the butter 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.440
 later mix better lets cut 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.340
 like those in small pieces 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:19.000
 and give it to our bowl and to it 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.000
 there are still brown sugar eggs 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.050
 and the sifted cocoa powder 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.560
 now seven we our baking powder over 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.330
 the flour mix that together and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.460
 give that back through the sieve in 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.620
 our shell and now everything will come along 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.080
 a hand mixer together 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.630
 mixed for about two to three minutes 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.830
 Stay that way through until one 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.670
 smooth creamy dough has emerged 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.930
 Now we say our walnuts and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:02.940
 gradually give it to ours 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.960
 chocolaty dough of course 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.790
 we must not forget ours 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.260
 to embed baking mold so that the cake 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.090
 does not stick later 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.720
 Now we give the dough in the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:20.370
 embedded baking mold and elapse 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.209
 him evenly and now comes 40 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.010
 to 45 minutes in the oven for the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.730
 Just cake the last ten minutes 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.400
 Loose with aluminum foil cover so or it 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.790
 already finished and must first 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.310
 Hand warmers cool for our course 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.020
 Let's put the butter in a bowl 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.599
 7 Add the cocoa powder and roast 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.910
 spoonful four tablespoons cooking 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.790
 including water and stir the so- 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.370
 long to a nice smooth creamy 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.500
 cream has emerged and now we give 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.900
 our complete powdered sugar again 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.599
 through the sieve to our smooth 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.910
 schoki cream and now he mixed 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.489
 everything together is a small one 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.810
 tricky thing with her must 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.640
 really try the whole 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.510
 powdered sugar with the chocolate cream too 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880
 connect 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.739
 you are welcome to take your hands for it 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.950
 and then you make a nice smooth one 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:27.090
 Ball out now you roll our little 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.950
 ball looks like a biscuit dough and 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.930
 then support him on our brownie cake 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.730
 and then carefully remove it from the board 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.500
 the excess edge easy 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.769
 Cut off and if you have gaps 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.630
 just stuff it with the bus and 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.590
 then the bus a few and careful 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.220
 smooth something out 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.540
 plumps dari overturned and then we are 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.560
 already done and you can do that 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.560
 cut cake into pieces 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.090
 It is often successful and visually 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.580
 are really good and smells delicious 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.860
 then something is marita - allergic 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.930
 so if pointed sharpened on MÃ¼nster 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.710

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.480
 Of course, omitting was not long 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.480
 Just snatch off 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.449
 do not believe too dry 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.180
 We all know dust- dry cakes 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.710
 We all taste naked and I think 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.900
