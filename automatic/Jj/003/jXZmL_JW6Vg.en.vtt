10,000 is quite a lot of subscribers so

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.810 
10,000 is quite a lot of subscribers so
as<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.320> probably<00:00:16.500> guessed<00:00:16.830> why<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.369> done<00:00:17.609> is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
as you probably guessed why I've done is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.290 
as you probably guessed why I've done is
I've<00:00:18.090> recreated<00:00:18.500> Super<00:00:19.500> Mario<00:00:19.710> Brothers<00:00:20.300> it's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
I've recreated Super Mario Brothers it's

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.650 
I've recreated Super Mario Brothers it's
the<00:00:21.480> first<00:00:21.689> level<00:00:22.400> it's<00:00:23.400> fully<00:00:23.730> functional<00:00:24.269> -

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the first level it's fully functional -

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.300 
the first level it's fully functional -
a<00:00:24.840> few<00:00:25.050> features<00:00:25.350> because<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.619> were<00:00:25.680> kind<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
a few features because they were kind of

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
a few features because they were kind of
impossible<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.820> add<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.170> general

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
impossible to add but the general

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
impossible to add but the general
structure<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.580> works<00:00:29.820> pretty

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
structure is there and it works pretty

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.460 
structure is there and it works pretty
well<00:00:30.900> actually

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
well actually

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.580

game<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:47.280> try<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.580> squish<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.800> goombahs

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
game to try and squish the goombahs

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.050 
game to try and squish the goombahs
distract<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:52.100> there<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.460> pipe<00:01:53.820> actually

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
distract it there is a pipe actually

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.730 
distract it there is a pipe actually
leads<00:01:54.540> somewhere<00:01:54.900> down<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:56.300> okay<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:57.510> then

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
leads somewhere down there okay and then

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.980

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.770 

power-ups<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.900> eventually<00:02:19.680> died<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:21.750> I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
power-ups and eventually died now I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.960 
power-ups and eventually died now I
don't<00:02:22.019> think<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.470> can<00:02:22.769> really<00:02:23.489> properly

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
don't think I can really properly

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.820 
don't think I can really properly
explain<00:02:24.390> how<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.690> all<00:02:24.780> works<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.319> one<00:02:25.470> video<00:02:25.620> so

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
explain how it all works in one video so

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.229 
explain how it all works in one video so
I<00:02:26.099> might<00:02:26.459> actually<00:02:26.610> leave<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:26.910> for<00:02:27.180> another

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
I might actually leave that for another

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.059 
I might actually leave that for another
