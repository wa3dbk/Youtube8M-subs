00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.020
 being with you is that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.870
 most important thing in life is anything 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.440
 incidental 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.670
 Do you want yes I am I have in front of you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.470
 I hardly die at first 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.189
 Meaning I stand with my back to the wall 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.949
 I prepare everything before 625 km 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.890
 about 20 million I know why me 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.890
 It also makes a nice ring 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.899
 would need to know how much he is worth a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.340
 Jurassic diploma is a license to steal 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.940
 but you have the capital out of it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 beaten 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.280
 I'm really scared it 'll be all 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.899
 good if you continue the way you 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.370
 they will have chosen sometime from 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.750
 moral decisions are made 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.750
 completely surprise her 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:06.340
 Be careful not my problem 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.259
 the delivery is gone 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.469
 our business partners called 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.579
 the 24 million 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:17.560
 they think we're all in it 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.670
 or no just you chancellor you believe that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.770
 not by chance 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.789
 they have heard of it but never before 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.789
 you see, you get in trouble 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.140
 if the abyss before the on tour 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.140
 I will be gone long ago 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.290
 What should I do now 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.920
 how bad is it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.000
 we are done here 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.550
 it is too late 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.550
 I can disappear, too 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:02.430
 what awaits us now 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.430
 we can not even imagine 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.759
 they are the world they created 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.310
 and if it will exist on 1 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.599
 the world they created 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.599
 also would exist
