00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.500
 good 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.580
 and here now more and more in this in 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.580
 this is looking for my life but 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.300
 once again 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.480
 I think I feel that in this character 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.050
 I have to tell you important things and 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.829
 although it 's like a joke but let's 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.829
 remove the wig 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.620
 he's going to take it from me because I want to talk 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.840
 with mario that moral 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.870
 I just broke the illusion of several 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.140
 children you will cry and I do not want to cry 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.160
 no it is not the intention is to stretch is 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.290
 simply that I am very emotional 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.100
 At the beginning of the program we play themes 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.780
 very nice very nice but the day of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.440
 today the production chose me to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.000
 I would like to thank you for these seven years 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.079
 that you have shared that they are very 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.440
 important in your life 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.530
 we want to thank you 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 because thanks to you each one of those who 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.690
 we are here we are what we are each 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.510
 one of the characters that people 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.600
 he admires and he sees them big there is no one 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.909
 more in this study 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.840
 that made them bigger than mario 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.360
 Bezares and your roses and sometimes you do not 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.820
 and sometimes we say to ourselves 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.580
 let's forget we believe that we can 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.290
 do everything on their own and when they are 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.600
 in other programs and be working 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.810
 with other people we realize that here 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.340
 the only big one and the only one with talent 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.340
 real are you 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.750

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.280
 that we do many of those that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.979
 we are here we have reached many 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.990
 things goals that we did not imagine that the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.700
 channel is proud of us but the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.100
 channel is I borough very proud of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.319

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.239
 you and above all of international stature 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.819
 because you are and you know it and you know what it is 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.459
 the best you never presume and that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.860
 you never say it and people I think that in 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.930
 these seven years you have to find out 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.560
 everything you have done of all that 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.840
 you are and that you shut up and you make us 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.239
 see great to us and as if 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.150
 we were very talented and we had 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.760
 a lot of trajectory but really the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.390
 you are great and you share it with 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.620
 us and I am not strict March 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.060

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.030
 bitter head I will 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.130

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.340
 for being 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.160
 not a boss for being our friend and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.130
 share what is most valuable 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.500
 that you have in your heart that always 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.240
 trust and have faith and above all what 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.200
 you carry the gift that God gave you that is 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.200
 the talent you have 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.480
 because 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.340
 it is necessary to say that it's my turn 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.569
 say it because I have no hair in the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.620
 tongue can eat 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.349
 whoever faces any size to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.819
 any driver or driver and nobody 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.819
 can against love 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.810
 I know you can be in a rally and you can 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.120
 have blows and vomit dressing 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.660
 horses 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.490
 of crazy to invite us but the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.460
 Sir 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.560
 and nobody can imitate him and nobody is going to 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.390
 win because he has faith in someone who 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.390
 it's up there and it shows every day 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.160
 It is true 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.160
 and being me 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.500
 in this humble you never share that 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.290
 in the cameras or meetings 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.410
 or with the people everything you get inside 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.600
 you shut it up really big cases and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.950
 you are one of the greatest of this 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.950
