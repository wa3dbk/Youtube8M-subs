activates<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:44.160> let's<00:00:44.430> say<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> get<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> thing

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
activates like let's say you get a thing

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
activates like let's say you get a thing
it's<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.780> crit<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.620> move<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it's just like crit with this move and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.760 
it's just like crit with this move and
then<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.940> move<00:00:48.000> does<00:00:48.539> more<00:00:48.750> damage<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.620> be

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
then this move does more damage that be

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.189 
then this move does more damage that be
a<00:00:49.800> proc<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.149> crit<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.600> thing<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
a proc so like you crit with a thing and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
a proc so like you crit with a thing and
then<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.890> damage<00:00:53.430> increase<00:00:53.910> from

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
then that that damage increase from

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.229 
then that that damage increase from
getting<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> crit<00:00:55.320> from<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> other<00:00:56.579> move<00:00:56.940> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
getting the crit from that other move I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.369 
getting the crit from that other move I

copper and that gives you the clues

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:34.069 
copper and that gives you the clues
faster<00:01:29.310> than<00:01:29.630> not<00:01:30.630> paying<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:33.079> couple

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
