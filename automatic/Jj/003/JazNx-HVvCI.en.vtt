00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 one of the objectives of rural consultancy 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.670
 black river is to qualify workers 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.410
 rural

 we will now see the tratorista course 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.880
 located in the northwestern part of Minas Gerais 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.640
 The Rio Negro Rural Consultancy offers 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.730
 today a complete structure to meet 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.699
 pastoralists and farmers in the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 and implementation of the management 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.550
 health and the environment. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.410
 black river things here on the farm go 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.180
 modifying this property by 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.850
 example, a new 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 dormitory for workers 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.920
 this represents respect and more 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.190
 quality of life for employees 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.699
 according to the norm nr is we have to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.590
 build a housing is with the foot 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.140

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.020
 he will have a rest here end of the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.640
 of the expedient will have a good budget 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.930
 Arrive to rest for the day. 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.200
 returning to work 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.720
 infrastructure improvements. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.360
 rural property and the provision of 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.430
 personal protective equipment 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.340
 Another important factor is the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.250
 awareness of rural workers 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.829
 the actions of the consultancy in this area are 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.350
 through the courses and 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.799
 trainings with theoretical and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.689
 practices including first aid 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.270
 but it is very usable so it is 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.729
 important to have a service like 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 outside at home and on the street is a 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.149
 Anac's testimony 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.890
 If something happens, it's already over. 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.659
 prepared to help is a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.220
 person who needs the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.890
 main objective of ours 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.200
 today is such that empowering employee 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.030
 for day to day activities is all 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.320
 employee as soon as he passes the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.500
 machine operator has to make a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.079
 qualification course in order to have a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.819
 how is it to operate the machine to make a check 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.710
 list on the machine in the morning that arrives at 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.220
 check 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.680
 oil means water from the machine and see if 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.110
 have extinguishers in stockpiles also been 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.630
 whether or not such an employee is aware of how 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.780
 operate the machine on the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.600
 tratoristas with duration of 16 hours 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.690
 the professional learns the proper use and 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.000

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.020
 individual and on a track prepared with 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.630
 barriers 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.880
 I have learned to perform maneuvers with 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.160
 control over the machine that is 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.920
 conducting all course content 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.130
 comply with the provisions of the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.660
 for the sector 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.480
 according to the Ministry of 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.800
 work is you can not with the activity 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.990
 without first passing a course of 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.160
 training is equal to the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.690
 driver 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.220
 you can not pick up a vehicle without first 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.950

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.960
 financial and increase productivity 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.720
 the well-trained operator is a requirement 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.140
 necessary to enable efficient use of 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.100

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.770
 and lower operating cost 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.930
 these beacons and hides in vain 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.900
 make a slide with them will make a 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.850
 simulation of working in locations with 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.270
 difficulty of access and I want 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.010
 analyze also speed want to analyze 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.880
 how to get on the machine with 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.370

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.180
 This care to know how to walk forward 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.130
