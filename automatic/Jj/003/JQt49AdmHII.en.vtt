00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.380
 so percent a year that's the money 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.630
 currently a lot of things to explain other 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.699
 I hope you understood well until Monday 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.699
 % now 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.460
 mr to adapt our our little animation 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.800
 so we're gonna do not feel why I took the project remains because I 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 find that it gives in France in paris a click on the typhoon 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.110
 we come here 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.810
 other sector desert patrick the promotion 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900
 that opens us to a new page 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.390
 fun tool 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.260
 click on playful tools 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.670
 eyi double ticket on gautier lipstadt head 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.280
 and that of greenhouse 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.720
 the last at the casino and left surfaces 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.760
 this model saas bank a mask that we would have created a mask 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.450
 alas that too close to 7% Monday in this very pretty state 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.430
 the side by side the capsules 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.350
 so we'll see even if you're like that while we're talking to the master 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.789
 and there we saw his new before going to the end of his nose 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.269
 now there is no more masked so with the click on the registered team 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.910
 one click mascara 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.100
 so this is our mask dollars of dunkerque holdings 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 one o'clock 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.360
 the two parameters that are open but it's about the school climate the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.730
 progressive contour 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.270
 the layout of the minck 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.910
 the opacity of the minck and the text 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.440
 the game would not be anyway 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.570
 I think if I think it will be so fast 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420
 the mask does it 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.120
 no matter 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.330
 ap 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.980
 while geometry precision to what we will do it later because 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.950
 it serves 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.730
 according to the progressive contour, it is said to be destroyed the attraction for precisely 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.030
 possible afraid it will be against progressive 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.189
 more to do results that really give that rips 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.350
 for the afom it gives the room 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.770
 then estimated at 335 euros 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.620
 additionally implement in some areas go back 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.780
 the opacity of the mask you know him 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.640
 our abilities he comes back here 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.920
 or he is hungry 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.869
 transfer but it's the same cssa not mentioned except that 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:03.990
 his capacity 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.820
 in the title to train 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.689
 it's the opacity of 2 that all the solid 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.110
 tadic place between his abilities until then what does unfortunately exist 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.829
 will not see any difference 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:14.829
 2% 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.239
 we can not deny 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.049
 alone 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.899
 we can associate 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.989
 you see the difference so it's smaller and bigger 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.849
 m this date 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.629
 the clarence sea e we have no term to add a key 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.469
 we just added the full contest below it's a bit like some 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.469
 it's stagnation it's not moving it's still like that 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.909
 in the farm and 2 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.909

 the text by the fame of the arrangement van den broeck guardian 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.950
 sorting afp 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.789
 the icon 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:54.909
 a third 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.799
 the tree to select it to scan it 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.929
 you are outside we could see the arrow appears 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.219
 first because here could not move it but if you go in 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.869
 the outside of the text you can always control 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.409
 two free midi columns 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.689
 you really see it you see the anchor it's there 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.689
 two anchor points up to the weld 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.269
 lacroix the household after percent 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.289
 in fact 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.509
 we select next 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.069
 this time 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.309
 a match that can believe them and if we run animations that makes me that so 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:30.269
 it's absolutely nothing we would like to have an hour 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.299
 it's a change anyway 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.499
 in the past stewardship seconds 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.539
 the anchor in the green 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.699
 she takes over the pattern is completed I am breeder used 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.379
 for this beautiful Eid a 100% companion 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.279
 we attribute people did not transform 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.759
 - many other basic compared to its positions hl 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.299
 to be sure not to quote 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.679
 so we'll move and the position before the 6th failure 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.189
 the army had recognized 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.189
 a click on the scale stopwatch 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.489
 at two seconds 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:14.029
 for sandra gini excuse me excuse me we come back to 0 score 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.310
 we come back that dare to contradict brand 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.159
 we are on the same foot here it's done 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.400
 Saint-AndrÃ© 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.969
 laval at the key is yannick politician 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.979
 m besides it rained 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.979
 the concert mazin rise account 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.330
 not in vain the highest possible 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
 the scale 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.949
 still be 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.949
 the greatest possible 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.900
 since she uses the image 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.710
 not far from here 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.710
 benjamin hour mallet by getting back to two seconds 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.620
 mrs cherel interview 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.080
 maybe a little bigger 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.210
 so at 12% in the same Serbian boat 100% logically excuse me 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.210
 he was there we see the difference because I'm doing that criticized on the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.389
 spacing bar and that would have made us 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.439
 an animation 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.659
 pretty friendly 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.159
 so 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.129
 tutor and agricultural 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.300
 Pasadena prefers it from there for that I think euros more than if you 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.279
 have followed 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.779
 My tutor 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:40.159
 told us that I lost that match to four seconds and you had money 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.370
 in this sense the aforesaid 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.279
 the pope quoted hlm 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.580
 and I play but until when is more 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.949
 the balloon the only the problem why because 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.400
 I will pass maybe you will think that La Liga 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.749
 this stage of a little while and he will leave 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:57.369
 and precisely because we did not have a good party 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.909
 that he had to be able to two seconds which remains a little while and 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.309
 after who leave 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.220
 the court and the mage passed like you 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.090
 our case that stands in basle and it gives me flavor is not the 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.860
 very young 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.330
 so we'll say so we have the secret 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.360
 dandy that you have to stay 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.550
 the first is emotional stay up to 1 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.629
 not only that three years is three seconds 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:24.060
 in some areas like the study credited here 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.150
 but complicated 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.330
 added a key 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.139
 a click here and it does not stop added a key that a tribe 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.389
 so clear the Iraqis in our caravans 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.689
 taki who this stage 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:37.430
 and to the recipe 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.059
 second time racket 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:41.669
 and greenhouse blades 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.669
 michel 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:50.540
 and percent and we can also create when we have not quoted 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.589
 so at the top here is back 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.490
 the quote for that 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.330
 at the arena at four seconds 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.689
 she from 5 to 0 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:03.039
 elana and that would have given us a place in the center in culture 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.039
 preview 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.130
 problem 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.369
 the welcome of the space of which you have the prayer 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:14.259
 so people to play really make several mistresses of the sale 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:15.439
 basic 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:17.259
 you enjoyed it 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:18.779
 %

 an explosion 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.680
 at a physics shot 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.990
