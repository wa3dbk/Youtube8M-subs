Rebecca just so many different muscles

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
Rebecca just so many different muscles
that<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:34.080> activated<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:34.770> using<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.460> lead

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that are activated by using this lead

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.420 
that are activated by using this lead
that<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> best

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
that it's I think it's one of the best

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.090 
that it's I think it's one of the best
the<00:00:39.550> reasons<00:00:39.880> why<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.840> clean-and-jerk<00:00:41.470> is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
the reasons why the clean-and-jerk is

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.970 
the reasons why the clean-and-jerk is
one<00:00:42.700> of<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.030> exercises<00:00:43.840> one<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.470> bets

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
one of the exercises one of the bets

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.030 
one of the exercises one of the bets
that<00:00:45.130> they<00:00:45.280> have<00:00:45.520> in<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.930> Olympic<00:00:47.260> Games<00:00:47.470> this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
that they have in the Olympic Games this

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.920 
that they have in the Olympic Games this
is<00:00:48.310> because<00:00:48.670> it's<00:00:49.150> kind<00:00:49.360> of<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.510> sign<00:00:49.780> of

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
is because it's kind of a sign of

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.010 
is because it's kind of a sign of
overall<00:00:50.350> strength<00:00:51.310> so<00:00:52.150> first<00:00:52.720> thing<00:00:52.930> I'm

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
overall strength so first thing I'm

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.740 
overall strength so first thing I'm
going<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.230> do<00:00:53.380> is<00:00:53.790> I'm<00:00:54.790> going<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.090> make<00:00:55.480> sure
