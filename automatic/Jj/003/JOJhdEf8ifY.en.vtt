00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.590
 what have a pair of underpants 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.870
 vaulted cellar and paris with each other 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.269
 together worth nothing to say now 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.789
 I say the opposite, we are here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.840
 in paris and look at the new quest 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.490
 for epic invited 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.890
 So why we are a vaulted cellar 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.750
 is clear why we presence too clear 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 But that's why I put the pants on 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.710
 has the head and why that something with 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 could have something to do with the game 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.160
 let's take a look at this here 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.850
 is our contribution or mighty quest 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.850
 for happy klude 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.559
 in action roleplay the quest for epic 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.420
 lud you meet a new genre mix 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.789
 from tower defense and hack and slay 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.679
 It's also about neat, of course 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.960
 invited and the fat gold treasures yours 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.270
 opponents fundamentally, however, two 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.549
 elements in the game 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.439
 the first is the defense in one 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.000
 castle that you can design yourself is 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.310
 at the end of a long way or 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.570
 hidden gold treasure and it applies 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.820
 of course to protect 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.920
 Numerous fall and serve for this purpose 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.929
 monsters you distribute in your castle 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.429
 you can ask the other players for yours 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.170
 coal want to fight off 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.210
 depending on the level you are of course 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.190
 ever stronger defense units to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.840
 disposal 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.789
 the second element is others 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.679
 to invade and try in a bow 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.819
 hack and slay manner in the opponent 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.560
 treasure chambers to come 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.390
 Here you can between the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.229
 archer or the sword fighter 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.909
 decide 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.740
 the characters can of course 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.289
 armaments and new weapons 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.390
 Special skills are upgraded 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.229
 However, the game learns more about the game 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.170
 now in an interview 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.819
 Ok, please introduce yourself 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.050
 of course my name is you want that 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.319
 really pull through without it again to 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.009
 mention or we will do it afterwards 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.229
 then everything clear 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.209
 my name is matthew sec and i left 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.340
 script ladder of the mighty quest for 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.200
 peace okay there is an underpants 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.300
 feature in the game explains us 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.879
 what exactly underwear and knight one 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.230
 play together 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.940
 underwear and twitter have in common 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.920
 that they are both very dangerous 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.370
 you can and you with the necessary 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.659
 But seriousness must be encountered in the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.400
 play itself becomes the knight 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.739
 or all other characters 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.629
 even if you have all your items stored 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.050
 have a small part of theirs 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.909
 personality get going because what's there 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.620
 more personal than the style of yours 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.480
 favorite underwear not very much 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.069
 I would say the knight that 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.849
 classic heart motif on his 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.760
 boxer shorts 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.190
 The Sagittarius, on the other hand, is something 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.180
 old-fashioned full body baby bodysuit 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.180
 but also confirm very well 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.159
 Let's see if the next question something 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.110
 becomes more serious what else is there 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.790
 winless features in the game I mean there 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.370
 is there any quantity gives us one 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.379
 example, you're talking about more here 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.230
 funny features came into existence so what's there 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.879
 underwear feature one of my 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.150
 Favorite features is my opponent 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.829
 can mock as you see yourself 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.640
 was when you played 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.109
 We have many competition aspects in the game 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.549
 something we want to push is the 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.489
 friendly match between 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.950
 something special to the players 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.780
 because friends like to do is after them 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.069
 a successful attack a small one 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.870
 to send mockery 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.549
 and if I'm that special 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.500
 injured designed I send mine 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.560
 scratches in his underwear in the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.790
 fight and there comes the underwear 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.950
 motive again into the game 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.209
 what is more embarrassing than from a man in 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.209
 Underpants to be defeated 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.359
 the most important aspects of the game are 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:01.000
 probably attack and defend what from 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:02.889
 Both are more important now that one would 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.569
 and the other does not work that way 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.099
 runs the game for all you in 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.440
 play attack or by someone else 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.180
 it would not have been placed there 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.829
 defense you have nothing 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.959
 to attack and vice versa 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.400
 the game is about a good one 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.630
 balance between these two 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 to find something 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.900
 if I do not defend my stuff 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.789
 I'll go to work someday and 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.720
 later in the game, oh man me 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.490
 lost gold 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.490
 I should defend it once 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.180
 but at the same time there is mine 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.860
 individual playing style to many 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.169
 Of course others will have it too 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.820
 There is also a replay feature where you can 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.889
 a repetition of the attack 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.389
 look and find out where it is 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.310
 weaken your own defense 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.080
 there or you get directly new ones 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.500
 tips and strategies on how to intervene 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.300
 can 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.460
 therefore, I think that these two 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.320
 Aspects must exist side by side 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.470
 and that is one of our strengths in 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.470
 game 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.680
 fall or monster so i am one 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.110
 monster man though i am also a big one 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.640
 fan of the hamsterrad trap but I am 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.440
 find it good if you have something in the 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.440
 eyes can see before that arrived 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.810
 sword or bow definitely the sword 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.490
 but also the hammer so right 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.530
 strong war summer I really have fun 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.690
 the last question is epic lud 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.940
 Of course you like people all the time 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.560
 a lot of special items or items in the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.150
 general there is in the game if I 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.910
 I remember correctly in the 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.190
 last count to the 4000 unique 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.600
 items that can be found in the game 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.640
 but that is only the tip of the 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.680
 icebergs are fun with them 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.990
 Name items with funny looks 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.610
 there is one that is just betty 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.290
 and are great and everything 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.970
 In between, we still have everything 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.840
 already in the game and it will still be 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.670
 come 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.540
 as you say that is just the same 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.540
 name of the game
