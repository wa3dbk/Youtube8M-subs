end up going like 22 and nine and we

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
end up going like 22 and nine and we
ended<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.520> making<00:01:20.729> these<00:01:20.939> kids<00:01:21.210> leave<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
ended up making these kids leave and I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
ended up making these kids leave and I
had<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.500> had<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.650> party<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> three<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.330> were

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
had I had a party of three and we were

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
had I had a party of three and we were
all<00:01:24.570> using<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> same<00:01:25.049> gun<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
all using the same gun it was a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.569 
all using the same gun it was a
peacekeeper<00:01:26.610> quick-draw<00:01:27.330> silencer<00:01:27.900> with

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
peacekeeper quick-draw silencer with

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.380 
peacekeeper quick-draw silencer with
lightweight<00:01:29.630> dexterity<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:32.390> for

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
lightweight dexterity and I think for

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.590 
lightweight dexterity and I think for
the<00:01:33.479> second<00:01:33.810> perk<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.200> use<00:01:35.600> obviously

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the second perk we use obviously

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.530 
the second perk we use obviously
toughness<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.729> secondary

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
toughness and for the for the secondary

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.690 
toughness and for the for the secondary
we<00:01:39.810> used<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.290> tomahawk<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:40.950> triple<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
we used a tomahawk with triple with a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.030 
we used a tomahawk with triple with a
triple<00:01:42.119> bang<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.649> actually<00:01:43.770> got<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
triple bang on it and I actually got a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.310 
triple bang on it and I actually got a
lot<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> cool<00:01:44.430> kills<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> watch

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
lot of cool kills in this if you watch
