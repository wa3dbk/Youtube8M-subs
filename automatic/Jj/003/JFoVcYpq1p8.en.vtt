this<00:00:37.790> particular<00:00:39.890> run<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.010> furnaces<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.880> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
this particular run of furnaces was that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.240 
this particular run of furnaces was that
Hyland<00:00:42.809> assembly<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.679> three<00:00:43.980> water

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
pilot and the way it's supposed to work

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.650 
pilot and the way it's supposed to work
on<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> lower<00:00:50.429> left<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.300> see<00:00:51.510> there's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
on the lower left you can see there's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
on the lower left you can see there's
some<00:00:51.809> wires<00:00:52.079> coming<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.769> it<00:00:52.980> that's<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
some wires coming out of it that's the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.819 
some wires coming out of it that's the
three<00:00:54.269> wires<00:00:54.920> come<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.249> this<00:00:56.339> thing

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
three wires come out of this thing

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.040 
three wires come out of this thing
here's<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.010> pilot<00:00:59.489> gas<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.510> your

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
here's your pilot gas here in your

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.750 
here's your pilot gas here in your
height<00:01:01.289> tension<00:01:03.260> lead<00:01:04.260> there<00:01:05.930> or<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> spark

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
height tension lead there or the spark

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.160 
height tension lead there or the spark
that's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.060> single-pole<00:01:09.570> double-throw<00:01:09.630> switch

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that's a single-pole double-throw switch

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.649 
that's a single-pole double-throw switch
on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.400> three<00:01:11.640> wire<00:01:11.850> side<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
on the three wire side it's a it's a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
on the three wire side it's a it's a
bi-metal<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.280> normal

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
bi-metal so that when it's in the normal

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.120 
bi-metal so that when it's in the normal
position<00:01:20.899> it'll<00:01:21.899> allow<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> spark<00:01:22.710> igniter

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
position it'll allow the spark igniter

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.770 
position it'll allow the spark igniter
to<00:01:23.250> light<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.170> pilot

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
to light the pilot

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.230 
to light the pilot
and<00:01:27.080> then<00:01:27.320> as<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.500> final<00:01:27.740> warms<00:01:28.400> it<00:01:28.610> breaks<00:01:28.970> that

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
and then as a final warms it breaks that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.660 
and then as a final warms it breaks that
contact<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.320> shuts<00:01:30.650> that<00:01:30.950> off<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.670> then

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
contact and shuts that off and then

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.300 
contact and shuts that off and then
we'll<00:01:34.670> make<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.870> other<00:01:36.500> side<00:01:36.950> which<00:01:37.280> will

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
we'll make the other side which will

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.910 
we'll make the other side which will
open<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.180> gas<00:01:38.390> valve<00:01:38.420> these<00:01:39.380> things<00:01:39.680> we<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
open the gas valve these things we the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.830 
open the gas valve these things we the
biggest<00:01:40.220> problem<00:01:40.910> with<00:01:41.060> these<00:01:41.240> things<00:01:41.300> they

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
biggest problem with these things they

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.420 
biggest problem with these things they
tended<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.380> stick<00:01:44.200> usually<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.380> startup<00:01:45.979> after

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
tended to stick usually on startup after

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.020 
tended to stick usually on startup after
a<00:01:46.460> long<00:01:46.670> shutdown<00:01:47.390> they<00:01:48.140> would<00:01:48.850> they<00:01:49.850> would

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
a long shutdown they would they would

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.800 
a long shutdown they would they would
stick

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
stick

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.060 
stick
so<00:01:51.140> they<00:01:51.290> oftentimes<00:01:51.680> had<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.220> be<00:01:52.369> replaced

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
so they oftentimes had to be replaced

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.859 
so they oftentimes had to be replaced
one<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.280> other<00:01:55.520> possible<00:01:56.180> issues<00:01:56.630> with

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
one of the other possible issues with

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.690 
one of the other possible issues with
this<00:01:57.110> furnace<00:01:58.070> was<00:01:58.910> this<00:01:59.119> spark<00:01:59.509> igniter<00:02:00.700> they

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
this furnace was this spark igniter they

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.020 
this furnace was this spark igniter they
have<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.940> have<00:02:02.060> 24<00:02:02.509> volts<00:02:02.810> coming<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.410> them

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
have to have 24 volts coming in to them

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.430 
have to have 24 volts coming in to them
and<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.210> pilot<00:02:05.630> assembly<00:02:05.990> turns<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.800> and

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and that pilot assembly turns it on and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.850 
and that pilot assembly turns it on and
if<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:09.850> doesn't<00:02:10.850> spark<00:02:11.300> there's<00:02:11.930> no<00:02:12.140> high

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
if it doesn't spark there's no high

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.130 
if it doesn't spark there's no high
voltage<00:02:13.280> coming<00:02:13.670> out<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.090> then<00:02:14.330> it's<00:02:14.930> bail

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.130 

this<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.950> gas<00:02:19.250> valve<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.120> thing<00:02:20.360> this

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
this is a gas valve for this thing this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.210 
this is a gas valve for this thing this
gas<00:02:21.440> valve<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:22.069> specific<00:02:22.790> for<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:24.220> believe

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
gas valve is specific for this I believe

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.340 
gas valve is specific for this I believe
they<00:02:25.370> still<00:02:25.640> make<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.120> valve<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:27.110> not

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
they still make this valve I have not

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.530 
they still make this valve I have not
seen<00:02:27.830> many<00:02:28.160> lately<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.670> haven't<00:02:29.060> really<00:02:29.270> looked

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
seen many lately I haven't really looked

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
seen many lately I haven't really looked
but<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.290> specific<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.280> furnace

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
but this is specific for this furnace

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.630 
but this is specific for this furnace
it's<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.030> only<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.600> can<00:02:32.750> use<00:02:33.640> there's

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's the only one you can use there's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.390 
it's the only one you can use there's
been<00:02:34.850> some<00:02:35.090> failures<00:02:35.540> there

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.980 

to<00:02:41.400> kind<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.730> give<00:02:41.940> an<00:02:42.060> idea<00:02:42.510> where<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
to kind of give an idea where the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.510 
to kind of give an idea where the
sequence<00:02:43.560> could<00:02:43.830> break<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.520> these<00:02:44.790> gas<00:02:45.690> valves

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
sequence could break on these gas valves

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.220 
sequence could break on these gas valves
because<00:02:47.520> they<00:02:48.560> they<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.360> open<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.690> pilot

to light that's a good idea that you got
gas<00:03:14.310> valve<00:03:14.670> problems<00:03:15.210> if<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.570> do<00:03:15.720> have<00:03:15.900> good

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
gas valve problems if you do have good

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.190 
gas valve problems if you do have good
gas<00:03:16.290> supply<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:20.130> you'll<00:03:20.400> sometimes<00:03:20.730> see

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
gas supply then you'll sometimes see

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.090 
gas supply then you'll sometimes see
where<00:03:22.790> main<00:03:23.790> gas<00:03:24.210> when<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.200> comes<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.740> when<00:03:26.070> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
where main gas when it comes on when the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.970 
where main gas when it comes on when the
pilots<00:03:26.820> which<00:03:27.060> switches<00:03:27.570> over<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.140> allows

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
pilots which switches over and allows

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.400 
pilots which switches over and allows
main<00:03:29.280> gas<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.850> come<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.210> that<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.690> won't<00:03:30.960> open

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
main gas to come on that it won't open

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
main gas to come on that it won't open
and<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:34.440> pilot<00:03:34.680> we'll<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.220> stay<00:03:35.400> lit<00:03:37.430> but

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
and so the pilot we'll just stay lit but

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.710 
and so the pilot we'll just stay lit but
the<00:03:38.490> main<00:03:38.760> gas<00:03:39.030> won't<00:03:39.330> won't<00:03:40.140> come<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.680> and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
the main gas won't won't come on and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.660 
the main gas won't won't come on and
pretty<00:03:42.720> much<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.200> use<00:03:43.950> your<00:03:44.160> meter<00:03:44.370> on

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
pretty much have to use your meter on

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.110 
pretty much have to use your meter on
this<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:46.200> use<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.830> diagram<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.430> comes<00:03:47.850> with

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
this and use the diagram that comes with

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.540 
this and use the diagram that comes with
it<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.750> determine<00:03:49.350> which<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.770> these<00:03:49.860> wires<00:03:50.220> is

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
it to determine which of these wires is

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.720 
it to determine which of these wires is
which<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.470> there's<00:03:55.710> some<00:03:55.920> issues<00:03:56.280> there<00:03:56.550> you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
which so there's some issues there you

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.880 
which so there's some issues there you
have<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.090> deal<00:03:57.330> with<00:03:57.660> on<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.960> gas<00:03:58.500> valve

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
have to deal with on that gas valve

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.370 
have to deal with on that gas valve
because<00:03:59.160> that's<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.610> fairly<00:04:00.210> common<00:04:00.390> failure

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
because that's a fairly common failure

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.130 
because that's a fairly common failure
where<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.400> main<00:04:02.580> gas<00:04:02.880> won't<00:04:03.180> come<00:04:03.360> off<00:04:03.510> when

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
where the main gas won't come off when

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.410 
where the main gas won't come off when
the<00:04:04.260> pilot<00:04:04.710> well<00:04:07.130> then<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.310> last<00:04:08.550> most<00:04:08.910> common
