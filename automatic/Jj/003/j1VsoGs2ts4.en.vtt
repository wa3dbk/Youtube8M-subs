00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.508
 I'm going crazy 

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:16.016
 I am often irritated by such a face. Every time I want to see someone who is important, my face will become like this. I need to cover these cockroaches 

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:23.398
 Today I will teach you how to do it. My name is Faye Smith, I am a hair stylist and a makeup artist. Today I will teach you how to conceal 

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.699
 I have to clean my face first. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.496
 Itâ€™s actually very simple, just wash off the oil on your face with water. 

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:43.043
 Then apply the lotion, I like to have sunscreen because my face will not be sunburned or tanned. 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.761
 First apply a liquid foundation 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.806
 Use a color similar to the neck, so it looks more natural 

00:00:56.865 --> 00:01:00.769
 I like to use Young Blood Mineral Cosmetic liquid foundation. 

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:09.319
 You can use a sponge or a foundation brush to paint, or use your fingers 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.784
 The temperature of your fingers will make the liquid foundation easier to apply and will look more natural 

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:22.290
 Make sure the liquid foundation looks natural enough 

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:31.591
 Now my skin color is more even, it is time to cover all the cockroaches. 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:39.182
 My acne is very big, I will use a concealer with a relatively strong coverage. 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.062
 I will use Young Blood Mineral Cosmetic, which is a color that matches my skin tone. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.885
 You can use a brush but I still use my fingers 

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:55.448
 Apply it over the enamel and smooth the edges. If you do this, it is not easy to see that there is concealer. 

00:01:55.457 --> 00:02:01.371
 On the dark circles of the eyes, there are red spots near the nose. 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:26.354
 Now I have covered all the cockroaches, dark circles and red spots. 

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:28.982
 I want to remove the reflection from my face. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:40.326
 I want to mix the powder with the mineral powder so that the coverage is wider and looks more natural. 

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.664
 I will use a honey powder brush 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.752
 I mixed the mineral foundation and the honey powder together. 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:59.721
 Mineral foundation will increase coverage and make the face look more natural, and will cover the remaining little 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.517
 The powder will remove the brightness of the face and the face will look more natural. 

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:10.648
 This is my flawless skin 

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:18.531
 Of course you don't want to go out like this. You will finish your makeup before going out. 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.118
 This is how to cover the video teaching of acne and sputum.
