is Android 4.4.2 and on top of that are
very<00:03:12.140> interesting<00:03:12.860> user<00:03:13.100> interface<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:14.240> I

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
very interesting user interface that I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.210 
very interesting user interface that I
think<00:03:14.660> sets<00:03:14.960> it<00:03:15.110> apart<00:03:15.200> from<00:03:15.440> majority<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.130> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
think sets it apart from majority of the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.310 
think sets it apart from majority of the
other<00:03:16.430> Android<00:03:17.150> smartphones<00:03:17.630> out<00:03:17.870> there<00:03:18.140> and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
other Android smartphones out there and

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.320 
other Android smartphones out there and
that's<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:19.010> user<00:03:19.220> interface<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.910> they<00:03:20.060> call

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
that's a user interface that they call

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.310 
that's a user interface that they call
emotion<00:03:21.140> UI<00:03:22.210> so<00:03:23.210> what<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.600> emotion<00:03:24.140> UI

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
emotion UI so what is this emotion UI

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.470 
emotion UI so what is this emotion UI
well<00:03:24.860> for<00:03:25.040> one<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.340> fundamentally<00:03:25.760> changes

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
about how emotion UI helps in terms of

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.590 
about how emotion UI helps in terms of
battery<00:04:18.410> life<00:04:18.680> so<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.549> has<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:20.209> range<00:04:20.420> of<00:04:20.570> useful

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
battery life so it has a range of useful

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.260 
battery life so it has a range of useful
features<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.859> alert<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:22.430> about<00:04:22.820> apps<00:04:23.090> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
services that are battery heavy and that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.850 
services that are battery heavy and that
gives<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.330> choice<00:04:26.600> allowing<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.560> to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
gives you the choice allowing you to

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.590 
gives you the choice allowing you to
either<00:04:27.980> turn<00:04:28.310> them<00:04:28.460> off<00:04:28.610> or<00:04:28.880> at<00:04:29.180> least<00:04:29.330> know

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
either turn them off or at least know

either turn them off or at least know
about<00:04:29.900> them<00:04:30.110> which<00:04:30.230> is<00:04:30.350> quite<00:04:30.530> helpful<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.160> it

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
about them which is quite helpful and it

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.790 
about them which is quite helpful and it
also<00:04:31.669> helps<00:04:32.150> extend<00:04:32.690> battery<00:04:32.870> life<00:04:33.200> when

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
also helps extend battery life when

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.290 
also helps extend battery life when
you're<00:04:33.980> running<00:04:34.280> really<00:04:34.520> low<00:04:34.790> by<00:04:35.030> actually

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
you're running really low by actually

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.240 
you're running really low by actually
turning<00:04:35.660> off<00:04:35.780> features<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.890> might<00:04:37.070> not

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
turning off features that you might not

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.430 
turning off features that you might not
need<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.780> think<00:04:38.990> that's<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.230> useful

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
need and I think that's a useful
