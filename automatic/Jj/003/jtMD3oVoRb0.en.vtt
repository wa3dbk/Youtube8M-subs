that<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.820> Fed<00:01:51.119> needs<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.539> be<00:01:51.659> as

that the Fed needs to be as

the credit markets and get the banks

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.560 
the credit markets and get the banks
lending<00:01:58.200> again<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:59.640> best<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
lending again the best way to do that is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.590 
lending again the best way to do that is
for<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> Fed<00:02:01.109> to<00:02:01.229> continue<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> cut<00:02:01.950> rates<00:02:02.600> to

for the Fed to continue to cut rates to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.090 
for the Fed to continue to cut rates to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
make it more profitable for banks to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
make it more profitable for banks to
start<00:02:05.399> lending<00:02:05.640> again<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.509> offset<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:07.170> of

absolutely the wrong

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
thing for the Fed to do at this point

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.699 
thing for the Fed to do at this point
yet<00:02:17.459> no<00:02:17.970> unfortunately<00:02:18.600> maybe<00:02:18.840> Ben<00:02:19.200> Bernanke

yet no unfortunately maybe Ben Bernanke
studied<00:02:20.160> history<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.700> studied<00:02:21.030> the

depression but he learned nothing from

depression but he learned nothing from
it<00:02:22.830> what<00:02:23.340> he<00:02:23.430> should<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.940> look<00:02:24.090> at<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
it what he should do is look at the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.449 
it what he should do is look at the
history<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.810> Argentina<00:02:25.709> look<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.310> what's

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
history of Argentina look at what's

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.699 
history of Argentina look at what's
happening<00:02:26.880> in<00:02:27.000> Zimbabwe<00:02:27.720> right<00:02:27.959> now<00:02:28.170> because

happening in Zimbabwe right now because

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.410 
happening in Zimbabwe right now because
those<00:02:28.950> are<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.130> type<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.400> monetary<00:02:29.880> policies

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
those are the type of monetary policies

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.449 
those are the type of monetary policies
that<00:02:30.510> he's<00:02:30.690> pursuing<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.069> something

that he's pursuing and we have something

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.430 
that he's pursuing and we have something
far<00:02:32.730> worse<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:33.180> our<00:02:33.270> future<00:02:33.480> if<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.170> do<00:02:34.319> not

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
far worse in our future if we do not

far worse in our future if we do not
veer<00:02:34.709> from<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:35.069> course<00:02:35.660> but<00:02:36.660> what<00:02:37.020> well<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
veer from this course but what well I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.880 
veer from this course but what well I
agree<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.550> go<00:02:39.120> ahead<00:02:39.330> go<00:02:39.720> ahead<00:02:39.750> dive<00:02:40.530> in

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
agree that the go ahead go ahead dive in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.780 
agree that the go ahead go ahead dive in
yeah<00:02:42.230> well<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.260> agree<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> Fed<00:02:44.130> needs<00:02:44.370> to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
yeah well I agree that the Fed needs to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.670 
yeah well I agree that the Fed needs to
be<00:02:44.970> seeing<00:02:45.420> less<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.720> reacting<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
be seeing less of reacting to the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.350 
be seeing less of reacting to the
markets<00:02:47.130> they<00:02:47.550> need<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.850> show<00:02:48.030> some

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
markets they need to show some

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.690 
markets they need to show some
leadership<00:02:48.570> some<00:02:48.900> backbone<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.519> why

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
leadership some backbone and that's why

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.550 
leadership some backbone and that's why
I<00:02:50.730> think<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.300> markets<00:02:51.750> applauded<00:02:52.260> what<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
I think the markets applauded what the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.229 
I think the markets applauded what the
Fed<00:02:52.800> did<00:02:52.980> today<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> Fed<00:02:53.610> didn't<00:02:53.910> give<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
Fed did today the Fed didn't give the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.670 
Fed did today the Fed didn't give the
market<00:02:54.540> exactly<00:02:55.080> what<00:02:55.260> they<00:02:55.410> were<00:02:55.470> looking

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
market exactly what they were looking

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.250 
market exactly what they were looking
for<00:02:56.090> instead<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.209> gave<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> little<00:02:57.810> bit<00:02:57.930> less

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
for instead they gave a little bit less

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.710 
for instead they gave a little bit less
than<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:59.239> subtly<00:03:00.239> reasserting

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
than that so subtly reasserting

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440 
than that so subtly reasserting
themselves<00:03:00.959> in<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:02.130> marketplace<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.940> you

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
know we're going to use other methods

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.590 
know we're going to use other methods

nervous<00:04:54.210> doesn't<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:55.880> well<00:04:56.880> it's<00:04:57.000> true<00:04:57.210> that

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
nervous doesn't it well it's true that

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.300 
nervous doesn't it well it's true that
this<00:04:57.630> isn't<00:04:58.020> really<00:04:58.200> consistent<00:04:59.160> with<00:04:59.280> a

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
this isn't really consistent with a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.210 
this isn't really consistent with a
deflationary<00:05:00.120> spiral<00:05:00.510> but<00:05:01.170> I<00:05:01.380> point<00:05:01.920> out<00:05:01.980> in

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
deflationary spiral but I point out in

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.820 
deflationary spiral but I point out in
1991<00:05:03.150> we<00:05:03.390> also<00:05:03.540> were<00:05:03.840> seeing<00:05:04.080> accelerating

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
1991 we also were seeing accelerating

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.650 
1991 we also were seeing accelerating
inflation<00:05:05.010> when<00:05:05.760> we<00:05:05.850> went<00:05:06.030> into<00:05:06.180> recession

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
inflation when we went into recession

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.990 
inflation when we went into recession
but<00:05:07.500> as<00:05:07.680> growth<00:05:07.950> slowed<00:05:08.400> we<00:05:08.610> did<00:05:08.790> see<00:05:08.970> a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
but as growth slowed we did see a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.300 
but as growth slowed we did see a
moderation<00:05:09.540> inflation<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.070> Fed<00:05:11.280> is

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
moderation inflation and the Fed is

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.770 
moderation inflation and the Fed is
actually<00:05:11.760> historically<00:05:12.210> been<00:05:12.360> pretty<00:05:12.600> good

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
actually historically been pretty good

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.990 
actually historically been pretty good
forecast<00:05:13.200> or<00:05:13.440> inflation<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.100> I<00:05:14.130> I'd<00:05:14.730> go<00:05:14.910> with

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
forecast or inflation so I I'd go with

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.180 
forecast or inflation so I I'd go with
the<00:05:15.150> feds<00:05:15.390> forecast<00:05:15.930> on<00:05:16.170> inflation<00:05:16.710> that<00:05:16.890> this

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
the feds forecast on inflation that this

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.610 
the feds forecast on inflation that this
is<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.340> demand-driven<00:05:18.240> as<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:18.990> economy<00:05:19.140> slows

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
is a demand-driven as the economy slows

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.350 
is a demand-driven as the economy slows
we're<00:05:19.860> going<00:05:19.980> to<00:05:20.040> see<00:05:20.220> some<00:05:20.250> moderation<00:05:21.000> there

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
we're going to see some moderation there

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.080 
we're going to see some moderation there
now<00:05:21.990> I'd<00:05:22.170> go<00:05:22.410> I'd<00:05:22.440> go<00:05:23.010> with<00:05:23.340> gold<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.760> wouldn't

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
now I'd go I'd go with gold I wouldn't

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.920 
now I'd go I'd go with gold I wouldn't
trust<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.450> government<00:05:24.570> know<00:05:24.810> I've<00:05:24.900> been

trust the government know I've been

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.480 
trust the government know I've been
buying<00:05:25.290> gold<00:05:25.560> I've<00:05:25.770> been<00:05:25.920> encouraging<00:05:26.370> my

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490

assets and commodities for about eight

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.060

years<00:05:29.940> because<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:30.900> understood<00:05:31.380> how<00:05:31.890> much

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
years because I understood how much

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.920 
years because I understood how much
inflation<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.940> government<00:05:33.300> was<00:05:33.390> creating

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
inflation the government was creating

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.820 
inflation the government was creating
you<00:05:33.990> know<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.170> government<00:05:34.380> doesn't<00:05:34.800> want

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
you know the government doesn't want

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.410

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
people to understand how much inflation

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.300 
people to understand how much inflation
they're<00:05:36.720> creating<00:05:37.110> so<00:05:37.560> they<00:05:37.680> hope<00:05:38.130> that

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
they're creating so they hope that

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.850 
they're creating so they hope that
you'll<00:05:38.430> buy<00:05:38.670> into<00:05:38.970> these<00:05:39.060> folks<00:05:39.330> yeah<00:05:39.860> you

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.070 
dropped in terms of national home prices
more<00:06:11.580> than<00:06:11.790> we<00:06:11.940> ever<00:06:12.090> dropped<00:06:12.510> since<00:06:12.810> the

more than we ever dropped since the
Great<00:06:13.260> Depression<00:06:13.290> so<00:06:14.100> our<00:06:14.670> models<00:06:15.060> around

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
Great Depression so our models around

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.030 
Great Depression so our models around
this<00:06:15.420> aren't<00:06:15.690> very<00:06:15.930> good<00:06:16.050> but<00:06:16.560> it's<00:06:16.770> we

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
this aren't very good but it's we

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.560 
this aren't very good but it's we
certainly<00:06:17.340> know<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:17.640> direction<00:06:18.000> that<00:06:18.240> things

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
certainly know the direction that things

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.420 
certainly know the direction that things
are<00:06:18.720> headed<00:06:19.080> we're<00:06:19.590> seeing<00:06:19.830> a<00:06:19.860> lot<00:06:19.890> of<00:06:20.070> wealth

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
are headed we're seeing a lot of wealth

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.030 
are headed we're seeing a lot of wealth
destruction<00:06:20.880> from<00:06:21.270> housing<00:06:21.780> and<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.800> stock

that's<00:06:24.750> going<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:24.960> weigh<00:06:25.170> on<00:06:25.200> consumer

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
that's going to weigh on consumer

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.070 
that's going to weigh on consumer
spending<00:06:25.800> and<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.850> Fed<00:06:27.330> needs<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.690> react<00:06:27.900> to
