that<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.420> played<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.110> winner<00:01:04.320> only<00:01:04.710> had<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> use

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that I played the winner only had to use

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
impression that the abilities on these

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.950
