yeah dr. so what does it conductor do I

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:13.580 
yeah dr. so what does it conductor do I
know<00:00:10.639> to<00:00:11.639> put<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.090> very<00:00:12.480> very<00:00:12.599> short<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
know to put it in very very short and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.379 
know to put it in very very short and
simple<00:00:13.769> way<00:00:14.040> because<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:14.820> really<00:00:15.089> not<00:00:15.330> that

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
simple way because it's really not that

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.210 
simple way because it's really not that
short<00:00:15.780> than<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.670> but<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.050> way<00:00:19.260> my<00:00:19.980> main

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
short than that but in a way my main

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.380 
short than that but in a way my main
task<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.029> try<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.519> to<00:00:23.519> figure<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:24.060> what

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
task is to try and to figure out what

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630 
task is to try and to figure out what
the<00:00:24.539> intentions<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> composer<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the intentions of the composer are and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.540 
the intentions of the composer are and
to<00:00:27.599> transmit<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> best<00:00:28.949> way<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to transmit that in the best way that I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.240 
to transmit that in the best way that I
can<00:00:30.050> with<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.320> knowledge<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:32.040> my

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
can with my knowledge with my

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.270 
can with my knowledge with my
personality<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:33.210> my<00:00:33.390> abilities<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
personality with my abilities to the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
personality with my abilities to the
musicians<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> conductor<00:00:37.500> don't

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
musicians because I as a conductor don't

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.650 
musicians because I as a conductor don't
make<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.879> single<00:00:39.180> note<00:00:41.000> it's<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> musicians

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
make one single note it's the musicians

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.750 
make one single note it's the musicians
who<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:43.379> play<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.040> instruments<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
who actually play the instruments and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
who actually play the instruments and
make<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> music<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.190> very

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
make the music so it's it's a very

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
make the music so it's it's a very
special<00:00:48.329> form<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> communication<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
special form of communication it's a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.369 
special form of communication it's a
very<00:00:50.100> strange<00:00:50.520> thing<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
very strange thing to be the one to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
very strange thing to be the one to
determine<00:00:52.890> how<00:00:53.070> things<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.670> yet<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
determine how things go yet to be the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.139 
determine how things go yet to be the
one<00:00:54.480> who<00:00:54.600> does<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> single<00:00:55.410> note<00:00:55.710> yes

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
one who does not make a single note yes

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.700 
one who does not make a single note yes
so<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.360> special<00:00:57.960> relationship<00:00:58.140> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so it's a very special relationship it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.060 
so it's a very special relationship it's
a<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.010> complex<00:01:00.260> mechanism<00:01:01.260> when<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.890> have

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
a very complex mechanism when you have

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.479 
a very complex mechanism when you have
maybe<00:01:02.430> 100<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:03.180> even<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.600> musicians<00:01:04.339> on<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
maybe 100 or even more musicians on the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.640 
maybe 100 or even more musicians on the
stage<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.970> big<00:01:06.150> Symphony<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
stage for a big Symphony and you are the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.010 
stage for a big Symphony and you are the
one<00:01:07.860> person<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:09.060> determine<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.810> which

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
one person to determine in which

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
one person to determine in which
direction<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.680> performance<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.340> pickles

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
direction the performance with pickles

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.200 
direction the performance with pickles
but<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.380> modest<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.580> much<00:01:14.880> more

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
but this is very modest it's much more

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.370 
but this is very modest it's much more
than<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.650> eyes<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
than that in my in my eyes it's the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
than that in my in my eyes it's the
honesty<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:24.119> more<00:01:24.270> true

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
honesty and the the more the more true

what he really feels and what he thinks
the<00:01:33.540> music<00:01:33.840> has<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.430> convincing

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
very mysterious about the relationship

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.150 
very mysterious about the relationship
between<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.869> conductor<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.650> orchestra<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
the more the conductor is really

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.370 
the more the conductor is really
immersed<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> ideas<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> music<00:02:10.259> the

immersed in the ideas of the music the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.680 
immersed in the ideas of the music the
more<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:10.679> forgets<00:02:11.009> about<00:02:11.160> himself<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.450> bigger

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
more he forgets about himself the bigger

more he forgets about himself the bigger
and<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.650> more<00:02:14.090> important<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.360> more<00:02:16.340> great

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and the more important of the more great

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.790
