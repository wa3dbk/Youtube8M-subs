00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.680 

now<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.470> begins<00:03:20.830> because<00:03:21.040> I'm<00:03:21.610> off<00:03:22.300> train

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
now that begins because I'm off train

now that begins because I'm off train
just<00:03:22.960> a<00:03:23.050> little<00:03:23.320> bit<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.640> see<00:03:24.880> how<00:03:24.970> it's<00:03:25.120> going

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
just a little bit so see how it's going

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.320 
just a little bit so see how it's going
forward<00:03:29.400> there<00:03:30.400> are<00:03:30.520> a<00:03:30.580> little<00:03:30.730> bit<00:03:30.910> backwards

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
forward there are a little bit backwards

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.300 
forward there are a little bit backwards
again<00:03:33.930> it'll<00:03:34.930> stay<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> little<00:03:35.470> bit<00:03:35.590> stable<00:03:36.130> for

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
again it'll stay a little bit stable for

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.980 
again it'll stay a little bit stable for
a<00:03:36.340> little<00:03:36.460> longer<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:37.180> little<00:03:37.330> bit<00:03:37.600> backwards

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
a little longer a little bit backwards

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.170 
a little longer a little bit backwards
now<00:03:38.160> gave<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.280> backwards<00:03:39.640> right<00:03:39.790> when<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.090> was

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
now gave it backwards right when it was

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.820 
now gave it backwards right when it was
about<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.510> enter<00:03:40.660> in<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.020> backwoods<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:41.650> it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
about to enter in the backwoods so it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.170 
about to enter in the backwoods so it
added<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.150> really<00:03:43.360> made<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.050> worse<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:45.180> made

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
added to it really made it worse I made

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.970 
added to it really made it worse I made
it<00:03:46.210> worse<00:03:46.450> by<00:03:46.630> clicking<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.170> trend

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:06.710 

Oh<00:03:54.690> get<00:03:55.690> my<00:03:55.870> TX

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:21.500 

oh<00:04:07.130> don't<00:04:08.130> what<00:04:08.310> up

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.950 

right

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
right

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.210 
right
that<00:04:24.620> was

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.660 

sound<00:04:29.850> like<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> first<00:04:30.270> first<00:04:30.450> other<00:04:30.840> time

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.080 

maybe

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.879 

maybe<00:04:39.720> it's<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.960> lucid<00:04:40.350> started<00:04:40.680> skipping

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
maybe it's a lucid started skipping

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:48.469 
maybe it's a lucid started skipping
teeth<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.460> continue<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:41.910> skip<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:47.479> little

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
teeth and continue to skip to a little

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.510 
teeth and continue to skip to a little
off-balance

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.460 

well<00:04:52.120> at<00:04:52.240> least<00:04:52.360> with<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.660> trend<00:04:52.930> of

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.120

can<00:06:30.330> do<00:06:30.570> this<00:06:30.600> to<00:06:30.990> make<00:06:31.080> a<00:06:31.139> mock<00:06:31.410> up<00:06:32.180> see<00:06:33.180> what's

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
can do this to make a mock up see what's

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.270 
can do this to make a mock up see what's
you<00:06:33.990> know<00:06:34.110> what<00:06:34.410> it's<00:06:34.530> all<00:06:34.680> about<00:06:37.280> basically

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
you know what it's all about basically

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.159 
you know what it's all about basically
you<00:06:38.760> remove<00:06:38.970> that<00:06:39.000> uh<00:06:40.370> you<00:06:41.370> know<00:06:42.020> what<00:06:43.020> do<00:06:43.080> you

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
you remove that uh you know what do you

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.510 
you remove that uh you know what do you
got<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.650> you<00:06:44.040> know<00:06:44.250> the<00:06:44.400> fly<00:06:44.610> bar<00:06:45.380> swivel

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
got the you know the fly bar swivel

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.659 
got the you know the fly bar swivel
thing<00:06:47.520> in<00:06:47.639> there<00:06:47.850> remove<00:06:48.630> that<00:06:48.810> guy<00:06:49.020> and<00:06:49.669> you

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
thing in there remove that guy and you

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.159 
thing in there remove that guy and you
gotta<00:06:50.850> carve<00:06:51.150> out<00:06:51.389> I<00:06:51.630> don't<00:06:51.840> know<00:06:51.900> if<00:06:51.990> you<00:06:52.080> can

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
gotta carve out I don't know if you can

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:53.960 
gotta carve out I don't know if you can
see<00:06:52.410> that<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:52.710> head<00:06:52.860> is<00:06:52.889> shiny<00:06:53.400> right<00:06:53.760> there

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
see that the head is shiny right there

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.120 
see that the head is shiny right there
inside<00:06:54.120> that<00:06:54.570> box<00:06:55.040> but<00:06:57.620> you<00:06:58.620> have<00:06:58.710> to<00:06:58.860> scrape

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
inside that box but you have to scrape

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.330 
inside that box but you have to scrape
away<00:06:59.340> and<00:06:59.790> use<00:07:00.540> the<00:07:00.720> fly<00:07:00.900> bar<00:07:01.200> kind<00:07:02.100> of<00:07:02.160> like

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
away and use the fly bar kind of like

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.550 
away and use the fly bar kind of like
pushing<00:07:03.030> against<00:07:03.450> it<00:07:03.570> you<00:07:03.690> know<00:07:03.810> and<00:07:03.840> rub<00:07:04.410> it

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
pushing against it you know and rub it

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.760 
pushing against it you know and rub it
so<00:07:04.710> that<00:07:05.370> it<00:07:05.520> gets<00:07:05.910> down<00:07:06.120> to<00:07:06.180> the<00:07:06.380> degrees<00:07:07.380> that

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
so that it gets down to the degrees that

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.360 
so that it gets down to the degrees that
it<00:07:08.430> needs<00:07:08.610> to<00:07:08.790> be<00:07:08.940> and<00:07:09.680> after<00:07:10.680> you<00:07:10.770> do<00:07:10.919> that<00:07:10.950> for

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
it needs to be and after you do that for

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.950 
it needs to be and after you do that for
like<00:07:11.610> an<00:07:11.760> hour<00:07:13.130> you'll<00:07:14.130> have<00:07:14.370> that<00:07:14.880> and<00:07:15.120> the

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
like an hour you'll have that and the

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.170 
like an hour you'll have that and the
bell<00:07:16.500> Hiller<00:07:16.740> arms<00:07:17.430> could<00:07:17.639> actually<00:07:17.820> be<00:07:18.150> a

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
bell Hiller arms could actually be a

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.230 
bell Hiller arms could actually be a
little<00:07:18.389> bit<00:07:18.539> longer<00:07:19.039> and<00:07:20.039> let<00:07:20.220> that<00:07:20.460> the<00:07:21.060> fly

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
little bit longer and let that the fly

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.180 
little bit longer and let that the fly
bar<00:07:21.479> drop<00:07:21.780> and<00:07:22.110> it's<00:07:22.440> a<00:07:23.060> square<00:07:24.060> you<00:07:24.780> know

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
bar drop and it's a square you know

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.409 
bar drop and it's a square you know
because<00:07:26.190> uh<00:07:26.220> there's<00:07:27.060> level<00:07:27.840> fly<00:07:28.050> bar<00:07:28.289> there

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 
because uh there's level fly bar there

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.700 
because uh there's level fly bar there
and<00:07:30.419> you<00:07:30.510> can<00:07:30.630> see<00:07:30.840> my<00:07:30.870> mixing<00:07:31.350> arms<00:07:31.560> aren't

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
and you can see my mixing arms aren't

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.570 
and you can see my mixing arms aren't
even<00:07:31.919> close<00:07:32.100> to<00:07:32.220> straight<00:07:32.700> and<00:07:33.770> it's<00:07:34.770> a<00:07:34.860> 43<00:07:35.370> be

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
even close to straight and it's a 43 be

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.750 
even close to straight and it's a 43 be
fly<00:07:36.180> bar<00:07:36.389> as<00:07:36.510> well<00:07:36.560> so<00:07:37.560> doesn't<00:07:38.460> even<00:07:38.580> need<00:07:38.700> a

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
fly bar as well so doesn't even need a

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.520 
fly bar as well so doesn't even need a
long<00:07:38.970> fly<00:07:39.210> bar<00:07:39.450> actually<00:07:39.810> probably<00:07:40.260> be<00:07:40.410> more

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
long fly bar actually probably be more

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.370 
long fly bar actually probably be more
stable<00:07:40.740> with<00:07:41.340> a<00:07:41.370> longer<00:07:41.880> fly<00:07:42.150> bar<00:07:42.389> so<00:07:42.660> that'd

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
stable with a longer fly bar so that'd

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.910 
stable with a longer fly bar so that'd
be<00:07:43.500> cool<00:07:43.680> I<00:07:43.919> have<00:07:44.280> to<00:07:44.400> try<00:07:44.550> that<00:07:44.580> too
