00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 and well this all to that a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.400
 we recommend I bring a video about how 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.980
 get the golden spoon 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.840
 practically the definitive weapon of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.570
 zombies as you see we killed a single 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.309
 cut to the 34th round if I do not 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.440
 wrong and good as you see we are going to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.789
 need two things first this weapon 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 that you are seeing here, you have a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.580
 video in the visions about how 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.619
 get it and also how to get the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.970
 Work of blue color improved tomahawk 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.920
 what we are going to have to do what 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 first of all it is to throw just a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.939
 tomahawk to that poster comes a symbol 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.669
 of the after life and we go one more place 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.190
 close to commit suicide we give you here and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 we enter what is still the wall 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.329
 that we say that what is behind 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 that poster and we have to realize 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 that here is just a spoon 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.660
 we give it to you there a couple of times and you see that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.260
 disappears once it has disappeared 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.579
 we received and we have to go to this 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.170
 another room to do the next 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.539
 step what do we have to do 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.309
 come just to the cafeteria a 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 We are in the cafeteria 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.329
 and we throw a tomahawk to the table the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.090
 spoon will disappear and we will hear the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.489
 following 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.520
 and this means that we can go to 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.990
 next step which is to kill 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.940
 zombies just in the part of the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.160
 Laundry is quite simple as 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.479
 you are seeing you already know that with this weapon 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.220
 all zombies go where 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.380
 shoot then we are not going to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.940
 approaching nobody is going to be pretty let's say 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.070
 that is easy but we are going to have to 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.360
 be quite a while in fact I do not know 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.500
 exactly how many rounds are but I know 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.910
 that we're still going to have to be so 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.920
 minus a couple of rounds here tucked 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.540
 disguise do not keep in mind that you have to 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.940
 be just part of inside the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.310
 laundry what are the doors or the 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.360
 fence where I am stuck then there was 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.430
 a door so they do not come near 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.340
 too much but it 's pretty enough 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.440
 complicated as we know if we are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.880
 doing well if this works well this 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.310
 not my mother as part of the tomahawk 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.330
 shown that arrives very far and as 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.460
 we do and we are here it's fine 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.619
 we are doing well let's listen 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.369
 a sound you're almost not going to see 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.369
 listen now just 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.680
 he wants to end his life 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.300
 and this means that we can go to 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.300
 the top floor towards the area of the 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.710
 nursing to collect our prize which 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.960
 is going to be our prize because our 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.030
 prize as you are seeing is nothing more 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.770
 nothing less than a golden spoon 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.290
 we have to bring them closer this morning 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.260
 to the Xs now as they leave the basen 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.510
 in play and in this way we will get the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.150
 trophy in this case like this one comes out 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.340
 a hand and he will give us what comes 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.260
 being the spoon the truth is that it is 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.940
 an authentic past and personally I 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.590
 loved it and on top is super useful for 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.940
 high rounds so I hope it has 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010
 liked is to like video vote it 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.000

 about six and nine years
