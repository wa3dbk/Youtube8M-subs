00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
when it's going well but we saw in

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.880 
when it's going well but we saw in
Cleveland<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:26.490> series<00:02:27.000> here<00:02:27.390> Game<00:02:27.780> six<00:02:28.170> they

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
Cleveland that series here Game six they

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.570 
Cleveland that series here Game six they
fell<00:02:29.220> apart<00:02:29.730> mentally<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:31.400> that's<00:02:32.400> exactly

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
fell apart mentally and that's exactly

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.580 
fell apart mentally and that's exactly
what's<00:02:33.360> happened<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.900> think<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.260> magic

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
what's happened here I think the magic

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.110 
what's happened here I think the magic
came<00:02:34.710> out<00:02:34.830> with<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> right<00:02:35.160> intention<00:02:35.760> but

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
came out with the right intention but

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.300 
came out with the right intention but
now<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.360> look<00:02:36.660> at<00:02:36.870> Rondo<00:02:37.590> chasing<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> loose

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
now you look at Rondo chasing the loose

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.280 
now you look at Rondo chasing the loose
ball<00:02:38.550> down<00:02:38.820> if<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:39.780> as<00:02:39.900> hard<00:02:40.110> as<00:02:40.200> you're

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
ball down if that's as hard as you're

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.140 
ball down if that's as hard as you're
going<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.470> pursue<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> loose<00:02:41.070> ball<00:02:41.310> then<00:02:41.970> you're

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
going to pursue a loose ball then you're

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.120 
going to pursue a loose ball then you're
not<00:02:42.330> winning<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.720> game<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.740> right<00:02:43.890> now

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
not winning the game and right now

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
they're offensive struggles they scored

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.450 
they're offensive struggles they scored
six<00:02:46.200> points<00:02:46.440> they<00:02:46.740> have<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:46.920> many<00:02:47.070> turnovers

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
six points they have as many turnovers

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.210 
six points they have as many turnovers
as<00:02:47.910> points<00:02:48.300> they're<00:02:48.810> 30<00:02:49.200> 14<00:02:49.740> from<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:49.980> field

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
as points they're 30 14 from the field

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.340 
as points they're 30 14 from the field

has been a double technical on Perkins
and<00:02:52.530> Howard's<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.490> just<00:02:53.730> seemed<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> bit

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
and Howard's it just seemed a bit

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.360 
and Howard's it just seemed a bit
rattled<00:02:54.990> by<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.350> aggressive<00:02:56.010> Celtic

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
rattled by this aggressive Celtic

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.100 
rattled by this aggressive Celtic
defense<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:57.090> why<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.270> like<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> move<00:02:57.900> by

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
defense that's why I like the move by

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.280 
defense that's why I like the move by
Stan<00:02:58.440> Van<00:02:58.650> Gundy<00:02:59.030> getting<00:03:00.080> Jason<00:03:01.080> Williams

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
Stan Van Gundy getting Jason Williams

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
and JJ redick in the ballgame find some

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.470 
and JJ redick in the ballgame find some
inspired<00:03:04.590> players<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.790> hope<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.270> ride

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
inspired players and you hope the ride

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.380 
inspired players and you hope the ride
but<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.470> cannot<00:03:07.860> sit<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.460> continue<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.210> watch

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
but you cannot sit and continue to watch

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.230 
but you cannot sit and continue to watch
when<00:03:09.900> he's<00:03:10.050> watched<00:03:10.320> almost<00:03:10.830> an<00:03:11.280> entire

when he's watched almost an entire

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.130 
when he's watched almost an entire
when<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.780> think<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.700> Redick<00:03:14.700> while<00:03:15.630> he<00:03:15.810> plays

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
when I think to Redick while he plays

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
when I think to Redick while he plays
hard<00:03:16.470> he<00:03:17.010> adds<00:03:17.420> basketball<00:03:19.160> offensive

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
hard he adds basketball offensive

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.030 
hard he adds basketball offensive
basketball<00:03:20.760> IQ<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.570> skill<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.140> you're<00:03:22.800> not

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
basketball IQ and skill and you're not

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.100 
basketball IQ and skill and you're not
beating<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.960> Celtic<00:03:24.960> team<00:03:25.170> when<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.010> have

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
beating a Celtic team when you have

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.700 
beating a Celtic team when you have
one-way<00:03:28.110> players

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.060 

I<00:03:31.090> really<00:03:32.090> believe<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:32.420> their<00:03:32.720> best

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
I really believe that their best

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.200 
I really believe that their best
situation<00:03:34.070> is<00:03:34.190> pushing<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.060> basketball

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
situation is pushing the basketball

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.970 
situation is pushing the basketball
because<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.080> Celtic<00:03:36.290> defense<00:03:36.800> is

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
because it's Celtic defense is

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.150 
because it's Celtic defense is
outstanding<00:03:37.990> especially<00:03:38.990> when<00:03:39.470> they<00:03:39.650> when

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
outstanding especially when they when

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.590 
outstanding especially when they when
it's<00:03:40.340> very<00:03:40.550> predictable<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.330> when<00:03:41.480> they're

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
it's very predictable so when they're

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.270 
it's very predictable so when they're
playing<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.200> half<00:03:42.410> court<00:03:42.740> set<00:03:42.800> it's

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
playing you and a half court set it's

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760 
playing you and a half court set it's
it's<00:03:43.910> easy<00:03:44.330> for<00:03:44.630> them<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.840> defend<00:03:45.320> its<00:03:45.560> when

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
it's easy for them to defend its when

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.260 
it's easy for them to defend its when
you're<00:03:45.920> pushing<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.340> down<00:03:46.520> if<00:03:46.790> they<00:03:46.820> throws

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
you're pushing it down if they throws

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.430 
you're pushing it down if they throws
where<00:03:47.480> they<00:03:47.600> have<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.960> make<00:03:48.140> quick<00:03:48.410> decisions

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
where they have to make quick decisions

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.070 
where they have to make quick decisions
