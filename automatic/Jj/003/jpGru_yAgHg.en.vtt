they're<00:01:57.930> very<00:01:58.110> inflammatory<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.100> they're

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
they're very inflammatory so they're

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.039 
they're very inflammatory so they're
causing<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.880> fires<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.360> your<00:02:00.479> body<00:02:00.690> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
causing a lot of fires in your body and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.570 
causing a lot of fires in your body and
we<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.260> that<00:02:01.500> inflammation<00:02:01.830> can<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
we know that inflammation can be a

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.240 
we know that inflammation can be a
leading<00:02:02.940> reason<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:04.140> chronic<00:02:04.500> diseases<00:02:04.830> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
leading reason for chronic diseases and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.500 
leading reason for chronic diseases and
if<00:02:05.670> you're<00:02:05.790> thinking<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.180> could<00:02:06.330> just

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
if you're thinking you could just

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.410

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
exercise away those extra calories think

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.350 
exercise away those extra calories think
again<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.170> burn<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> thousand<00:02:11.459> calories<00:02:11.939> I'd

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
again to burn a thousand calories I'd

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.199
