00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello friends on the screen right now 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 incredible game probably here if me 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.040
 ask what game I had as a child 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.539
 most beloved well, or not that I was the most 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.999
 favorite but the most memorable 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.920
 at least it will certainly be tanks 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.720
 game battle city well we called them 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.880
 always tanchiki let's play tanchiki 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.180
 here and there we will hack into tanchiki 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.920
 this beautiful game was on dendy but still 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.870
 some consoles she went out already 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.770
 talk about how many games she spawned 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.200
 how many games 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.960
 come out of these very simplest 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.989
 pixel tanks but do not have to deal 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.629
 is that this game is for a game that was 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.329
 released before I was born and the first 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.210
 versions appeared such understand in 1980 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.149
 my gosh few of you caught these 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.949
 seasons of the year this game is different in that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.479
 in it there is a regime of course two but on 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.519
 dandy this general co-op was quite 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.229
 standard solution but there is 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.819
 level editor here this level on 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.379
 which we are now I did 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.350
 just 3 minutes ago own 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.760
 personally it was for me at all 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.469
 since childhood I like it more from 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.820
 create and in the same heroes 3 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.380
 for example for me the biggest 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.750
 the advantage of the game was not that she 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.479
 smart yes and the fact that it was the editor 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.799
 levels here game tanchiki it was not she 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 my first game in which I did 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.119
 some cards and i liked it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.149
 well it was just superb really 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.189
 even now she is generally quite 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.689
 playable but already felt that 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.840
 of course not enough speed is not enough 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.579
 graphics but for my childhood it was 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 just a super game because everyone had 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.009
 Tetris I really like these theses 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.840
 there was a sea 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.509
 they broke batteries all the time 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 still that lost somewhere here and on 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.950
 Thesis tanks were certainly much weaker 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.869
 than this one this game was just 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.960
 masterpiece is actually a cult game and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.820
 so many games went from her 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.149
 the last seems to me to kill 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.009
 tank I do not know I hope you like it 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.810
 that we remembered such an old one 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.009
 cool game 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.420
 force try it yourself find it 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.950
 called battle city here i'm even in 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.170
 I found websites where I can 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.520
 emulators are straight, that is, nothing is needed 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.580
 just download on the website 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.410
 which online 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.480
 You can play I do not know it seemed to me 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.130
 that this game is very nice and possible 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.500
 one of you remembered and shed a tear 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.860
 now though of course it is not worse than a game 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.990
 year 2013 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.000
 Well, it looks like I went through myself . 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.170
