00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 big hello to everyone and today i will do 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.319
 video about your school bag so how do u 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.639
 I have 2 and I'll show the school bag 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.670
 you one of hers more precisely one bag she 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 my favorite and very long sought 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.010
 and finally did find the following 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.130
 video I handed over my bag which I wear 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.760
 everyday that is it is not a school 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
 the bag is such a bullet night big 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.650
 a bag 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.420
 my bag looks like this 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.559
 that it fell in general like this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.510
 my bag looks like it is pisa from the store 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.750
 carp for this is my favorite store 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.649
 more precisely one of the most favorite stores i 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.590
 I know for sure that there will always be a bag 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.260
 that I won't go out of there just like that without me 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 so buy and if i need a bag i 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.149
 I go there but somehow I decided that I should 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 diversify your choices and in the end 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.770
 the very last moment went into nettles 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.719
 she bought this bag over his shoulder at her 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.240
 there is such a 3 bag on 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.250
 lush purple so spring 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.750
 bag and here is such a regulator yes and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.970
 he is my longest because 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.189
 Satan is the longest in length 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 because i love when the bag hangs on 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.960
 one shoulder she has one pocket 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.090
 here on the zip 3 pockets inside no 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.310
 main pocket yes and it has three pockets 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.020
 one of them is zipped and two are usually in 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.790
 ordinary pockets nothing lies 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.409
 I'm not going to show you any 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.750
 tutorials because i think that's 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.640
 completely uninteresting they practically 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.950
 all the same notebook and start 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.110
 well notebook different I'll show you 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670
 individual things such a diary pencil case 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.530
 Well 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.610
 no maybe all the class is the same but 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:58.159
 we all have different and we all have different 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:02.119
 some here and perhaps start from here that 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.970
 there is such a pocket which is not in 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.630
 mostly ammonium ion I have a constant and 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.940
 there are a lot of real junk 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.870
 candy wrappers there they usually cooked 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.830
 our school 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.720
 and as for the phone I do not carry the phone 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.840
 in a bag like when in your pocket so you 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.840
 if you don't have a wrist watch 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.519
 you are just in the canteen class and in general I 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.580
 I do not like to rummage through the bag in search 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.830
 phone here is my wallet yes all 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.110
 read our wallet to him they do not lie 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.540
 in the main pocket so that or not it 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.560
 Nobody stole because I love for a long time 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.080
 get a wallet 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.220
 yes then I look like a clutch 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.230
 generally as a separate sumac that is here 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.780
 so everything here inside and show something 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.260
 the money is the only thing Iâ€™ll show 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.670
 there is a separate movement in it 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 my travel card is like this 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.700
 looks like 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.160
 yes i'm taking public transport and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.709
 here at all such a thing happened 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.170
 not very good, that is, it got stuck 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.829
 a little bit but it is not so important in principle 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.540
 because it does not lead to the very pocket 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.150
 There is no problem here. 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.560
 the book you saw on my tour com 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.049
 and in my room here she is usually not 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.380
 write down all sorts of different things on the lesson 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.799
 because lessons in many lessons 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.900
 bored here already from my two brilliance 11 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.609
 minced meat and so here he looks like himself 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.299
 raspberries but why does it feel there 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.650
 wild strawberry 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:39.230
 other from white so here it looks 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.540
 Yankees and usually hygienic lipstick if 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.540
 open for cattle franchette for example 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.120
 Here I think between coconut and strawberry on 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.210
 it's like I thought I left one 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.250
 spoons of tili-tili fish are very, very 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.380
 I need ordinary lessons at different lessons 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.300
 classic markers and they don't write 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.380
 well yes and everything is in this pocket and 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.720
 nothing else lies 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.650
 further the main pocket here is mine 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:16.840
 diary so here it looks like it 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:20.920
 Garfield and my wants just excellent 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:25.390
 In general, yes, here and so, he looks further 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:28.480
 what is it my case 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.970
 retired on bibi vule and and bought it at 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.320
 last year he is quite mine 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.110
 a lot of things are just in the final here 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:43.720
 are gum because having pinned up 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.680
 hair very often yes my country is only 10 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.750
 or eight pens 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.610
 Here is such a sharpener and all these 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.860
 I ask my friends when I am her 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.960
 emptied sit down to eat there 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.040
 which it happens in all lessons 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.780
 when there is such a box below 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.000
 under the table, even I usually have a ruler 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.060
 there is an unusual pencil case like everyone else but not to 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.280
 for all the needs of the laundresses pencil and 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.730
 saved on because I don't like taking 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.550
 someone here further I have here 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.710
 Here is such a pocket with a zipper on it 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.390
 lies deodorant why i wear a skin with 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.830
 gifts because I have lessons 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:27.120

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.419
 normal it is by the way from the company boom here 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.320
 so here 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:35.160
 deodorant is the same 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.750
 what else is in my pocket 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.900

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.440

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.320

 and in the bushes pockets I do not wear anything 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:11.229

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:26.620

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.919
 I watched what people like and like 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:40.560
 that's why I was inspired to create 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:43.030
 of this video, in general, this is all thanks 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.440
 for a little 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.000
 almost as long as the amount 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.889

 you watch it in the afternoon and if you do it 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:07.620
