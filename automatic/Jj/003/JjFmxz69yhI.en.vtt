looking at a prototype fantasy fronts
hear<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:15.299> say<00:00:15.450> prototype<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.139> look<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:16.650> all

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
hear you say prototype but look at all

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.470 
hear you say prototype but look at all
this<00:00:16.830> wood<00:00:17.010> stuff<00:00:17.400> whereas<00:00:17.970> all<00:00:18.060> these<00:00:18.180> wood

this wood stuff whereas all these wood

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.679 
this wood stuff whereas all these wood
components<00:00:18.990> come<00:00:19.109> from<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.470> giant<00:00:20.039> Zeppelin's

components come from a giant Zeppelin's

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.570 
components come from a giant Zeppelin's
apparently<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.960> yeah<00:00:22.170> nice<00:00:22.800> wooden<00:00:23.100> airships

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
apparently and yeah nice wooden airships

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400 
apparently and yeah nice wooden airships
put<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> lot<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.359> effort<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> prototype

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
put a lot of effort into the prototype

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.019 
put a lot of effort into the prototype
just<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> make<00:00:26.340> sure<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.910> know

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
just want to make sure that it you know

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.089 
just want to make sure that it you know
it's<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.900> game<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> pattern

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
it's it's the game is a pattern

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
it's it's the game is a pattern
recognition<00:00:29.550> game<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.390> noticed<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.869> some

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
recognition game as I noticed in some

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.139 
recognition game as I noticed in some
early<00:00:31.349> prototypes<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.340> depending<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.030> how

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
early prototypes that depending on how

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.819 
early prototypes that depending on how
the<00:00:33.180> tiles<00:00:33.510> were<00:00:33.719> looking<00:00:33.989> they<00:00:34.110> were<00:00:34.170> making

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the tiles were looking they were making

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.650 
the tiles were looking they were making
it<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> bit<00:00:35.100> difficult<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> patterns

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it a bit difficult to see the patterns

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
it a bit difficult to see the patterns
and<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> had<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.649> take<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> extra

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and so I had to kind of take the extra

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.619 
and so I had to kind of take the extra
step<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:38.969> bit<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.270> love<00:00:39.360> in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
step and put a little bit of love in

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.380 
step and put a little bit of love in
this<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.239> besides

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
this so what do we have in here besides

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.619 
this so what do we have in here besides

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
deck is in the actual deck of the ship

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.929 
deck is in the actual deck of the ship
not<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> card<00:01:19.770> deck<00:01:20.009> there's<00:01:20.520> obviously<00:01:20.610> when

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
not a card deck there's obviously when

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
not a card deck there's obviously when
you<00:01:21.030> said<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> was<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.600> there's<00:01:22.290> no<00:01:22.320> deck

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you said that I was like there's no deck

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.350 
you said that I was like there's no deck
in<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.950> oh<00:01:23.100> yes<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.270> have

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
in here oh yes they have they have

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
in here oh yes they have they have
little<00:01:24.509> spaces<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.799> determine

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
little spaces here so you can determine

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
little spaces here so you can determine
exactly<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.570> yeah<00:01:27.990> exactly<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
exactly what they do yeah exactly so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.859 
exactly what they do yeah exactly so
it's<00:01:29.790> pretty<00:01:30.060> since<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.479> said<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:30.780> are

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it's pretty since if you said what are

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929 
it's pretty since if you said what are
your<00:01:31.229> pioneers<00:01:31.680> into<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> study<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.729> some

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
your pioneers into the study to do some

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
your pioneers into the study to do some
research<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.570> cartography<00:01:34.020> they'll<00:01:34.710> be

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
research and cartography they'll be

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.499 
research and cartography they'll be
providing<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> map<00:01:35.759> cards<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
providing you with the map cards this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
providing you with the map cards this
does<00:01:36.720> come<00:01:36.930> from<00:01:37.049> an<00:01:37.200> actual<00:01:37.350> deck<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.310> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
little bit of terraforming you can

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.039 
little bit of terraforming you can
actually<00:02:44.910> send<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.239> couple<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.569> your<00:02:45.720> workers

you'll have these different places to

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.720 
you'll have these different places to
put<00:03:30.720> them<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.019> got<00:03:31.170> five<00:03:32.010> pioneers<00:03:32.639> that

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
I've now reached enough resources to

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.190 
I've now reached enough resources to
actually<00:03:53.700> build<00:03:54.090> my<00:03:54.299> town<00:03:54.569> but<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.049> going<00:03:55.139> to

have to wait and do that on a future
turn<00:03:56.669> and<00:03:56.880> then<00:03:57.299> my<00:03:57.450> scouts<00:03:57.810> will<00:03:58.349> provide<00:03:58.709> me

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
turn and then my scouts will provide me

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.199 
turn and then my scouts will provide me
a<00:03:59.220> random<00:03:59.970> draw<00:04:00.930> from<00:04:01.169> this<00:04:01.319> bag<00:04:02.030> take<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> look

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
a random draw from this bag take a look

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.240 
a random draw from this bag take a look
at<00:04:03.329> my<00:04:03.419> tiles

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
at my tiles

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.910 
at my tiles
and<00:04:04.340> then<00:04:04.460> off<00:04:04.760> turn<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.480> know<00:04:05.630> have<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:06.170> hand

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
and then off turn you know have a hand

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.120 
and then off turn you know have a hand
of<00:04:07.310> cards<00:04:07.760> here<00:04:08.330> these<00:04:08.540> map<00:04:08.750> cards<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.410> an<00:04:09.980> off

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
of cards here these map cards and an off

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.800 
of cards here these map cards and an off
turn<00:04:10.370> I'm<00:04:10.550> looking<00:04:10.790> at<00:04:10.880> my<00:04:10.970> cards<00:04:11.120> looking<00:04:11.690> at

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
turn I'm looking at my cards looking at

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.690 
turn I'm looking at my cards looking at
the<00:04:11.930> what's<00:04:12.200> already<00:04:12.380> on<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.890> board<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.340> how

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
the what's already on the board and how

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.730 
the what's already on the board and how
I<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:14.090> kind<00:04:14.300> of<00:04:14.360> work<00:04:14.570> this<00:04:14.720> around<00:04:15.080> and<00:04:15.320> then

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
I can kind of work this around and then

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.930 
I can kind of work this around and then
next<00:04:15.950> turn<00:04:16.130> I'll<00:04:16.310> be<00:04:16.400> able<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.609> place<00:04:16.790> them

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
next turn I'll be able to place them

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.420 
next turn I'll be able to place them
down<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.390> continue<00:04:17.600> like<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.440> how<00:04:19.280> does

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
down and continue like that and how does

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.250 
down and continue like that and how does
it<00:04:19.519> end<00:04:19.640> what<00:04:20.030> do<00:04:20.090> we<00:04:20.180> when<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:20.930> once<00:04:21.140> you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
it end what do we when I so once you

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.810 
it end what do we when I so once you
reach<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.620> certain<00:04:21.650> threshold<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.520> victory

points that's going to trigger trigger
the<00:04:24.530> endgame<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.100> then<00:04:25.340> you'll<00:04:25.490> add<00:04:25.610> up<00:04:25.850> what

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
the endgame and then you'll add up what
