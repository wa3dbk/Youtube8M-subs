right-handed first baseman kind of see
how<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
how they do it

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.900 
how they do it
I'd<00:00:24.329> say<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.840> standard<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.399> most<00:00:26.640> guys

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
I'd say the standard way that most guys

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
I'd say the standard way that most guys
do<00:00:27.270> it<00:00:27.419> is<00:00:27.540> pretty<00:00:27.779> similar<00:00:28.020> throughout<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
do it is pretty similar throughout the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.870 
do it is pretty similar throughout the
league<00:00:28.770> but<00:00:29.040> then<00:00:29.160> there<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.309> some<00:00:29.610> guys<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
league but then there are some guys that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.450 
league but then there are some guys that
try<00:00:30.840> different<00:00:31.079> things<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.829> we'll<00:00:32.070> kind<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.369> go

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
try different things so we'll kind of go

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
try different things so we'll kind of go
over<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.790> standard<00:00:33.210> way<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.380> know

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
over the standard way and then you know

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
over the standard way and then you know
a<00:00:34.530> few<00:00:34.590> ways<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> might<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.489> able<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> try

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
a few ways that you might be able to try

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.900 
a few ways that you might be able to try
to<00:00:36.060> see<00:00:36.420> how<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> light<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.680> first<00:00:38.670> we'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
start off with the right-handed first

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.620 
start off with the right-handed first
baseman<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.830> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> standard<00:00:42.480> way

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630

ball<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:39.299> try<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.540> tag<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> runner<00:01:40.110> but

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
ball and don't try to tag the runner but

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.570 
ball and don't try to tag the runner but
basically<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.890> catch<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.340> put<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.549> right

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
basically just catch and put it right

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.609 
basically just catch and put it right
down<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.090> base<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:43.290> thing<00:01:43.470> you'll

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
down on the base and one thing you'll

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
down on the base and one thing you'll
see<00:01:43.890> by<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> few<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.549> guys<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.540> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
see by a few of these guys here in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
see by a few of these guys here in
Canarsie<00:01:46.140> own<00:01:46.409> catches<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.490> ball<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.939> then

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
Canarsie own catches the ball and then

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.149 
Canarsie own catches the ball and then
reaches<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> tries<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.229> tag<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.920> runner

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
reaches out and tries to tag the runner

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.060 
reaches out and tries to tag the runner
and<00:01:50.689> he<00:01:51.689> actually<00:01:51.840> still<00:01:52.200> gets<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> call<00:01:52.770> he's

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and he actually still gets the call he's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.550 
and he actually still gets the call he's
still<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.020> how<00:01:55.110> his<00:01:55.229> hand

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
still out but you can see how his hand

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920 
still out but you can see how his hand
gets<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:56.010> there<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.360> important<00:01:57.750> catch

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
gets in there so it's important catch

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.240 
gets in there so it's important catch
and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.320> quickly<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.860> put<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.159> down

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and then quickly just put it right down

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.780 
and then quickly just put it right down
at<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.670> base<00:01:59.820> as<00:02:00.060> quickly<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.659> so

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
at the base as quickly as you can so

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.100 
at the base as quickly as you can so
that's<00:02:02.790> basically<00:02:03.390> how<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.990> see

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that's basically how you're going to see

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.240 
that's basically how you're going to see
most<00:02:04.259> right-handers<00:02:05.659> position<00:02:06.659> themselves

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
most right-handers position themselves

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.949 
most right-handers position themselves
to<00:02:08.250> quickly<00:02:08.459> catch<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.209> tag

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.979 

now<00:02:16.959> we'll<00:02:17.110> go<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.260> left<00:02:17.530> hand<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.909> as<00:02:19.780> a

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
now we'll go to left hand so as a

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.440 
now we'll go to left hand so as a
left-hander<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:21.459> basically<00:02:21.909> can<00:02:22.180> be<00:02:22.269> the

you'll see first baseman to do

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.539 
you'll see first baseman to do
especially<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.739> big<00:04:02.889> leagues<00:04:03.099> well<00:04:03.370> she's

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
especially in the big leagues well she's

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.750 
especially in the big leagues well she's
very<00:04:03.849> much<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.269> lower<00:04:04.540> levels<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.489> just<00:04:06.489> I'm

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
very much a lower levels but just I'm

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.550 
very much a lower levels but just I'm
sure<00:04:06.790> people<00:04:07.269> were<00:04:07.329> wondering<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.200> when<00:04:08.440> this

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
sure people were wondering so when this

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.039 
sure people were wondering so when this
right<00:04:09.160> here<00:04:09.549> there's<00:04:10.359> a<00:04:10.419> left-handed<00:04:10.900> pitcher

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
right here there's a left-handed pitcher

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.099 
right here there's a left-handed pitcher
on<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.410> mound<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:13.419> know<00:04:13.480> sometimes<00:04:13.720> the

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
on the mound and you know sometimes the

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.720 
on the mound and you know sometimes the
left-handed<00:04:14.560> pitcher<00:04:14.919> especially<00:04:15.459> if<00:04:15.549> there

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
left-handed pitcher especially if there

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.560 
left-handed pitcher especially if there
may<00:04:16.030> be<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.180> left-handed<00:04:16.690> hitter<00:04:16.780> at<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.049> plate

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
may be a left-handed hitter at the plate

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.120 
may be a left-handed hitter at the plate
because<00:04:19.570> it's<00:04:20.079> tougher<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.530> read<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.949> move

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
because it's tougher to read the move

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.649 
because it's tougher to read the move
and<00:04:21.340> basically<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:21.789> first<00:04:21.970> baseman<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.450> have

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
and basically the first baseman you have

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.800 
and basically the first baseman you have
to<00:04:22.810> read<00:04:22.990> move<00:04:23.289> sometimes<00:04:24.330> left-handed<00:04:25.330> first

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
to read move sometimes left-handed first

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.870 
to read move sometimes left-handed first
baseman<00:04:26.349> feel<00:04:27.099> that<00:04:27.250> they<00:04:27.370> might<00:04:27.550> not

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
baseman feel that they might not

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.060 
baseman feel that they might not
get<00:04:28.180> off<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.390> bag<00:04:28.570> as<00:04:28.750> quickly<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.860> shuffle

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
get off the bag as quickly to shuffle

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.610 
get off the bag as quickly to shuffle
off<00:04:30.310> afterwards<00:04:30.790> so<00:04:31.090> some<00:04:31.330> guys<00:04:31.510> like<00:04:32.200> Davis

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
off afterwards so some guys like Davis

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.760 
off afterwards so some guys like Davis
here<00:04:33.480> puts<00:04:34.480> himself<00:04:34.630> in<00:04:34.960> this<00:04:35.080> position<00:04:35.620> with

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
here puts himself in this position with

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.560 
here puts himself in this position with
the<00:04:35.860> left-hander<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.610> then<00:04:36.730> he<00:04:36.880> reads<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.360> so

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
the left-hander and then he reads it so

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.040 
the left-hander and then he reads it so
if<00:04:37.900> he<00:04:38.260> picks<00:04:38.560> over<00:04:38.770> well<00:04:39.250> then<00:04:39.370> he'll<00:04:39.550> just

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
if he picks over well then he'll just

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.150 
if he picks over well then he'll just
drop<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.320> back<00:04:41.560> here<00:04:41.830> quickly<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:43.650> now<00:04:44.650> boom

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
drop that back here quickly and now boom

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.740 
drop that back here quickly and now boom
right<00:04:45.430> here<00:04:45.670> he's<00:04:45.820> basically<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.570> same

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
right here he's basically in the same

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.420 
right here he's basically in the same
position<00:04:47.200> he<00:04:47.320> would<00:04:47.470> have<00:04:47.560> been<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:48.190> now<00:04:48.310> he

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
position he would have been so now he

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.800 
position he would have been so now he
just<00:04:48.640> catches<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.720> puts<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.050> tag<00:04:50.230> down<00:04:51.810> but

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
just catches and puts the tag down but

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.170 
just catches and puts the tag down but
the<00:04:52.900> reason<00:04:53.200> he's<00:04:53.320> in<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.590> position<00:04:53.650> is<00:04:54.250> now

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
the reason he's in this position is now

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.820 
the reason he's in this position is now
if<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.420> pitcher<00:04:55.660> throws<00:04:56.110> home<00:04:56.410> if<00:04:56.710> the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
if the pitcher throws home if the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.980 
if the pitcher throws home if the
left-handed<00:04:57.250> pitcher<00:04:57.610> throws<00:04:58.030> home<00:04:58.300> well<00:04:58.840> now

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
left-handed pitcher throws home well now

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.660 
left-handed pitcher throws home well now
all<00:04:59.020> he<00:04:59.290> has<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.560> do<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.860> shuffle<00:05:00.070> off<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.580> he's

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
all he has to do is shuffle off and he's

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.430 
all he has to do is shuffle off and he's
in<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.820> good<00:05:01.030> position<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.990> it's<00:05:02.200> just<00:05:02.260> an

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
in a good position so it's just an

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.170 
in a good position so it's just an
easier<00:05:02.710> way<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.860> do<00:05:03.100> it<00:05:03.280> again<00:05:03.700> you<00:05:04.060> know

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
easier way to do it again you know

but<00:05:10.240> it's<00:05:10.360> just<00:05:10.540> another<00:05:10.690> option<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.260> can<00:05:11.290> you

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
but it's just another option you can you

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.230 
but it's just another option you can you
could<00:05:11.800> work<00:05:11.950> on<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.280> try<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.850> practice

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
could work on and try it and practice

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:21.570 
could work on and try it and practice
you<00:05:13.420> like<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:19.320> then<00:05:20.320> here's<00:05:20.650> Adrian<00:05:20.830> Silas

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
you like it and then here's Adrian Silas

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.600 
you like it and then here's Adrian Silas
so<00:05:22.480> this<00:05:22.630> is<00:05:22.780> again<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.380> little<00:05:23.620> bit<00:05:23.740> you

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
so this is again just a little bit you

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.000 
so this is again just a little bit you
know<00:05:24.730> it's<00:05:25.060> his<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:26.110> way<00:05:26.230> he<00:05:26.380> likes<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.740> do<00:05:26.890> it

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
know it's his the way he likes to do it

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.010 
know it's his the way he likes to do it
instead<00:05:27.700> of<00:05:27.760> having<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.390> right<00:05:28.570> foot<00:05:28.870> on<00:05:28.900> the

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
instead of having the right foot on the

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.990 
instead of having the right foot on the
bag<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.650> left<00:05:29.830> foot<00:05:29.980> here<00:05:30.220> well<00:05:30.700> he<00:05:30.790> just

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
bag and the left foot here well he just

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.640 
bag and the left foot here well he just
squares<00:05:31.540> up<00:05:31.780> a<00:05:31.930> little<00:05:32.080> bit<00:05:32.230> more<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.560> the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
squares up a little bit more to the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.910 
squares up a little bit more to the
pitcher<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.070> now<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:33.670> pitcher<00:05:34.270> picks<00:05:34.510> over

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
pitcher and now the pitcher picks over

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.050 
pitcher and now the pitcher picks over
well<00:05:35.920> then<00:05:36.070> he<00:05:36.130> just<00:05:36.310> dropped<00:05:36.490> his<00:05:36.670> right<00:05:36.880> foot

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
well then he just dropped his right foot

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.940 
well then he just dropped his right foot
back<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.600> he's<00:05:38.140> back<00:05:38.350> in<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.590> same<00:05:38.770> position

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
back and he's back in the same position

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:46.890 
back and he's back in the same position
catch<00:05:39.460> and<00:05:39.760> tag<00:05:44.010> and<00:05:45.450> then<00:05:46.450> if<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.630> pitcher

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
catch and tag and then if the pitcher

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.120 
catch and tag and then if the pitcher
delivers<00:05:47.020> home<00:05:47.470> well<00:05:47.680> then<00:05:47.800> all<00:05:47.860> he's

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
delivers home well then all he's

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.620 
delivers home well then all he's
basically<00:05:48.730> in<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:48.940> position<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.360> just

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
basically in the position to just

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.510 
basically in the position to just
shuffle<00:05:49.900> off<00:05:50.020> quickly<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:50.620> he<00:05:50.740> he<00:05:51.040> gets<00:05:51.280> there

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
shuffle off quickly and he he gets there

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.810 
shuffle off quickly and he he gets there
so<00:05:52.290> that's<00:05:53.290> board<00:05:54.060> catch<00:05:55.060> tag<00:05:55.600> Oh<00:05:56.640> so<00:05:57.640> again

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
so that's board catch tag Oh so again

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.790 
so that's board catch tag Oh so again

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
know but the big thing again is just to

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.510 
know but the big thing again is just to
make<00:06:32.110> sure<00:06:32.350> that<00:06:35.160> when<00:06:36.160> we're<00:06:36.310> in<00:06:36.400> this

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
make sure that when we're in this

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.909 
make sure that when we're in this
position<00:06:36.700> just<00:06:37.210> open<00:06:37.630> that<00:06:37.660> toe<00:06:37.930> up<00:06:38.110> be<00:06:38.800> in<00:06:38.860> a

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
position just open that toe up be in a

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.060 
position just open that toe up be in a
good<00:06:39.070> athletic<00:06:39.340> position<00:06:39.520> he's<00:06:40.150> been

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
good athletic position he's been

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.010 
good athletic position he's been
that<00:06:41.220> way<00:06:41.310> you<00:06:41.370> can<00:06:41.580> move<00:06:41.790> because<00:06:42.150> not<00:06:42.810> every

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
that way you can move because not every

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.180 
that way you can move because not every
throw<00:06:43.170> is<00:06:43.260> going<00:06:43.410> to<00:06:43.470> be<00:06:43.560> a<00:06:43.590> good<00:06:43.740> throw<00:06:43.920> and

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
throw is going to be a good throw and

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.980 
throw is going to be a good throw and
make<00:06:44.310> sure<00:06:44.430> you<00:06:44.520> expect<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.570> bad<00:06:45.750> throw
