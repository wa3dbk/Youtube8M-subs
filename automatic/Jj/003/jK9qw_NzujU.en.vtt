00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 with your friends are welcome once 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 more to your craft channel and of 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.450
 recycling this time I bring you a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.410
 very nice tutorial video and father who is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.900
 the chayote of the game plants verses 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.240
 men if they realize it is bad liver 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 He has his eyes and I did it with bottles 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 of plastic if you want to learn how 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.939
 do it stay with us first thing 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.160
 what you have to get is a bottle 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.250
 perfectly clean plastic 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.590
 preference of two point and a half liter or 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.899
 of three liters the lavas the short one is very 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.780
 While the bottom going to cut 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.550
 then the top part that is the mouth 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.530
 of the bottle once you have 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.510
 painted a strong green color that is more 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.760
 or less the color of the chayote I'm going to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.140
 show here one of a lighter green 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.539
 which is going to be for another character 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.030
 always remember to make a slot 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.949
 to put candy sweets money 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 Little things of your daughter Lydia 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.039
 pins what you always walk 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 losing there in the dressing table and not what 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.180
 you can find it good, this is the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 way you like, remember 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.290
 eliminate the simple red paints it very 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.540
 well two or three passes that I know 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.440
 and then you're going to do the shape or the base 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.420
 of the chayote's body when I saw the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.000
 Plant characters versus zombies or 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.310
 my son showed it to me I realized that the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.190
 bottle with this shape that I give is the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.350
 shape of a chayote is small towards 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.120
 up big down and it goes 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.250
 widening once you have the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.950
 base the next thing you're going to do is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.229
 put a little bit of felt on top 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.150
 it would be the roots or the tender bud of the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.820
 chayote of the color that you want me what 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.479
 I made one stronger the green and one more 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.640
 clear later with black foami 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.610
 delineates the eyebrows that the chayote always 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.650
 is angry I put some mobile eyes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.479
 in any matter you get big 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.150
 join them or they can also serve you 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.160
 these are like decals after 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.990
 I made her mouth and the chayote has some 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.140
 small protuberances or granites that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.820
 I made him with green felt plus 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.910
 strong so that this will stand out 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.360
 contrast like you already have your chayote of 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.429
 plants vs zombies if you liked it, like it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.110
 subscribe to my channel and I wait in your 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.410
 character 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.330
 the famous videogame plants versus 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.330
