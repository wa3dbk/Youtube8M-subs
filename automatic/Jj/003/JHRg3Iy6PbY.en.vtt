 little by little grandchild very much 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.180
 despair for food 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 Both lio and squid now can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.050
 to see that she is already very fat now 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.180
 are complete behaving 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 usually he was more aggressive he 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.619
 it's quieter quieter 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.710
 the two have broken teeth claws 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.270
 scratches and marks on the face damage 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 irreversible 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 she has this scar on her forehead is due 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.350
 she is hanging her head on the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 cage where she lived with a galley 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 very small she got stressed and then 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.409
 I was going from one place to another and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.119
 shaving head on the railing 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.549
 this was a wound that is now 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.520
 scarred and this mark was on the forehead 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.380
 a cage of six square meters 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.840
 if for a human being already a place 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.740
 small tight difficult to get 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.409
 to move 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.570
 imagine for a lion only that this cage 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.939
 in fact forced at the same time three 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.759
 lions is not an isolated history 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.880
 in the last year Brazil saw the number of 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.579
 abandoned lions fold all coming from 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.290
 circuses always in circumstances like 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.689
 this or worse 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.939
 it's too cruel because the circus of 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.430
 way in general they do that they commit 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.560
 ill- treatment and two ways be it 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.479
 physical castrating plucking in the tooth 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 mutilating pluck in the clutches 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.190
 or even psychological that you 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.610
 simply confine these animals to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.230
 chimpanzee giraffes zoos on wagons 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.379
 in cages 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.959
 between 2006 and 2008 the number of 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:22.150
 wild felines rescued by ibama 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.620
 rose from 68 to 150 among the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.349
 aging of animals laws that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.410
 prohibit animals in the spectacles that actions 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.239
 stricter authorities but lack 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.730
 space to receive so many animals 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.129
 abandoned and requiring care 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.470
 such as the ones offered in this 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.220
 sanctuary in sorocaba in the interior of são 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.310
 paulo who in one year received nine lions 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.349
 This law is the sabrina my chará and she 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.750
 walks very hard 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.090
 result of the confinement she had to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.280
 time in the circus in a circus of the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.410
 camila now what the situation was a 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.970
 of the worst cases it was one of the worst ever 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.340
 arrived here very lean 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.859
 very wounded with several bruises on her 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.079
 she has her tail amputated even with 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.790
 open wound and she has this 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.019
 deformity in the spine that people 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.910
 probably will not be able to 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.010
 to recover more than she saw nine years in 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.500
 A very tight cage she finished 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.590
 getting thor all pie so conditions 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.750
 the population already at risk. 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.359
 that circus cages are often 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.769
 old and rusty with danger of 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.319
 animals escape 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.010
 and it's not just lions other animals 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.750
 are also victims as Russian phase 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.730
 he was addicted to soda 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.720
 food is that old bread and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.549
 soda 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.090
 He suffered a lot, he had teeth. 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.010
 he does not have gas on his 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.599
 of life if all this suffering and yet 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.569
 did not fully recover 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.299
 or also the tiger simba that by the trauma 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.840
 to date reproduces stress 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.329
 and the shuttle cage where he lived to the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.930
 what we do is that you noticed that a 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.639
 circus does the abuse of an animal you do not 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.950
 honors this show so it is not 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.680
 a spectacle is a second cruelty 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.359
 He saw that the animal has contacted 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.819
 with the environmental police or with the 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.370
 or with an NGO known 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.739
 have in the city ​​to make a complaint 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.239
 formal education and ibama, which is the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.239
 can take the necessary measures
