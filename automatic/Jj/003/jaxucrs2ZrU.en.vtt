at<00:01:17.990> most<00:01:18.320> bias<00:01:18.650> McConnell's<00:01:19.310> gap<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:21.730> now<00:01:22.730> I

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
at most bias McConnell's gap so now I

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.520 
at most bias McConnell's gap so now I
have<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:24.440> nice<00:01:24.650> delivery<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.520> nice<00:01:25.700> face<00:01:26.090> and

have the nice delivery the nice face and
a<00:01:27.530> good<00:01:27.980> cup<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.280> coffee<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.230> I'm<00:01:30.230> getting

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
a good cup of coffee so I'm getting

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.120 
a good cup of coffee so I'm getting
started<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.390> new<00:01:32.600> piston<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.980> new

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
started so the new piston and the new

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.160 
started so the new piston and the new
liner<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.150> in<00:01:35.540> place<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:37.810> forgot<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.960> mention

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
liner is in place I forgot to mention

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.710 
liner is in place I forgot to mention
that<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:40.840> used<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:42.050> blast<00:01:43.090> sandblast<00:01:44.090> or<00:01:44.420> with

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
that I used to blast sandblast or with

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.880 
that I used to blast sandblast or with
glass<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.560> upper<00:01:46.160> part<00:01:46.400> of<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.940> piston<00:01:47.890> to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
glass the upper part of the piston to

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.330 
glass the upper part of the piston to
make<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.370> surface<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:50.060> little<00:01:50.180> bit<00:01:50.330> rougher

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
make the surface a little bit rougher

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.020 
make the surface a little bit rougher
that<00:01:52.340> makes<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.120> suit<00:01:54.340> adhere<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.550> little<00:01:55.850> bit

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
that makes the suit adhere a little bit

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
that makes the suit adhere a little bit
better<00:01:56.420> too<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:58.550> if<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.000> get<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.600> thin<00:01:59.870> layer

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
better too and if you get a thin layer

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.680 
better too and if you get a thin layer
of<00:02:00.110> soot<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.950> top<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.520> piston<00:02:01.730> you

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
of soot on the top of the piston you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.960 
of soot on the top of the piston you
don't<00:02:02.900> get<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:03.440> much<00:02:03.590> heat<00:02:03.920> transfer<00:02:04.550> down<00:02:04.760> to

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
don't get so much heat transfer down to

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.350 
don't get so much heat transfer down to
the<00:02:05.120> piston<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.250> onwards<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.940> rod<00:02:08.149> and

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
the piston and onwards to the rod and

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.710 
the piston and onwards to the rod and
the<00:02:08.899> cylinder<00:02:09.319> walls<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:11.180> might<00:02:11.480> be<00:02:11.690> a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the cylinder walls so that might be a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.640 
the cylinder walls so that might be a
good<00:02:12.020> thing<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:13.310> take<00:02:13.460> care<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.730> when

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
good thing to to take care of when

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.509 
good thing to to take care of when
you<00:02:14.709> start<00:02:15.069> assembling<00:02:15.730> your<00:02:15.790> own<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:18.340> in

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
you start assembling your own or in

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.500 
you start assembling your own or in
order<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.409> check<00:02:20.409> what<00:02:20.890> about<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.090> piston

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
order to check what about the piston

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.170 
order to check what about the piston
clearance<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.079> got<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.760> usually<00:02:24.760> do<00:02:24.909> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
clearance you got I usually do the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.179 
clearance you got I usually do the
normal<00:02:25.599> clay<00:02:26.439> test<00:02:26.939> you<00:02:27.939> put<00:02:28.180> clay<00:02:29.079> inside<00:02:29.769> the

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
normal clay test you put clay inside the

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.610 
normal clay test you put clay inside the
valve<00:02:30.900> pockets<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.939> and<00:02:34.329> then<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.409> put

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
valve pockets like this and then you put

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.940 
valve pockets like this and then you put
the<00:02:36.069> cylinder<00:02:36.430> head<00:02:36.819> on<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.620> turn<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.769> motor

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the cylinder head on and turn the motor

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.839 
the cylinder head on and turn the motor
around<00:02:39.400> at<00:02:40.120> least<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.689> two<00:02:41.530> turns<00:02:41.829> two<00:02:42.609> full

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
around at least to two turns two full

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.990 
around at least to two turns two full
turns<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.879> check<00:02:46.060> how<00:02:46.750> much<00:02:48.000> dent

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
turns and then you check how much dent

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.410 
turns and then you check how much dent
or<00:02:49.299> mark<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.470> have<00:02:50.590> made<00:02:50.829> from<00:02:51.430> from<00:02:52.299> the

or mark you have made from from the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.099 
or mark you have made from from the
valves<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.109> clay<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.730> when<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.180> put

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
valves in the clay so when you have put

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.089 
valves in the clay so when you have put
in<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.349> clay<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:58.239> turn<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> motor<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.260> it's

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
squish about one millimeter and I have

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.780 
squish about one millimeter and I have
measured<00:04:08.900> here<00:04:09.350> on<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.800> XO's<00:04:10.190> they<00:04:10.550> need<00:04:10.760> a

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
measured here on the XO's they need a

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.990 
measured here on the XO's they need a
little<00:04:11.000> bit<00:04:11.209> more<00:04:11.480> room<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:12.650> they've<00:04:13.130> got<00:04:13.400> like

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
little bit more room so they've got like

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.810 
little bit more room so they've got like
two<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.480> half<00:04:14.510> millimeters<00:04:15.320> both<00:04:15.820> axially

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
two and half millimeters both axially

two and half millimeters both axially
and<00:04:17.140> radially<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.930> really<00:04:21.169> important

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
and radially so that is really important

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.070 
and radially so that is really important
to<00:04:22.010> check<00:04:22.790> that<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.150> have<00:04:23.180> these<00:04:23.450> clearances

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
to check that you have these clearances

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.180 
to check that you have these clearances
before<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:24.680> assemble<00:04:25.250> your<00:04:25.280> engine<00:04:26.680> so<00:04:27.680> like

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
before you assemble your engine so like

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.610 
before you assemble your engine so like
you<00:04:28.370> see<00:04:28.550> we're<00:04:28.910> back<00:04:29.270> on<00:04:29.510> track<00:04:29.720> again<00:04:29.840> the

the cam positioning like this and there
you<00:05:09.050> have<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:10.270> intake<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:12.340> guess<00:05:13.340> with<00:05:13.580> this

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
you have the intake I guess with this

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.680 
you have the intake I guess with this
large<00:05:14.660> intake<00:05:15.229> I<00:05:15.440> get<00:05:15.729> get<00:05:16.729> an<00:05:16.910> excessive

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
large intake I get get an excessive

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.730 
large intake I get get an excessive
amount<00:05:17.960> of<00:05:18.620> money<00:05:18.680> spent<00:05:19.340> on<00:05:19.900> paper<00:05:20.900> covering

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
amount of money spent on paper covering

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:28.719 
amount of money spent on paper covering
up<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:24.050> on<00:05:24.950> top<00:05:25.160> here<00:05:26.030> you<00:05:26.210> have<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:28.310> crank

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
up and on top here you have the crank

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.350 
up and on top here you have the crank
ventilation<00:05:29.570> coming<00:05:30.229> out

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.670 

and<00:05:32.479> you<00:05:33.020> see<00:05:33.259> the<00:05:34.330> lubrication<00:05:35.330> for<00:05:36.139> the

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
and you see the lubrication for the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.129 
and you see the lubrication for the
camps<00:05:37.069> and<00:05:37.569> I'm<00:05:38.569> taking<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.919> normal<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.930> oil

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
camps and I'm taking the normal the oil

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.990 
camps and I'm taking the normal the oil
coming<00:05:42.530> out<00:05:42.770> from<00:05:43.430> here<00:05:44.020> it's<00:05:45.610> from<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.759> same

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
coming out from here it's from the same

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.760 
coming out from here it's from the same
channel<00:05:47.719> as<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:47.930> was<00:05:48.430> up<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:50.169> 2004<00:05:51.169> I<00:05:51.199> guess

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.929 

alright<00:05:54.770> so<00:05:55.990> now<00:05:56.990> it's<00:05:57.400> back<00:05:58.400> in<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.639> frame

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
alright so now it's back in the frame

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.979 
alright so now it's back in the frame
and<00:05:59.150> off<00:05:59.750> for<00:06:00.349> the<00:06:00.620> dyno
