00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
just a white sheet of paper it came out

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.080 
just a white sheet of paper it came out
like<00:03:07.990> really<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.710> light<00:03:09.100> purple<00:03:09.580> almost

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
here in a second but the the seam

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.320 
here in a second but the the seam
sealing<00:03:17.860> on<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> jacket<00:03:18.610> obviously<00:03:19.000> didn't

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
sealing on the jacket obviously didn't

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.350 
sealing on the jacket obviously didn't
take<00:03:19.620> any<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.070> other<00:03:21.430> dye<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.090> looks<00:03:22.270> a

was<00:03:33.880> running<00:03:34.030> clear<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.690> then<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.350> ran<00:03:35.650> it

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
was running clear and then I ran it

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.680 
was running clear and then I ran it
through<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.120> wash<00:03:37.120> cycle<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:38.490> delicate<00:03:39.690> with

through a wash cycle on delicate with
two<00:03:41.050> rinses<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:42.130> make<00:03:42.280> sure<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.580> was

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
two rinses to make sure it was
