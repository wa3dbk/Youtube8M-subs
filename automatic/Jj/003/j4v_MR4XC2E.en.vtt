00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.069
 good that you can see more and 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.410
 with more or less pins to guide me and 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.870
 next we are going to sew starting 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.870
 from up here you have to start a 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.790
 well closed point and we continue until 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.130
 up down sorry 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.310
 the idea is to blur it from this 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.130
 way so it does not look like it breaks 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.030
 the seam of a suddenly then 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.760
 let's make the line 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.950
 in this way how is each 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.770
 instead narrower and as I said 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.860
 let's sew good I show you how 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.910
 is already cooked what is the first 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.700
 pin 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.160
 how it is caught and I did the same with 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.580
 the other side I show you how the pitas 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.880
 They are in the middle and not on the sides and not 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.670
 here placed 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.820
 If you have a lot of fabric left over like this in 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.490
 this case can cut what I was going to catch 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.810
 so that you do not cause them one does not 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:05.260
 open do not fray or accommodate it like this and 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.110
 Sew it to the same skirt so that it does not 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.760
 the peaks are out and good once 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.230
 I took the opportunity to cut what was 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.650
 I mentioned that it is a piece of the lining 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.840
 and he gave him a quick pill so that 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.980
 do not continue fraying and with these 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.980
 we put on the suspenders 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.220
 good with the fabric work that we left 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.740
 apart from the lining we are going to do the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.530
 tight in this way we join it and what 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.100
 we turn inside out so that it is in a 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 it rolls more or less like that and the end what 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.200
 let's join the fabric 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.140
 in the part of the back and the ends 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.000
 the front part to already form what 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.659
 which is the line as you can see in 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.439
 this case I am coming 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.710
 to the clamp that we had formed and I'm 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.500
 putting the strip here to hide 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.649
 this way I'm going to sew it for 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.240
 place it in the back part and there's 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.039
 three designs as we look good here 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.399
 I show you that you have already placed the two 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.399
 strips 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.920
 we just have to pass 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.890
 to do what they will feel 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.440
 we have two options 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.440
 one that is straight 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.430
 we have with a pin or 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.080
 and the ready 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:43.300
 I show you dress is over I decided 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.300
 put the crossed straps 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.620
 as you can see this part of here has already 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.760
 remained fairly it is lawful and not 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.760
 pockets with the tweezers that we put 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.050
 the edges a dress 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.799
 based on a skirt that we had to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.540
 It was long and can be adapted very well 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.430
 I hope you like it as you can see 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.590
 seams simply very simple and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.140
 we give a radical change to only one 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.159
 The garment is tried by the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.159
 we keep seeing chao
