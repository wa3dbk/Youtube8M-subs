00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
well and why don't we go attack and see

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.140 
well and why don't we go attack and see
if<00:01:26.790> some<00:01:26.970> loot<00:01:27.150> drops<00:01:30.979> yep<00:01:31.979> zergling<00:01:32.850> venom

dropped sewing venom dropped again which
is<00:01:35.040> showing<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.909> our<00:01:36.060> probabilities

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
is showing that our probabilities

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
is showing that our probabilities
working<00:01:36.960> good<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.290> sort<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> dropped<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.210> now

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
working good and sort of dropped so now

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.760 
working good and sort of dropped so now
we<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.540> pick<00:01:39.750> these<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.320> pick<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> sword

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.050 
we can pick these up I can pick a sword
up<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> swords

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
up and now I can see that the swords

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 
up and now I can see that the swords
sitting<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.600> even<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.320> doing

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
sitting here even if it's not doing

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.560 
sitting here even if it's not doing
anything<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.549> our<00:01:44.670> general<00:01:45.000> inventory

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
anything it's in our general inventory

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
anything it's in our general inventory
and<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.920> why<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.189> figure<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
and so why don't we figure out the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.920 
and so why don't we figure out the
selling<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> I'll<00:01:48.420> fix<00:01:48.659> some<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
selling thing and I'll fix some of the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.840 
selling thing and I'll fix some of the
buttons<00:01:49.140> off<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.860> believe<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> reason<00:01:50.700> that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
buttons off so I believe the reason that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.499 
buttons off so I believe the reason that
it's<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:52.640> enough<00:01:53.640> functioning<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.149> me<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
it's not enough functioning this me to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.709 
it's not enough functioning this me to
pile<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.880> let's<00:01:56.880> place<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> couple<00:01:57.299> just

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
pile on here let's place a couple just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.149 
pile on here let's place a couple just
we'll<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.439> fixes<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.890> hopefully

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
we'll see if that fixes it hopefully

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.270 
we'll see if that fixes it hopefully
will<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:01.049> let's<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.439> back<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.590> data<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> let's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
will and let's go back to data and let's

Biff<00:04:28.370> whose<00:04:28.550> tutorial<00:04:29.060> about<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.390> i<00:04:29.480> believe

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
Biff whose tutorial about it i believe

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.110 
Biff whose tutorial about it i believe
he<00:04:29.900> did<00:04:30.050> one<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:31.610> basically<00:04:31.730> involves

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
he did one and it basically involves

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.790 
he did one and it basically involves
giving<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.720> train<00:04:32.990> ability<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.590> this

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
giving the train ability to this

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.550 
giving the train ability to this
building<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:35.450> train<00:04:35.660> abilities<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.350> same

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
building the train abilities the same

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.870 
building the train abilities the same
way<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.740> make<00:04:36.950> marines<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.490> stuff<00:04:37.700> like<00:04:37.820> that

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
way you make marines and stuff like that

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.670 
way you make marines and stuff like that
except<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:38.510> can<00:04:38.630> use<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.990> make<00:04:39.110> items<00:04:39.380> as

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
except you can use it to make items as

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.590 
except you can use it to make items as
well<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.280> then<00:04:40.760> items<00:04:41.060> will<00:04:41.180> just<00:04:41.330> go<00:04:41.420> into

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
well and then items will just go into

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.720 
well and then items will just go into
your<00:04:41.720> inventory<00:04:41.960> when<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.530> when<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.490> buy

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
your inventory when you when you buy

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.570 
your inventory when you when you buy
them<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.330> would<00:04:44.480> give<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:46.280> give<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
them so you would give you give it the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.280 
them so you would give you give it the
train<00:04:46.820> ability<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.420> then<00:04:47.570> you'd<00:04:48.050> also<00:04:48.140> have

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
train ability and then you'd also have

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.530 
train ability and then you'd also have
to<00:04:48.410> give<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.710> interact<00:04:49.220> ability<00:04:49.730> so<00:04:50.360> that

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
to give it the interact ability so that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.840 
to give it the interact ability so that
when<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:50.990> come<00:04:51.200> close<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.680> becomes<00:04:51.980> your<00:04:52.220> you

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
when you come close it becomes your you

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.159 
when you come close it becomes your you
i<00:04:52.880> mean<00:04:53.060> when<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.300> come<00:04:53.540> close<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:53.780> can

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
i mean when you come close you can

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.480 
i mean when you come close you can
interact<00:04:54.380> with<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.770> building<00:04:55.100> so<00:04:55.250> it's<00:04:55.370> not

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
interact with the building so it's not

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.460 
interact with the building so it's not
just<00:04:55.550> neutral<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.240> then<00:04:56.960> you'll<00:04:57.080> see<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.290> bunch

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
just neutral and then you'll see a bunch

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.320 
just neutral and then you'll see a bunch
of<00:04:57.620> like<00:04:57.770> like<00:04:58.610> instead<00:04:58.880> of<00:04:58.940> trained<00:04:59.150> marine

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
of like like instead of trained marine

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.060 
of like like instead of trained marine
you'll<00:04:59.600> see<00:04:59.750> by<00:05:00.050> item<00:05:00.440> if<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.590> set<00:05:00.890> it<00:05:00.919> up

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
you'll see by item if you set it up

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.610 
you'll see by item if you set it up
properly<00:05:01.660> be<00:05:02.660> food<00:05:02.840> goes<00:05:02.960> over<00:05:03.230> that<00:05:03.260> so<00:05:03.560> i'm

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
properly be food goes over that so i'm

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.409 
properly be food goes over that so i'm
not<00:05:03.740> really<00:05:03.800> going<00:05:04.040> to<00:05:04.100> cover<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.400> here<00:05:04.730> hope

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
not really going to cover that here hope

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.470 
not really going to cover that here hope
this<00:05:05.540> helps<00:05:05.600> thanks<00:05:06.080> for<00:05:06.169> watching
