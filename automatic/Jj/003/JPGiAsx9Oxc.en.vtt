00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.550
 today I decided 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.119
 explain what is the origin 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.740
 well for those who do not know the sip are the nemesis of the yaki 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.870
 they follow the dark side of the force and usually use lightsabers of color 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.500
 Red 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.470
 this video is more specifically aimed at those who know the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.600
 history of this wastewater that those who have not seen the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 movies may not understand some things 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.990
 well without further ado we begin 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.070
 long ago even before what happened in knights of the ancient 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.910
 republic was founded the first Jedi order which was conformed by 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.860
 followers of the light side of the force who believed that to acquire 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.300
 the powers of force needed meditation and peace 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.360
 but there was a yeti called environment 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.900
 who thought that to acquire the true power of force there was no 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.520
 to meditate and be at peace, on the contrary, he thought that it should be 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 unleash the emotions passions and hatred 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.790
 with which he became the first to follow the path of the dark side 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.320
 he was adding yetis to his cause by converting them to the dark side texts 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.900
 that blurs madóz the Quito Quirós 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.700
 there was a great tension between the wants and the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.830
 it erupted into a great battle called the great civic procession after which we 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.850
 remains and obscure were expelled from the old republic and sent in 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.470
 coastal to the unknown of the galaxy 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.670
 in a world far and unknown by the republic at that time liam adocco 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.650
 rival inhabited a primitive alien race called ict 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.040
 these seven were sensitive to the force they called magic 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.290
 well the dark Yaquis came to this world called ran bread 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.330
 in him this primitive race called sitar see the disover kouros descend on 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.159
 ships worshiped them as if they were gods 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.419
 in addition the handling of the strength that had the sith was impressive by 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.729
 what I feel first yédiot cured began to investigate them until they became 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:22.819
 even stronger than them 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.769
 blind us blind enslaved the nineteenth and month that sharon with them 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.249
 forming an empire that was called the empire follows 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.819
 this great empire had hundreds of worlds and was made up of slaves 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.849
 Engineers plus attendant without 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.360
 the empire of the sip stood up for a long time having several envelopes 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.019
 of the sic as attached palmar to load us natasha routes cetera 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.139
 the empire of the tried in conflict with the republic this conflict was 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.879
 called the civil war that 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.819
 the end of this conflict ended with the extermination of the sith and the almost 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.409
 annihilation of the want 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.310
 time later the Jedi the boys watched to grow after which there was 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:06.139
 a great battle in which he fought the whole of the sip against a few thousand 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:06.889
 of victims 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.150
 after this battle 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.510
 there was no situation and I live except a century called barbarian 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.510
 he escaped with an apprentice and established the rule that he should only 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.469
 have a teacher and an apprentice 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.709
 the republic believed the pp sites 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.909
 without knowing that one of them was still 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.889
 trained a lot of time after acting in which he trained to give positive which 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.770
 kill his master while he slept 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.360
 he seized the republic his first trendy was dharma ultima after was to give 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.510
 they shoot bush better known as Count Dooku and finally the young Anakin 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.019
 I write to believe who called dark void 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:40.819
 as well 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.299
 that was the story of the centuries although he only mentioned the most 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.269
 I hope I have clarified to you what is the origin of the Sith and their 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.169
 history until the creation of the galactic interior 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.359
 one last thing the word if it has the Celtic and means nothing 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.629
 that was all if they have 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.479
 just let me know and I will try to help 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.299
 I hope you liked my video and until next time
