 and so 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.109
 and we chose the two that can be more submissive and we got closer 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.259
 we 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.210
 you can get closer to us that's what we care about the fiction jury 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.970

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.030
 by means of genetic modification we are creating different types of glasses 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.670

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.109
 but the 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.329
 We believe that based on our needs not the needs of the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.480
 Toll 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.079
 we do not specify what we started to use 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.820
 so that this benefit as for example with dogs dogs with 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.860
 policemen 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.490
 for drug detection 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.330
 for anyone who would qualify secretaries of state faces and mistakes 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.860
 for nothing the grazing st

 if then you somehow save 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 we need them too 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.720
 another thing is important 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.120
 Christian get bored 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.770
 if that is very easy to know 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.330
 all have a fairly large territory that does not defend with urine 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.990
 and like a mole that's what they do when they go out for a walk 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.300
 which is in some way 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.110
 what its territory 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.180

 you want to buy a piece of land 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.879
 It is extremely important that you come with a veterinarian to deal with 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.389
 terrain characteristics 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.479
 It seemed comfortable 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.579

 so they exercise the communication of the dogs with us 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.590
 and basically the behavioral problems is based on the fact that we both want to educate 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.769
 to terror 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.739

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.340
 by our sight by how we are accepted as we are 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.729
 it's not because we are Kurdish poor rich dishes 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.259
 but simply 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.829
 We are your leaders and send us days 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.429
 it is important that you issue them 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 but do not have them 10 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.089
 but they have to be aware 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:08.319
 ipad if that's going to do 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.539
 that we have a noble friend for life 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.059

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.969
 that make us to his fifth and miami 26 dissidents with sadness 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.059
 of this form of communication 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:26.159
 besides the language 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.069
 they how they communicate with barking with urine 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.659
 known 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.090
 i 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.210
 with many things that we 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.550
 in some way we have to learn 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.740
 to understand what is happening 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.120
 so 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.029
 i 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.380
 practical problems is for example 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.469
 the ambivalence 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.889
 then he runs away and we all go out to run around him if we do not 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.199
 we go out to anything what we are doing is 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.310
 and if one of us is submissive we are you 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.719
 the detainee is 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.059
 but recovery and grinding 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.749
 what we have to do is that this year it is taken out but when it arrived 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.279
 to others who did not adjust philly 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:17.860
 I know that if you go to 10 500 or 3 minutes the albos 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.620
 the secretary we knew 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.350
 we stop hysterical or get angry only punished with more time 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.350
 it was worth to react punished 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.280
 we must take into account that Peru has 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.759
 40 million 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.069
 of years or rather the lugo has 40 million years of living here the 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:36.020
 Aunts 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.290
 for that reason the instincts are extremely stronger than us 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.290
 we part social trust 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.580
 we are dt e 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.279
 they are members of the cooperatives and that 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.880
 the others are two 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.880
 tabárez 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.160
 then in those instincts 2 11 sep 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.490
 different 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.430

 to intendenta our mascot 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.949

 in daily coexistence learning until understanding 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.369
 just like what happens with our children 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.539
