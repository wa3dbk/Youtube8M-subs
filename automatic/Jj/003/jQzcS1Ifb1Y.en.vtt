easy way to do this you see how a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.010 
easy way to do this you see how a
venetian<00:01:06.000> blinds<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:06.900> these

venetian blinds down and all these
little<00:01:07.260> tiny<00:01:07.470> pinholes<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.159> light<00:01:08.340> coming

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
little tiny pinholes of light coming

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.969 
little tiny pinholes of light coming
through<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.119> super<00:01:09.900> easy<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
through the super easy way to do this is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
through the super easy way to do this is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
get about 215 feet away or so find a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.620 
get about 215 feet away or so find a
pinhole<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.710> light<00:01:14.000> that's<00:01:15.000> entering<00:01:15.479> in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pinhole of light that's entering in

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
pinhole of light that's entering in
through<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.960> house<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.460> focus<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
autofocus let it focus in and then pull

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
autofocus let it focus in and then pull
your<00:01:22.229> diopter<00:01:22.740> adjustment<00:01:22.770> wheel<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is that the image will actually split

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
is that the image will actually split
one<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.900> you're<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.259> too<00:01:37.409> far<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:37.799> way

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
one way if you're going too far one way

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.010 
one way if you're going too far one way
and<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.880> pinhole<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> light<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.689> split

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and the the pinhole of light will split

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.840 
and the the pinhole of light will split
the<00:01:40.170> other<00:01:40.290> way<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.100> you're<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.400> able<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the other way so you're actually able to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.060 
the other way so you're actually able to
get<00:01:42.030> super<00:01:42.390> precise<00:01:42.780> adjustment<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
get super precise adjustment this is

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.069 
get super precise adjustment this is
you're<00:01:44.220> looking<00:01:44.460> through<00:01:44.729> your<00:01:44.850> viewfinder

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
of eyesight issue where you need to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.920 
of eyesight issue where you need to
adjust<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:52.110> diopter<00:01:53.030> correction<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> your

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930

the image will actually split the
pinhole<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.800> light<00:02:20.980> will<00:02:21.130> split<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:22.540> your

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
pinhole of light will split if your

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.750 
pinhole of light will split if your
tooth<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.140> once<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.740> turns<00:02:23.980> into<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.250> perfect
