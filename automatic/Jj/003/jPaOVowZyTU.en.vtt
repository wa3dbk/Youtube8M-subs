everything was shrinking like I wasn't

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.069 
everything was shrinking like I wasn't
skinny<00:01:43.340> but<00:01:44.719> everything<00:01:45.719> was<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.289> down<00:01:46.700> so

skinny but everything was going down so

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.550 
skinny but everything was going down so
month<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:50.899> was<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.920> probably<00:01:53.159> say<00:01:53.969> I<00:01:54.689> had

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
month one was I would probably say I had

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
month one was I would probably say I had
the<00:01:55.679> baby<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.299> 164

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the baby out 164

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.399 
the baby out 164
I<00:01:58.399> weighed<00:01:59.399> 164<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.539> by<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.840> end<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.170> month

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I weighed 164 and by the end of month

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.419 
I weighed 164 and by the end of month
one<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.039> down<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.360> 148<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.710> guess<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
one I was down to 148 so I guess that is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.800 
one I was down to 148 so I guess that is
a<00:02:08.459> big<00:02:08.640> difference<00:02:08.849> yeah

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
a big difference yeah

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.610 
a big difference yeah
and<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.009> month<00:02:11.310> -<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:13.049> was<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.620> okay<00:02:14.489> I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and so then month - I was like okay I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.309 
and so then month - I was like okay I
want<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> lose<00:02:16.950> more<00:02:17.250> weight<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.599> was<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.230> I

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319
