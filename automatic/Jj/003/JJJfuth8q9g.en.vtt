00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
netbook it always sounds not like you're

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.030 
netbook it always sounds not like you're
very<00:03:00.320> big<00:03:00.830> difference<00:03:01.070> but<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.270> crazy<00:03:03.040> just

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
very big difference but it's crazy just

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.790 
very big difference but it's crazy just
look<00:03:04.280> at<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:05.020> two<00:03:06.020> really<00:03:06.350> big<00:03:06.530> difference

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
look at that two really big difference

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.690 
look at that two really big difference
and<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.900> mean<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.500> other<00:03:09.590> one<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:09.920> about<00:03:10.310> four

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
and I mean the other one is about four

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.090 
and I mean the other one is about four
kilograms<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.200> about<00:03:12.410> one<00:03:12.830> kilogram

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
kilograms this one is about one kilogram

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.449 
kilograms this one is about one kilogram
and<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:14.780> makes<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.260> big<00:03:15.380> difference<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:16.190> also

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
and it makes a big difference and also

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.210 
and it makes a big difference and also
battery<00:03:17.090> life<00:03:17.299> tour<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.780> one<00:03:18.019> is<00:03:18.200> two<00:03:18.530> hours

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
battery life tour the one is two hours

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.229 
battery life tour the one is two hours
maybe<00:03:19.760> this<00:03:20.239> one<00:03:20.450> has<00:03:20.600> nine<00:03:20.840> hours<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.910> I

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
maybe this one has nine hours and so I

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.120 
maybe this one has nine hours and so I
think<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:25.299> netbook<00:03:26.299> has<00:03:26.510> really<00:03:27.130> advantage

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
think a netbook has really advantage

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.080 
think a netbook has really advantage
over<00:03:28.489> not<00:03:29.299> no<00:03:29.600> poop<00:03:29.959> it's<00:03:30.680> not<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:31.310> replacement

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
over not no poop it's not a replacement

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.670 
over not no poop it's not a replacement
but<00:03:33.220> it's<00:03:34.220> pretty<00:03:34.760> cool<00:03:35.120> also<00:03:35.989> for<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.200> surfing

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
but it's pretty cool also for a surfing

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.870 
but it's pretty cool also for a surfing
