00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
new zealand was really impressive but

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.700 
new zealand was really impressive but
when<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> start<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.710> you're

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
when you start like that you're

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.990 
when you start like that you're
confident<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.250> getting<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.520> result<00:00:20.789> when<00:00:20.910> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
confident of getting the result when you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.250 
confident of getting the result when you
when<00:00:21.180> you've<00:00:21.300> got<00:00:21.449> those<00:00:21.600> first<00:00:21.869> few<00:00:21.990> tries

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
when you've got those first few tries

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.859 
when you've got those first few tries
yeah<00:00:22.769> well<00:00:22.980> i<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.600> kind<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
yeah well i think that that was kind of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.450 
yeah well i think that that was kind of
it<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.380> good<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> boys<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.340> ham

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it was good for the boys to see that ham

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.509 
it was good for the boys to see that ham
we<00:00:27.180> could<00:00:27.689> score<00:00:27.900> tries<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.320> also<00:00:28.619> d<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:28.949> keep

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
we could score tries and also d up keep

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.900

the<00:00:29.609> score<00:00:29.820> line<00:00:29.970> 20<00:00:30.359> again<00:00:30.660> at<00:00:31.140> halftime<00:00:31.320> but

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
the score line 20 again at halftime but

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.130 
the score line 20 again at halftime but
it's<00:00:32.910> quite<00:00:33.030> quite<00:00:33.329> disappointing<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.870> second
