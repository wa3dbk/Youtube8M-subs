much I'll get into the that we did other

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.200 
much I'll get into the that we did other
live<00:00:37.290> data<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.399> particular<00:00:38.670> vehicle<00:00:39.030> as

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
live data for this particular vehicle as

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.160 
live data for this particular vehicle as
you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> engine<00:00:40.140> running

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you can see we have the engine running

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.959 
you can see we have the engine running
we're<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.739> moving<00:00:41.430> anywhere<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.940> are

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
we're not moving anywhere we are

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.510 
we're not moving anywhere we are
stationary<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> an<00:00:43.739> RPM<00:00:44.219> or

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
stationary but we do have an RPM or

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.860 
stationary but we do have an RPM or
probably<00:00:45.300> around<00:00:45.600> six<00:00:46.500> 700<00:00:47.129> there

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
probably around six 700 there

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.380 
probably around six 700 there
alright<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.170> clicking<00:00:49.920> ok<00:00:50.489> 2<00:00:50.550> data<00:00:51.120> stream<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
alright so clicking ok 2 data stream and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
alright so clicking ok 2 data stream and
what<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> basically<00:00:54.660> does<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.379> gives<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.710> all

do is click on all data stream of page

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
do is click on all data stream of page
so<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> gives<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.780> give<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
all these three values when we click OK

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
all these three values when we click OK
it's<00:01:09.689> selected<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.430> we'll

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
it's selected them all and then we'll

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.330 
it's selected them all and then we'll
just<00:01:11.700> click<00:01:11.850> escape<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.710> should<00:01:13.920> start

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
just click escape and I should start

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
just click escape and I should start
showing<00:01:14.700> us<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> particular<00:01:15.540> values<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
showing us the particular values so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.590 
showing us the particular values so
there<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> engine<00:01:17.490> speed<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
there we can see the engine speed and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.609 
there we can see the engine speed and
that<00:01:19.290> will<00:01:19.409> change<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:21.229> put<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.320> foot<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that will change as I put my foot on the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.450 
that will change as I put my foot on the
gas

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
gas

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.899 
gas
as<00:01:24.820> you<00:01:24.940> can<00:01:25.030> see<00:01:25.210> there<00:01:25.450> I'm<00:01:25.600> sort<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:26.909> putting

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
as you can see there I'm sort of putting

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.969 
as you can see there I'm sort of putting
it<00:01:28.030> up<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.360> maybe<00:01:28.810> two<00:01:29.080> thousand<00:01:29.590> there<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
it up to maybe two thousand there and

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.890 
it up to maybe two thousand there and
it's<00:01:30.130> shown<00:01:30.400> two<00:01:30.640> thousand<00:01:31.210> on<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.600> data

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
it's shown two thousand on the data

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.100 
it's shown two thousand on the data
stream<00:01:32.260> page<00:01:33.540> vehicle<00:01:34.540> has<00:01:34.630> been<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.810> zero

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
stream page vehicle has been a zero

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.460 
stream page vehicle has been a zero
coolant<00:01:35.710> temperature<00:01:36.220> ninety<00:01:36.610> six<00:01:37.030> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
coolant temperature ninety six and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.120 
coolant temperature ninety six and
rising<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.720> that's<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.080> first<00:01:41.290> page<00:01:41.650> wouldn't

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
rising so that's the first page wouldn't

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.100 
rising so that's the first page wouldn't
just<00:01:42.310> come<00:01:42.460> out<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.880> then<00:01:43.570> we<00:01:43.840> can<00:01:43.990> go

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
just come out of that then we can go

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.889 
just come out of that then we can go
down<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.590> second<00:01:45.040> page<00:01:45.420> click<00:01:46.420> old<00:01:46.659> data

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
down to the second page click old data

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.680 
down to the second page click old data
stream<00:01:47.170> F<00:01:47.290> page<00:01:47.530> escaped<00:01:48.100> again<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.700> then

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
stream F page escaped again and then

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.510 
stream F page escaped again and then
here<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.050> are<00:01:50.080> engine<00:01:50.740> coolant<00:01:51.040> temperature

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
here we are engine coolant temperature

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.230 
here we are engine coolant temperature
again<00:01:51.850> throttle<00:01:52.630> position<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:54.759> we<00:01:54.940> can<00:01:55.060> change

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
again throttle position or we can change

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.200 
again throttle position or we can change
that<00:01:55.509> just<00:01:55.690> by<00:01:55.780> putting<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.290> gas<00:01:57.210> mass

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
that just by putting on the gas mass

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.029 
that just by putting on the gas mass
airflow<00:01:58.509> meter<00:01:59.940> for<00:02:00.940> real<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.649> that's<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.950> a

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
airflow meter for real and that's just a

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
airflow meter for real and that's just a
case<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.250> scrolling<00:02:06.910> through<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.330> pages<00:02:08.550> and
