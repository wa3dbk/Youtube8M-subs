found very little on the Nikon system I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.550 
found very little on the Nikon system I
have<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> Nikon<00:00:14.130> d3s<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.330> recently<00:00:15.509> got<00:00:15.870> a

new<00:00:17.039> audio<00:00:17.340> setup<00:00:17.640> for<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.930> wanted<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.320> do

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
new audio setup for it so wanted to do

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.720 
new audio setup for it so wanted to do
several<00:00:19.680> comparisons<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> hope<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
several comparisons in the hope that

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.700 
several comparisons in the hope that
this<00:00:21.000> might<00:00:21.240> be<00:00:21.390> helpful<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.650> people

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this might be helpful to other people

these<00:00:26.820> tests<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.570> done<00:00:27.830> about<00:00:28.830> four<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
these tests are all done about four to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.370 
these tests are all done about four to
five<00:00:29.279> feet<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> microphones<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:31.140> test

five feet from the microphones to test
what<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> would<00:00:31.920> call<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> run-and-gun<00:00:32.669> type<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
what I would call a run-and-gun type of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.990 
what I would call a run-and-gun type of
audio<00:00:33.750> capture<00:00:34.489> with<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> microphone

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
audio capture with the microphone

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060 
audio capture with the microphone
directly<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> camera<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.710> using<00:00:37.980> the

directly into the camera or using the

directly into the camera or using the
camera's<00:00:38.370> microphone<00:00:39.320> there<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.440> obviously

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
camera's microphone there are obviously

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.280 
camera's microphone there are obviously
better<00:00:40.920> ways<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.250> record<00:00:41.910> audio<00:00:42.290> but

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
better ways to record audio but

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.850 
better ways to record audio but
sometimes<00:00:43.640> they're<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:45.000> feasible

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
sometimes they're just not feasible

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.720 
sometimes they're just not feasible
sometimes<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> really<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
sometimes you really just have a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
sometimes you really just have a
microphone<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.660> top<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.469> your<00:00:49.590> camera<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.039> your

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
microphone on top of your camera in your

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.930 
microphone on top of your camera in your
camera<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.760> you're<00:00:51.449> running<00:00:51.840> an<00:00:51.930> N<00:00:52.050> gunning

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
camera and you're running an N gunning

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
camera and you're running an N gunning
maybe<00:00:53.940> later<00:00:54.180> I'll<00:00:54.390> try<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.890> with<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
maybe later I'll try this with a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
maybe later I'll try this with a
different<00:00:56.160> more<00:00:56.430> optimal<00:00:56.850> audio<00:00:57.120> setup<00:00:57.649> okay

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
different more optimal audio setup okay

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.569 
different more optimal audio setup okay
anyway<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.489> go<00:01:00.469> in<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.590> big<00:01:01.800> town<00:01:02.039> crowded

using the zoom to the d3s is better than
