and we're going to add some of our malt

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
and we're going to add some of our malt
extract<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:21.750> we're<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.170> take<00:00:22.410> our

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
make sure that it all gets blended in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.830 
make sure that it all gets blended in
now<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.460> tip<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.030> may<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.600> from<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
now a tip that you may not get from a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.160 
now a tip that you may not get from a
lot<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> other<00:00:46.260> brew<00:00:46.559> starters<00:00:47.480> is<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
lot of other brew starters is that you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.139 
lot of other brew starters is that you
don't<00:00:49.379> actually<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> add<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.969> malt

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
don't actually want to add all the malt

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.110 
don't actually want to add all the malt
extract<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.579> instead<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
extract right now instead we're going to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.170 
extract right now instead we're going to
add<00:00:54.300> roughly<00:00:54.840> half<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:56.250> two-thirds<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
add roughly half to two-thirds of the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.779 
add roughly half to two-thirds of the
extract<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.890> prevent<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.579> some

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
extract what this will prevent is some

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
extract what this will prevent is some
of<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> carnally<00:01:00.449> flavors<00:01:00.930> which<00:01:01.140> are

basically<00:01:51.299> don't<00:01:51.689> want<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> spend<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> lot<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
basically don't want to spend a lot of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.399 
basically don't want to spend a lot of
time<00:01:52.470> cleaning<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:55.140> take

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
time cleaning that up so just take

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.800 
time cleaning that up so just take
carefully<00:01:56.189> turn<00:01:56.909> down<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.119> temperature<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
carefully turn down your temperature and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.569 
carefully turn down your temperature and
watch<00:01:58.140> carefully<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> boil<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.399> not

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
watch carefully for the boil do not

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.890 
watch carefully for the boil do not
leave

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.440 

here<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.010> see<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.220> first<00:02:04.610> boil<00:02:04.970> bubbles

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
here you can see the first boil bubbles

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.450 
here you can see the first boil bubbles
pushing<00:02:05.900> through<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:07.160> want<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.400> be

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
pushing through so you really want to be

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.020 
pushing through so you really want to be
careful<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:07.880> your<00:02:08.000> temperature<00:02:08.450> now<00:02:10.030> once

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
careful with your temperature now once

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.210 
careful with your temperature now once
you<00:02:11.180> have<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.330> nice<00:02:11.540> rolling<00:02:12.170> boil<00:02:12.440> going<00:02:12.590> make

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you have a nice rolling boil going make

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.650 
you have a nice rolling boil going make
sure<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.730> doesn't<00:02:13.910> get<00:02:14.090> too<00:02:14.150> vigorous

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
sure that it doesn't get too vigorous

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.020 
sure that it doesn't get too vigorous
that<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.200> foam<00:02:15.650> doesn't<00:02:16.040> rise<00:02:16.190> too<00:02:16.490> high<00:02:16.520> and

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
that the foam doesn't rise too high and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.630 
that the foam doesn't rise too high and
start<00:02:17.240> going<00:02:17.420> out<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.600> your<00:02:17.690> pot<00:02:18.160> otherwise<00:02:19.160> if

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
start going out of your pot otherwise if

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.700 
start going out of your pot otherwise if
it<00:02:19.940> does<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.570> can<00:02:20.690> kind<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.110> spray<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.560> down

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
it does you can kind of spray it down

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.530 
it does you can kind of spray it down
with<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.070> sprayer<00:02:22.370> or<00:02:22.610> possibly<00:02:23.090> drop<00:02:23.300> ice

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
with the sprayer or possibly drop ice

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.790 
with the sprayer or possibly drop ice
cubes<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:28.250> going<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.490> foam<00:02:28.670> up<00:02:29.740> both<00:02:30.740> a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.380 
cubes in it's going to foam up both a
little<00:02:31.070> temperature<00:02:31.520> management<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.180> should

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
little temperature management you should

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.870 
little temperature management you should
be<00:02:32.540> okay
