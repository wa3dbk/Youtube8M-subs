00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
thing but I've a minute it's sticking

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.250 
thing but I've a minute it's sticking
out<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.610> too<00:03:47.790> much<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:48.989> want<00:03:49.200> to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
out of it too much so I just want to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.630 
out of it too much so I just want to
shade<00:03:49.500> over<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.920> little<00:03:50.129> bit<00:03:54.739> just<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.099> do<00:03:56.400> some

shade over a little bit just and do some

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.309 
shade over a little bit just and do some
small<00:03:57.360> lines<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:58.019> create<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.440> bumper

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.199 

and<00:04:04.830> now's<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> good<00:04:05.310> part<00:04:05.610> we're<00:04:05.760> gonna<00:04:05.879> start

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
and now's a good part we're gonna start

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.839 
and now's a good part we're gonna start
the<00:04:06.360> wheel<00:04:06.569> do<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.560> massive<00:04:08.010> wheel<00:04:08.189> latch<00:04:13.849> to

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
the wheel do the massive wheel latch to

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:23.080 
the wheel do the massive wheel latch to
do<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.150> huge<00:04:15.599> wheel

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.690 

I<00:04:23.120> think<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:23.990> this<00:04:24.110> car<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.740> want<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.520> do<00:04:25.639> the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
I think on this car I want to do the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.970 
I think on this car I want to do the
tire<00:04:26.030> quite<00:04:26.389> thick<00:04:26.750> thick<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.470> unusual

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
tire quite thick thick and unusual

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.940 
tire quite thick thick and unusual
because<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.510> again<00:04:29.990> adds<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.560> American

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
because it again adds to the American

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:45.510 
because it again adds to the American
theme<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.370> car

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.219 

though<00:04:46.520> it's<00:04:47.150> gonna<00:04:47.360> rub<00:04:47.599> out<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:47.870> line<00:04:48.080> in

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
though it's gonna rub out this line in

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.589 
though it's gonna rub out this line in
the<00:04:48.289> middle<00:04:48.439> so<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.979> can<00:04:49.129> start<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.520> design

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.399 

it's<00:04:53.599> gonna<00:04:53.780> do<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.960> small<00:04:55.810> small<00:04:56.810> room<00:04:57.139> in<00:04:57.289> the

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
it's gonna do a small small room in the

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:05.110 
it's gonna do a small small room in the
middle

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.989 

and<00:05:05.690> next<00:05:06.020> comes<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.410> hub

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:10.999 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:13.629 

now<00:05:11.569> I'm<00:05:11.659> just<00:05:11.779> going<00:05:12.019> to<00:05:12.049> do<00:05:12.259> one<00:05:12.949> strut<00:05:13.369> here

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
now I'm just going to do one strut here

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:23.740 
now I'm just going to do one strut here
and<00:05:14.419> I'll<00:05:14.509> show<00:05:14.539> you<00:05:14.749> in<00:05:14.899> the<00:05:14.989> next<00:05:15.319> video<00:05:15.589> why

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.490 

and<00:05:24.290> we'll<00:05:24.620> detail<00:05:25.040> a<00:05:25.070> bit<00:05:27.490> cool
