00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.049
 very good morning my name is daniel 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.040
 Rodriguez will be checking one 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.469
 reading of a tipi sensor is control of 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 sensual position we are working on 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.160
 a nissan pathfinder of the year 98 and what 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.500
 what I want you to see is practically the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.260
 wrong readings that you have in that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.120
 scanner 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.270
 to do it in a much more way 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.180
 simple I'm using a scanner 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.520
 strong 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.170
 a scanner that much more economical 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 for obviously for what we are 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.660
 verifying then 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.030
 practically simple to use 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.630
 and we 're going to the system 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.270
 graphs 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.790
 if we see the vehicle now 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.950
 the revolutions are practically a 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:58.640
 little high yes even though I'm not 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.640
 moving the accelerator 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.180
 if we see the graphs 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.420
 think that practically 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.799
 that guy we're seeing is not being 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.220
 accelerating and is in the wrong way 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.220
 is dialing 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.560
 approximately 1 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.329
 9 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.649
 and 8a and it's stable let's accelerate a 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.649
 small only 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.899
 notice that a little mom and climbs 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.030
 practically 90 percent today that's 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.770
 as if we were accelerating the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.729
 vehicle practically still to 13 thousand 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.729
 4,000 revolutions 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.189
 and right now he 's dialing 58 60 % yes 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.549
 it makes it look a little bit more, it returns another 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.280
 Once it arrives it's dialing 1800 right now 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.510
 revolutions 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.010
 and I went is the erratic error that is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.290
 if you let go of the accelerator, it is assumed that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.819
 automatically that type of position is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.879
 returns again wrong that is from 0 to 0.05 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:33.019
 depending on your specifications without 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:35.510
 However, he is dialing 34 and he and the engine 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.940
 is marking a revolution of 1,100 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.480
 revolutions hey and it's not accelerating 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.519
 the vehicle and it's because you miss 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.400
 are forming the computer that the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.400
 person is accelerating the vehicle 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.799
 when that is not correct therefore it 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.530
 what is this scanner telling us and 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.280
 these readings in graphic and live is 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.790
 that this guy is defective is bad 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.480
 and that's going to cause the transmission 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:11.690
 of failures or changes erratically 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.240
 so we have the check engine light 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.740
 we have the vehicle with one revolution 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.140
 high 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.130
 we have multiple giving them readings 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.230
 wrong we're going to see if he smokes 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.040
 and by giving it a small 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.260
 to carve accelerator 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.880
 so I came and I work at 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.790
 percentage of 0 or 0.5 that is assumed 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.640
 that will work so you have to make it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.290
 a cleaning that deal and you have to 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.290
 replace that warmth 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.990
 these are ways and styles of how to do 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.540
 the diagnostic procedure in form 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.950
 well there always comes an easy so 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:02.080
 boys take care good afternoon and that 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.080
 let's have a good weekend thanks
