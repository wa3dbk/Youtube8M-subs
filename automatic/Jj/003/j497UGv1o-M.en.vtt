00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
said kind of boring the AI is pretty

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.440

weird<00:03:08.860> playing<00:03:09.190> against<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.460> computer<00:03:09.520> as

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
weird playing against the computer as

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.910 
weird playing against the computer as
you<00:03:10.600> can<00:03:10.720> see<00:03:10.810> in<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.050> goal<00:03:11.260> here<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:11.740> guy's

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
you can see in this goal here this guy's

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.290 
you can see in this goal here this guy's
just<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.370> know<00:03:12.460> hung<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.090> just

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
just you know hung up and then just

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.910 
just you know hung up and then just
shoots<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.630> goal<00:03:13.780> computer<00:03:14.440> seems<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.740> be<00:03:14.890> a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
shoots the goal computer seems to be a

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.060 
shoots the goal computer seems to be a
bit<00:03:14.980> sweaty<00:03:15.460> they're<00:03:16.030> not<00:03:16.170> scalars<00:03:17.170> they

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
bit sweaty they're not scalars they

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.310 
bit sweaty they're not scalars they
don't<00:03:18.250> seem<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.459> try<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.790> as<00:03:18.940> much<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.450> think

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
don't seem to try it as much I think

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.780 
don't seem to try it as much I think
they<00:03:20.410> should<00:03:20.650> maybe<00:03:21.070> in<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.370> early<00:03:21.640> going

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
they should maybe in the early going

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.040 
they should maybe in the early going
they<00:03:22.090> don't<00:03:22.270> know<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.480> skill<00:03:22.660> moves<00:03:22.900> either

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
they don't know the skill moves either

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.620 
they don't know the skill moves either
that's<00:03:23.440> what<00:03:23.650> I'm<00:03:23.740> guessing<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:25.420> played

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
that's what I'm guessing I have played

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.300 
that's what I'm guessing I have played
other<00:03:25.750> game<00:03:25.990> modes<00:03:26.170> though<00:03:26.470> where<00:03:26.830> you<00:03:27.100> play

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
other game modes though where you play

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.160 
other game modes though where you play
hard<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.760> they<00:03:27.940> just<00:03:28.120> don't<00:03:28.330> seem<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.630> skill

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
hard and they just don't seem to skill

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.350 
hard and they just don't seem to skill
so<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.740> don't<00:03:30.640> know<00:03:30.700> maybe<00:03:30.910> we're<00:03:31.060> gonna<00:03:31.150> run

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
so I don't know maybe we're gonna run

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.780 
so I don't know maybe we're gonna run
into<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.630> online<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.200> where<00:03:32.580> people<00:03:33.580> just

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
into this online to where people just

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.160 
into this online to where people just
want<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.120> pass<00:03:34.270> around<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.690> score<00:03:34.900> look<00:03:35.050> at

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
want to pass around and score look at

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.930 
want to pass around and score look at

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
problem is just you play the AI so much

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.790 
problem is just you play the AI so much
that<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.570> just<00:03:58.750> gets<00:03:58.900> repetitive<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.620> gets

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
that it just gets repetitive and gets

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.949 
that it just gets repetitive and gets
boring<00:04:00.280> hopefully<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:01.240> not<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.540> case<00:04:01.720> in

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
boring hopefully it's not the case in

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
Daniel sores and nepenthez they've got a

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.320 
Daniel sores and nepenthez they've got a
nice<00:04:51.919> club<00:04:52.159> going<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.610> might<00:04:53.060> have<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.210> try

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
out for that because I think that could

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.490

open<00:04:55.009> up<00:04:55.189> a<00:04:55.280> homo<00:04:55.580> new<00:04:55.939> freshness<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.449> FIFA<00:04:56.840> so
