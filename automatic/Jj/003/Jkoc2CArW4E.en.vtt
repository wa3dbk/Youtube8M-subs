00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.190
 people who say i'm not starting 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.050
 business is definitely no money but just 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.050
 Apparently not think of such a reason 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.599
 if the check wants to start a business he will start 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.189
 you just need to understand him 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.189
 start off small be ready for 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.140
 where I have days when they don't have 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.610
 credit cards there are personal loans there 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.469
 if there is an idea again if you have 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.090
 experience and ability to eat can be found here 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.680
 investors actually have a bunch 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.320
 ways there are a lot of businesses that are not 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.839
 require a large capital investment itself 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.059
 beginning without fail 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.430
 money capital open a factory for 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 restaurant but something small can start 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.860
 can 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.130
 opening a restaurant open a little there 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.969
 point of sale there pies or 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.280
 baking or sandwiches and gradually 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.899
 investing profits to develop there 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.590
 absolutely not big money in any 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.509
 the bank, I think that the man salary from 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.420
 15,000 rubles can issue a credit 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.479
 card with a limit of 150 200 thousand rubles 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.100
 already with this money you can start something 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.860
 it all depends on the desire that is possible 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.189
 rent not buy auto kiosk 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.250
 can moreover come there in some kind 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.959
 there for example there is some kind of unprofitable car 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.729
 kiosk and say let me take 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.500
 rent control is admissible 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.539
 take the actual property for rent 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.869
 completely yeah well business for rent and 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.780
 make it all more efficient there 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.119
 rebuild the menu and bring to profit and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.970
 thereby actually having no investment 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.289
 there open your business why not 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 Business is not what you're there to take 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.840
 money immediately opened with them 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.770
 production by the way often 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.679
 entrepreneurs met with me 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.780
 was a friend of five people as well 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.709
 acquaintance that is again young 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.709
 entrepreneur 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 5 friends took money from their parents loan 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.520
 Again, on the cards thrown off that they 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.650
 did they wanted to sell filters for 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.410
 water purification 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.300
 professional for restaurants catering 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.460
 as they did the first thing they took off 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.120
 office in a business center 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.230
 bought a furniture and a label hanged 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.240
 there with the name they developed the brand 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.570
 here and on some words somewhere two 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.310
 months after that only they started 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.870
 to the sale of filters but ended very 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.880
 deplorable here because costs are almost 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.170
 much faster than income money 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.410
 when the days are over 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.790
 run out and mind 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.320
 tread could have been much easier then 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.130
 there is communication to rent any offices 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.530
 work at home 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.150
 simply by catalogs to engage in active 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.799
 sales and not even invest in 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.780
 in this filter it has more attachments with 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.099
 filter don't buy filters though they could 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.450
 just come to the restaurant 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.110
 use fantastic desire 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.819
 sell they we sold this filter after 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.370
 That they would receive an advance payment of the father 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.170
 restaurants have ordered this filter 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.049
 brought and installed 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.970
 and actually would get the first capital 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.489
 absolutely no contribution can be inserted only 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.989
 your wild desire to grow 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.640
 companies generally should always 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.799
 evolve from my point of view in such 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.500
 extreme conditions if there will always be 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:51.389
 grab money but companies are just having 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.250
 fat, she kind of relaxes not 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.900
 It seeks to maximize the effectiveness and 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.480
 when the company is in extreme conditions 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.480
 and not enough money then she just 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.930
 trying to survive all the resources and therefore 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.970
 Let us even when we have enough money, I 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.739
 maybe even artificially beating from 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.139
 quality chocolate you give them to the poor no but 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:17.470
 contribution to development or that is again 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:19.570
 companies should value money as soon as 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.370
 in the company so much money that before she 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.420
 ceases to appreciate and count them all 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:30.010
 begins immediately weakening and she 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.420
 losing his pelvis working conditions and life 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.570
 should be a comfortable person should 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.290
 getting pleasure from her but this one 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.660
 there is a cure there is, let's say 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.210
 quality furniture and comfortable office is 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.610
 necessary thing and it should be but let's say 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.710
 some kind of mega pathetic chair there in 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.590
 director's office and oak visa table with 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.520
 my point of view is overkill 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.520
 again to each his own 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.060
 business is probably in the company it's like 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.780
 we are extrapolated for worldview 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.170
 owner 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.150
 that is, someone wants does not want 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.370
 invest in development build some 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.280
 big projects and he is enough for him 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.220
 wants to earn money to live 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.320
 nice and good here it is again 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.790
 transferred there to the company someone wants 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.240
 it is interesting to develop 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.040
 create something and he gets from it 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.599
 pleasure but it is absolutely not 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.429
 means that there 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:31.279
 personally we are preached by our company 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:32.959
 some rigid asceticism that's that 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:37.309
 be sure to say the ceiling 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:38.389
 absolutely no we just moved here 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:41.239
 in fact we will do very 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.639
 comfortable space as we are but 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:45.139
 A lot of work is needed so that 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.509
 the text had to feel here 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:51.339
 cozy and nice so here in a couple 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.339
 months will be very cool
