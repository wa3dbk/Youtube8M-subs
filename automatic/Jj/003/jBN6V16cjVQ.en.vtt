00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.120
 a new sequence of speech and answer 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 the show where we ask your questions 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.809
 answer and we would say directly 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.849
 going first of the accounts ask first 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
 ask come from Christoph and asks 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.780
 Hello you, I have sandra from what 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.670
 on ebay sd-cards of the class 10 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 my canon powershot and my gopro 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
 two then filmed with the gopro filmed 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.400
 and then purely in the know and then 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.779
 again nico pro and after four times has 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 the cat gave up her mind 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 why is that so he can do that for you 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.439
 tend to give several reasons 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.180
 problem that happens again and again that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.590
 It does not matter which manufacturer that is 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.969
 simply broken that can stop his 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.649
 Memory cards are an absolute 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.870
 mass products become millions of dollars 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.309
 They are also becoming basic 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.629
 Checked as you see here they come 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.160
 actually already functional 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.050
 but there is always a very complete one 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 very small percent of the part has 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 it really seems defective here it seems 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.510
 really more likely to come there 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 a possibility is and a problem with 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.820
 the camera that means that the mechanics 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.070
 and a lot of effect that the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.270
 memory cards keeps coming up 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.129
 if you like it there and what not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.199
 works but I think so 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.969
 the real mistake is in the first one 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.210
 set directly in it and that on ebay 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.890
 I always bought the question why 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.689
 Hell merchant memory cards actually 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 The world at all, you look at Amazon 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.799
 because you get really good brands 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.450
 memory cards 16 gb for 12 13 euro more 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.610
 is not it really effective? 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 and you have to see amazon the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 buy memory cards hundreds of thousands 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.119
 million scale in part a year 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.460
 that means if someone volume discounts 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.860
 then there are dealers like Amazon 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.259
 they just have to spend a lot of money 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.909
 and if now on ebay veto has that 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.500
 someone else 30 percent cheaper that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.720
 all then you should be around you 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.860
 can that be any question at all and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.570
 straight sender is for example one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.549
 brand with extremely many cases 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.619
 but also have lex over and co 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.490
 the same problem then of course the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.320
 expensive models 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.299
 that is, from me the tip slightly 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 Memory cards bought pictures that are 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.439
 important people with that she bought 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.229
 Amazon buys them at Saturn Media Markt 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.670
 completely irrelevant bought invite the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.040
 Entertainment is renowned and not 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.570
 at the next occupy 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.890
 china ebay brother who somehow found 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.720
 just because I have again for euro 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.810
 cheaper is the whole it is the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.010
 Stress in the end not worth it if you are here 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.780
 is the second question he asked 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.000
 was where we actually get 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.860
 our whole test he must buy like 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.260
 we'll get the presents that 's the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.900
 people again yes the question can 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.980
 really quite often and you 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.170
 must say many of you yes 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.420
 to think somehow yes farmer human being me 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.740
 have some problem now 170 d said 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.080
 times as to the now so and so and 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.370
 we just can not do that 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.200
 because we usually have the cameras 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.880
 something and for two to four weeks 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 to test headsets or something at once 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.120
 wait three times six times 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.709
 we get ourselves completely and how ever eight 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.040
 weeks but that usually waits too 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.900
 beautiful 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.100
 it gives it completely quite completely 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.330
 rare case that really times 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.530
 he must be able to retain 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.850
 that for example with memory cards 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.320
 with me the case because I have the and how 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.030
 60 memory cards or something here 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.470
 but are also only for the reason 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.850
 because I say okay it always comes 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.080
 we want to source new camera again 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.030
 the memory cards repeatedly with the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.800
 test latest cameras and at the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.209
 I say prices at the 20 30 euro 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.910
 memory card you can just do that 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.590
 Do it with the manufacturer and say that 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.630
 shipping costs are indeed at the end almost like that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.709
 high as the memory card itself can 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.030
 we do not keep it then that goes in 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.920
 usually have already clear and finally 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.150
 We settled it like that only if we did 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.500
 The things also can keep test 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.790
 Anyone who else makes it easy 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.470
 effectively no sense for us because 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.060
 would after three four months 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.260
 longer out of the overall standings 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.239
 because time is no longer the values ​​of nine 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.160
 There are cameras on the other side 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.350
 but 2000 euro mirror reflex or 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.180
 3000 euro objective dumbest case 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.370
 that should be obvious to everyone 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.080
 that there with canon nikon and co stand there 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.549
 and say yes takes people takes takes 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.799
 we take too much of it anyway 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.989
 and somehow one million euros a year 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.760
 no problem, it just does not exist 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.110
 a lot and you have to say so now 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.000
 for example, when launching the new canon 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.320
 their 70's or something like that there was 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.269
 really not for all germany anymore 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.650
 so maybe two digit lots 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.870
 something between five and seven 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.010
 Models for completely Germany and 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.690
 mostly with germany then too 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.850
 still the whole german language 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.350
 Austria and Switzerland meant and 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.880
 that's really going to be all editorial 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.930
 operated and accordingly it works 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.489
 just do not stop that one 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.680
 Give the camera to five people 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.970
 so to make it short we get 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.100
 the cameras actually usually 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.989
 directly from the manufacturer to measure 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.760
 normal way or line else maybe 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.380
 at some other time out but then 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.700
 really only for two to six 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.510
 weeks in the cut thus already with the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.409
 unfortunately the longest there is 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.180
 that's it, yes, he's ours 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.489
 last question today comes from björn 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.560
 and he writes hello I could have 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.600
 a question regarding ipad as a monitor 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.610
 there is a possibility an ipad 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.760
 as a monitor to use although the camera 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.440
 no wlan does i have a 650 de and 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.500
 have not found a way out yet 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.560
 He continues to make great videos if you like 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.789
 just fine, yes, even at rapid 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.560
 you can just seriously seriously 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.229
 ask what you can do by if 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.729
 Unfortunately, the answer is nothing there 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.080
 At least, to my knowledge, there is now 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.430
 not the possibility first like cameras 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.620
 for example he 70 ie one 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.970
 integrated wlan with in and out could 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.500
 then again the app also for 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.150
 ios and android is available then 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.130
 just as a live image is transmitted 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.690
 delayed but it works as 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.370
 small beside example still from nikon there 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.220
 is there a pluggable wlan adapter 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.539
 that could be the whole thing with us 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.100
 yes yes but the functions also 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.570
 not with any camera that it only too 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.370
 from some versions available 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.590
 but could be relatively late that the 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.510
 d5100 wlan in it does not matter 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.729
 So as I said at 650 de there are 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.350
 currently not the possibility but what 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.199
 just that would be possible that and 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.539
 Solutions like touch surface first responders 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.740
 cards so wlan memory cards there can 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.150
 at least the pictures taken 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.830
 ever transferred to the tablet or 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.030
 smartphone since there are also apps for 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.970
 you can sometimes is simply a 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.080
 web browser do that now would be a 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.639
 half off the one he might go 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.500
 Could to solve the problem somehow 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.599
 fix for you relatively short broadcast 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.740
 The whole thing was 3 45 today 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.910
 No idea in every case 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.970
 shorter than last time topic 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.919
 data security, however, and 10 12 13 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.539
 minutes so we are rather short 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.729
 but unfortunately it was not 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.750
 so many of you are wondering while I'm 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.160
 a bit sad I hope that changes 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.580
 At this time still yours 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.289
 always ask at question round weg.de 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.870
 and the markets we answer too 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.280
 they are not asking that much now 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.690
 have to do with the topic of technology 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.470
 example as we go in testcenters 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.510
 come or something 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.039
 So there again always like to ask 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.840
 everything and what we do 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.360
 want to answer the answer in 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.440
 the rule somehow thank you 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.000
 for watching places are and the 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.889
 you'll find links here below 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.330
 more interesting speech and answer 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.420
 no also tutorial videos you can still 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.640
 always 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.870
 Somewhere over there we'll meet again 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.300
 sunday is possible and until then
