 approximately for the two devices sng 600 sng 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 330 we are currently in the shutdown 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.649
 with the headquarter cologne grains in short 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.689
 bootloader shared with these devices 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.460
 if the updates are not like 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.860
 We should have planned to come 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.750
 understood that we are closer to the crisis 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.689
 have to work together 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.420
 we therefore want to be in 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.060
 future sooner than in the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.979
 past the ex-coach bootloader 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.460
 as well as the cologne available 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.960
 put 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.640
 we are here in the vote 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.990
 with our headquarter as we at the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.060
 can do best on the platform 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.520
 ilias can do but we have here 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 is definitely a target law that we 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.250
 in the first half of this year 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.869
 for those in live devices the whole 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.640
 provide information 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.020
 become 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.820
 become the kernel codes and bootloader 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.920
 for the food guy i lon and eat the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.619
 Series released at open source 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.850
 solutions 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.180
 Of course it is very important that we 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.209
 here the right tools for the developers 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.970
 give it to hand to just as well with 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.590
 the equipment of the snb is and it to the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.120
 to deal with 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.400
 We will also do this accordingly 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.640
 into the platform where we have the existence 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.260
 and the cologne left with integrate 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.569
 the huawei smartphones always bribe 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.280
 again by very good sar values 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.430
 Why are not they reinforced? 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.170
 Public communicates so the good 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.989
 sar values â€‹â€‹we use on our phones 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.480
 who are of course the fact that we 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.010
 not just phones in and out understand 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.239
 but also the network and the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.190
 interaction between phone and 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.660
 What not only in the network 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.430
 press battery performance should be just 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.380
 also in the asservaten finds again for 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.329
 but we are still the sar general 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.829
 an important topic and we try 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.829
 Of course, to optimize in general 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 but that is no marketing for us 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.660
 Huawei's focus since 2012 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.910
 the world's number 3 smartphone 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.709
 But that's how we are here 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.950
 the cebit is not the only one 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.519
 area you can ours short the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.829

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.420
 describe there are special features the 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.579
 especially for the german market too 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.930
 note 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.389

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.690

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.190

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.480
 product ranges of 100 so 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.990
 carrier networks enterprise and over 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.640
