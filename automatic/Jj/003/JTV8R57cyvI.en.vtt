00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.070
 hi to all and must today be 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.720
 find for a new video 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.850
 so today I offer you a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 gameplay in eliminations confirmed on 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.519
 stand off then already a very good 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.710
 combination because immigration 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.150
 confirm it goes up really fast 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.260
 your rip scores what it's fifty 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.539
 points when you kill someone there 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.189
 feel the point when you pick up a 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.530
 plate so there nothing extraordinary 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.110
 but stand off locates maps you tell me 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.969
 banal on call of duty 3 axes normal 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 but only I like it because there 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.809
 sets and relief that I appreciate 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.579
 especially and that allows me to 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.070
 sneaking have little everywhere to protect me 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 put me bleach aids and make 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 kills more easily nothing but the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.879
 putting behind can that makes it easier for me 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.949
 task 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.510
 in a country exposed because it is enough 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.309
 a sniper ball that makes me angry 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.010
 of that and I'm not the only one I think 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.020
 but often slip it can you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.489
 to do a lot of that account 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.989
 people who do not necessarily have 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 a lot of shoots or count of people 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.229
 which you machine gun assault rifle 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.240
 while if it's against a sniper 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.799
 inevitably it's a fatal blow I want 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.420
 to tell you 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.650
 so I'll tell you a little bit of everything 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960
 that I used in this gameplay for 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.740
 not confusing 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.900
 I used to win with 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.049
 phantom determination robustness 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.830
 paralyzing dexterity and centex then 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.420
 ghost determination to be so 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.939
 undetectable but at the same time to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.479
 unlock mestric easily and in addition 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.979
 from that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.689
 I was in and so it's inevitably 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.720
 unblocks very very very fast you go 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.850
 see after robustness dexterity another 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 duo another combination that is very 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 very important to me I have a lot of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.520
 bad to play without and this combination 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.860
 for me is the best because she 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.060
 allows you dynamics and hears from 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.040
 win most of your duels 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.659
 because in fact dexterity savors me 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.610
 savor adds a little punch you are 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.229
 much faster in front of your 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.969
 opponents and more robust is that it 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.799
 you flinch - you do not flinch 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.710
 at all I know more with that corresponds 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.360
 concentrating on 1 2 and 3 no lo 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.920
 I have a little finished but you speak a little 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.979
 strict scores because it's going to do 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.239
 not bad of the taf 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.920
 today in its gameplay you go 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.599
 see it's very very important and also 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.200
 I wanted to clarify something that this 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.180
 gameplay 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.310
 and I realized quite a while ago 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.069
 and most importantly the most important thing 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.750
 is that I realized before the patch in 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.000
 made ready patch because with the patch 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.489
 the victory is it more powerful so 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.290
 the go - and that was when the ms 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.640
 mmc dominated everybody finally we're not going 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.790
 debate but it still dominates 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.349
 so at the source level and the star and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.340
 rooney lightning scores it's 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.709
 that they grow very quickly 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.630
 who are low I made a choice that's 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.549
 maybe harder but I'm going 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.799
 unlock more often and I want to do 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.080
 a choice in not hot we do not 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.420
 so not choosing the VSAT and 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.819
 so that's it now I've spent 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.810
 a small subject that according - will you do 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.819
 interact hic 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.620
 I hope you like it 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.819
 the trigger for a purchase at 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.760
 video game level 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.130
 so it's true that today we are 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.340
 many surrounded by the media by your 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.040
 friends by the internet by by all 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.069
 means of communication and we liked it 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.069
 daily so on our life is 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.870
 as safe on our purchases since nothing 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.639
 that you see a commercial on TV 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.739
 does that give you more or less a 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.440
 positive or negative opinion that leaves you 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.480
 never without voice in form and today 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.900
 I wanted to talk about that because that's it 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.030
 there was the release of there was the teaser 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.310
 do not trailer the teaser of call of 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.930
 dutyy kid who says we 're going out 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.720
 new housing cases if it's going to be 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.329
 different here are my stockings a lot of people 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.889
 are waiting for it and many people will have 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.870
 surely buy it but I wanted you 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.829
 ask what triggers 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.319
 your purchase what will you do 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.269
 buy this game is it going to be I 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.050
 do not know tests is that it's 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.070
 because 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.590
 is it because you are 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.090
 fans of the saga is what it is because 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.310
 that new content and new features 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.920
 attracts you is what it is because 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.440
 you love the multi of this game where full 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.900
 things like that especially the trailer and 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.390
 media means for example especially 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.370
 the tv the web that can make you 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.560
 change your mind also by videos 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.230
 youtube by big youtuber that you 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.300
 change your mind so most of the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.310
 time what makes you buy in 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.890
 this is what interests me because 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.780
 today with this marketing that has us 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.550
 invaded that is omnipresent I wanted 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.930
 know what made you buy if 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.650
 it was really effective 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.140
 all these means of communication and 2 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.830
 how to say persuasion at the level of 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.890
 consumer 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.290
 I wanted because I also wanted to talk 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.000
 of one thing it is more than +100 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.550
 that he so today I hear time 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.590
 but it's true that on youtube 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.330
 now if we realize more in if we 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.370
 not realize in addition you feel that it limits 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.010
 that normal limit we look at you from the fact 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.360
 but it's not a gameplay 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.630
 now it is true that there is more 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.830
 in addition to which we will say of criteria for 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.210
 community channels besides I 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.710
 offers this video has only two topics 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.330
 who are really handsome tough but 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.980
 today it's more and more 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.270
 difficult to achieve good gameplay 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.190
 because already the community she is 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.800
 more or less rotten already on the game and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.750
 then to dd equipment that goes that 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.400
 I'm enraged so it's 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.290
 complicated but now on youtube 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.850
 for me it is an essential limit of 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.200
 to do +100 kg and so I'm going to 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.540
 give some tips for doing 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.500
 so the first advice is to choose 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.690
 a good fashion 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.120
 a mode that will earn you 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.010
 points very quickly so the points 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.390
 per minute 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.580
 for me the best is the war of 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.740
 territory with as combination 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.090
 often the nations confirm that this is 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.740
 a really fatal combination to 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.440
 score level at points level 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.120
 another thing is to choose as well 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.320
 his weapon according to the mas because 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.980
 if you have a very open brand 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.330
 as turbines 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.610
 it will be very complicated for days 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.930
 pumps we'll say that unless you 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.980
 have very very good trips 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.400
 also displacements it counts 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.810
 a lot 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.130
 but here I am wondering for you 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.970
 what is the best way to 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.680
 make a gameplay 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.840
 I personally give you 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.610
 some tricks of the game mode 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.650
 because of the behavior adopted at 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.430
 displacements 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.320
 here for me 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.330
 I wanted to ask you also what is 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.140
 which according to you allows you to achieve 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.820
 good gameplay 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.560
 so I know that there is a lot also the 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.570
 chance that comes into it all 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.460
 do not lie to yourself if you do not have 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.590
 luck in general does not make you big 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.060
 thing finally here we come soon to 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.010
 video term but I wanted you 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.750
 present two three tricks on my channel 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.300
 since I propose this video qgc them 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.610
 ways to expand my audience a bit and 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.140
 propose my content a maximum of 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.180
 people and satisfy a maximum of 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.590
 people and entertain you our anxieties 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.970
 at a ride for the win I realize 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.060
 videos on call of duty 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.740
 so there nothing and nothing but I play 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.620
 how to say I focus a little on 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.940
 the tutorials the tips the guides that this 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.860
 in decerto in class and I 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.950
 proposed big big scores of 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.870
 debates of things like that need to know 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.220
 that also I am not badly available 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.160
 I try to interact with my community 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.420
 I do not answer most of the time 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.470
 comment is also I take it into account 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.660
 for more or less choose the types 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.940
 different videos of the currencies and the 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.430
