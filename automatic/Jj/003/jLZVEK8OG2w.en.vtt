 that you have two 'breaks' in the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.479
 test number two because one is not going to 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.200

 then if everything is going to consist of centex and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.490
 the tactic 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.659
 it will not consist of tactics in being sing 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:34.380
 and then it's course tics are going to be 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.380
 guardian is going to be coming and telling you 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.020

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.100
 final in the dogs and he will be of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.159
 Sudan then do not forget here to put 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.409
 game recording one because by the simple 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.970
 fact that if you do not have like 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.130
 record then you can 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.000
 ask an enemy to an enemy 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.009
 friend that is only serious and so you what 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.140
 can upload to your channel today is what can 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.970
 upload to your online channel gamer tac 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.300
 you too 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.110
 and what else if you do not have how 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.300
 record then they can do can 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.150
 make two videos one with 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.450
 with the phone or if possible but I 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.910
 I want to see them I want to see them win 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.950
 I want to see them win and I want them 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.590
 see that they have everything that I have given them 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.180
 asked now what this will consist of 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.220
 well what will it consist is going to be 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 similar to last week's you 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.410
 they are going to play the goal they have to win 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.250
 and this time I 'm not going to put a limit of 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.920
 low because this challenge if it is difficult and 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.830
 to tell them that I had it last night 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.250
 once nothing else I'm doing this 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.620
 live I do not know if I'm going to pass it I doubt it 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 because try without lying maybe 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.550
 20 times and of the 20 times only one 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.020
 Once you can win, it's very good. 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.210
 that's why I'm not going to put a limit 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.800
 of deaths or a limit I forgive a limit 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:19.910
 of casualties so the person who wins the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.340
 starting and the one with the most 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.340
 of casualties is the person who will win the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.560
 challenge what is going to be good what 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.800
 I can give you the challenge this is going to be 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.800
 well 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.000
 it is difficult to hit them 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.129
 I knew I had known and I already knew 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.129
 good you have to defend 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.290
 but well as I repeat this is a bit 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.350
 difficult but what I want to see is that 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.220
 you win or win and the person who 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.370
 I win 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.780
 the largest number 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.000
 greater number of casualties 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.389
 towards the person who wins then that 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.269
 I'm going to give you I'm going to give it away again 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.970
 1600 points for microsoft or what 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.400
 equivalent that is for playstation 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.190
 the only thing I need you to do 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.320
 It is also that they let me know 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.680
 know if you are playing 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.230
 playstation or are playing xbox occupy 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.410
 xbox for the reason that I do not 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.460
 I want to pass the same as me go 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.590
 say after I'm I'm offering 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.270
 microsoft points and then tell me are the 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.440
 I sent and then tell me it's not for 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.970
 playstation then 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.370
 it is better to avoid confusion and do 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.600
 that but well you already know the rest 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.170
 they already have an idea of what is going to 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.880
 consist so the points are 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.890
 available to for those who can 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.030
 those who have the ability to 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.700
 win so at least try not 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.270
 I'm putting a limit on a limit of 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.540
 deaths or casualties but if I'm 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.390
 demanding that it be earned and that they remain in and 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.780
 have a good number of casualties is 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.550
 everything I need if you like 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.940
 it's called you do that then 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.940
 obviously 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.840
 I 'm going to give you the points so that 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.970
 you can buy it what you 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.970
 give you the gift you want with 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:50.060
 with the points I gave him so 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:53.879
 good is everything take care and I hope so 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.280
 participate, you know yes, if you like it 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.470
 Well, ideas like challenges 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.129
 then that's all they have to 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.930
 do 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.669
 leave me a comment a like a dislike 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.349
 what you want to know that 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.879
 they think the challenges take care of themselves and 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.879
 it's all take care of yourself and see you later
