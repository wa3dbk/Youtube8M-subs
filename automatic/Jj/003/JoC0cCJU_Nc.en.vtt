00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.860 
is any XL plans for the two vs I mean we
barely<00:03:57.220> just<00:03:57.490> announced<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.240> Nintendo<00:03:58.660> 2ds

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
barely just announced the Nintendo 2ds

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.690 
barely just announced the Nintendo 2ds
so<00:03:59.350> we<00:03:59.440> don't<00:03:59.620> have<00:03:59.710> anything<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.190> announce<00:04:00.340> at

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
so we don't have anything to announce at

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.030 
so we don't have anything to announce at
this<00:04:00.760> time<00:04:01.090> really<00:04:01.450> our<00:04:02.020> focus<00:04:02.230> is<00:04:02.620> definitely

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
this time really our focus is definitely

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.400 
this time really our focus is definitely
getting<00:04:03.190> Nintendo<00:04:03.730> 2ds<00:04:03.940> out<00:04:04.450> there<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:11.290> sure

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
getting Nintendo 2ds out there for sure

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.340 
getting Nintendo 2ds out there for sure
so<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.890> few<00:04:12.640> folks<00:04:12.880> have<00:04:13.060> asked<00:04:13.360> how<00:04:13.600> do<00:04:13.660> I<00:04:13.900> put

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
so a few folks have asked how do I put

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.020 
so a few folks have asked how do I put
the<00:04:14.560> system<00:04:14.740> into<00:04:15.010> sleep<00:04:15.220> mode<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.670> can<00:04:15.910> get

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
the system into sleep mode so I can get

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.729 
the system into sleep mode so I can get
my<00:04:16.090> street<00:04:16.420> past<00:04:16.600> data<00:04:16.840> especially<00:04:17.140> here<00:04:17.650> it

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
my street past data especially here it

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.710 
my street past data especially here it
shows<00:04:17.920> like<00:04:18.130> pax<00:04:18.400> where<00:04:18.730> you<00:04:19.209> know<00:04:19.360> we've<00:04:19.570> got

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
shows like pax where you know we've got

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.990 
shows like pax where you know we've got
streetpass<00:04:20.290> opportunities<00:04:21.070> around<00:04:21.640> every

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
streetpass opportunities around every

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.180 
streetpass opportunities around every
corner<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:22.870> in<00:04:23.020> order<00:04:23.140> to<00:04:23.260> put<00:04:23.590> Nintendo<00:04:23.980> 2ds

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
get it out of sleep mode you actually

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.840 
get it out of sleep mode you actually
have<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.410> switch<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.770> back<00:04:35.890> so<00:04:36.280> I'm<00:04:36.700> not

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
have to switch it back so I'm not

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.460 
have to switch it back so I'm not
already<00:04:37.180> pretty<00:04:37.720> instantaneous<00:04:38.290> mm-hmm

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.410 

the<00:04:41.650> home<00:04:41.860> button

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.120 

but<00:04:45.420> again<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.410> big<00:04:46.560> focus<00:04:46.980> is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
but again the the big focus is

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.610 
but again the the big focus is
definitely<00:04:47.639> again<00:04:48.420> as<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:48.840> entry<00:04:49.260> level

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
definitely again as that entry level

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.950 
definitely again as that entry level
maybe<00:04:49.980> that<00:04:50.190> first<00:04:50.490> first-time<00:04:51.120> player<00:04:51.480> into

and there's two things that stood out

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.190 
and there's two things that stood out
for<00:05:20.400> me<00:05:20.460> right<00:05:20.760> away<00:05:20.850> I've<00:05:21.150> never<00:05:21.390> owned<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.810> 3ds

for me right away I've never owned a 3ds

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.820 
for me right away I've never owned a 3ds
and<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:24.510> first<00:05:24.930> big<00:05:25.170> positive<00:05:25.620> was<00:05:25.740> I

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
and the first big positive was I

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.410 
and the first big positive was I
actually<00:05:25.950> like<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.520> fact<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:27.030> doesn't

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
actually like the fact that it doesn't

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.960 
actually like the fact that it doesn't
flip<00:05:27.660> closed<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.320> feels<00:05:28.890> like<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.070> very<00:05:29.400> solid

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
flip closed it feels like a very solid

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.030 
flip closed it feels like a very solid
singular<00:05:30.450> device<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:31.440> know<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:31.560> owned<00:05:31.890> a

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
singular device you know I owned a

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.100 
singular device you know I owned a
regular<00:05:32.430> DS<00:05:32.640> sometimes<00:05:33.240> those<00:05:33.420> hinges<00:05:33.690> get<00:05:34.080> a

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
regular DS sometimes those hinges get a

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.630 
regular DS sometimes those hinges get a
little<00:05:34.380> loose<00:05:34.530> it's<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.890> little<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.610> know

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
little loose it's a little you know

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.910 
little loose it's a little you know
squeakier<00:05:36.180> what<00:05:36.390> not<00:05:36.570> not<00:05:37.170> not<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.470> problem

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
squeakier what not not not a problem

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.160 
squeakier what not not not a problem
with<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.130> two<00:05:38.280> DS<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:39.690> wedge<00:05:39.960> design

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
with the two DS and the wedge design

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.200 
with the two DS and the wedge design
actually<00:05:40.560> feels<00:05:40.890> really<00:05:40.980> comfortable

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
actually feels really comfortable

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.150 
actually feels really comfortable
the<00:05:43.780> thing<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:44.020> didn't<00:05:44.319> like<00:05:44.350> was<00:05:44.800> right<00:05:45.009> now

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
the thing I didn't like was right now

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.100 
the thing I didn't like was right now
I'm<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.370> big<00:05:45.610> fan<00:05:45.789> of<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:46.030> XL<00:05:46.360> size<00:05:46.600> i<00:05:46.900> think

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
I'm a big fan of the XL size i think

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.710 
I'm a big fan of the XL size i think
that<00:05:47.229> the<00:05:47.350> screens<00:05:47.680> on<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.370> regular<00:05:48.729> 3ds<00:05:49.180> a

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
that the screens on the regular 3ds a

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.930 
that the screens on the regular 3ds a
little<00:05:50.259> small<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.919> 2d<00:05:51.160> s<00:05:51.280> has<00:05:51.490> that<00:05:51.699> same

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
little small and the 2d s has that same

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.969 
little small and the 2d s has that same
screen<00:05:52.180> size<00:05:52.240> so<00:05:52.960> hopefully<00:05:53.650> that<00:05:53.830> they're

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
screen size so hopefully that they're

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.260 
screen size so hopefully that they're
