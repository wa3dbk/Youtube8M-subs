00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730
 this is a day of rest 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.039
 what's in it all 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.470
 year 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.720
 plus that's just everything has maintained nothing 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.230
 try the preventive back and forth to know everything better where the car and 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.050
 to clean and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 also a little official playing time 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.420
 the incident on half how was the first half real madrid 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.890
 Yes 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.990
 the first half I have to say the nice got through 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.040
 why the test session will last long 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.790
 now we have better but for a bit in line for it lost 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.880
 stand 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.930
 but of course expect 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 but we still have a week to be taken 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.250
 everything goes according to plan 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 I hope that is not included 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.850
 halfway through the scheme but not seeing it annually without shame 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.420
 well that's from 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.160
 first day everything is one 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.010
 that is meanwhile already fitter and to manage there was a steering error 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.290
 at three kilometers from the end, fifteen meters have the deep in the garden 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.930
 went over four times 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.040
 as with miracle 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.600
 if the engine was off then we are on our four wheels north holland and mine 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.650
 jan since then it all runs quite a lot of pollen 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.940
 Electronics problems is a fixed wares tonight around one o'clock 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.509
 three 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.469
 but in that branch 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.700
 the sporting ambitions have been given a place 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.700
 but then I will have to wait an I had secretly hoped for 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.510
 I want to finish a brought to start but then in the course of the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.139
 First days I was a bit like an album that is still four years earlier 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.339
 to see how is the relationship with the other participants and I had hoped for 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.549
 into a stage that was always fed up with it 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.349
 after it will have to be pirates 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.999
 to ask for money there 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.949
 of course you already have Heerenveen fifty years ago 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:46.089
 Heerenveen still has its own collective labor agreement falls in South America kz american press 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.579
 that the argentines are crazy 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.549
 angels reilly watching autotrack race crazy 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.839
 it is fantastic that we are very welcome 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.769
 I am much less reluctant to enjoy 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.570
 in addition, that is possible in africa 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.209
 yes then you know you have the entire globe 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.219
 the places they end up later is beautiful 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.000
 The Clubleiding real estate agent in Chili Chili is also very nicely stated otherwise 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:09.699
 magnificent 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.699
 no one was injured therefore the traffic jam will be completed in 2011 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.679
 after so very big difference 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.679
 also not in terms of course 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.940
 sounds when 73 is started 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.569
 we sat 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.149
 After, unfortunately, we have to say that we are only left with the three buyse 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.049
 strange man 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.589
 not because we are the buddy who come 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.499
 the like olijke 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.899
 so that means that it was physically quite their battle 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.239
 Albert dropped out at the belleman who 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.510
 the ever-flaring child the marathons of the twenty days are running a lawsuit 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.769
 sometimes very difficult 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.009
 don't compete 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.479
 and third is a big one 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.489
 unfortunately for the problems 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.839
 in this die 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:09.619
 too little sleep 38 did not sit yes but it became yes that was day two that I 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.019
 in flashbacks year that soft police do not sit 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.340
 he says i want to sit and the baker should be then i quit after it was 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.109

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.349
 yes that shows that 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.429
 that it is a very fierce battle
