00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 good short-staffed the event had 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.820
 girl who is the channel's first video 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.980
 of minecraft because it is not the first 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.190
 Video ronaldo score but not 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 he won of all things here goes 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.840
 be very cool from the point where in each 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.420
 machine security system in 2010 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.210
 coming to play with you but I 'm 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.510
 bad was because the company's request 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:37.460
 the first thing is cheaper than 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:41.160
 market more here 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 In case you are going to go 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:01:00.930
 meet the queen on top with that is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:20.790
 facilitate instruction 60 but with certainty 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:23.060
 nor if you want to do what you can 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060
 do 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:53.159
 but then I think it's capable of financing 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:02:03.000
 a card with this is that not return 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:09.110
 better when it comes to things 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.110
 and this 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 I 'm so full tomorrow at 9am with a 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:26.139
 touch and now you 're home 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.139
 It's normal for the new caption 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:37.340
 I liked it there was the smallest 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:48.109
 I like his side soon he'll be there. 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:58.510
 never the only line of material and in the 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:03:43.310
 May first video out there 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:48.129
 I'm going to go home yesterday so I can 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.669
 they can not get close to having 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.590
 the choice of wood or iron 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:04:11.449
 Ok, so for me, the subject from the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:14.810
 Mexico's law and tourism has failed and is 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:17.750
 That's why I got here. 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.049
 we were loose and I thought how 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.049
 did it 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:38.199
 what he called the campaign in 1991, I 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.199
 also the experience of heavy tomorrow 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:40.550
 Wait, I like it so there's no more like 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:42.610
 you eat example does not cause more 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:57.080
 strict 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:06:03.130
 some girls I do is at this time 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.130
 What do you have to think about him? 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:16.599
 imagine the transmilenium sarney more 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:23.199
 other drugs give you a harmony is easy 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:27.310
 When you change the item, you just arrived. 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:30.789
 do here a system set around the 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:51.129
 things run round 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:57.580
 the supply in a single political destination to be 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:07:00.360
 quite disputed between 11 and so 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.360
 Hi
