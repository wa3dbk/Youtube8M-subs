00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
tutorial but here we have Firefox and we

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
tutorial but here we have Firefox and we
have<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.970> URL<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> username

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
have the URL and we have the username

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and password right here I'm not going to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
and password right here I'm not going to
extend<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.080> don't<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
extend it because I don't really want to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
extend it because I don't really want to
show<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.920> username<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.310> password<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
show you my username and password but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.640 
show you my username and password but
basically<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> works<00:01:16.439> it's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
basically that's how it works it's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.230 
basically that's how it works it's
really<00:01:16.950> easy<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.460> doesn't<00:01:17.700> work<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
really easy if this doesn't work for you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.270 
really easy if this doesn't work for you

also very easy on the Mac first off we
have<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> applications<00:01:31.920> scroll<00:01:32.640> down

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
have to go to applications scroll down

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.210 
have to go to applications scroll down
and<00:01:33.150> find<00:01:33.180> utilities<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.950> we're<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and find utilities then we're going to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
and find utilities then we're going to
look<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> keychain<00:01:36.030> access<00:01:36.270> app<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.380> will

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
look for a keychain access app this will

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.929 
look for a keychain access app this will
show<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> passwords<00:01:38.220> saved<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.820> your
