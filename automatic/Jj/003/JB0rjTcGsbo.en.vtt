to say okay okay and then we're gonna

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.160 
to say okay okay and then we're gonna
flash<00:00:50.010> clock<00:00:50.520> wat<00:00:51.140> clockworkmod<00:00:52.140> recovery

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
flash clock wat clockworkmod recovery

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.330 
flash clock wat clockworkmod recovery
and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:52.920> choose<00:00:53.300> HTC<00:00:54.300> g2<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.129> this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this makes everything easier before you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960

have<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> whole<00:01:11.310> bunch<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> other<00:01:11.670> stuff

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
have to do a whole bunch of other stuff

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.130 
have to do a whole bunch of other stuff
but<00:01:12.240> clock<00:01:12.990> mod<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.560> definitely<00:01:14.840> makes<00:01:15.840> things

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
but clock mod is definitely makes things

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.670 
but clock mod is definitely makes things
easier

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680
