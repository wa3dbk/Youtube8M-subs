00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
a normal jump so again jump away does

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.050 
a normal jump so again jump away does
not<00:03:47.290> be<00:03:47.440> forty<00:03:47.859> i<00:03:47.889> should<00:03:48.010> go<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> fireball<00:03:48.880> now

as you saw in the lab right i have to

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.589 
as you saw in the lab right i have to
kind<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.519> wait<00:03:51.700> for<00:03:51.880> her<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.000> commit<00:03:52.329> on<00:03:52.540> a

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
kind of wait for her to commit on a

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.690 
kind of wait for her to commit on a
second<00:03:53.019> jump<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.440> then<00:03:53.590> fire<00:03:54.220> them<00:03:54.310> all<00:03:54.459> might

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
second jump and then fire them all might

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.330 
second jump and then fire them all might
work<00:03:54.910> but<00:03:55.150> he<00:03:55.239> can<00:03:55.389> still<00:03:55.510> toss<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.079> web<00:03:56.280> as<00:03:57.280> a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
work but he can still toss the web as a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.309 
work but he can still toss the web as a
way<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.579> hover<00:03:57.880> again<00:03:58.329> over<00:03:58.810> your<00:03:58.930> firebox
