 m 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.130
 hi girls, how good is that, today I'm going 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.220
 I will bring you a petition that is today so 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.960
 good that I carry in my bag and I made a 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.760
 howitzer I think when I started with the channel 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.570
 years ago then good and years ago 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.200
 sorry 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.270
 a time then clear is already very 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.770
 late and I have decided to make a 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.360
 update and so answer too 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.370
 your requests 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.329
 So, well, I'm going to show you what 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.409
 I carry in my bag normally 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.320
 now a bag that I am using 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.660
 much that this trunk 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.880
 a bag without black primarian primar 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.830
 with the handle 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.260
 nothing special is a size 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.149
 medium 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.649
 and well, it's the one I'm using the most 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.739
 usually you already know that I change 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.850
 bag practically every day because then 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.940
 depending on the clothes I wear 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.460
 I change the bag but I already say what 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.960
 this is the one that I use the most but now 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.960
 for spring-summer used colors 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 more alive but good 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.690
 I do it with this one who is the one who called 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.270
 today for example and I teach you to see 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.120
 I'm good with a packet of real Kleenex 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.080
 where I catch them a carrefour because the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.080
 stamping that has 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.259
 I carry my emergency kit ume kit 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.869
 of survival calling as you want 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.549
 that hello kitty of mercadona is expected 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.500
 if I remember correctly that there is a 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.810
 exclusive video that I talk about what 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.610
 I've been here in here so good if 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.260
 You want to leave the link here 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.870
 down and so you can see it directly 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.940
 that I explain it in more detail 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.250
 Then came some wipes 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.680
 refreshing the mercadona station 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.510
 I take them especially if it was like 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.890
 by itself as anything or so I 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.630
 I do not like that my hands 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.490
 they fly to food or things from these 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.760
 then I prefer to always carry some 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.760
 wipes 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.170
 then I have this little bag that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.480
 I took it last year like that in one of 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.390
 these local holidays that are in the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.000
 stand and here what I always carry 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.950
 is the lipstick that I'm carrying in the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.150
 moment today is number 42 of kiko 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.700
 to retouch me then I take the perfume 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.240
 good the little bottle of perfume with 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.360
 perfume that you wear in the day 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.670
 and I also carry this creampie that 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.060
 increase for the axes because you see 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.849
 I have one here and I get 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.220
 quite often let's say now no 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.660
 so much but before but well I prefer 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.130
 take it for dry then this what 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.239
 I have been here sometimes I also have eye drops 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.830
 and what happens now is just me 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.350
 end the boat person last you 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.330
 doctor 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.130
 if this is the only thing that I carry 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.690
 of makeup and all this is what 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.750
 I normally take to touch up the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.550
 labial and that's what happens is that if 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.870
 I will be a whole day out or if I go 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.730
 to something more special or whatever 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.950
 then I'm taking a toilet bag 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.890
 makeup is valid but daily I do not 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.690
 I wear 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.100
 what's better my portfolio is since 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.370
 I have no idea what you think 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.260
 they gave away 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.040
 and now for summer it will also change and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.280
 I would take one with more colors but good 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.840
 and nothing because here I have dissolved and my 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.260
 cards over here by the sides I 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.260
 strips 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.450
 later I also carry the book that is 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.099
 reading right now is this almost 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.099
 a novel of come Maxwell 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.030
 I also carry a bottle of water 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.230
 although now how do I use the bottles 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.480
 of a liter as the floor carry 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.860
 normally in your hand and you're done if you do not 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.350
 I have a small booty bag 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.300
 and then my mobile arrived 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.120
 immobile and my keys that are now in 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.800
 the door so I can not teach them and 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.930
 nothing else you see that I carry things very very 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.550
 simple nothing great but good 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.710
 is what I need on a day to day basis 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.600
 I need nothing more so that's what 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.910
 I take it and well I hope that I have 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.910
 liked the video girls a little kiss chao
