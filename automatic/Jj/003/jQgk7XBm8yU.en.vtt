like<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.370> defined<00:06:09.000> texture<00:06:09.210> pack<00:06:09.390> and<00:06:09.870> I<00:06:10.260> do

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
like the defined texture pack and I do

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.260 
like the defined texture pack and I do
believe<00:06:10.590> that's<00:06:10.890> it<00:06:11.130> because<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.550> GOI<00:06:11.910> never

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
believe that's it because the GOI never

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.970 
believe that's it because the GOI never
changed<00:06:12.600> just<00:06:12.780> keep<00:06:12.990> it<00:06:13.140> that<00:06:13.260> default<00:06:13.770> feel

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
changed just keep it that default feel

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.220
