00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.000 
about it right now I will do it well big
update<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.090> although<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:13.410> I

update for you although so I

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.440

can<00:02:14.099> let<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.489> one<00:02:14.849> thing<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.060> can't<00:02:15.330> say

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
can let you know one thing I can't say

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.449 
can let you know one thing I can't say
so<00:02:15.510> far<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.470> hair<00:02:16.650> does<00:02:16.920> shed<00:02:17.189> a<00:02:17.220> lot

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
so far is that the hair does shed a lot

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.330 
so far is that the hair does shed a lot
I<00:02:17.840> mean<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.260> could<00:02:19.409> be<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.799> that<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.040> didn't

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
I mean it could be one that I didn't

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.069 
I mean it could be one that I didn't
send<00:02:20.519> my<00:02:20.579> whips<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.060> two<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.390> did<00:02:21.780> cut<00:02:21.989> the

send my whips and two I did cut the

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.100 
send my whips and two I did cut the
trucks<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.470> didn't<00:02:22.799> double<00:02:23.780> whatever<00:02:24.780> it's

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
