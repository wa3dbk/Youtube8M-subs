00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
hints at the fact that we could actually

hints at the fact that we could actually
play<00:04:30.670> as<00:04:31.050> zombies<00:04:32.050> now<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.950> is<00:04:33.100> known<00:04:33.370> of

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
play as zombies now it is known of

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.490 
play as zombies now it is known of
course<00:04:33.580> as<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.090> turned<00:04:34.480> game<00:04:34.960> mode<00:04:35.230> within

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.650

so<00:04:39.340> maybe<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.700> coding<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.120> just<00:04:40.300> not<00:04:40.480> being

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
so maybe the coding is just not being

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.330 
so maybe the coding is just not being
changed<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.320> was<00:04:41.410> carried<00:04:41.680> on<00:04:41.830> back<00:04:42.190> its

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
changed and it was carried on back its

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.100

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
to as it's being left there maybe that's

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.170
