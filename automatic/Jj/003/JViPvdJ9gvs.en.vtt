00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.870
 know how to choose the best race for 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.859
 playing with your child is a decision 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.900
 would be 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.000
 That's why Dr. Silvio has 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 some important guidelines for 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.859
 You want to buy a puppy? 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.730
 for your child to have a look at the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.730
 pet space 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.310
 inserting a dog into a family is a 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.110
 very important decision power and change 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.129
 whole house routine 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.610
 we will have to ask ourselves if we have 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.989
 condition of creating a field like ours. 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.840
 rhythm of life 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.629
 if we live in a house or apartment 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.699
 We live in the countryside or in the city. 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.910
 if we have time to take your brother in the 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.809
 cases and needed if we 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.909
 we will be concerned to keep everything clean 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.519
 if he commits any mess within the 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.400
 house and especially if we have 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:09.470
 child at home what would be the ideal breed 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.049
 to deal with this child is difficult 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.530
 indicate an ideal breed for breeding 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.229
 since all races they have 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.200
 own characteristics but all 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.130
 individuals are also one 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.560
 We know several dogs of races. 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.680
 so aggressive that they are very 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.240
 gentle with children and other not so much 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.460
 People have to ask themselves what the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.460
 field personality 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.720
 search with someone who has a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.730
 same breed 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.550
 check with people who live together 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.409
 With him, how's that personality? 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.840
 we must also remember that the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.940
 children also help us if it is a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.620
 very electric child 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.390
 it would not be interesting to put a dog 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.479
 very big we have to remember 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.580
 that the question of the size of the 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.040
 animal sometimes the dog he can 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.240
 simply walking can knock down without 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.010
 want the child 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.620
 other times it may be so small 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.530
 the child can hurt you so 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.709
 best option is to do a lot of research and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.720
 ask for directions can not be for someone 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.210
 who has created this breed can be for a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.780
 neighbor can be 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:26.050
 and very careful when taking a dog to 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.780
 identify the best way to know 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.270
 if the dog is reliable close to children is 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.860
 know how he was blamed if 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.500
 from a young age he had contact with 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.600
 children from an early age he endured 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.570
 pulled and pinches are falls are the people 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.430
 also have to remember that adult dogs 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.250
 can be tolerant but we do not 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.270
 history of socialization is 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.270
 better we take some care 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.300
 no matter how much your dog is 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.750
 socialized or with your child 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.000
 behaved but children and dogs should not 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.610
 being left alone we have to 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.560
 remember that accidents happen so much 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.340
 by the dog as well as by the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.450
 kid 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.170
 The very ideal is always you 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.050
 supervise or leave someone 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.660
 responsible for supervising your dog and 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.780
 your child make your child respect the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.450
 dog and make the dog respect your child 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.540
 taking these attitudes we all have 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.250
 a harmonious family happy personal well 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.100
 I hope I have answered some questions 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.100
 Next week we will fight again.
