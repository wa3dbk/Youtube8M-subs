00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
history so so doom was this revolution
and<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.840> remember<00:00:31.230> did<00:00:31.349> he<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> him<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.130> well

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and and so on but doom 3 they had this

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.150 
and and so on but doom 3 they had this
still<00:00:38.790> lightning<00:00:39.360> effects<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.980> could

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
still lightning effects what you could

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.779 
still lightning effects what you could
move<00:00:41.340> light<00:00:41.640> around<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.170> shadows<00:00:43.530> will

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
move light around and the shadows will

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.510 
move light around and the shadows will
draw<00:00:44.840> in<00:00:45.840> perspective<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> light<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
draw in perspective of the light and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.610 
draw in perspective of the light and
this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> technology<00:00:48.750> breakthrough<00:00:49.440> but

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
this is a technology breakthrough but

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.490 
this is a technology breakthrough but
the<00:00:49.800> game<00:00:50.010> itself<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:51.000> didn't<00:00:51.449> break<00:00:52.230> through

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the game itself it didn't break through

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
the game itself it didn't break through
like<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.860> other<00:00:53.160> ones<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.059> had<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> huge

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
like the other ones so we had this huge

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.189 
like the other ones so we had this huge
gap<00:00:55.820> since<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.780> coming<00:00:58.079> back

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
gap since then and now it's coming back

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.680 
gap since then and now it's coming back
so<00:00:59.449> having<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:02.309> mind<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so having this in mind how do you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.590 
so having this in mind how do you
prepare<00:01:04.260> yourself<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.479> the
