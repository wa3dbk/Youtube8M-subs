here's<00:00:12.260> our<00:00:12.380> front<00:00:12.500> to<00:00:12.650> back<00:00:13.150> here's<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:14.299> back

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
here's our front to back here's the back

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.870 
here's our front to back here's the back
to<00:00:14.570> front<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:16.070> back<00:00:16.250> to<00:00:16.430> back<00:00:16.580> can<00:00:16.760> go

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
to front the back to back can go

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.640 
to front the back to back can go
infinitely<00:00:17.330> because<00:00:18.080> you're<00:00:18.289> just<00:00:18.470> starting

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
infinitely because you're just starting

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.930 
infinitely because you're just starting
in<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:18.890> back<00:00:19.039> grip<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:19.430> you're<00:00:19.520> pulling<00:00:19.850> it

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
in the back grip and you're pulling it

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.260 
in the back grip and you're pulling it
into<00:00:20.090> a<00:00:20.150> bad<00:00:20.360> grip<00:00:20.570> see<00:00:20.779> back<00:00:21.560> back<00:00:21.830> in<00:00:22.270> front

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
into a bad grip see back back in front

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.920 
into a bad grip see back back in front
to<00:00:23.360> front<00:00:23.510> front<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.440> front<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.450> last<00:00:26.630> two

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
to front front to front so the last two

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.900 
to front front to front so the last two
you<00:00:27.110> can<00:00:27.260> do<00:00:27.350> infinitely<00:00:27.830> but<00:00:28.310> they're<00:00:28.610> ups

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
you can do infinitely but they're ups

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.510 
you can do infinitely but they're ups
they're<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.240> little<00:00:29.600> bit<00:00:29.840> more<00:00:29.870> difficult<00:00:30.520> and

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
they're a little bit more difficult and

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.459 
they're a little bit more difficult and
also<00:00:32.300> we<00:00:32.539> want<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:32.750> get<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:32.930> back<00:00:33.079> friends<00:00:33.379> in

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
also we want to get the back friends in

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.670 
also we want to get the back friends in
the<00:00:33.530> front<00:00:33.649> to<00:00:33.800> backs<00:00:33.980> okay<00:00:34.640> because<00:00:35.600> once<00:00:36.469> we

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
the front to backs okay because once we

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.529 
the front to backs okay because once we
learn<00:00:36.860> those<00:00:37.159> we'll<00:00:37.640> be<00:00:37.789> able<00:00:37.879> to<00:00:38.149> figure

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
learn those we'll be able to figure

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.009 
learn those we'll be able to figure
Eight's

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
Eight's

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.660 
Eight's
and<00:00:39.350> we'll<00:00:39.469> start<00:00:39.710> adding<00:00:39.800> back<00:00:40.249> two<00:00:40.399> fronts

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
and we'll start adding back two fronts

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.279 
and we'll start adding back two fronts
and<00:00:40.789> front<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:40.999> backs<00:00:41.269> and<00:00:41.809> once<00:00:41.989> you'll<00:00:42.140> end

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
and front to backs and once you'll end

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.729 
and front to backs and once you'll end
up<00:00:42.379> with<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:44.030> is<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:44.929> figure<00:00:45.140> eight<00:00:45.319> wrist<00:00:45.499> roll

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.630 

all<00:00:48.739> right<00:00:48.829> you<00:00:49.069> want<00:00:49.219> to<00:00:49.249> learn<00:00:49.399> that<00:00:49.579> right

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
all right you want to learn that right

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.549 
all right you want to learn that right
because<00:00:50.359> I<00:00:50.569> mean<00:00:50.749> once<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.140> get<00:00:51.350> that

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
because I mean once you get that

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.340 
because I mean once you get that
everything<00:00:52.489> opens<00:00:52.850> up<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.019> yours

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
everything opens up so yours

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.889 
everything opens up so yours
there's<00:00:55.309> two<00:00:55.460> ways<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:56.030> people<00:00:56.420> get<00:00:56.719> into

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
there's two ways that people get into

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.419 
there's two ways that people get into
the<00:00:57.440> back<00:00:57.620> in<00:00:57.739> front<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.979> the<00:00:58.039> front<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.370> a

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
the back in front of the front of a

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.279 
the back in front of the front of a
Chris<00:00:58.699> rolls<00:00:58.940> I'm<00:00:59.539> going<00:00:59.749> to<00:00:59.809> show<00:00:59.929> you<00:01:00.019> the

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
Chris rolls I'm going to show you the

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.079 
Chris rolls I'm going to show you the
way<00:01:00.409> that<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.620> usually<00:01:00.859> get<00:01:01.190> into<00:01:01.460> them<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:01.729> I

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
way that I usually get into them and I

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.399 
way that I usually get into them and I
use<00:01:02.210> something<00:01:02.449> called<00:01:02.479> it's<00:01:02.870> called<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.139> rib

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
use something called it's called a rib

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.550 
use something called it's called a rib
okay<00:01:04.010> our<00:01:04.729> rip<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.120> basically<00:01:05.540> one<00:01:06.200> hand

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
okay our rip is basically one hand

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.580 
okay our rip is basically one hand
creates<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:08.210> momentum<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.080> other<00:01:09.230> hand

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
creates the momentum for the other hand

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.980 
creates the momentum for the other hand
like<00:01:10.070> in<00:01:10.220> nunchucks<00:01:10.610> usually<00:01:10.970> one<00:01:11.630> hand<00:01:11.900> is

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
like in nunchucks usually one hand is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.420 
like in nunchucks usually one hand is
just<00:01:12.020> creating<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.560> momentum<00:01:12.920> for<00:01:13.040> itself

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
just creating the momentum for itself

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.980 
just creating the momentum for itself
like<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.950> rip<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.850> left<00:01:17.270> hand<00:01:17.570> for<00:01:17.930> instance

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
like so rip this left hand for instance

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.280 
like so rip this left hand for instance
is<00:01:18.650> going<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.010> rip<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.640> momentum<00:01:20.120> into<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.750> so

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
is going to rip the momentum into it so

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.960 
is going to rip the momentum into it so
you're<00:01:21.470> using<00:01:21.710> one<00:01:22.070> hand<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.490> create<00:01:22.760> the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
you're using one hand to create the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.110 
you're using one hand to create the
momentum<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.960> for<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.380> spin<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
momentum for the for the spin so the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.810 
momentum for the for the spin so the
back<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.750> your<00:01:26.840> fist<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.530> do<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.800> rip<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.640> want

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
back of your fist to do a rip you want

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.610 
back of your fist to do a rip you want
the<00:01:28.880> back<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.180> your<00:01:29.270> fist<00:01:29.540> one<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:30.140> be<00:01:30.260> pointed

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
the back of your fist one to be pointed

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
back of your fist or the other should be

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.130 
back of your fist or the other should be
pointed<00:01:34.970> down<00:01:35.000> towards<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:35.600> floor<00:01:35.750> like<00:01:36.110> this

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
pointed down towards the floor like this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.910 
pointed down towards the floor like this
so<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:36.950> ceiling<00:01:37.700> floor<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:39.740> that's

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
so here is ceiling floor the one that's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.770 
so here is ceiling floor the one that's
pointed<00:01:40.070> towards<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.580> floor<00:01:40.880> we're<00:01:41.540> going<00:01:41.720> to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
pointed towards the floor we're going to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.740 
pointed towards the floor we're going to
pull<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:41.990> up<00:01:42.080> like<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.030> step<00:01:44.450> one

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
pull it up like this it is a step one

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.870 
pull it up like this it is a step one
you<00:01:45.410> should<00:01:45.620> see<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.010> chain<00:01:46.220> go<00:01:46.430> across<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
you should see the chain go across the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.900 
you should see the chain go across the
back<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.090> your<00:01:47.360> fist<00:01:47.660> like<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.310> okay<00:01:49.310> try<00:01:49.880> it

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
back of your fist like that okay try it

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.350 
back of your fist like that okay try it
again

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360

again
this<00:01:50.930> one<00:01:51.110> that's<00:01:51.260> fun<00:01:51.410> each<00:01:51.500> other<00:01:51.650> so<00:01:51.800> four

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
this one that's fun each other so four

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.980 
this one that's fun each other so four
crosses<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> back<00:01:54.110> of<00:01:54.320> your<00:01:54.440> fist<00:01:55.420> okay<00:01:56.420> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
crosses the back of your fist okay the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.690 
crosses the back of your fist okay the
