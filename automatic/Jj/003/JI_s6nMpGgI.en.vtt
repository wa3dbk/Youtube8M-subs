00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you may or may not know I broke a code

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.560 
you may or may not know I broke a code
in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> Mayan<00:01:14.549> calendar<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.030> ended<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.450> down

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
there with a bunch of scientists and so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.950 
there with a bunch of scientists and so
I<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> learn<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.600> whole<00:01:18.750> Mayan

culture and of course their genius in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.249 
culture and of course their genius in
mathematics<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.830> use<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> frequencies

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
mathematics and the use of frequencies

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.980 
mathematics and the use of frequencies
notwithstanding<00:01:25.259> their<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.990> horrible

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
intellect when I came to science and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.670 
intellect when I came to science and
math<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.650> sound<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.400> frequencies<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:37.259> was

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
math and sound and frequencies so I was

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.330 
math and sound and frequencies so I was
down<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.009> studying<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:40.189> one<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.280> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that they were complaining like this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.969 
that they were complaining like this
guy's<00:02:03.240> such<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.509> jerk<00:02:03.930> he's<00:02:04.320> selfish<00:02:04.770> did

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
guy's such a jerk he's selfish did

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.920 
guy's such a jerk he's selfish did
enough<00:02:05.280> however<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:06.119> said<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.719> end

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
enough however they said that my end

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.430 
enough however they said that my end
back<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.700> use<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.000> today<00:02:09.440> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
back then but we can use it today so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.750 
back then but we can use it today so
just<00:02:10.619> imagine<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:11.280> looking<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.610> yourself

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
just imagine you're looking at yourself

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.630 
just imagine you're looking at yourself
and<00:02:12.150> that's

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
and that's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.880 
and that's
those<00:02:12.820> spiritual<00:02:13.270> modems<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.500> know<00:02:14.620> life

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
those spiritual modems of you know life

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.940 
those spiritual modems of you know life
is<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.490> reflection<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.590> said

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
is just a reflection of you so that said

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.190 
is just a reflection of you so that said
it<00:02:18.340> still<00:02:18.640> hurts<00:02:19.270> when<00:02:19.570> people<00:02:19.840> are<00:02:19.960> mean<00:02:20.170> to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
it still hurts when people are mean to

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.600 
it still hurts when people are mean to
you<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.520> what<00:02:22.030> do<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.830> one<00:02:23.830> take<00:02:24.400> that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
you and so what do you do one take that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.330 
you and so what do you do one take that
reflection<00:02:25.210> into<00:02:25.570> how<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.830> look<00:02:27.040> at<00:02:27.160> this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
reflection into how can I look at this

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
reflection into how can I look at this
and<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:27.850> I'm<00:02:28.090> saying<00:02:28.390> somebody's<00:02:28.990> being<00:02:29.260> mean

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
and if I'm saying somebody's being mean

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.360 
and if I'm saying somebody's being mean
to<00:02:29.890> me<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.250> what<00:02:30.310> way<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.590> look<00:02:32.860> inside

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
to me and what way can I look inside

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.500 
to me and what way can I look inside
myself<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.090> say<00:02:34.480> how<00:02:35.080> am<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:36.300> taking<00:02:37.300> care

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
myself and say how am I not taking care

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.770 
myself and say how am I not taking care
of<00:02:37.540> me<00:02:37.870> or<00:02:38.170> being<00:02:38.590> mean<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.280> myself<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:40.600> would

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
of me or being mean to myself that would

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.680 
of me or being mean to myself that would
be<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.050> first<00:02:41.290> step<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.860> take<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> look<00:02:42.280> at<00:02:42.430> that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
be the first step to take a look at that

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.420 
be the first step to take a look at that
that's<00:02:43.690> usually<00:02:44.200> not<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.680> easy<00:02:44.920> your<00:02:45.250> look

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
that's usually not so easy your look

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.949 
that's usually not so easy your look
you're<00:02:45.640> always<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:46.150> wait<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.630> has<00:02:46.750> nothing

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
you're always like wait that has nothing

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.930 
you're always like wait that has nothing
to<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.350> with<00:02:47.470> me<00:02:47.650> unless<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.610> course<00:02:48.640> you're

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
to do with me unless of course you're

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.160 
to do with me unless of course you're
staring<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.360> mirror<00:02:49.450> well<00:02:49.810> if<00:02:49.930> they're

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
staring in the mirror well if they're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.400 
staring in the mirror well if they're
right<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.970> next<00:02:52.000> thing<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.630> would<00:02:52.750> say<00:02:53.110> is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
right so the next thing I would say is

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.390 
right so the next thing I would say is
set<00:02:54.070> boundaries<00:02:54.489> once<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:56.020> see<00:02:56.560> something<00:02:56.980> or

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
set boundaries once you see something or

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.449 
set boundaries once you see something or
interact<00:02:57.910> with<00:02:58.060> somebody<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:59.170> can<00:03:00.130> only

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
interact with somebody that you can only

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.060 
interact with somebody that you can only
put<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> low<00:03:01.810> frequency<00:03:02.050> on<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.739> other<00:03:02.890> words

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
put a low frequency on in other words

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.710 
put a low frequency on in other words
they're<00:03:03.340> angry<00:03:03.760> they're<00:03:04.030> kind<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.330> sending

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
they're angry they're kind of sending

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.570 
they're angry they're kind of sending
they're<00:03:05.020> mean<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.560> then<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.370> have<00:03:06.400> to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
they're mean to you then you have to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.000 
they're mean to you then you have to
protect<00:03:07.510> yourself<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:08.350> means<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.709> have<00:03:08.890> to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
protect yourself that means you have to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.860 
protect yourself that means you have to
limit<00:03:09.370> time<00:03:09.610> with<00:03:09.820> them<00:03:09.970> no<00:03:10.150> matter<00:03:10.270> what<00:03:10.570> even

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
limit time with them no matter what even

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.420 
limit time with them no matter what even
if<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.260> care<00:03:11.500> about<00:03:11.590> them<00:03:11.890> even<00:03:12.190> if<00:03:12.280> there's

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
if you care about them even if there's

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.220 
if you care about them even if there's
somebody<00:03:12.610> close<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.180> while<00:03:13.989> they're<00:03:14.140> in

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
that frequency you're like I will help

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.670 
that frequency you're like I will help
you<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.360> 10<00:03:16.510> minutes<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.989> will<00:03:17.170> listen<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.530> you

for 10 minutes I will do my best but I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.759 
for 10 minutes I will do my best but I
can't<00:03:20.110> sink<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.739> low<00:03:20.950> frequency<00:03:21.160> and

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
can't sink to this low frequency and

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.890 
can't sink to this low frequency and
allow<00:03:23.769> myself<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.519> harmonize<00:03:25.030> with<00:03:25.450> these<00:03:25.630> low

allow myself to harmonize with these low

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.229 
allow myself to harmonize with these low
frequency<00:03:26.220> vibrations<00:03:27.220> because<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:28.000> will

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
frequency vibrations because it will

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.750 
frequency vibrations because it will
bring<00:03:28.420> me<00:03:28.570> down<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.019> then<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.799> can't<00:03:30.310> help<00:03:30.459> you
