00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
footprint machine a little bit like the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.359 
footprint machine a little bit like the
micro<00:00:20.369> series<00:00:21.350> in<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.950> know<00:00:23.040> smaller

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
don't get those beans right away they

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.630 
don't get those beans right away they
only<00:04:04.320> give<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.590> about<00:04:04.620> two<00:04:04.950> seconds<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.489> can

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
only give you about two seconds you can

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.460

up or down the strength of it and you

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.190 
up or down the strength of it and you
can<00:04:07.620> see<00:04:07.800> there<00:04:07.950> was<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.070> wide<00:04:08.489> range<00:04:12.200> it's

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
and what we found on this machine as

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.540 
and what we found on this machine as
well<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.919> makes<00:05:30.190> hot<00:05:30.550> drinks<00:05:32.250> we<00:05:33.250> had<00:05:33.400> one

so that is the Juara a 9 the basics the
pros<00:05:54.220> on<00:05:54.430> this<00:05:54.610> machine<00:05:54.789> are<00:05:55.210> as<00:05:55.449> far<00:05:55.660> as<00:05:55.690> I'm

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
pros on this machine are as far as I'm

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.529 
pros on this machine are as far as I'm
concerned<00:05:56.320> why<00:05:56.530> would<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.800> buy<00:05:56.949> this<00:05:57.009> machine

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
concerned why would I buy this machine

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.150 
concerned why would I buy this machine
makes<00:05:58.539> a<00:05:58.720> nice<00:05:58.900> drink<00:05:59.259> I<00:05:59.470> think<00:05:59.560> they<00:05:59.889> do<00:05:59.949> the

makes a nice drink I think they do the

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.890 
makes a nice drink I think they do the
foam<00:06:00.310> really<00:06:00.639> well<00:06:00.789> and<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.210> heat<00:06:01.479> this<00:06:01.720> is

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
foam really well and the heat this is

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.629 
foam really well and the heat this is
warmer<00:06:02.650> than<00:06:02.770> most<00:06:03.009> drinks<00:06:03.370> that<00:06:03.490> you're

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
warmer than most drinks that you're
