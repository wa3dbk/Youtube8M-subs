and toxicities in the next couple videos
this<00:00:28.220> is<00:00:28.399> the<00:00:28.579> first<00:00:29.000> video<00:00:29.329> in<00:00:29.809> the<00:00:30.099> vitamins

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
this is the first video in the vitamins

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.560 
this is the first video in the vitamins
section<00:00:31.489> which<00:00:31.640> is<00:00:31.820> going<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:32.090> have<00:00:32.239> four

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
of these after this one we'll start with

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.560 
of these after this one we'll start with

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
the fat soluble vitamins which are

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.810 
the fat soluble vitamins which are
hydrophobic<00:00:39.170> nutrients<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.130> are<00:00:40.280> necessary

hydrophobic nutrients that are necessary

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.970 
hydrophobic nutrients that are necessary

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
mean fat loving and when we consume

this<00:00:53.630> means<00:00:53.900> that<00:00:53.990> deficiencies<00:00:54.829> are<00:00:55.040> less

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
this means that deficiencies are less

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.360 
this means that deficiencies are less
likely<00:00:55.550> because<00:00:56.210> we<00:00:56.690> can<00:00:56.870> store<00:00:57.200> weeks<00:00:58.070> or

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
likely because we can store weeks or

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.370 
likely because we can store weeks or
months<00:00:58.700> worth<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.360> vitamins<00:00:59.810> in<00:01:00.020> our<00:01:00.140> body

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
months worth of the vitamins in our body

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.810 
months worth of the vitamins in our body
so<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:00.920> would<00:01:01.040> take<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.220> long<00:01:01.489> time<00:01:01.760> for

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
so it would take a long time for

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.119 
so it would take a long time for
deficiencies<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:03.110> come<00:01:03.739> up

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
deficiencies to come up

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.940 
deficiencies to come up
it<00:01:04.339> also<00:01:04.549> means<00:01:04.960> toxicities<00:01:05.960> are<00:01:06.140> more<00:01:06.470> likely

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
it also means toxicities are more likely

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.790 
it also means toxicities are more likely
because<00:01:07.490> as<00:01:08.060> we<00:01:08.270> consume<00:01:08.659> less<00:01:09.050> it<00:01:09.409> can<00:01:09.560> build

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
because as we consume less it can build

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.590 
because as we consume less it can build
up<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.250> body<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:10.760> accumulate<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.570> cause

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
up in the body and accumulate and cause

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.320 
up in the body and accumulate and cause
problems<00:01:12.250> fat<00:01:13.250> soluble<00:01:13.580> vitamins<00:01:14.120> are

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
problems fat soluble vitamins are

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.050 
problems fat soluble vitamins are
absorbed<00:01:14.870> from<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.350> diet<00:01:15.590> as<00:01:15.920> part<00:01:16.550> of<00:01:16.610> calico

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060

digested by pancreatic enzymes this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.370 
digested by pancreatic enzymes this
means<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.670> fat<00:01:26.000> absorption<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.840> inhibited

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
means that a fat absorption is inhibited

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.800 
means that a fat absorption is inhibited

absorbed<00:01:38.979> steatorrhea<00:01:39.979> is<00:01:40.760> when<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.240> have

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
absorbed steatorrhea is when you have

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.740 
absorbed steatorrhea is when you have

decreased fat soluble vitamin absorption

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.380 
decreased fat soluble vitamin absorption
which<00:01:44.750> means<00:01:45.080> increased<00:01:46.040> fat<00:01:46.460> excretion<00:01:47.150> in

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
which means increased fat excretion in

then put in parentheses vitamin b2 so if

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.390 
then put in parentheses vitamin b2 so if
you<00:04:48.600> know<00:04:48.750> one<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.140> one<00:04:49.530> or<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.980> other<00:04:50.130> you're

I've<00:05:21.390> made<00:05:21.510> up<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.780> little<00:05:21.990> bit<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.410> mnemonic

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
I've made up a little bit of a mnemonic

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.460 
I've made up a little bit of a mnemonic
for<00:05:22.920> this<00:05:23.280> first<00:05:24.180> off<00:05:24.390> just<00:05:24.570> imagine<00:05:25.140> the

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
for this first off just imagine the

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.960 
for this first off just imagine the
largest<00:05:26.070> individual<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.120> can<00:05:27.390> being<00:05:28.020> naked

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
largest individual you can being naked

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.210 
largest individual you can being naked
and<00:05:29.970> that'll<00:05:30.270> let<00:05:30.420> you<00:05:30.480> know<00:05:30.780> that<00:05:31.350> fat<00:05:31.770> stands

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
and that'll let you know that fat stands

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.180 
and that'll let you know that fat stands
for<00:05:32.460> fat<00:05:32.730> soluble<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.750> naked<00:05:34.530> has<00:05:34.920> the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
for fat soluble and naked has the

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.480 
for fat soluble and naked has the
letters<00:05:35.550> of<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.330> fat<00:05:36.540> soluble<00:05:36.900> vitamins<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.650> K

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
letters of the fat soluble vitamins a K

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.360 
letters of the fat soluble vitamins a K
E<00:05:38.850> and<00:05:39.420> D<00:05:39.720> obviously<00:05:40.170> there's<00:05:40.680> no<00:05:40.800> vitamin<00:05:41.190> M

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
E and D obviously there's no vitamin M

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.490 
E and D obviously there's no vitamin M
so<00:05:41.610> that<00:05:41.730> shouldn't<00:05:42.030> throw<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:42.330> off<00:05:42.600> and<00:05:42.870> then

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
so that shouldn't throw you off and then

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.600 
so that shouldn't throw you off and then
you<00:05:43.560> can<00:05:43.710> just<00:05:43.800> think<00:05:43.980> of<00:05:44.160> all<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.580> other

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
you can just think of all the other

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.780 
you can just think of all the other
vitamins<00:05:45.330> not<00:05:45.570> mentioned<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:46.350> naked<00:05:46.890> all<00:05:47.490> the

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
vitamins not mentioned and naked all the

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.510 
vitamins not mentioned and naked all the
B's<00:05:48.000> and<00:05:48.450> C<00:05:48.840> are<00:05:49.200> going<00:05:49.620> to<00:05:49.710> be<00:05:49.800> water<00:05:50.040> soluble

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
B's and C are going to be water soluble

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.150 
B's and C are going to be water soluble
