unique<00:00:46.590> things<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.070> we're<00:00:47.190> doing<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
unique things that we're doing that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.970 
unique things that we're doing that
we're<00:00:47.700> combining<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.390> technologies<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
we're combining in technologies is the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
we're combining in technologies is the
fact<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.420> these<00:00:51.420> skiers<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.989> looking<00:00:52.260> for

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
fact that these skiers are looking for

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.400 
fact that these skiers are looking for
lighter<00:00:52.800> weight<00:00:53.219> skis<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.260> are

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
lighter weight skis and so we are

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.260 
lighter weight skis and so we are
putting<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.800> honeycomb<00:00:56.340> tip<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.820> tail<00:00:56.969> end

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
putting a honeycomb tip and tail end

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
putting a honeycomb tip and tail end
okay<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.719> well<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.199> we've<00:00:58.530> removed<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.309> edges

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
okay as well as we've removed the edges

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
okay as well as we've removed the edges
on<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> extremities<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> creates<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
on the extremities so it creates a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
on the extremities so it creates a
really<00:01:02.699> light<00:01:03.090> swing<00:01:03.449> weight<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> also<00:01:04.439> for

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
really light swing weight and also for

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
really light swing weight and also for
guys<00:01:04.769> who<00:01:04.799> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> carry<00:01:05.460> their<00:01:05.700> skis<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
guys who want to carry their skis up the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
guys who want to carry their skis up the
mountain<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.470> access<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.070> terrain<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
mountain now to access that terrain that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
mountain now to access that terrain that
lifts<00:01:08.850> don't<00:01:08.970> observe<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
lifts don't observe this is going to be

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.289 
lifts don't observe this is going to be
a<00:01:10.710> great<00:01:10.950> ski<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> you're<00:01:11.760> reducing<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
a great ski for that you're reducing the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179 
a great ski for that you're reducing the
weight<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.810> yet<00:01:13.140> less<00:01:13.409> effort<00:01:13.650> getting<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
weight so yet less effort getting on the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
weight so yet less effort getting on the
hill<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.729> those<00:01:14.880> guys<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.360> hitting

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
hill and then if those guys are hitting

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450 
hill and then if those guys are hitting
the<00:01:15.659> pillows<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.500> backcountry<00:01:16.830> kicker<00:01:17.189> stuff

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like that that low swing weight makes

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.890 
like that that low swing weight makes
the<00:01:19.320> ski<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.890> easy<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.490> spin<00:01:20.900> absolutely
