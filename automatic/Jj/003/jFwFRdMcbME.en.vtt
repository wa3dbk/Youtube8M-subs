00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the following video is part of one online 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.259
 learn short on www the optimal 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.890
 preparing for his high school diploma 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.230
 custom multiple themes 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.700
 videos and original high school assignments 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.770
 inner so somehow still in the middle of the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.260
 evolution welcome to the next abi 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.090
 web learn video in the fall about the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.070
 Stammbaum and I have it completely 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 intentionally only family tree as 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.220
 Heading chosen because you know 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 different pedigrees namely 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.890
 once the so-called low genetic 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.030
 you always tree in the evolution 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.770
 would sort or in the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.410
 sort topics evolution and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.730
 on the other hand she knows from the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.180
 human genetics of genetics 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.550
 the family trees that the example 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.820
 show inheritance of diseases 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 both spaces 10 are the same in principle 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.789
 and both are the same somehow 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.340
 built so feel genetic 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.969
 Pedigree is one way the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.780
 relationships between different types 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.159
 or their suspected 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.330
 emergence in a diagram 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.590
 summarize 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.630
 So you can do facts or suspicions 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 describe on pages or man 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.420
 Just try it in the diagram 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.270
 and that is in most 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 make it clearer and easier 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.009
 understand and that is why you are in the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.369
 evolutionary research 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.860
 easy to draw pedigrees 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.420
 and I would like to return with that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.670
 compare family tree 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.009
 if you have a personal one right now 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.619
 would make family pedigree then 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:44.009
 catch them with the simplicity's sake 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:48.299
 the members to whom you at the moment 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.680
 know and there you can see who it 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.729
 related to whom it is relative 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.399
 simply because then you never know 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.770
 married and they have children c 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.439
 and d and so on that means a and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 b in bern in the case now not directly 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.030
 related 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.229
 a direct relationship if I have that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.700
 now on the leader genetic 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.090
 transferred to pedigree 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.569
 then I look 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.030
 that somehow fit together 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.099
 what can homologue suspected 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.599
 to be called that is any 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.069
 similar structure that I find to 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.470
 example, the spine at the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.150
 vertebrate animals 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.370
 but that can also be a dna information 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.560
 be in which I enter 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.750
 pick out and then I'll look at it 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.900
 conditions for the different species 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.000
 and try to find out who is with 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.220
 closest to related genetic 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200
 Trunk trees are always based on the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.640
 principle of the simplest explanation 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.290
 that is, I have two samples that themselves 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.280
 just in a mutation for example now 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.720
 distinguish 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.610
 then the natural ones are closer 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.220
 related to each other as if I were two 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.440
 The samples are divided into five mutations 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.220
 so always distinguish the simplest 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.250
 statement 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.980
 it's just a mutation too 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.140
 generate as in the same period 5 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.019
 So you would create mutation 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.750
 accept sample one and two themselves 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.299
 only differ with one feature or 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:25.930
 to differ in a factor are closer 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:29.590
 related to each other like the one of 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.660
 There are five different factors 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.700
 might have been a precursor 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.400
 because there is again on the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.910
 other side of which to this 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.349
 with five features different 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.280
 also differ only with two 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:51.760
 but to those on the left in ten 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:55.260
 features or so both as a 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.880
 now similar to these heats 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.030
 what the five feature so I have 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.450
 to serve here seen five features 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.160
 Maybe I have a difference here 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.669
 two more features that are different 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.010
 and between the two I have 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:15.740
 only one feature and here it is 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.000
 also 1 and I have what I still have three 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.950
 features that are different now 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.720
 really just just pay off 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.410
 airborne are around them 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.080
 demonstrate 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.600
 I try to sort after the 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.600
 simplest explanation a mutation 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.480
 in between two mutations to the preliminary 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.510
 15 next precursor, of course, ideal 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.220
 if you have data, that's one thing 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.590
 give 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.810
 that's when you dna data about it 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.690
 used or amino acid pedigrees 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.640
 then it is the case and you can 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.730
 then try to retrace 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.800
 who is in the original common 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.300
 the forerunner the man had and if one 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.970
 that on the family tree about about 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.400
 then you can think about it 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.890
 who was the forerunner who how far 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.440
 Can I trace what ? 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.600
 what I enter into the family book and 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.000
 Other stories who was that 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.310
 origin of this super this is now there 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.790
 many viewed critically in evolution 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.470
 seen who was the last known or 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.320
 the earliest forerunner not 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.070
 can moor for a kind of poet 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.300
 investigate 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.850
 and how has this art 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.020
 evolved what do I see now what 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.850
 I saw in many before some time 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.570
 Tribal trees you can see different 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:41.780
 lengths 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:44.840
 This first is an idea of ​​the times 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.130
 who could have needed it and she 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.570
 already hear something very about my 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.500
 spongy formulation of it 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.500
 could have needed 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.750
 from a to b so come from this 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.220
 precursor to the precursor to the two 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.370
 I have to come now 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.100
 But that is not an exact statement 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.660
 can only time statements 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.980
 when I actually come to 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:12.410
 example, have a fossil and this 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.970
 fossil I can date through time 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.690
 other studies on the euro 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.020
 the radiocarbon method for example only 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.830
 then I can make temporal statements 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.170
 the storage space is 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.930
 in itself the length of the family tree itself 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.500
 does not give exact output over time 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.400
 who needed it its precursor 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.600
 by developing after preliminary b 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.600
 trunks only give information about the 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.770
 near the relationship between these
