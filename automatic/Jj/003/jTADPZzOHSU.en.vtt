though it's all natural and sweat but
you<00:07:08.930> guys<00:07:09.110> didn't<00:07:09.440> need<00:07:09.530> to<00:07:09.650> know<00:07:09.710> that<00:07:09.800> but

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
you guys didn't need to know that but

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.280 
you guys didn't need to know that but
the<00:07:10.940> thing<00:07:11.120> I<00:07:11.210> want<00:07:11.270> to<00:07:11.360> do<00:07:11.570> differently<00:07:12.050> with

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
the thing I want to do differently with

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.620 
the thing I want to do differently with
this<00:07:12.440> look<00:07:12.740> is<00:07:12.950> obviously<00:07:13.640> not<00:07:14.210> use<00:07:14.420> some

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
this look is obviously not use some

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.000 
this look is obviously not use some
lashes<00:07:15.020> because<00:07:15.140> they're<00:07:15.590> going<00:07:15.770> all<00:07:15.980> over

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010 
lashes because they're going all over

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.680 
lashes because they're going all over
the<00:07:16.220> place<00:07:16.340> and<00:07:16.760> then<00:07:16.880> I<00:07:16.910> think<00:07:17.270> people<00:07:17.480> would

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
the place and then I think people would

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.460 
the place and then I think people would
just<00:07:17.900> confuse<00:07:18.830> me<00:07:19.100> as<00:07:19.310> a<00:07:20.060> crazy<00:07:20.600> lady<00:07:20.840> because

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.470 
just confuse me as a crazy lady because

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.850 
just confuse me as a crazy lady because
it<00:07:21.920> doesn't<00:07:22.400> even<00:07:22.520> match<00:07:22.700> my<00:07:23.030> my<00:07:23.600> eyelash<00:07:24.290> so<00:07:24.590> I

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
it doesn't even match my my eyelash so I

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.350 
it doesn't even match my my eyelash so I
think<00:07:25.040> I<00:07:25.310> would<00:07:25.460> do<00:07:25.550> that<00:07:25.580> differently<00:07:25.850> I

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
think I would do that differently I

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.360 
think I would do that differently I
would<00:07:26.450> add<00:07:26.840> a<00:07:27.080> little<00:07:27.410> bit<00:07:27.710> of<00:07:27.770> less<00:07:28.040> blush

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.370 
would add a little bit of less blush

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.650 
would add a little bit of less blush
Ashley<00:07:28.790> I<00:07:28.850> would<00:07:29.000> just<00:07:29.120> keep<00:07:29.270> going<00:07:29.540> with

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 
Ashley I would just keep going with

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.020 
Ashley I would just keep going with
