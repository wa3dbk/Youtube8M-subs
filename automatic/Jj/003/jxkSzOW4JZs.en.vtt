 stands out is the president and I am today 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.840
 student 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.329
 well welcome thank you I wanted 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.789
 go back to school and I've come to 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:29.220
 do a lot here and I'm seeing that this 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 call is very special I'm glad to know 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.909
 in English 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.579
 if we are a bilingual center and in addition to 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.710
 be bilingual we practice in the hundred 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.449
 one hundred of the subjects that is bilingual 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.850
 and we also have auxiliary teachers 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.739
 two native assistant professors for 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.350
 reinforce these classes we consider that 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.589
 English is very important and new 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.589
 technologies 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.570
 you can spend a lot of time and be in 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.280
 all levels of teaching from 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.650
 secondary primary child care 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.259
 baccalaureate and there is a residence by 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.689
 true the residence the students who do not 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.220
 they live in toledo and they consider that the 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.750
 educational offer of the school is what 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.710
 important enough to 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.659
 receive here in 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.659
 in the school and in the city of toledo 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.880
 all right 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.700
 us when we hear the word 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.580
 internship 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.000
 it's a word that I do not know but it's like 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.110
 being locked up in a school does not 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 like anyone 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.119
 nobody but has nothing that does not 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.590
 the boarding schools of the last century or 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.770
 except we do not want him to have 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.770
 nothing 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.940
 and reside here and yet also 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.690
 they study and have a life of their own inside 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.690
 of the school also 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.170
 I just wanted to tell you skates because 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.750
 we have to go to the library that 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.250
 once the course is started the most 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.140
 important to us is that the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.310
 children are full of illusions and 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.560
 now what it is about is that 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.330
 we adults and teachers do not 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.790
 let's develop those illusions that 's 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.620
 our basically support role 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.959
 because with jobs he cheats me 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.230
 francisco from the school that there where 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.120
 go is in all the work of the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.459
 students for example here our eight 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.459
 by many the protagonists 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.600
 in your house fundamentally what 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.210
 we want you to feel comfortable at home 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.630
 I thought I saw a digital blackboard 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.520
 but well this school has made a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.960
 bet very determined and very strong for 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.300
 the new technologies as I said 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.910
 and the pieces the school is 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.910
 digitized with internet connection 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.320
 from 3 years old until the courses of 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 up and gas watching the classroom 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.080
 computing not 100% correct any 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.640
 disabled person can walk 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.250
 access all the places in the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.590
 security collection you do not have to upload more 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.650
 from a single floor is accessed and 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.770
 evicts 900 people in less than two 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.770
 minutes 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.129
 we've thought about it you have to think about 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.590
 doctor francisco congratulations that 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:35.409
 fruit of the day and I enjoy the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.079
