00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.300
 hello welcome on leads of 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.009
 today's tutorial trucks the 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.009
 pneumatic brakes part 1 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.209
 today still talk about systems 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.920
 of pneumatic brakes who watched 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.369
 the components looked at the pieces 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.550
 interesting parts and we're going 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 start with the compressor that is the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.770
 compressor and green channel is exchanged to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.650
 its servers that takes more attacks 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.829
 to feed after drying after 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.450
 that she has decompressing the actions 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.739
 logical end power after his 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.840
 score 6 2 votes are used in ningbo 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.790
 numbers or here to indicate to 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.830
 regulators of people enjoying the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.260
 in the pressure regulator is going to 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.740
 put to fight up to a level 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.650
 that we will reach 116 of the 137 yves of 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.500
 pressure the future mother of the young Kosovar 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.660
 there is even so thin enough for 220 nor of 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.850
 pressure what is this course of his 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.950
 pressure meeting the regulator of 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.810
 compressors to stop working from 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.240
 this drama of cooling is that it 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.040
 there was biston that it was incumbent 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.770
 continues to push to tie 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.120
 increases go they will put 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.300
 in cooling mode 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.670
 at the same time by the facilitator go there 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.250
 to take will exceed will be in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.280
 neither the army nor any pressures that go to them 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.960
 are going to do a pure on the singer for 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.159
 to remove excess du bist and 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.860
 hands convincing the contributions of 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.740
 increase your dark green coat 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.659
 sporty he will lead he goes into effect 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.670
 in primary school children and our 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:49.299
 secondary visions the lovers 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.220
 primary secondary needs are 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.869
 equipped with unidirectional base this 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.759
 who will come out and where one of them 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.409
 would be secondly that I can not 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.780
 can not go back into the tank 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.149
 same power thing we 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.130
 in second in geneva no understand 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.810
 it is that the assets of the plantations 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.720
 also grow in the streets of a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.819
 but you know the foot pressure 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.470
 in children in food either 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.989
 greater than the pressure in the green 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.250
 in the human reservoir and this for the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.980
 French network is condensed into the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.019
 new wave if the impression is hoping him 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.239
 if the valves have remained closed 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.880
 will we approach them from madaillan 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.829
 6th and have for example so reserved for 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.019
 primary and pressure hasani a 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.500
 house for secondary and 90's 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.850
 pressure supply tank to the game 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.519
 blow into the reasoning 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.290
 secondary he by deduction is 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.989
 capable of a good old that the tank 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.630
 feeding your day is equal to the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.799
 low-end view of the two tanks 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.920
 ok in the loser of the vehicle lying 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.230
 just 80 of an impression in the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.560
 secondary tank and a kid who 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.520
 gives the impression of knowing more 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.590
 a cadre has for him to have 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.420
 feeding what is invented 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.620
 understand by cons is that the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.590
 pressure regulator 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.930
 it is he who knows him who all 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.400
 stop compressor which is activated by 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.849
 two around the big actions 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.580
 so the regulators because we want to know 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.400
 at what pressure against 106.7 arrested 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.739
 operate but theoretically the 2 and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.980
 2 to have a bonus of one of his mandates without 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.690
 ask the same question 6.6 in the world 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.880
 until the end we put on saturday 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.239
 problem 720 that he senses that he has me 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.310
 decorated kitchen usually only 20 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.920
 loss books most regulators 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.950
 will put the harrach system for that 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.680
 the system did not start again 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.540
 its unique patent pumping cycle of 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.519
 time in what is going to be 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.560
 ask is that the forwards documentation 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.680
 after consuming crazy air a 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.720
 braking suspension use 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.819
 against eire today and with what 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.680
 tool this theme is the networks see a 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.959
 intimate video a feed tank 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.260
 sees so from the network sees worse 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.700
 here then yves haupert dollars whose 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.980
 the impressive league for 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.280
 really blessed sequences of luxury berck 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.739
 compressors relying on March 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.269
 to start with it is to fight by 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.010
 deduction is only able to say that the 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.400
 feed tank your toy is 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.419
 equal to the triba rise of the two most 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.419
 beautiful of the two kings
