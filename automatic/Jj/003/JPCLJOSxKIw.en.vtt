00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
the other side and that's exactly what

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.960 
the other side and that's exactly what
happened<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.709> can<00:04:11.829> see<00:04:12.040> I'm<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.519> used<00:04:12.849> my

war machine here to try and get a few
extra<00:04:14.889> kills<00:04:15.280> trying<00:04:15.609> to<00:04:15.760> secure<00:04:16.449> this<00:04:16.599> hard

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
extra kills trying to secure this hard

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.240
