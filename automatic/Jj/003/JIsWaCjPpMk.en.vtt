00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.140
 in the previous videos of compounds 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.800
 binaries we already studied the compounds 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.700
 of hydrogen 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.590
 the compounds of the oxides 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.980
 and this video will serve to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.529
 study them the salts the binary salts 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.910
 which can be metallic and non-metallic 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.560
 and that inside these binary birds 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.560
 are the halogen salts 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.689
 to be the binaries when they are 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.480
 metallic ones have the shape of the metal to the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.660
 left him not metal on the right 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 when they are non-metallic a goal of the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.570
 left and 1 metal on the right 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.880
 they are always named as the combination 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.740
 of a union with education and from the side 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.080
 left is where the song was 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.390
 there is the cation and from the right side up 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.690
 the year then the name of the union in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.280
 termination cures the preposition of and the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.520
 The name of the search is how it is going to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520
 to name 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.479
 for binary salts when we have 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.510
 a metal for example gold gold equipment and 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.750
 sodium what we have to specify is 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.119
 the oxidation number of the metal itself 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.380
 because in this case for example the 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:20.200
 sulfur and phosphorus pure extermination 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.900
 With hard determination we go to your 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.340
 family and its only negative valence 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:31.180
 for example 17 to 10 minus 16 to minus 25 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.420
 a is minus 3 of the 4 at least 4 in this 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.280
 case is the sulfur then you suffer 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.080
 minus 2 and the phosphorus is minus 3 then 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.600
 here with the ending 1 there is no 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.450
 confusion but with metals and you have to 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.310
 specify for example here is gold that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.910
 I'm working with the 1 and here is gold 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.670
 that is working with 3 that then 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.350
 the smallest oxidation number 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.259
 corresponds 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.600
 one bigger the three and this one goes 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.119
 to match the ending bear and this 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.880
 three will correspond the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.160
 determination and co 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.080
 normally for an exam you have 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.230
 right to the periodic table where they are 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.269
 the oxidation numbers 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.760
 this then there should not be any 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.010
 problem this is going to be called sulfur 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.819
 Gold 1 in the stop nomenclature or 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.940
 Traditional sulfurous natural east 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.670
 gold sulfide 3 in the stop system is o 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.950
 sulfur manufactured in the nomenclature 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.470
 traditional and this is sodium phosphorus 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.450
 for sodium you do not have to specify 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.390
 because they are inside the metals that 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.849
 they only have an oxidation number here 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.170
 there is a very useful tablet that tells you that 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.480
 it's valence 1 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.700
 we have alkalis and silver 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.430
 valence 1 and 2 that copper hydrogen 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.410
 an interest only gold valencia 2 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.140
 2 the thirds way means gave 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.260
 valencia is 12-3 nickel cobalt iron 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.030
 chrome manganese but they have more valence 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.859
 2 and 4 lead platinum and tin 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.049
 3 aluminum equivalence that these are 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.060
 the most frequent but as I tell you in 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.829
 your exam to happen to me all the periodic 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.660
 with the association number as these 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.660
 slight of memory and only of understanding 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.370
 for non-metallic ones the most convenient 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.620
 is used in a systematic creature is 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.519
 say indicating the prefixes in this 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.470
 case this 5 is going to be expressed as penta 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:31.890
 phosphorus chloride here this 3 is going to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.470
 express as three nitrogen sulfide 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.530
 we already clarified the subscripts no longer 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.720
 we have to clarify any valence 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.830
 because because we are here giving 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.780
 subscripts that will go in the formula 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.880
 as I say the simplest way in the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.900
 systematic appointment for 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.900
 binary compounds 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.599
 and finally the halogen salts wahlöö 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.440
 ideas are those that have the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.170
 combination of a metal a halogen 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.290
 chlorine as binary social iodine and it 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.110
 they name like those we already saw in the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.470
 wooden name 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.630
 same as the previous ones 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.540
 here we have examples of binary salts 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.280
 first here we have classification already 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.950
 we know they are binary salts but 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.510
 They can be metal metallic and inside 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.730
 of these can be halogen this 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.850
 It is also a halogen or not 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.790
 metal which are two non-metals 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.520
 and we have four examples is marked 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.370
 in red the nomenclature that is more 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.890
 common use with that element that as I already 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.530
 had said is the simplest for the 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.050
 sodium cross because traditional is 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.540
 sodium chloride this chlorine in solís 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.940
 systematic sodium chloride 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.240
 we could say mono sodium chloride 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.840
 but it is not really used for the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.100
 green lead 4 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.700
 we specify for lead let's see 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.470
 the lead the lead works with 2 and 4 the 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.080
 valencia the smallest is 2 the largest 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.600
 4 therefore corresponds 5 to the most 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.840
 big that is cut then here 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.700
 we have the 4 why he explained or with 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.550
 the stock short specific good valence 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.560
 lead bromide 4 and with the systematics 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.290
 we specify the subscripts in this 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:23.500
 case 4 would be tetra lead bromide 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:25.540
 very easy for him for the psc the e3 the 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.450
 simpler would be the systematic 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.480
 specifying this tri as tri chloride 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:35.200
 of phosphorus and the same here would be 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:39.550
 Hexafloride of the simplest without 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:44.710
 But let's see the stock here 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:48.620
 it would be the phosphorus chloride they acquire 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.600
 crude phosphorus errors so correct it 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.750
 phosphor color and here is working 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.500
 with 3 in phosphorus and we have to 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.500
 specify it 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.360
 here the sulfur is working with 6 per 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.120
 that's extensions suffers 6 this system 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.070
 stock for the traditional for the 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.560
 traditional we have to go back to this 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:16.750
 tablita ok from family 5 to him can 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.750
 be three or five the match 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.819
 here we have the match is working 

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:24.149
 with 3 is the richest therefore it goes to 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:28.979
 be a euro matches and here the sulfur 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:31.110
 for your region the 6th to the 64th in this 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.749
 case is the biggest that 6 is going to be 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.080
 That's why we're going in addition, figured 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:40.139
 sulfuric there must be no greater 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.629
 problem you always have to know the 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.300
 three systems however if you have a 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.189
 formula because the easiest thing is to name it 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.679
 in the way that artistic the most 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:52.860
 simple because both three 

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:55.349
 structures are correct with the colony 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.240
 seen this then you can name 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:07:01.810
 these binary salts 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.990
 and in this exercise they are already 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.900
 mixed the binary compounds all 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.630
 of the traditional video asks you this 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.190
 it is here there are others like the formula 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.139
 traditional and they are here 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:19.650
 we can continue there is more 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:22.229
 traditional and this or the next 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.689
 type of exercise in this exercise 9 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:27.419
 I give you some traditional name clog 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:30.479
 systematic and you from that name 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:34.560
 deduce the formula from the formula and 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:36.569
 You take out the other names 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.740
 here are others 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:39.740
 not really the problem 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.860
 there are some more 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.000
 so this is all about the 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.160
 binary compounds 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.160
 and I wish you success in your study
