actually the basic if I don't have this
then<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.949> user<00:00:53.270> that<00:00:54.270> using<00:00:54.690> machine<00:00:56.780> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
then the user that using machine it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.369 
then the user that using machine it
stuck<00:00:58.379> summer<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.750> these<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.020> different

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
stuck summer and these are all different

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.299 
stuck summer and these are all different
colors<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.480> they<00:01:03.480> create<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.309> visualization

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
colors and they create the visualization

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.660 
colors and they create the visualization
of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.510> world<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.189> actually<00:01:08.490> make

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
of the world and they can actually make

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.350 
of the world and they can actually make
your<00:01:08.820> transport<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:10.580> like<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.820> like

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
your transport it's not like just like

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.260 
your transport it's not like just like

you're in the real world site if you die

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
you're in the real world site if you die
you're<00:01:18.000> gone<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.020> ming<00:01:19.229> zi<00:01:19.350> realization

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you're gone this is ming zi realization

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.969 
you're gone this is ming zi realization
as<00:01:20.250> possible<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.259> connections<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
as possible but some connections and I

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.650 

this<00:01:28.730> is<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.510> Redstone<00:01:30.020> stuff<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:32.330> go<00:01:32.480> up

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
this is the Redstone stuff and we go up

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.190 
this is the Redstone stuff and we go up
here<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.050> we<00:01:33.350> get<00:01:33.530> all<00:01:34.460> gates<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.750> stuffing

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
here and we get all gates and stuffing

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.320 
here and we get all gates and stuffing
in<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:37.100> is<00:01:37.220> also<00:01:37.490> something<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.030> i'll<00:01:38.090> show

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
in here is also something so i'll show

getting<00:02:33.980> onto<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.489> real<00:02:34.670> machine<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.330> we

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
getting onto the real machine and we

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.559 
getting onto the real machine and we
shining<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.410> all

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569

that can take really so no going to show
you<00:02:48.489> what's<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:55.409> Debrett<00:02:56.409> I<00:02:56.499> don't<00:02:56.680> do<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:57.040> or

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
you what's in Debrett I don't do that or

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.910 
you what's in Debrett I don't do that or
it'll<00:02:57.329> still<00:02:58.329> it<00:02:58.389> exploits<00:02:58.840> because<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.739> got<00:02:59.889> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
it'll still it exploits because I got a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:46.740 
it'll still it exploits because I got a
