when<00:00:01.620> doing<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.949> structural<00:00:02.399> engineering

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
when doing the structural engineering

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.160 
when doing the structural engineering
for<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.060> building<00:00:03.389> you're<00:00:03.540> supposed<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.959> treat

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
for a building you're supposed to treat

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.110 
for a building you're supposed to treat
every<00:00:04.589> knot<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.190> board<00:00:05.430> as<00:00:05.640> if<00:00:05.879> it<00:00:06.000> were<00:00:06.089> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
every knot and a board as if it were a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.509 
every knot and a board as if it were a
hole<00:00:06.420> even<00:00:07.290> if<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.529> wood<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.830> still<00:00:08.040> there<00:00:08.309> so

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
hole even if the wood is still there so

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.379 
hole even if the wood is still there so
if<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.150> had<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> board<00:00:09.570> like<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:11.240> lot<00:00:12.240> of

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
if you had a board like this a lot of

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.730 
if you had a board like this a lot of
knots<00:00:12.540> running<00:00:12.900> through<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.500> wouldn't

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
knots running through it it wouldn't

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.730 
knots running through it it wouldn't
make<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> very<00:00:14.099> good<00:00:14.460> floor<00:00:14.790> joist<00:00:15.740> people

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
make for a very good floor joist people

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.050 
make for a very good floor joist people
might<00:00:16.890> question<00:00:17.100> well<00:00:17.460> why<00:00:17.580> would<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> treat

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
might question well why would you treat

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060 
might question well why would you treat
that<00:00:18.090> as<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> hole<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.650> board<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.010> very

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that as a hole on this board it's very

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.740 
that as a hole on this board it's very
clear<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.910> actually<00:00:21.060> just<00:00:21.330> pop<00:00:21.539> these

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
clear you can actually just pop these

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.990 
clear you can actually just pop these
knots<00:00:21.990> straight<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.310> even<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.730> can't

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
knots straight out and even if you can't

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
knots straight out and even if you can't
on<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> newer<00:00:24.449> board<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:27.260> as<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.560> board

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
on a newer board the as the board

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.560 
on a newer board the as the board
shrinks<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.250> dries<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.150> knots<00:00:30.359> will

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
shrinks and dries the knots will

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
shrinks and dries the knots will
eventually<00:00:30.960> come<00:00:31.140> loose<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.309> see

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
eventually come loose so you can see

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130 
eventually come loose so you can see
basically<00:00:32.790> every<00:00:33.149> knot<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.630> board<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
basically every knot on this board I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.340 
basically every knot on this board I
could<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:35.460> pop<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.110> wouldn't

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
could just just pop out so it wouldn't

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.630 
could just just pop out so it wouldn't
make<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:38.010> floor<00:00:38.250> joist<00:00:38.489> or

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
make very very good floor joist or

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610 
make very very good floor joist or
anything<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:39.059> actually<00:00:39.270> spanning<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
anything that's actually spanning like a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
anything that's actually spanning like a
beam<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.670> gonna<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.180> just

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
beam what I'm gonna do I'm gonna just

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.510 
beam what I'm gonna do I'm gonna just
use<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.840> board<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> floor<00:00:43.559> board<00:00:43.800> probably

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
use this board as a floor board probably

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.920 
use this board as a floor board probably
apply<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:45.000> bit<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.300> glue<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.840> we

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
apply a little bit of glue so that we

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
apply a little bit of glue so that we
don't<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.379> many<00:00:46.500> large<00:00:46.800> holes<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
don't have so many large holes in the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.910 
don't have so many large holes in the
floor<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.110> this<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:49.260> work<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.530> fine<00:00:49.860> for

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
floor and this will work just fine for

00:00:49.920 --> 00:02:03.670 
floor and this will work just fine for
that<00:00:50.160> purpose

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.540 

there<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.700> go<00:02:04.850> that's<00:02:05.120> a<00:02:05.740> pretty<00:02:06.740> nice<00:02:06.950> kiting

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
there you go that's a pretty nice kiting

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.310 
there you go that's a pretty nice kiting
tight-fitting<00:02:08.360> joinery<00:02:08.750> given<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.200> it's

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
tight-fitting joinery given that it's

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.850 
tight-fitting joinery given that it's

about a proper workstation pretty

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.280 
about a proper workstation pretty
pleased<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.920> result<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
pleased with the result there and the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.560 
pleased with the result there and the
same<00:02:18.500> thing<00:02:18.560> over<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.280> side<00:02:19.570> just

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
same thing over on this side just

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.390 
same thing over on this side just
notching<00:02:20.990> around<00:02:21.320> having<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:22.040> some<00:02:22.250> rip

cuts<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.790> those<00:02:22.970> boards<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:24.010> think<00:02:25.010> it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
cuts on those boards but I think it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.640 
cuts on those boards but I think it
looks<00:02:25.220> really<00:02:25.430> nice<00:02:26.170> little<00:02:27.170> old-world

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
looks really nice little old-world

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 
looks really nice little old-world
craftsmanship<00:02:28.430> keep<00:02:29.270> talking<00:02:29.630> about<00:02:29.810> of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
craftsmanship keep talking about of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.720 
craftsmanship keep talking about of
course<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.710> was<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.860> true<00:02:31.010> craftsman<00:02:31.550> I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
course if I was the true craftsman I

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.960 
course if I was the true craftsman I
wouldn't<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:33.130> cut<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.280> notch<00:02:34.460> for<00:02:34.790> this

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
wouldn't have cut the notch for this

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.290 
wouldn't have cut the notch for this
piece<00:02:35.210> on<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> wrong<00:02:35.720> side<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.280> did<00:02:37.910> so

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
piece on the wrong side but I did so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.080 
piece on the wrong side but I did so
after<00:02:39.130> unfortunately<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.160> had<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.490> cut<00:02:41.000> that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
after unfortunately I had to cut that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.790 
after unfortunately I had to cut that
piece<00:02:41.270> off<00:02:41.450> back<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.900> next<00:02:42.170> joist<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.770> a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
piece off back to the next joist and a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.410 
piece off back to the next joist and a
house<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.459> infill<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> little<00:02:44.300> bit

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
house just have to infill a little bit

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.460 
house just have to infill a little bit
there

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
there

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.150 
there
in<00:02:45.800> any<00:02:45.980> case<00:02:46.130> yeah<00:02:47.410> he's<00:02:48.410> almost<00:02:48.709> done<00:02:48.920> all

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
those gaps are being filled up the only

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.900 
those gaps are being filled up the only
thing<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.530> do<00:02:51.770> is<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.490> very<00:02:52.520> last
