00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.800
 hi photo friends news in this 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.280
 I have the pleasure to show you the 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.029
 panasonic fz 200 that comes to be the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.890
 150 recipe replacement a camera 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.760
 very dear to us and for the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.900
 the general public is basically the fct 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.240
 150 with a very high quality lens 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.540
 which is what caught our attention 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.540
 only the leica but it brings an opening 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.480
 of 2.8 which means that it is very 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.280
 bright and very good for situations of 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.809
 little light we will see that compared 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.769
 fz 60 there is not much difference in sizes 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.769
 a little bigger 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.410
 the screen is also almost the same 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.630
 size except that the f z200 has this 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.600
 very loved flip-up monitor and very 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.220
 searched for the filmmakers the people who 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.550
 he likes to make formations or to take 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.800
 photographs at very difficult angles 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.200
 you will find that this camera is 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.930
 basically what they are looking for is a 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.030
 bridge camera that is bridge that is not 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.730
 SLR means you do not have lenses 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.790
 interchangeable as we all already know in 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.310
 measurement of 35 millimeters since the sensor 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.600
 is a reduced sensor would come to be from 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.870
 25 millimeters to 600 very interesting in 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 this now let's see the zoom 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.590
 there is 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.090
 we see that it moves through a very 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.549
 significant also comes in the box 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.520
 along with the accessories a parasol a 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.399
 parasol in petah what 'us or from 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.189
 our point of view is cute meets 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.920
 its function but it is not well finished anymore 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.970
 that is is easily put but also 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.540
 You can go out 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:10.280
 as they saw it is very easy to lose 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.710
 the menu is exactly like the menus 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.880
 all our old cameras 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.030
 panasonic parasol and 150 47 and the new 60 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.950
 very easy to handle with three main 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 options options main very 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.460
 Interesting 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.970
 what is striking about this 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.860
 camera apart from its price depending 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.580
 of the country where they are round of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.620
 400 to 600 dollars which one would say 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.450
 good with that price to buy one of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.000
 three thousand one of three thousand one hundred nikon 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.420
 but here we get here we get a 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.200
 Optical lake all made in japan 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.990
 with a maximum opening of 2.8 very 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.240
 bright very interesting 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.670
 It is true that the sensor is small but 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.150
 with only 12 megapixels we are going to 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 get a very interesting quality already 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.440
 that has a venus engine processor that 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.810
 It also allows you to shoot up to 12 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.180
 frames per second 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.849
 it seems that panasonic has understood the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.459
 raw reality the smaller the 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.020
 sensor its quality improves if it has less 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.880
 pixels the fct 62 has 16 points 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.980
 megapixels or fz 60 which is the one 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.650
 we had shown that it is the same varies 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.030
 according to whether for europe or for america axis 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.030
 z 60 or 62 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.900
 also the opening of the consisted in addition 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.370
 to be constant throughout the range of 2.8 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.560
 You can also photograph in format 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.650
 raw has a dedicated button for 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.350
 filming mode the power button 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.990
 It is very accessible here to the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.900
 right and the psuv can not only be done 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.390
 with 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.519
 the normal button with which they bring all the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.519
 camera but also from the side 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.370
 for those who want to focus with a 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.739
 hand and shoot with the other we have the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.129
 normal manual focus options 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.349
 autofocus and macro and also 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.409
 for a very dedicated button very 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.670
 interesting to block the approach 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.419
 it means that when we focus a 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.789
 model a model a product 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:27.040
 we press the button and we can move the 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:28.870
 camera without losing focus a rotor 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.510
 on the right hand to change the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.009
 speed or he did whatever it is that 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.370
 we are photographing 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:41.520
 and those are basically the first 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.110
 take test of this camera very soon 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.449
 we will be providing them with pictures taken 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.350
 by our photographer ernesto in the 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.479
 field to see the real quality of this 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.080
 camera but first instance they 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.330
 we show what is physically the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.130
 plastic product but with very good 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.130
 finished the glass looks that is very 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.610
 well he also has a flash that is a 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.010
 little flash an internal flash that in 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.949
 some moments of very dark places 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.680
 we can use the entrance for the 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:21.479
 external microphone we also have a 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:26.670
 entry for mini hdmi and the entry of 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:29.430
 tv and digital audio the input of 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.890
 the sd memory that we recommend for 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.240
 affirmations in full hd class 10 or class 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:39.900
 6 and the battery that lasts 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:43.350
 interesting since the photographs do not 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.440
 exceed 15 or 20 megabytes because they are 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.740
 of 10 and 12 megapixels of 12.1 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.380
 exactly they are not very heavy and we can 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.870
 photographing 400 to 600 photos with one 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.840
 8gb card very interesting for a 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.850
 product of this range and follow us in photo 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.790
 dotcom news because we will be 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:07.550
 publishing current images of this 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.550
 product taken by our partner
