00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hey people here we are back to 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.280
 Warlords as a coach look better today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.410
 we look at the frosty and frost changes 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.790
 they did 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 I would say we drive in the beginning 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.529
 the patches to which you have changed 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.070
 and it starts 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.920
 the imports are really strong 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.350
 frost what does it give us ten percent 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.320
 more strength and no more peace 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.080
 No further comment on the rink 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 Fouchard now makes ten percent 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.149
 less damage means we are at 30 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.149
 percent less damage we have the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.629
 Space is the chance that ours 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.379
 next post rock and pop literature 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.640
 critical even now there is more with it 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.579
 we have it here like all holly 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.219
 20 percent more 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.600
 then we have the improve the fridge 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.360
 what happens when we have a day trip 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 it automatically gets change of super 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.110
 strong pvp change of 20 more with and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 the hammer now hold on to the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 improved means reese gives us a range 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.390
 of 20 meters 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.799
 I considered the steady blues by 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.799
 something and suddenly on french fries 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.439

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.350
 now the damage hold tight 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.189
 So everything will be awesome to throw everything 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.740
 What we have 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:38.299
 trickett extra cans and white go 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.299
 to disturb properly let's go 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.970
 and boom 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.370
 frosty is going to bother me prophesying 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.800
 I 'm looking forward to it and hope we see 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.500
