the<00:01:25.830> coconut<00:01:26.310> milk<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:27.080> can<00:01:28.080> use<00:01:28.140> corn<00:01:28.590> starch

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the coconut milk you can use corn starch

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.440 
the coconut milk you can use corn starch
instead<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.430> can't<00:01:29.640> find<00:01:29.820> tapioca<00:01:30.390> starch

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
instead if you can't find tapioca starch

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
instead if you can't find tapioca starch
but<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.140> Asian<00:01:31.500> cuisine<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:32.070> tend<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> use

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
but in Asian cuisine we tend to use

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310 
but in Asian cuisine we tend to use
tapioca<00:01:33.090> starch<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
tapioca starch because that's what is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760 
tapioca starch because that's what is
available<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.220> us<00:01:35.250> now<00:01:36.290> keep<00:01:37.290> cooking<00:01:37.680> until
