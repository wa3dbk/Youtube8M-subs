00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.910 
Depot it's very light plastic with
little<00:02:59.630> half<00:03:00.110> inch<00:03:00.380> square<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.530> run<00:03:03.769> it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
little half inch square and I run it

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.509 
little half inch square and I run it
across<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.250> top<00:03:06.100> like<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:08.269> little<00:03:09.310> tough<00:03:10.310> on

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
across the top like so a little tough on

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:20.360 
across the top like so a little tough on
the<00:03:10.700> other<00:03:10.850> side<00:03:11.060> up<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.209> my<00:03:11.540> 2x4<00:03:16.030> whoops

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.740 

so<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.430> hook<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.760> across<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:23.019> barely<00:03:23.349> see<00:03:23.590> it

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
so I hook it across and barely see it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.509 
so I hook it across and barely see it
and<00:03:25.750> then<00:03:26.260> I'll<00:03:26.470> put<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:26.830> little<00:03:27.129> bar<00:03:27.340> on

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
and then I'll put this little bar on

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.410 
and then I'll put this little bar on
here<00:03:27.879> I<00:03:28.739> first<00:03:29.739> started<00:03:30.250> with<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.549> 3/4<00:03:31.239> inch

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
here I first started with this 3/4 inch

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.080 
here I first started with this 3/4 inch
plastic<00:03:31.750> pipe<00:03:32.370> thinking<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:33.459> they<00:03:33.580> landed<00:03:33.970> on

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
plastic pipe thinking if they landed on

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.819 
plastic pipe thinking if they landed on
here<00:03:34.299> would<00:03:34.420> spin<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.079> I<00:03:35.200> would<00:03:35.349> scare<00:03:35.650> them

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
here would spin and I would scare them

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:36.899 
here would spin and I would scare them
but<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.129> didn't<00:03:36.340> do<00:03:36.430> anything

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
but it didn't do anything

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.649 
but it didn't do anything
now<00:03:37.810> it's<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.049> different<00:03:38.409> decoration<00:03:39.040> but<00:03:39.659> this

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
now it's a different decoration but this

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.190 
now it's a different decoration but this
plastic<00:03:41.170> goes<00:03:41.349> up<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.769> about<00:03:41.920> here<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:44.079> they

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
plastic goes up to about here so they

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.479 
plastic goes up to about here so they
can't<00:03:44.470> jump<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.860> high

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
can't jump that high

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.280 
can't jump that high
now<00:03:45.879> they<00:03:46.060> don't<00:03:46.150> cook<00:03:46.360> them<00:03:46.629> can't<00:03:46.900> get<00:03:47.079> in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
now they don't cook them can't get in

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.160 
now they don't cook them can't get in
their<00:03:47.470> food<00:03:47.709> area<00:03:48.599> right<00:03:49.599> my<00:03:49.750> phone<00:03:49.959> right

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170
