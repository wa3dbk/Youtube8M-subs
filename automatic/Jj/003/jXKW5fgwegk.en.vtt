00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
nothing other than that actually we

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.099 
nothing other than that actually we
realized<00:02:52.700> later<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:53.060> Brett<00:02:53.420> left<00:02:53.629> a<00:02:53.780> handful

of<00:02:54.200> things<00:02:54.319> off<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.890> list<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.970> camera<00:02:56.329> a

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
of things off that list like a camera a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.580 
of things off that list like a camera a
way<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.379> purify<00:02:57.620> water<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.909> headlamp<00:02:59.590> but

way to purify water and a headlamp but

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.619 
way to purify water and a headlamp but
the<00:03:01.099> larger<00:03:01.489> point<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.269> don't<00:03:02.450> want

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
the larger point is that you don't want

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.970 
the larger point is that you don't want
to<00:03:02.659> take<00:03:02.840> anything<00:03:03.109> that<00:03:03.349> isn't<00:03:03.530> essential

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
to take anything that isn't essential

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.960 
to take anything that isn't essential
and<00:03:04.430> any<00:03:05.359> luxury<00:03:06.109> items<00:03:06.530> do<00:03:07.040> take<00:03:07.489> should<00:03:07.819> be

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
and any luxury items do take should be

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.110 
and any luxury items do take should be
chosen<00:03:08.390> wisely<00:03:08.599> on<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:10.190> other<00:03:10.340> hand<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.909> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
starving I wasn't starving cuz I was

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.330 
starving I wasn't starving cuz I was
eating<00:04:07.370> every<00:04:07.549> day<00:04:07.669> but<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:08.769> do<00:04:09.769> think<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.310> I

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
eating every day but I do think that I

eating every day but I do think that I
have<00:04:10.549> a<00:04:10.730> slight<00:04:11.349> insight<00:04:12.349> into<00:04:12.620> what<00:04:13.099> it<00:04:13.400> would

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
have a slight insight into what it would

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.150 
have a slight insight into what it would
be<00:04:13.940> like<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.359> live<00:04:14.569> in<00:04:14.739> hunger<00:04:15.739> which<00:04:15.980> is<00:04:16.130> a

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
be like to live in hunger which is a

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.029 
be like to live in hunger which is a
very<00:04:16.609> uncommon<00:04:16.849> feeling<00:04:17.530> how<00:04:18.530> did<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:18.799> feel

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
very uncommon feeling how did it feel

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.469 
very uncommon feeling how did it feel
when<00:04:19.099> you<00:04:19.430> almost<00:04:19.669> killed<00:04:20.000> your<00:04:20.150> best<00:04:20.299> friend

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
when you almost killed your best friend

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.190 
when you almost killed your best friend
it<00:04:21.079> felt<00:04:21.469> fine

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
it felt fine

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.690 
it felt fine
actually<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.690> was<00:04:24.690> not<00:04:25.110> understanding<00:04:26.100> like

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
actually I was not understanding like

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.080 
actually I was not understanding like
dude<00:04:27.200> all<00:04:28.200> kidding<00:04:28.710> aside<00:04:28.800> it's<00:04:29.370> not<00:04:29.700> easy<00:04:29.910> to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090
