about ten colors available however I

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.100 
about ten colors available however I
tried<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.970> pick<00:01:22.119> white<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.420> they<00:01:22.780> said<00:01:22.960> that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
tried to pick white and they said that

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.570 
tried to pick white and they said that
wasn't<00:01:23.259> available<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.009> I<00:01:24.070> ended<00:01:24.340> up<00:01:24.369> going

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
wasn't available and I ended up going

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.300 
wasn't available and I ended up going
with<00:01:25.170> pebble<00:01:26.170> gray<00:01:26.440> which<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.770> as<00:01:27.070> close<00:01:27.130> to

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
with pebble gray which is as close to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.270 
with pebble gray which is as close to
white<00:01:27.640> as<00:01:27.820> I<00:01:27.910> could<00:01:28.090> get<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.229> depends<00:01:29.770> I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
white as I could get so it depends I

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.850 
white as I could get so it depends I
know<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.720> colors<00:01:32.050> seem<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.320> change<00:01:32.649> on<00:01:32.830> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
know that the colors seem to change on a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.290 
know that the colors seem to change on a
regular<00:01:32.950> basis<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.820> might<00:01:33.940> want<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.149> check

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
regular basis so you might want to check

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.790 
regular basis so you might want to check
with<00:01:34.360> your<00:01:34.540> dealer<00:01:34.869> on<00:01:35.020> that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.790 

okay<00:01:39.980> so<00:01:40.250> if<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.400> done<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:41.140> GoPro<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.170> my<00:01:42.380> head<00:01:42.620> we

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
okay so if I done a GoPro on my head we

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.030 
okay so if I done a GoPro on my head we
can<00:01:42.980> go<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.370> take<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.550> look<00:01:43.820> at<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:45.040> deviated

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
can go and take a look at the deviated

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.030 
can go and take a look at the deviated
stitching<00:01:46.430> options<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:46.970> put<00:01:47.150> in<00:01:47.240> my<00:01:47.390> car<00:01:47.690> I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
stitching options that I put in my car I

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.990 
stitching options that I put in my car I
guess<00:01:49.040> I'll<00:01:49.160> start<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.490> what<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:49.880> consider

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
guess I'll start with what I consider

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.240 
guess I'll start with what I consider
the<00:01:50.450> most<00:01:50.540> important<00:01:51.230> of<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.650> three<00:01:51.680> major

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the most important of the three major

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.980 
the most important of the three major
areas<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:53.720> know<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> three<00:01:54.200> being<00:01:54.410> seats<00:01:55.990> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
areas you know the three being seats the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.370 
areas you know the three being seats the
door<00:01:57.200> panels<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.400> rest<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.970> trim<00:01:59.380> the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
door panels and the rest of the trim the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.860 
door panels and the rest of the trim the
seats<00:02:01.120> probably<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.210> most<00:02:02.330> important<00:02:02.840> one

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
seats probably the most important one

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.730 
seats probably the most important one
and<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.560> seats<00:02:04.690> are<00:02:05.690> known<00:02:05.930> as<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.230> front<00:02:06.590> and

the sides and the stitching down here so

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.580 
the sides and the stitching down here so
that's<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.560> nice<00:02:33.709> detail<00:02:34.959> if<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.260> into<00:02:36.470> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
that's a nice detail if I get into the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.540 
that's a nice detail if I get into the
car<00:02:36.800> now

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.990 

we're<00:02:40.390> gonna<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.720> look<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> door

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
we're gonna have a look at the door

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
we're gonna have a look at the door
panels<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.440> door<00:02:47.620> panels<00:02:48.780> appear<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:49.990> a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
panels the door panels appear to be a

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.320 
panels the door panels appear to be a
bit<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.320> bargain<00:02:50.560> at<00:02:50.800> first<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:51.330> each

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
bit of a bargain at first because each

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.060 
bit of a bargain at first because each
item<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.050> around<00:02:53.380> three<00:02:53.680> hundred<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.010> ninety

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
item is around three hundred and ninety

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.060 
item is around three hundred and ninety
dollars<00:02:54.460> but<00:02:55.330> once<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.440> get<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.710> all<00:02:56.860> done

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
dollars but once you get it all done

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.540 
dollars but once you get it all done
it's<00:02:57.520> over<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:57.910> thousand<00:02:58.360> dollars<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.960> so<00:02:59.920> it's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
it's over a thousand dollars and so it's

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.360 
it's over a thousand dollars and so it's
broken<00:03:00.790> down<00:03:01.120> into<00:03:01.230> four<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.260> think<00:03:02.500> you've<00:03:03.190> got

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
broken down into four I think you've got

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.590 
broken down into four I think you've got
the<00:03:03.810> center<00:03:04.810> panel<00:03:05.020> which<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:07.090> stitching

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
the center panel which is this stitching

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.720 
the center panel which is this stitching
here<00:03:08.160> for<00:03:09.160> three<00:03:09.340> hundred<00:03:09.460> and<00:03:09.670> ninety

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
here for three hundred and ninety

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.350 
here for three hundred and ninety
dollars<00:03:11.340> then<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> upper<00:03:13.120> door

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
dollars then you have the upper door

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.610 
dollars then you have the upper door
trim<00:03:14.580> up<00:03:15.580> here<00:03:16.230> three<00:03:17.230> hundred<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.560> ninety

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
trim up here three hundred and ninety

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.070 
trim up here three hundred and ninety
dollars<00:03:18.360> then<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.390> stitching<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:19.990> the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
dollars then the stitching on the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.260 
dollars then the stitching on the
armrest<00:03:20.710> which<00:03:21.280> for<00:03:21.460> some<00:03:21.610> reason<00:03:21.640> is<00:03:22.090> only

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
armrest which for some reason is only

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.660 
armrest which for some reason is only
three<00:03:22.810> hundred<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.200> ten<00:03:23.500> which<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.460> bit

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
three hundred and ten which is this bit

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.030 
three hundred and ten which is this bit
here<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:24.910> guess<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.360> little<00:03:25.480> shorter<00:03:25.930> but<00:03:26.860> then

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
here I guess a little shorter but then

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.920 
here I guess a little shorter but then
you<00:03:27.160> get<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.430> door<00:03:27.700> handles<00:03:28.210> which<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.750> back

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
you get the door handles which is back

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.810 
you get the door handles which is back
up<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.140> 390<00:03:30.480> which<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:31.750> bit<00:03:31.990> here<00:03:32.460> so<00:03:33.460> I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
up to 390 which is this bit here so I

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.630 
up to 390 which is this bit here so I
got<00:03:34.480> all<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.780> them<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.950> think<00:03:36.460> it<00:03:36.550> looks

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
got all of them and I think it looks

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.820 
got all of them and I think it looks
great<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:39.390> guess<00:03:40.390> if<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.750> dropped<00:03:41.350> one<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.740> them

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
great I guess if you dropped one of them

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.260 
great I guess if you dropped one of them
you<00:03:41.980> wouldn't<00:03:42.130> really<00:03:42.370> notice<00:03:42.640> but<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.030> think

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
you wouldn't really notice but I think

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.870 
you wouldn't really notice but I think
it<00:03:43.330> would<00:03:43.450> look<00:03:43.480> odd<00:03:43.840> if<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:44.230> took<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.070> the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
it would look odd if you took the the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.170 
it would look odd if you took the the
armrest<00:03:46.330> but<00:03:46.510> not<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.780> door<00:03:46.960> handle<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:48.220> it

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
armrest but not the door handle and it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.940 
armrest but not the door handle and it
would<00:03:49.300> also<00:03:49.420> look<00:03:49.690> odd<00:03:50.140> if<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.530> didn't<00:03:50.800> get

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
would also look odd if you didn't get

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.310 
would also look odd if you didn't get
the<00:03:51.070> rest<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.490> as<00:03:51.550> well<00:03:51.760> which<00:03:52.120> what<00:03:53.020> I<00:03:53.050> mean

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
the rest of it as well which what I mean

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.400 
the rest of it as well which what I mean
is<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.580> rear<00:03:55.120> side<00:03:55.480> panel<00:03:55.990> this<00:03:56.200> bit

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
is that the rear side panel this bit

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.010 
is that the rear side panel this bit
here<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:57.700> stitching<00:03:58.090> continues<00:03:58.630> around

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
here so the stitching continues around

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.170 
here so the stitching continues around
and<00:03:59.350> then<00:04:00.040> if<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.310> doesn't<00:04:00.610> get<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:01.000> course

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
and then if you doesn't get of course

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.920 
and then if you doesn't get of course
the<00:04:02.020> dashboard<00:04:02.560> which<00:04:02.710> is<00:04:02.740> also<00:04:03.120> $190<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
the dashboard which is also $190 so the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.050 
the dashboard which is also $190 so the
stitching<00:04:05.350> runs<00:04:05.530> all<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:05.980> way<00:04:06.250> around<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
stitching runs all the way around the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.120 
stitching runs all the way around the
entire<00:04:07.360> car<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:13.540> other<00:04:13.800> area<00:04:14.800> that<00:04:14.830> I<00:04:14.980> got

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
entire car the other area that I got

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.050 
entire car the other area that I got
stitching<00:04:15.520> is<00:04:15.700> this<00:04:16.770> Center<00:04:17.770> tunnel<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
stitching is this Center tunnel the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.200 
stitching is this Center tunnel the
center<00:04:19.359> tunnel<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:19.900> an<00:04:20.350> expensive<00:04:20.950> one<00:04:21.210> it's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
center tunnel is an expensive one it's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.630 
center tunnel is an expensive one it's
eleven<00:04:22.600> hundred<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:22.930> ninety<00:04:23.170> dollars<00:04:23.640> plus

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
eleven hundred and ninety dollars plus

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.200 
eleven hundred and ninety dollars plus
you<00:04:24.790> also<00:04:24.970> have<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.390> add<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.990> $80.00

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
you also have to add a $80.00

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.840 
you also have to add a $80.00
daeviated<00:04:28.210> stitching<00:04:28.780> X<00:04:29.230> H<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:30.280> something<00:04:30.610> or

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
daeviated stitching X H is something or

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.540 
daeviated stitching X H is something or
other<00:04:31.050> which<00:04:32.050> specifies<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:32.920> color<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
other which specifies the color of the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.910 
other which specifies the color of the
stitching<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.480> guess<00:04:35.170> it's<00:04:35.500> just<00:04:35.560> over

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
stitching so I guess it's just over

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.800 
stitching so I guess it's just over
twelve<00:04:36.130> hundred<00:04:36.280> dollars<00:04:36.670> but<00:04:36.880> for<00:04:37.630> twelve

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
twelve hundred dollars but for twelve

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.760 
twelve hundred dollars but for twelve
hundred<00:04:37.930> dollars<00:04:38.200> for<00:04:38.320> that<00:04:38.380> twelve<00:04:38.650> hundred

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
hundred dollars for that twelve hundred

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.240 
hundred dollars for that twelve hundred
dollars<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.190> get<00:04:39.310> this<00:04:40.500> center<00:04:41.500> console

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
dollars you get this center console

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.890 
dollars you get this center console
upgraded<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.090> soft<00:04:43.330> leather<00:04:43.540> that<00:04:43.720> you

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
upgraded to the soft leather that you

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.200 
upgraded to the soft leather that you
get<00:04:44.200> on<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.440> seats<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:45.460> get<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.730> stitching

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
get on the seats you get the stitching

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.350 
get on the seats you get the stitching
around<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:47.440> seat<00:04:47.680> belt<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:49.030> stitching

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
around the seat belt and the stitching

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.090 
around the seat belt and the stitching
up<00:04:49.479> here<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.870> adds<00:04:50.260> stitching<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.979> this

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
up here and adds stitching to this

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.220 
up here and adds stitching to this
center<00:04:51.729> console<00:04:52.150> as<00:04:52.330> well

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
center console as well

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.830 
center console as well
so<00:04:53.350> overall<00:04:53.680> it's<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:53.980> nice<00:04:54.130> package<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.720> only

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
so overall it's a nice package the only

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.340 
so overall it's a nice package the only
stitching<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:56.320> didn't<00:04:56.710> get<00:04:56.920> was<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:58.350> stitching

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
stitching I didn't get was the stitching

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.170 
stitching I didn't get was the stitching
around<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.770> steering<00:05:00.010> wheel<00:05:00.280> which<00:05:00.820> has<00:05:01.030> also

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
around the steering wheel which has also

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.350 
around the steering wheel which has also
$1,100<00:05:02.170> and<00:05:02.830> in<00:05:03.160> hindsight<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.880> guess<00:05:04.120> since

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
$1,100 and in hindsight I guess since

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.730 
$1,100 and in hindsight I guess since
I've<00:05:04.510> spent<00:05:04.780> all<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:04.990> money<00:05:05.050> on<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.620> other

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
I've spent all this money on the other

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.990 
I've spent all this money on the other
stitching<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.280> probably<00:05:06.490> should<00:05:06.700> have<00:05:06.790> got<00:05:06.910> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
stitching I probably should have got the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.760 
stitching I probably should have got the
steering<00:05:07.240> wheel<00:05:07.450> but<00:05:08.020> at<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.200> time<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.470> was

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
steering wheel but at the time I was

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.820 
steering wheel but at the time I was
worried<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.160> I<00:05:10.020> was<00:05:11.020> overdoing<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.680> on<00:05:11.770> the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
worried that I was overdoing it on the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.680 
worried that I was overdoing it on the
stitching<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.550> may<00:05:12.670> look<00:05:12.850> too<00:05:13.240> much<00:05:13.420> but

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
stitching and it may look too much but

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.870 
stitching and it may look too much but
I've<00:05:13.930> seen<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.530> now<00:05:14.560> on<00:05:15.340> some<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.670> the<00:05:15.730> other

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
I've seen it now on some of the other

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.280 
I've seen it now on some of the other
cars<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.450> it<00:05:16.510> does<00:05:16.690> look<00:05:16.810> great

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
cars and it does look great

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.020 
cars and it does look great
but<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:17.860> don't<00:05:18.100> really<00:05:18.190> miss<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.670> love<00:05:18.850> the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030

really gives a personal touch to give

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.720 
really gives a personal touch to give
you<00:06:35.740> an<00:06:35.830> idea<00:06:35.920> of<00:06:36.160> what<00:06:36.280> the<00:06:36.370> colored

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
you an idea of what the colored

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.040
