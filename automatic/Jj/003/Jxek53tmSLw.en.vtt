00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.960
 he welcome to my next video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.510
 name the previous video that is again 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.190
 very well received and thank you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.190
 for your beautiful and sweet reactions 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.490
 what i want to tell today want today 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.230
 I tell some things I'm so 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.359
 not with the whiteboard going but 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 I have something very nice July 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.720
 I've decided on things for the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.910
 movies you 've seen so far 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.519
 and those are the two that have two 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 movies to open a youtube channel 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.590
 and those movies to go on youtube 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.390
 so that you can also download the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.550
 can share videos and even better 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 because some people can view that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.710
 can unfortunately not see the videos 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.960
 because they cannot be seen on the ipad 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.489
 or the iphone 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.590
 second thing of course I also had mouth 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.120
 and on average they have on my 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
 facebook put huh 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.960
 is then I would really like to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 to meet you all in real life 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.559
 and him i will have a date soon 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.780
 punctures 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.589
 that may be sometime in March 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.409
 early April and my preference goes out 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.439
 a Saturday afternoon the times from one to 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.740
 five and most likely that will be in 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.830
 environment of utrecht are just that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.830
 that will follow later in my previous video 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.430
 I explained and showed you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.650
 was what she said but just effect it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.750
 of your thoughts 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.270
 and i have a time ago i have one 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 done a test once with a trip 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.439
 grains trip coaches in three 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.840
 different pots and at the scary 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.009
 port you that we just have 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.470
 completely ignored 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.479
 so actually did nothing with it the second 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
 jar there with my very sweet words 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 said against and the third jar 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.930
 we are going to be incredibly mean 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.869
 do well i want to take a whole lot 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.600
 in those video images because I have them 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.030
 also taken step by step and thus 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.460
 I prove to you and maybe also 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 change your videos 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.750
 see 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.130
 prove that I was thinking or in it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.289
 anyway be do with 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.850
 and this case one with rice so go with it 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.850
 to video then it shows you 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.750
 this is the second day and we are going again 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:28.470
 is ugly and the jar 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.470
 yes it stinks from your mouth 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.590
 I hate yes yes and it is very ugly 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.030
 no go nice yes you can also see it 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.250
 little pot 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.180
 something other than the other jar is true 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.180
 we are going now 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.750
 this 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.680
 the nicest game then we are sweet against 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.950
 to do 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.430
 that looks slightly different and we go 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.540
 now 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.299
 do you love I hunt you are the state 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.909
 the very most very dear direct them 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.260
 pretty bad 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.689
 and then we have a third jar 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.150
 but we can't do that anymore because 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.569
 we must ignore them and we will only see them 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.829
 in 28 days we will go in two days 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.700
 filming again 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.700
 bye bye dear jar 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.700
 this is the better game 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.049
 let's see what the other jars 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.239
 do it soon 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.849
 the 30-day experiment is over 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.159
 and we will now put all the pots together 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.750
 start collecting to see what they are 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.620
 done exactly 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.620

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.439

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.620
 behind that you actually do pretty well 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.359
 be ugly 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.049
 well people here you see the result 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.239
 30 days ugly stupid to someone and this 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.769
 we also go next to the other one 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.769
 putting you going pity potty 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.430
 well this is what we have 30 days 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.400
 have long been ignored 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.410
 we didn't look back at all 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.790
 did not pay attention to anything said 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.959
 no sweet words no ugly 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.140
 words 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.200
 just nothing at all he also sees this 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.800
 not really nice but good this 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.230
 little pot 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.230
 also comes you come 9 potty 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.240
 well we have close 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.610
 three dots next to each other and you see the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.750
 clearly the result between the sweet 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.180
 little pot 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.770
 between the ugly stupid jar and against one 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.390
 g report 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.190
 we will zoom in briefly from above 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.410
 so that you can clearly see the result 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.230
 is 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.320
 this is a sweet game 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.500
 sweet this is the jar where we just 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.090
 really ugly to have done no the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.980
 things that you can see just small 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.070
 compare a bit with a few popes or 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.890
 so he really ugly and it is 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.060
 jar was just completely ignored 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.690
 to have 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.140
 and that is full of mold so what 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.300
 we learned from this players like us 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.410
 t prefer to play what happens 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.210
 then 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.580
 Well then you get light back and forth 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.440
 back and if we act ugly against people 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.990
 then you get to be nice and yes who they are 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.410
 back and if we have nothing against it 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.530
 people say no, really is very bad 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.340
 yes exactly so what is the best thing 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.730
 we can do that 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:52.760
 against people and being nice and then 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:56.120
 being human being being beautiful well it 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.160
 experiment was successful and I would say 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.710
 share this video with everyone who has it 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.750

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.940
 be kind to each other 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.940
 that was the experiment goodbye 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.830

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.990

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.440
