really<00:01:22.939> well-made<00:01:23.570> fan<00:01:23.899> trailer<00:01:24.170> but<00:01:24.619> it

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
really well-made fan trailer but it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.590 
really well-made fan trailer but it
wasn't<00:01:25.189> gameplay<00:01:25.520> from<00:01:25.579> black<00:01:25.850> ops<00:01:26.060> 3<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:26.509> was

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
wasn't gameplay from black ops 3 it was

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.179 
wasn't gameplay from black ops 3 it was
gameplay<00:01:26.990> from<00:01:27.049> a<00:01:27.350> game<00:01:27.560> called<00:01:27.770> Killing

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
gameplay from a game called Killing

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.399 
gameplay from a game called Killing
Floor<00:01:28.310> 2<00:01:28.430> which<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.210> another<00:01:29.540> zombie<00:01:29.810> game<00:01:30.140> so

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
Floor 2 which is another zombie game so

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.200 
Floor 2 which is another zombie game so
I<00:01:30.590> knew<00:01:30.950> right<00:01:30.979> away<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.490> was<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.880> and

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
I knew right away that it was that and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.700 
I knew right away that it was that and
unfortunately<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.930> was<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.170> little<00:01:33.350> bummed<00:01:33.560> out

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
unfortunately I was a little bummed out

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.200 
unfortunately I was a little bummed out
but<00:01:33.950> it's<00:01:34.159> still<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.430> pretty<00:01:34.640> cool<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.000> I

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
but it's still a pretty cool and I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.429 
but it's still a pretty cool and I
wanted<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.509> share<00:01:35.689> it<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:35.990> if<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:36.140> guys<00:01:36.259> want

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:40.899 
down in the description below and then
the<00:01:39.740> next<00:01:39.860> one<00:01:40.070> was<00:01:40.310> someone<00:01:40.700> who<00:01:40.789> actually

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
again down in the description below but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.399 
again down in the description below but
basically<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:50.119> is<00:01:50.450> someone<00:01:50.780> whoever<00:01:50.930> did<00:01:51.259> this

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
basically it is someone whoever did this

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.039 
basically it is someone whoever did this
they<00:01:51.469> blurted<00:01:52.009> out<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.399> if<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.420> look<00:01:53.659> at<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.930> it

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
they blurted out and if I look at it it

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.230 
they blurted out and if I look at it it
actually<00:01:54.229> does<00:01:54.740> look<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.579> zombie<00:01:55.880> maps

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
actually does look like a zombie maps

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.819 
actually does look like a zombie maps
similar<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.930> doesn't<00:01:57.259> look<00:01:57.320> like<00:01:57.500> any<00:01:57.649> map

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
similar it doesn't look like any map

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.099 
similar it doesn't look like any map
I've<00:01:58.009> seen<00:01:58.250> before<00:01:58.609> there's<00:01:59.060> like<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> pipe<00:01:59.570> it

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
I've seen before there's like a pipe it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:01.090 
I've seen before there's like a pipe it
looks<00:02:00.289> like<00:02:00.380> there's<00:02:00.560> stairs<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:00.979> go

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
looks like there's stairs to go

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.590 
looks like there's stairs to go
downstairs<00:02:01.609> and<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:01.909> looks<00:02:02.090> kind<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.539> like

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
downstairs and it looks kind of like

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.120 
downstairs and it looks kind of like
nach<00:02:02.960> der<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.350> tone<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.530> don't<00:02:03.829> really<00:02:03.920> know
