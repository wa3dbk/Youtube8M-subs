the<00:00:18.480> only<00:00:19.480> one<00:00:19.690> of<00:00:19.810> these<00:00:19.960> steps<00:00:20.230> works<00:00:20.560> for<00:00:20.860> my

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
the only one of these steps works for my

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.439 
the only one of these steps works for my
bird<00:00:21.250> but<00:00:21.580> I<00:00:21.640> will<00:00:21.850> do<00:00:22.000> my<00:00:22.029> best<00:00:22.300> to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
bird but I will do my best to

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.779 
bird but I will do my best to
demonstrate<00:00:23.110> the<00:00:23.710> first<00:00:24.010> thing<00:00:24.279> you<00:00:24.400> can<00:00:24.430> do

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
demonstrate the first thing you can do

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.330 
demonstrate the first thing you can do
is<00:00:25.029> come<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.840> pick<00:00:26.230> them<00:00:26.260> up<00:00:26.560> step<00:00:27.430> up<00:00:27.580> Brockie

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
is come and pick them up step up Brockie

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.060 
is come and pick them up step up Brockie
step<00:00:30.340> up<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.960> slowly<00:00:32.199> bring<00:00:32.710> them<00:00:32.859> out

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
step up and just slowly bring them out

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.729 
step up and just slowly bring them out
my<00:00:33.699> bird<00:00:33.940> does<00:00:34.180> not<00:00:34.210> like<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:34.630> so<00:00:35.470> another

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
my bird does not like that so another

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.530 
my bird does not like that so another
thing<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:36.010> could<00:00:36.280> do<00:00:36.460> is<00:00:36.700> stick<00:00:37.000> your<00:00:37.030> hand<00:00:37.420> in

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
thing you could do is stick your hand in

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.310 
thing you could do is stick your hand in
the<00:00:37.630> cage<00:00:37.899> pick<00:00:38.680> them<00:00:38.920> up<00:00:39.210> step<00:00:40.210> up<00:00:41.280> step<00:00:42.280> up

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the cage pick them up step up step up

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.819 
the cage pick them up step up step up
step<00:00:44.320> up<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:46.390> pick<00:00:46.629> them<00:00:46.780> up<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.050> just<00:00:47.590> hold

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
step up just pick them up and just hold

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.440 
step up just pick them up and just hold
your<00:00:47.950> arm<00:00:48.010> there<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.460> eventually<00:00:48.670> they<00:00:49.180> will

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
your arm there and eventually they will

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.720 
your arm there and eventually they will
get<00:00:49.660> curious<00:00:49.989> enough<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.559> come<00:00:50.739> out<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.700> other

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
get curious enough to come out the other

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.880 
get curious enough to come out the other
way<00:00:52.180> that<00:00:52.960> works<00:00:53.230> best<00:00:53.649> for<00:00:53.829> me<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
way that works best for me is to

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.420 
way that works best for me is to
actually<00:00:57.809> take<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.200> top<00:00:59.440> off<00:00:59.649> of<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.190> cage

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
actually take the top off of the cage

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.910 
actually take the top off of the cage
some<00:01:01.270> cages<00:01:01.690> do<00:01:01.840> this<00:01:02.020> easier<00:01:02.350> some<00:01:02.620> may<00:01:02.739> not

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
some cages do this easier some may not

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.910 
some cages do this easier some may not
do<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.190> at<00:01:03.309> all<00:01:03.399> but<00:01:03.670> if<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.940> if<00:01:04.449> yours<00:01:05.409> does<00:01:05.710> do

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
do it at all but if you if yours does do

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.440 
do it at all but if you if yours does do
this<00:01:06.069> this<00:01:06.279> is<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.609> method<00:01:06.909> that<00:01:06.939> works<00:01:07.240> best

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
this this is the method that works best

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:16.679 
this this is the method that works best
for<00:01:07.569> me<00:01:08.310> mine<00:01:12.420> off<00:01:14.609> like<00:01:15.609> this<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.359> I'm

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
for me mine off like this and I'm

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.359 
for me mine off like this and I'm
actually<00:01:16.899> going<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.349> take<00:01:17.529> put<00:01:17.889> the<00:01:18.009> camera

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
actually going to take put the camera

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.149 
actually going to take put the camera
down<00:01:18.399> for<00:01:18.609> this<00:01:19.029> and<00:01:19.359> I<00:01:20.139> will<00:01:20.349> be<00:01:20.679> back<00:01:20.920> in

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
down for this and I will be back in

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.449 
down for this and I will be back in
energy<00:01:21.819> so<00:01:22.779> as<00:01:23.079> you<00:01:23.349> can<00:01:23.529> see<00:01:23.740> I've<00:01:23.889> taken<00:01:23.920> the

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:24.459 
energy so as you can see I've taken the

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.169 
energy so as you can see I've taken the
top<00:01:24.729> off<00:01:25.029> of<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.779> cage<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:27.130> rocky<00:01:27.579> jump<00:01:27.969> down

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
top off of the cage and rocky jump down

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:39.449 
top off of the cage and rocky jump down
there<00:01:28.450> so<00:01:34.169> climb<00:01:35.169> back<00:01:35.409> up<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.009> can<00:01:39.429> just

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
there so climb back up so you can just

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:47.219 
there so climb back up so you can just
pick<00:01:39.849> him<00:01:40.029> up<00:01:40.590> rocky<00:01:41.590> step<00:01:41.950> up<00:01:43.950> rocky<00:01:46.109> come<00:01:47.109> on

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
pick him up rocky step up rocky come on

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.859 
pick him up rocky step up rocky come on
rocky<00:01:47.560> step<00:01:47.770> up

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.389 

I'm<00:01:53.590> up<00:01:53.829> here<00:01:54.450> I'll<00:01:55.450> go<00:01:55.600> over<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.020> cage<00:01:56.399> rocky

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
I'm up here I'll go over the cage rocky

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.889 
I'm up here I'll go over the cage rocky
step<00:01:57.670> up<00:01:59.939> Rocky<00:02:03.360> okay<00:02:04.360> well<00:02:04.570> he's<00:02:04.750> not

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
step up Rocky okay well he's not

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.779 
step up Rocky okay well he's not
cooperating<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:05.740> usually<00:02:06.189> you<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.520> pick<00:02:06.700> him

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
cooperating but usually you can pick him

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.580

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
around like this so that he can't see

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.740 
around like this so that he can't see
the<00:02:11.500> cage<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.790> set<00:02:12.940> there<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.269> pet<00:02:13.480> him

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the cage and just set there and pet him

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
the cage and just set there and pet him
and<00:02:14.280> hopefully<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.610> helps<00:02:15.910> we'll<00:02:16.120> give<00:02:16.239> this

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and hopefully this helps we'll give this

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.870 
and hopefully this helps we'll give this
