points on the back so you just plug in
your<00:00:41.700> meter<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.149> re<00:00:42.270> bias<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> fly<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:44.100> has

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
your meter and re bias on the fly it has

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
your meter and re bias on the fly it has
a<00:00:44.250> switchable<00:00:45.030> clean<00:00:45.360> boost<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.780> back

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
also and we went with the simple like

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.910 
also and we went with the simple like
pedal<00:00:48.750> platform<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.289> wanted<00:00:49.559> something<00:00:49.829> we

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
pedal platform we wanted something we

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.380 
pedal platform we wanted something we
obviously<00:00:50.070> make<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:50.640> great<00:00:50.820> effects<00:00:51.210> if

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
obviously make these great effects if

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.580 
obviously make these great effects if
you<00:00:51.510> wanted<00:00:51.719> something<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.199> flat<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you wanted something that was flat and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
you wanted something that was flat and
linear<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.280> plug<00:00:53.489> into<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> amplify

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
linear they just plug into and amplify

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
linear they just plug into and amplify
these<00:00:54.809> great<00:00:55.079> devices<00:00:55.520> what's<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> called<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
these great devices what's it called the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.619 
these great devices what's it called the
Sound<00:00:57.329> Projector<00:00:57.890> 25<00:00:58.890> 25<00:00:59.640> 25<00:00:59.940> Watts<00:01:00.449> that's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
Sound Projector 25 25 25 Watts that's
