and<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.409> say<00:01:46.560> okay<00:01:46.799> Larry<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.729> get

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and I would say okay Larry can you get

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.270 
and I would say okay Larry can you get
the<00:01:48.149> shaft<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.110> hit<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> bag<00:01:49.560> before<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.100> club

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the shaft to hit the bag before the club

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
the shaft to hit the bag before the club
head<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.060> usually<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.570> good<00:01:51.750> way<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
head and this is usually a good way to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560 
head and this is usually a good way to
kind<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.799> train<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> muscles<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.729> work<00:01:53.909> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
kind of train the muscles to work so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.060 
kind of train the muscles to work so
that<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> club<00:01:55.079> head<00:01:55.229> isn't<00:01:55.560> being<00:01:55.680> flipped

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that the club head isn't being flipped

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.130 
that the club head isn't being flipped
into<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:57.659> kind<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
into the back so that's kind of the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.389 
into the back so that's kind of the
first<00:01:58.290> thing<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.070> worked<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
first thing and you know that worked a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.040 
first thing and you know that worked a
little<00:01:59.520> bit<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> how

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
little bit of how

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.020 
little bit of how
a<00:02:00.080> little<00:02:00.320> but<00:02:00.440> he<00:02:00.530> was<00:02:00.680> still<00:02:00.860> walking<00:02:01.160> you

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
a little but he was still walking you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.180 
a little but he was still walking you
know<00:02:02.120> he<00:02:02.270> did<00:02:02.360> still<00:02:02.570> kind<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:02.930> walk<00:02:03.650> back<00:02:03.920> into

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
know he did still kind of walk back into

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.250 
know he did still kind of walk back into
his<00:02:04.370> back<00:02:04.580> side<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.510> see<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.720> can<00:02:05.990> still

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
his back side you can see I can still

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.530 
his back side you can see I can still
get<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.470> shaft<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.040> hit<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.220> bag<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.760> be<00:02:08.420> on

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
get the shaft and hit the bag and be on

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.430 
get the shaft and hit the bag and be on
my<00:02:08.570> right<00:02:08.869> side

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
my right side

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.760 
my right side
so<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.580> next<00:02:10.760> thing<00:02:10.940> we<00:02:11.090> did<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.320> added

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
so the next thing we did is we added

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.790 
so the next thing we did is we added
this<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.160> platform<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:15.020> his<00:02:15.170> right<00:02:15.440> side

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
this this platform to get his right side

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.470 
this this platform to get his right side
up<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.340> little<00:02:16.580> bit<00:02:16.700> higher<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.060> get<00:02:17.180> his<00:02:17.270> right

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
up a little bit higher to get his right

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.090 
up a little bit higher to get his right
hip<00:02:17.720> higher<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.200> get<00:02:18.320> his<00:02:18.410> right<00:02:18.560> foot<00:02:18.800> higher

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
hip higher to get his right foot higher

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.160 
hip higher to get his right foot higher
so<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.760> was<00:02:19.850> almost<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.270> pressuring<00:02:21.020> him<00:02:21.140> to

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
so it was almost like pressuring him to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.440 
so it was almost like pressuring him to
start<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.680> his<00:02:21.800> left<00:02:22.040> side<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.490> then<00:02:23.090> was<00:02:23.270> that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
start on his left side and then was that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.350 
start on his left side and then was that
okay<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:24.250> from<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.400> left<00:02:25.670> foot<00:02:28.270> we're<00:02:29.270> gonna

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
okay now from the left foot we're gonna

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.990 
okay now from the left foot we're gonna
just<00:02:29.720> set<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.380> club<00:02:30.620> rock<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.550> shoulders

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
just set the club rock the shoulders

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.640 
just set the club rock the shoulders

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
very much like the square to square

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.000 
very much like the square to square
swing<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.430> I've<00:02:34.550> got<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> video<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:36.010> just

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
shoulder through all the time pivoting

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.000

around<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.330> left<00:02:44.570> foot<00:02:44.930> rather<00:02:45.560> than<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.800> right

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
around the left foot rather than a right

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.550 
around the left foot rather than a right
foot<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:47.210> even<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:47.630> sometimes<00:02:47.930> he<00:02:48.410> would

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
foot but even then sometimes he would

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.580 
foot but even then sometimes he would
stay<00:02:48.800> there<00:02:49.520> but<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.570> club<00:02:50.810> would<00:02:51.020> drag<00:02:51.290> back

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
stay there but this club would drag back

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800 
stay there but this club would drag back
low<00:02:51.890> we'd<00:02:52.280> see<00:02:52.490> him<00:02:52.580> maybe<00:02:53.090> stay<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.480> his<00:02:53.600> left

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
low we'd see him maybe stay on his left

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.870 
low we'd see him maybe stay on his left
foot<00:02:54.050> but<00:02:54.200> his<00:02:54.350> hands<00:02:54.620> would<00:02:54.950> kind<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.670> take

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
foot but his hands would kind of take

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.400 
foot but his hands would kind of take
the<00:02:56.030> club<00:02:56.210> back<00:02:56.270> with<00:02:56.630> his<00:02:56.750> right<00:02:56.960> hand<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the club back with his right hand and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.830 
the club back with his right hand and
then<00:02:57.830> he<00:02:57.980> would<00:02:58.160> flip<00:02:58.970> again<00:02:59.270> coming<00:02:59.540> through

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
then he would flip again coming through

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.800 
then he would flip again coming through
so<00:03:00.440> we<00:03:00.590> had<00:03:00.680> at<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.860> box<00:03:01.240> so<00:03:02.240> we<00:03:02.450> have<00:03:02.570> now

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
so we had at the box so we have now

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.530 
so we had at the box so we have now
three<00:03:03.170> props<00:03:03.800> in<00:03:04.160> again<00:03:05.000> I've<00:03:05.120> been<00:03:05.239> working

with this guy for two years on

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.060 
with this guy for two years on
simplifying<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.600> locking<00:03:09.320> into<00:03:09.470> position

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
simplifying and locking into position

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.610 
simplifying and locking into position
left<00:03:11.000> hands<00:03:11.330> dominant<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.140> more<00:03:12.320> body

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
left hands dominant and more body

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.400 
left hands dominant and more body
dominant<00:03:13.220> swing<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.660> now<00:03:14.810> we<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> box

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
dominant swing so now we have the box

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.560 
dominant swing so now we have the box
and<00:03:15.620> now<00:03:15.770> we<00:03:15.830> have<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.310> don't<00:03:17.120> know<00:03:17.270> if<00:03:17.330> there's

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
and now we have I don't know if there's

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.210 
and now we have I don't know if there's
anything<00:03:17.750> else<00:03:18.020> I<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.380> put<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.650> there<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:18.890> think

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
anything else I can put in there I think

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.690 
anything else I can put in there I think
this<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.580> got<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.970> what<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.020> does<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.590> if<00:03:22.070> we<00:03:22.400> set

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
this is got it what it does is if we set

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.290 
this is got it what it does is if we set
up<00:03:22.730> with<00:03:23.060> kind<00:03:23.270> of<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.480> preset<00:03:24.170> strong<00:03:24.770> mini

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
up with kind of a preset strong mini

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.910 
up with kind of a preset strong mini

stop flipping number one now the reason
I<00:04:34.520> came<00:04:34.790> across<00:04:34.970> all<00:04:35.420> these<00:04:35.660> devices<00:04:36.110> is

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
I came across all these devices is

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.010 
I came across all these devices is
because<00:04:37.480> larry<00:04:38.480> has<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.670> past<00:04:40.940> he<00:04:41.300> had<00:04:41.510> an

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
because larry has in the past he had an

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.660 
because larry has in the past he had an
artery<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.470> was<00:04:42.710> getting<00:04:42.950> blocked<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.550> he

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
artery that was getting blocked and he

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.690 
artery that was getting blocked and he
lost<00:04:43.940> blood<00:04:44.780> flow<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.560> his<00:04:45.740> left<00:04:46.040> leg

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
lost blood flow to his left leg

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.310 
lost blood flow to his left leg
so<00:04:47.360> his<00:04:47.660> left<00:04:47.960> leg<00:04:48.230> became<00:04:49.510> atrophied<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.690> the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
so his left leg became atrophied it the

so his left leg became atrophied it the
muscle<00:04:51.800> just<00:04:52.250> just<00:04:52.790> kind<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.060> went<00:04:53.300> away

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
right side where he's strong dragged the

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.790 
right side where he's strong dragged the
club<00:05:27.830> back<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:28.430> then<00:05:29.380> flipped<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.560> club

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
club back and then flipped the club

back<00:05:32.270> up<00:05:32.510> this<00:05:32.690> way<00:05:32.900> Oh<00:05:33.140> kind<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:34.510> start<00:05:35.510> with<00:05:36.020> a

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
back up this way Oh kind of start with a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.080 
back up this way Oh kind of start with a
back<00:05:37.040> his<00:05:37.250> way<00:05:37.400> out<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.760> shop<00:05:38.200> so<00:05:39.200> I<00:05:40.160> didn't

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
back his way out of the shop so I didn't

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.400 
back his way out of the shop so I didn't
know<00:05:41.240> this<00:05:41.450> until<00:05:41.720> I<00:05:41.930> put<00:05:42.200> it<00:05:42.290> together

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
know this until I put it together

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.250 
know this until I put it together
yesterday<00:05:42.770> with<00:05:43.190> some<00:05:43.820> help<00:05:44.060> but<00:05:44.840> that's<00:05:44.990> why

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
yesterday with some help but that's why

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.980 
yesterday with some help but that's why
it's<00:05:46.040> because<00:05:46.400> his<00:05:46.550> bright<00:05:46.850> side<00:05:47.180> is<00:05:47.390> so<00:05:47.720> much

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
it's because his bright side is so much

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.320 
it's because his bright side is so much
stronger<00:05:48.350> and<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:48.860> much<00:05:49.070> more<00:05:49.310> dominant<00:05:49.550> that

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
stronger and so much more dominant that

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.270 
stronger and so much more dominant that
when<00:05:50.600> he<00:05:50.780> gets<00:05:50.990> ready<00:05:51.230> to<00:05:51.320> do<00:05:51.530> any<00:05:51.710> action<00:05:52.190> any

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
when he gets ready to do any action any

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.460 
when he gets ready to do any action any
physical<00:05:52.820> action<00:05:53.210> his<00:05:53.720> brain<00:05:54.080> is<00:05:54.260> saying

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
physical action his brain is saying

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.380 
physical action his brain is saying
let's<00:05:54.950> do<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.310> from<00:05:55.520> that<00:05:55.550> dominant<00:05:56.240> side

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
let's do it from that dominant side

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.510 
let's do it from that dominant side
let's<00:05:56.690> do<00:05:56.810> it<00:05:56.900> from<00:05:57.050> that<00:05:57.169> strong<00:05:57.470> side<00:05:57.770> so

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
let's do it from that strong side so

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.110 
let's do it from that strong side so
that<00:05:58.730> might<00:05:58.910> be<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.090> reason<00:05:59.330> why<00:05:59.720> but<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.590> fix

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
that might be the reason why but the fix

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.340 
that might be the reason why but the fix
and<00:06:02.120> this<00:06:02.210> has<00:06:02.419> actually<00:06:02.570> worked<00:06:02.990> really<00:06:03.230> well

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
and this has actually worked really well

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.260 
and this has actually worked really well
for<00:06:03.530> us<00:06:03.800> in<00:06:04.070> the<00:06:04.130> last<00:06:04.340> month<00:06:04.669> we've<00:06:04.880> done<00:06:05.060> so

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
not going to do this or this I'm not

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.840 
not going to do this or this I'm not
going<00:07:08.170> to<00:07:08.230> change<00:07:08.530> I'm<00:07:08.980> not<00:07:09.310> going<00:07:09.670> to<00:07:09.730> make

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
going to change I'm not going to make

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.660 
going to change I'm not going to make
that<00:07:10.060> distance<00:07:10.330> any<00:07:10.690> different<00:07:11.220> so<00:07:12.220> if<00:07:12.340> I<00:07:12.430> lock

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
that distance any different so if I lock

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.880 
that distance any different so if I lock
that<00:07:12.880> radius<00:07:13.419> in<00:07:13.660> and<00:07:13.870> just<00:07:14.440> move<00:07:14.710> the

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
that radius in and just move the

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.490 
that radius in and just move the
shoulder<00:07:15.400> the<00:07:16.090> club<00:07:16.360> never<00:07:16.570> gets<00:07:16.840> any<00:07:17.020> longer

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
shoulder the club never gets any longer

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.990 
shoulder the club never gets any longer
or<00:07:17.650> shorter<00:07:17.680> at<00:07:18.190> the<00:07:18.310> bottom<00:07:18.580> of<00:07:18.700> the<00:07:18.760> swing

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 
or shorter at the bottom of the swing

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000 
or shorter at the bottom of the swing
and<00:07:19.240> so<00:07:19.960> if<00:07:20.050> you<00:07:20.169> looked<00:07:20.380> at<00:07:20.500> it<00:07:20.710> from<00:07:20.860> this

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
and so if you looked at it from this

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.880 
and so if you looked at it from this
side<00:07:21.210> you<00:07:22.210> can<00:07:22.360> kind<00:07:22.570> of<00:07:22.630> see<00:07:22.870> if<00:07:23.560> my<00:07:23.680> left

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
side you can kind of see if my left

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.290 
side you can kind of see if my left
shoulder<00:07:24.070> is<00:07:24.280> locked<00:07:24.460> in<00:07:24.640> place<00:07:24.669> and<00:07:24.850> the<00:07:25.090> club

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300 
shoulder is locked in place and the club

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.020
