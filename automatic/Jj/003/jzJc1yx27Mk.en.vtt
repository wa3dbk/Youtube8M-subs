need for building and if we take a look
on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.720> map<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.710> we've<00:00:32.160> got<00:00:32.340> a

on the map you can see that we've got a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.959 
on the map you can see that we've got a
quite<00:00:32.940> amount<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:34.130> biomes<00:00:35.130> already<00:00:35.520> quite

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
quite amount of biomes already quite

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.000 
quite amount of biomes already quite
close<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.660> spawn<00:00:36.960> that's<00:00:37.230> why<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> seed<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
close to spawn that's why the seed is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.549 
close to spawn that's why the seed is
right<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.610> high<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.030> my<00:00:39.180> database<00:00:39.570> so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
right we've got the coat biomes with ice

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.810 
right we've got the coat biomes with ice
spikes<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.150> also<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.049> course<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
guess the closest ice spikes must be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.090 
guess the closest ice spikes must be

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
the screen so yeah what is special about
the<00:01:40.829> spawn<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.729> we've<00:01:41.880> got<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
here going through and I think that this
is<00:01:46.860> quite<00:01:47.009> cool<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.670> imagine<00:01:47.880> quite<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.479> lot

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is quite cool I can imagine quite a lot

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.649 
is quite cool I can imagine quite a lot
of<00:01:48.750> nice<00:01:48.930> things<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> spawn<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.939> then

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
of nice things here and spawn and then

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.870 
of nice things here and spawn and then
if<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.530> into<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.009> savanna<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.610> little

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
if we just go into the savanna a little

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060 
if we just go into the savanna a little
bit<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.149> will<00:01:54.390> come<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> desert<00:01:55.619> I've<00:01:55.920> got

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
bit we will come to the desert I've got

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.499 
bit we will come to the desert I've got
a<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.369> promise<00:01:56.579> today<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.180> loading

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
a bit of promise today with loading

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.929 
a bit of promise today with loading
chunks<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.380> won't<00:01:58.710> look<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:59.159> right

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
chunks so if they won't look up right

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.520 
chunks so if they won't look up right
away<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.590> sad<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
away then don't be sad and then in the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
away then don't be sad and then in the
desert<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.149> we've<00:02:06.329> got<00:02:06.360> a

desert we can see that we've got a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.119 
desert we can see that we've got a
village<00:02:07.140> here<00:02:07.409> which<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:07.740> quite<00:02:07.950> nice

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
now to the south from the village we can

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.130 
now to the south from the village we can
see<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:26.430> we've<00:02:26.640> got<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.240> bit<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.630> Plains<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
place to set it down because you've got

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.500

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.340 
in front and then if we just follow the
coastline<00:02:37.110> here<00:02:37.710> we'll<00:02:38.250> come<00:02:38.520> back<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.350> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
coastline here we'll come back to the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.180 
coastline here we'll come back to the
savanna<00:02:41.160> here<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.440> then<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
savanna here and then going into the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.550 
savanna here and then going into the
savanna<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:45.060> bit<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.600> see<00:02:45.900> this

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
savanna a little bit we can see this

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.920 
savanna a little bit we can see this
mountain<00:02:47.100> here<00:02:47.610> looks<00:02:47.880> quite<00:02:48.270> crazy<00:02:48.600> with

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
mountain here looks quite crazy with

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.860 
mountain here looks quite crazy with
water<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.590> lava<00:02:50.070> next<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.850> each<00:02:50.970> other<00:02:51.209> this

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
water and lava next to each other this

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.150 
water and lava next to each other this
is<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.200> course<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.680> savanna<00:02:53.190> M<00:02:53.790> by<00:02:54.510> M<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.160> I

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
is of course the savanna M by M and I

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.400 
is of course the savanna M by M and I
think<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.480> gonna<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.110> already

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
think that that's gonna do it already

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the seat there's a lot more to explore I

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.050

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
seat is really the spawn with the big

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.270 
seat is really the spawn with the big
river<00:03:12.390> going<00:03:12.570> through<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.830> liked<00:03:14.070> it
