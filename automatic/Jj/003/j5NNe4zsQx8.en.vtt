00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 something like that is welcome 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.420
 a new video and today it is 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.160
 again some comments from you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.780
 to comment as a lot 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.570
 come together under the last 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 Videos comment number one by mps 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.279
 Becker I can watch your video of course 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.630
 Of course, if you ask so nice with 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.980
 his nice smile behind it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.570
 of course, why not come now 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.269
 probably to 10,000 comments in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.340
 I can give her a video, yes I can 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.369
 probably nothing against next 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.769
 comment is from haswell choir and that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.390
 if not five maps come this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.739
 community maps there was somehow 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 times such a vote or so I have 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.559
 yes in the cd video with the new community 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.180
 web said that we are still in there 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.739
 and at many thought of for January 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 but it comes still the community 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.329
 do not map the community maps the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.280
 clouds roadmaps there anyway and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.350
 I thought that somewhere caught 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.840
 to have that no longer come and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 instead of the community web I know 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.210
 not sure but who knows each one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.980
 turn case because why not play games 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.439
 i like to be in battlefield 4 doors with the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.810
 At 490 I would definitely be there 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.220
 but look forward to it as I said if you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.119
 because it is exactly like it could be the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.650
 Write comments 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.270
 So if it's really safe and stuff 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.250
 further and not just some rumor 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 then it could like the comment 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.520
 but as I said I was writing 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.060
 and I'm there right now 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.939
 not so mega sure chair hour would like 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 like to know if I'm the june from the city 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.180
 aiming at 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.790
 as far as I know I do not know if sale 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.380
 There was no such thing as a patch 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 Hallein and there are many 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.799
 complained about it and so on but 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.939
 if that exists now then 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.740
 I have nothing in my attitude 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.290
 changed and have probably 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 if not automatically on I am 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.619
 I think I have it if I can 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.439
 believe that it does not yet exist, the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.030
 I would have announced bigger 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.399
 if so such a change of 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.079
 but if it does exist I still have it 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.180
 not changed and if then I would 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.009
 Definitely hire and me 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.049
 thus playing into because that's 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.090
 of course better if it is 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.770
 Definitely do that though 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
 that's I think as 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.790
 matter of taste then another 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.879
 comment below the lockout video the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.869
 sniper live round and that is not supposed to 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.640
 flames 1 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.910
 but sometimes you got kills where 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.460
 actually the ball off 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.220
 be enticed and that is the art 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.320
 to play battlefield you have to do that 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.760
 You have to understand the game with everyone 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.980
 Player at Battlefield is one 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.060
 slightly different due to the netcode and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.970
 the hit boxes etc 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.280
 You have to know that if you are an enemy 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.990
 around the corner is running that one too 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.090
 can shoot and the thumb goes that 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.740
 That's the way Battlefield is when I do that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.000
 games and an opponent runs around the corner 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.530
 I'll shoot it anyway 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.940
 a few balls in the direction because stop 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.620
 the hip hop style of netcoo as well 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.540
 more often a little bit more 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.980
 gets into the grip afterwards and that 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.770
 is in my example then extra 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.780
 made because I know that when about 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.130
 start is and they are simply not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.230
 I think there was a good idea 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.720
 For example, maybe it's me 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.280
 good example if so sometimes slow motion 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.810
 may be that it is not and the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.930
 It was not quite around the corner 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.490
 but that's really what I'm up with 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 Battlefield plays on it 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.860
 that 's just the netcode and if you 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.270
 want to do more kids and jajaja more 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.790
 you want to do kids then you have to stop 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.830
 to handle a bit and also 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.240
 so to speak play and not so of 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.830
 because of how I play in others I hear 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.360
 to shoot is around the corner no one 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.880
 can still continue to party and with 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.100
 luck to get the kill so that's how it is 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.880
 the little art at battlefield i say 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.890
 just times 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.660
 you just have to think along and so 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.130
 play at battlefield and then you can 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.510
 you kill one or the other 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.290
 in addition dust even if he 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.130
 actually not possible anymore 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.080
 would have been 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.940
 it was also asked more often whether 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.950
 I buy battle from me and so too 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.330
 make videos and of course I will 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.739
 buy me and I will play too 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.500
 and videos will most likely 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.420
 Also, I do not know if you do 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.739
 So the first parts you played 1 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.900
 and 2 I definitely have them 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.360
 I played them back then, too 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.709
 wanted and accordingly me 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.840
 I'm looking forward to the game I hope 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.030
 that it will be good i really hope that 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.250
 It'll be fine the next comment is 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.130
 quite interesting and indeed it turns 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.020
 I'll talk about the teamplay in bed and 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.640
 especially in battlefield eagle did not run 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.900
 is just before maybe I am 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.940
 still on the magic train and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.430
 Teamplay aspect of bf likely 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.050
 stayed with the 43 but in prtg 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.280
 and repair tool does not work for me 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.830
 meaning you want to one 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.200
 somehow into the web medick exception are 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.090
 one to two employees with ochs and 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.789
 pwc but unfortunately you can see more such 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.050
 setups and the teamplay suffers clearly 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.840
 including that is how 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.789
 then with that and so on where then 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.620
 always the pioneers are around and 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.419
 I always said yes, look there 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.669
 we are looking for the vehicles in tdm again 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.310
 and so on because pioneers belong 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.050
 not tdm that can because teamplay moderately 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.729
 do nothing 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.069
 every other class is better 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.050
 preferably of course the medi because in 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.729
 mobility continues to exist 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.220
 revive the ticket back in 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.599
 Of course, it's hallein as well 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.180
 you just have to say this medic 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.889
 train like him in battlefield 3 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.180
 it did not work 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.830
 there's nothing more in battlefield 4 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.840
 so mega works well and in 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.520
 Haarklein works even better 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.460
 less that takes in this direction 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.800
 always on and on and on 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.919
 It is increasing that they classify others 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.090
 such moody just getting stronger 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.979
 we'll just take that 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.280
 Example with the mechanic in hardliner 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:22.000
 booking of stops 50 percent more 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.860
 out and is so in tdm and so on 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.289
 especially extremely strong at 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.780
 embedded everyone on the chest you shoot 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.699
 would have 50 percent more out of such 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.740
 cause changes or such features 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.199
 that these classes are in fashion like tm 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.180
 just a lot more to be played because 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.500
 A tm is about always being with you 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.300
 hire because you will always be with the opponents of 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.740
 confronts and pack many 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.449
 people such setups then one 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.520
 and what you have to say is 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.020
 works well I have now synonymous 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.729
 mechanics often in tdm and so on 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.099
 continue to play and you are with it 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.380
 really superior if you are with now 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.419
 medi jumped come mechanic 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.210
 is in front of you then you just have the 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.740
 definite disadvantages and this maddie 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.270
 trend of this teamplay as it is in 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.440
 battlefield 3 for example still possible 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.759
 that was with everyone now 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 decreased at the four and at 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.870
 it's tough now I say it all 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.669
 down because we just take that one 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.990
 aspect that if you have a headshot 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.159
 you do not collect that anymore 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.509
 can be revived 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.889
 and you get that one 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.379
 defibrillator like in battlefield 4 always 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.539
 still so robl needs to recharge and that 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.680
 It just takes that hardly anyone does 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.300
 and if someone does it then he gives 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.379
 The 20s will be shot again then 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.460
 you can not be revived 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.319
 like in battlefield 4 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.900
 There you can keep what you want 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.430
 but this is how the game is developing 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.500
 It's not everything anymore 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.419
 At that time that's just the way to go 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.289
 my baby wants to have like to do in magic 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.680
 play three with three colleagues and 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:42.499
 to 10 integrated clap but how 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.229
 in hallein , that's no more 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:47.240
 possible only very well writes so me 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.469
 can now just a 08 15 good pc 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.389
 Internet joke bring but those are 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:52.189
 somehow so nothing at all for me 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.569
 I will be packing again in two three months 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:54.860
 but now the joke without you, you can 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.330
 Do not hold anything dear mario 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.360
 play so as you can your opponent to 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.520
 head jumps so people i think that 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.649
 Most of these two insiders understand and 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.069
 I think that's my personal opinion 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:09.289
 the mario partaken significantly 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:11.599
 is the mario part which is actually like that 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.159
 Nice the dear Mario can play there 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:15.229
 you jump your opponent in the head that 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:17.330
 I would like to read that too if you 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:19.129
 little battlefield in their games ins 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.009
 are chatting with such a good pc 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:25.069
 everyone knows internet but maria i share 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:28.159
 I think the synonymous nice I think 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:31.279
 Since you have to sometimes even he and so wrong 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:32.899
 I hope the video has fallen if 

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:35.089
 yes, I would give myself a thumb 

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:36.499

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:37.819

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:41.569

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:44.439
