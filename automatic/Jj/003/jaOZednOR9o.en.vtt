00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
know that sounds really basic but some

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.819

pinching feeling or pressure in your

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
pinching feeling or pressure in your
finger<00:00:48.390> tips<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.079> could<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.440> pushing<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
finger tips you could be pushing on a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
finger tips you could be pushing on a
nerve<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:50.550> something<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.780> don't

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
nerve or something like that you don't

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
nerve or something like that you don't
want<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.260> long-term<00:00:52.800> damage<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:53.699> if

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
want to do long-term damage because if

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
want to do long-term damage because if
you're<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.960> me<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.710> probably<00:00:55.739> planning

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you're like me you're probably planning

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
you're like me you're probably planning
on<00:00:56.550> spending<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.030> whole<00:00:57.210> life<00:00:57.270> Rocking<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
on spending your whole life Rocking and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.930 
on spending your whole life Rocking and
you<00:00:58.350> can't<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.739> rocking<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.460> fingers<00:00:59.730> are

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you can't be rocking if your fingers are

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.549 
you can't be rocking if your fingers are
all<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.750> pain<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> time

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
all like you know in pain all the time

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.280 
all like you know in pain all the time
so<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> really<00:01:03.329> recommend<00:01:03.480> doing<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
so what I really recommend doing is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.350 
so what I really recommend doing is
trying<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.159> chords<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.790> different<00:01:05.820> ways

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
trying to make chords in different ways

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.750 
trying to make chords in different ways
and<00:01:06.780> seeing<00:01:07.290> which<00:01:07.560> one's<00:01:07.860> hurt<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> which

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and seeing which one's hurt and which

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
and seeing which one's hurt and which
ones<00:01:09.000> work<00:01:09.330> sometimes<00:01:10.170> you'll<00:01:10.320> find<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
ones work sometimes you'll find that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.320 
ones work sometimes you'll find that
you'll<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> lot<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.580> strength<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.119> one

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
you'll have a lot of strength in one

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
you'll have a lot of strength in one
finger<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> maybe<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.799> another

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
finger and maybe not so much in another

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
finger and maybe not so much in another
for<00:01:14.310> example<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.790> pinky<00:01:15.180> finger<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.900> may

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
for example your pinky finger you may

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.830 
for example your pinky finger you may
not<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:17.180> strength<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.720> it's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
not have as much strength in it but it's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
not have as much strength in it but it's
actually<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.320> handy<00:01:19.770> finger<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
actually a really handy finger so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.399 
actually a really handy finger so
there's<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.240> exercises<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.290> do

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
there's some exercises that you can do

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.480 
there's some exercises that you can do

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to actually kind of strengthen your

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
to actually kind of strengthen your
fingers<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.600> people<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
fingers this is one that people like it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.130 
fingers this is one that people like it
basically<00:01:26.159> goes<00:01:26.460> pointer<00:01:27.000> middle<00:01:27.360> ring<00:01:27.630> pinky

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140

up<00:01:28.320> each<00:01:29.070> string<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:33.380> then<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.590> backwards

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.280 

and<00:01:41.190> that<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.549> help<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:42.360> only<00:01:42.420> strengthen

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and that will help not only strengthen

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
and that will help not only strengthen
your<00:01:43.680> right<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.310> left<00:01:44.549> hand<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:44.940> fretting
