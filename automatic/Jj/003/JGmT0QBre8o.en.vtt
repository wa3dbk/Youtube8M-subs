00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
happened with redstone and pistons and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.660 
happened with redstone and pistons and
repeaters<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.530> work<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.950> survival<00:00:47.399> senior

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
repeaters that work in survival senior

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
repeaters that work in survival senior
put<00:00:47.879> single-player<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.690> when<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> uploaded

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
put single-player but when I uploaded

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
put single-player but when I uploaded
them<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:51.829> multiplayer<00:00:52.829> server<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.820> they

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
them to my multiplayer server it they

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
them to my multiplayer server it they
didn't<00:00:54.449> work<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> same<00:00:55.020> way<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
didn't work the same way so I have to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.470 
didn't work the same way so I have to
sort<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> figure<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.879> how<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> make<00:00:57.270> them<00:00:57.449> work

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
sort of figure out how to make them work

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.560 
sort of figure out how to make them work
in<00:00:57.809> both<00:00:58.609> besides<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.180> close<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> being

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
in both besides that it's close to being

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.450 
in both besides that it's close to being
done<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.649> what's<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.890> happen<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
done and I think what's gonna happen is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
done and I think what's gonna happen is
when<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.300> finish<00:01:03.870> legendary<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.710> think

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
when I finish legendary which I think

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
when I finish legendary which I think
maybe<00:01:05.129> there's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> legendary<00:01:06.090> coming<00:01:06.390> out

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
maybe there's a legendary coming out

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.039 
maybe there's a legendary coming out
tonight<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:08.240> then<00:01:09.240> maybe<00:01:09.450> three<00:01:10.020> or

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
tonight and then then maybe three or

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
tonight and then then maybe three or
four<00:01:10.350> videos<00:01:10.890> after<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.670> quite
