lot on television in Pakistan so
primarily<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.479> difference<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:17.250> the

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
primarily the the difference in the

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.999 
primarily the the difference in the
working<00:05:18.150> style<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:19.050> was<00:05:19.199> it<00:05:19.409> was<00:05:19.500> very<00:05:19.530> obvious

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
which obviously had me nervous is in

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.149 
which obviously had me nervous is in
television<00:05:24.599> you<00:05:25.199> are<00:05:25.259> able<00:05:25.409> to<00:05:25.560> execute

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
television you are able to execute

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.100 
television you are able to execute
whatever<00:05:26.729> you're<00:05:26.909> doing<00:05:27.180> over<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.539> number<00:05:27.960> of

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
whatever you're doing over a number of

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.330 
whatever you're doing over a number of
episodes<00:05:28.680> for<00:05:29.219> film<00:05:29.639> you<00:05:30.389> have<00:05:30.780> only<00:05:31.340> let's

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
episodes for film you have only let's

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.189 
episodes for film you have only let's
say<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> very<00:05:32.849> limited<00:05:33.090> amount<00:05:33.389> of<00:05:33.630> time<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:33.900> win

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
say a very limited amount of time to win

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.620 
say a very limited amount of time to win
the<00:05:34.289> heart<00:05:34.530> of<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.800> audiences<00:05:35.370> so<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.819> think

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
the heart of the audiences so I think

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.249 
the heart of the audiences so I think
the<00:05:36.840> pressure<00:05:37.110> mounts<00:05:37.860> on<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:39.090> great<00:05:40.050> deal<00:05:40.199> more

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
the pressure mounts on a great deal more

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.379 
the pressure mounts on a great deal more
than<00:05:41.039> it<00:05:41.159> would<00:05:41.370> when<00:05:41.759> you're<00:05:41.909> working<00:05:42.270> on

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
than it would when you're working on

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.700 
than it would when you're working on
television<00:05:42.539> as<00:05:43.080> far<00:05:43.319> as<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.789> working<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:46.560> way

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
television as far as the working the way

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.860 
television as far as the working the way
of<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:47.550> way<00:05:47.669> we<00:05:47.819> operate<00:05:47.969> there<00:05:48.509> the<00:05:48.750> way

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
of the way we operate there the way

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.990 
of the way we operate there the way
we've<00:05:49.050> operated<00:05:49.319> here<00:05:49.889> I<00:05:50.009> really<00:05:50.789> can't

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
we've operated here I really can't

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.820 
we've operated here I really can't
really<00:05:51.180> comment<00:05:51.810> on<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.139> difference<00:05:52.500> because

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
really comment on the difference because

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.890 
really comment on the difference because
that<00:05:53.009> was<00:05:53.190> for<00:05:53.219> television<00:05:53.789> and<00:05:53.909> this<00:05:54.449> film

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
that was for television and this film

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.930 
that was for television and this film
and<00:05:55.169> the<00:05:55.770> film<00:05:55.949> that<00:05:56.009> I<00:05:56.130> had<00:05:56.250> done<00:05:56.430> earlier<00:05:56.699> I

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
and the film that I had done earlier I

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.600 
and the film that I had done earlier I
think<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.539> was<00:05:57.810> after<00:05:57.990> a<00:05:58.169> very<00:05:58.259> long<00:05:58.610> there'd

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
think that was after a very long there'd

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.309 
think that was after a very long there'd
been<00:05:59.729> a<00:05:59.759> big<00:05:59.969> big<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.719> long<00:06:00.930> period<00:06:01.169> of

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
been a big big the long period of

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.070 
been a big big the long period of
silence<00:06:01.560> in<00:06:01.949> cinema<00:06:02.340> in<00:06:02.969> in<00:06:03.360> Pakistan<00:06:03.870> had

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.769 
silence in cinema in in Pakistan had
gone<00:06:04.319> down<00:06:04.590> a<00:06:04.620> great<00:06:04.979> deal<00:06:05.009> and<00:06:05.550> we<00:06:06.479> were<00:06:06.630> in

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779
