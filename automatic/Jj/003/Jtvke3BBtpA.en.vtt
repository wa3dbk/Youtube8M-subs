underwater is using toys dice six and
again<00:01:05.579> incentive<00:01:06.360> systems<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:07.590> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
again incentive systems like kind of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
again incentive systems like kind of
challenges<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> games<00:01:08.580> children<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.330> having

the cooler the toys the easier the task
and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:14.880> gradually<00:01:15.780> making<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.290> little

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and then gradually making it a little

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.800 
and then gradually making it a little
more<00:01:16.620> involved<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.340> difficult<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:18.570> better

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
off they are try to include something

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.050 
off they are try to include something
that<00:01:21.920> manipulates<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> into<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.430> activity<00:01:23.970> is

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that manipulates it into an activity is

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
that manipulates it into an activity is
opposed<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.510> a<00:01:24.600> task<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.800> child<00:01:26.100> will
