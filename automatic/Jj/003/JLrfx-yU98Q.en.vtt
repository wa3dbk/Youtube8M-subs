00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 here is the presence of evil evil 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.770
 jim elliott dedicated to 1 can not take the burden of giving up some 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.410
 tricks some tricks and I can give a very important tip because it is the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.380
 next what we have in the mixer the two turntables since in the case of the toque 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.900
 on the right side disk 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.109
 he who is the channel of the criminal law degree and here has a good name 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.939
 a very important tip for us that will do better than what we 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.880
 should always be two volumes are at the same height in the same 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 in the same place because too many faculties the manager make a turn is the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.220
 music that will enter the place most lowered much louder these people 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.690
 feel on the track another very important tip so I'll pick up I think the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 next disc 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.910
 I'm going to find some discussion object that points to the supposed bid artifact 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.910
 that I have already met and I release the mayor for example the question being able to 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.930
 reddenings of discovering that their own offices of sad well but 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.920
 I do not believe in the innocence of dollars, the project was really the future. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.050
 now they are more or less the same 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 Then I can show the music at home. 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.810
 here have passed two good adulterated notes 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.460
 is here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 I still tried the two together and I cut the carbohydrate 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.130
 and now suffer fractures 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.480
 they only take from the artist 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.470
 and then in that case the tip that the volume is very very important to stay 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.780
 scoring well and winning well 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.090
 bimba heavy on the track and now everyone is talking a lot today initially neither 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.979
 felt kléber pereira andré almada will portray the reality is that he does not have the 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.220
 access yesterday received cti discharge 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.510
 hence my agent has three other 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.680
 up functions other possibilities that owns a style own mixer 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.980
 like effect in the game stores made over the music play with effect the brand 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.070
 French that for example we have several ronaldo Brazilian standards 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.610
 the filter 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.660
 the rapper ti with the free jazz reverend so I'll put here about six days 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.380
 We get injured here. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.899
 she is already rolling made the launch to test very humble 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.890
 and then you play with this one of formalities but I would love that I chose 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.249
 what do you want and are you kidding, some of them can go to school too 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.149
 and electronic music CDs that the dragon got to set well 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.579
 but is an exception the student is a pattern that follows 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.499
 pretty cool now if you 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.290
 if you sent your message to us by twitter it will roll from the wing 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:40.880
 telavive to institutions and wins gabi fabio milharal emphasis on sin house 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.559
 43 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.869
 It's easy to party. 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.589
 the body of crime 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.739
 I think it gets easier for us. 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.199
 on Tuesday check out I think I understood that it was made 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.629
 It's not the first time I'm playing with vinyl. 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.749
 because it is a very difficult material to obtain a very expensive material today 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.299
 agents may also have another possibility 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.299
 that do not touch vinyl that download mp3 music 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.799
 this is exactly what you can perform this work through a 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.330
 program also on the computer is so guess what he meant that these 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.689
 and is really doing a mixed-gender work with 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.499
 the mp3 or not sebastian vettel is playing the same way to make a 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.750
 work just as they are being another tool this one is one more thing 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.109
 and it's harder as well because it's all 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:40.389
 manually middle-east or laptop computer helps in several things that 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.219
 It is difficult to work so at the time you can comment on the game of these 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.079
 resources to get the job done 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.510
 get worse difficult sudden illness that is the 4th biggest impact on health says 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:56.209
 anyone the most complicated trickiest part to find the bpm of the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.209
 music that are slaughtered 7 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.870
 Afraid of the rhythm of Cape Verdean music and the acceleration of 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.519
 each has a time 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.659
 so it's harder to find some time from the next song like that 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:12.689
 it's playing 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.109
 for example fame scores increasing tact 28 edp is mixed 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.109
 is to let us say that it is much faster to find 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.689
 this one is a piti not she accelerates or slows down the music 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.059
 the harder you find speed that corresponds to those people 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.120
 suffered in the head has to stay 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.729
 doing there 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.509
 for example is the most difficult however there are problems and computer that does 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.990
 will decide the automatic renewal - to understand it then you have to 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.159
 accept and 128 and thinks it is in 150 replicas low equivalent pm pm pm 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.259
 You are away months. 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.729
 he will be able to be smaller but he appealed of the sentence and dvd of the music that is 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.949
 touching fire caused his 18th place in the premiere 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.499
 So, when we have colleagues like this, we gradually 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:05.349
 next years if there is no place and noted for the owners of the house leaves the 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.180
 right of yourselves difficulties but are not being more frequent this 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.789
 seems to be the capital of the infraero 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.789
 she's the one who knows we have the following email here is playing music 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.509

 the opening of 80's nasdaq depends on how the reuters is something that is 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.750

 agitated and you want to take a breath 070 in progress to do that the cool is 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.500
 You are always dealing with the lane if you are brave in the discussion. 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.599
 try 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.309
 do what you can to drive this is a good night then the thermometer to 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.219
 total income for people over 75 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.389
 Old port is everyone happy or not. 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.600

 total load was 27 that we fought tried to exceed this term that 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.020
 two hour limit 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.130
 He arrived at his house at six o'clock in the afternoon. 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.050
 but it is very exhausting and it has to be very nice to know this team 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.699
 The place that you're stuck behind, I went all night long. 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:24.460
