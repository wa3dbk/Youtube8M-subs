with<00:05:02.080> blood<00:05:02.349> counts<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:02.770> we<00:05:02.889> have<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.190> number

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
with blood counts so we have the number

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.040 
with blood counts so we have the number
of<00:05:03.580> days<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:03.789> we<00:05:04.030> want<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.270> count<00:05:04.449> down<00:05:04.660> for

person<00:05:11.229> Terry's<00:05:11.710> got<00:05:11.889> her<00:05:12.039> work<00:05:12.220> cut<00:05:12.250> out<00:05:12.460> for

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
person Terry's got her work cut out for

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.450 
person Terry's got her work cut out for
her<00:05:12.849> come<00:05:13.120> on<00:05:13.210> Carrie<00:05:13.449> yeah<00:05:14.310> ultimately<00:05:15.310> we

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
her come on Carrie yeah ultimately we

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.830 
her come on Carrie yeah ultimately we
have<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:15.669> figure<00:05:15.849> out<00:05:15.970> how<00:05:16.090> do<00:05:16.300> we<00:05:16.509> hit<00:05:16.720> the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
have to figure out how do we hit the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.659 
have to figure out how do we hit the
quality<00:05:17.229> on<00:05:17.259> a<00:05:17.380> predictable<00:05:18.009> timeline<00:05:18.430> so

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
quality on a predictable timeline so

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.010 
quality on a predictable timeline so
right<00:05:18.910> now<00:05:18.940> we're<00:05:19.270> trending<00:05:19.479> towards<00:05:19.870> being

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
right now we're trending towards being

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.760 
right now we're trending towards being
able<00:05:20.259> to<00:05:20.349> hit<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.680> in<00:05:20.889> 12<00:05:21.550> days<00:05:22.530> but<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:23.620> need

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
able to hit that in 12 days but you need

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.159 
able to hit that in 12 days but you need
to<00:05:23.860> deliver<00:05:24.070> in<00:05:24.250> four<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.550> half<00:05:24.580> correct<00:05:25.169> so

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
to deliver in four and a half correct so

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.390 
to deliver in four and a half correct so
what<00:05:26.320> does<00:05:26.410> that<00:05:26.440> mean<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.860> need<00:05:27.039> to<00:05:27.099> go<00:05:27.220> right

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
what does that mean I need to go right

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.420 
what does that mean I need to go right
now<00:05:28.349> where's<00:05:29.349> your<00:05:29.620> head<00:05:29.830> out<00:05:29.979> right<00:05:30.190> now
