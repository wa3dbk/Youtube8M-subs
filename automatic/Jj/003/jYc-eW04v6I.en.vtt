most and if even to get everything

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.900 
most and if even to get everything
working<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.739> only<00:00:47.039> thing<00:00:47.309> i<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.760> figure

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
working the only thing i have to figure

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.080 
working the only thing i have to figure
out<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:49.039> whether<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.370> Final

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
out right now is whether or not Final

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.360 
out right now is whether or not Final
Cut<00:00:51.210> Pro<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.539> backed<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:52.890> backup<00:00:53.250> hard

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
Cut Pro is backed up in my backup hard

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
Cut Pro is backed up in my backup hard
drive<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.780> irresponsible<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.620> I'm

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
drive I was very irresponsible if I'm

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
drive I was very irresponsible if I'm
backup<00:00:56.100> hard<00:00:56.250> drive<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.030> doesn't<00:00:57.360> even

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
backup hard drive and it doesn't even

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
backup hard drive and it doesn't even
function<00:00:57.960> correctly<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> main<00:00:59.670> thing<00:00:59.699> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
function correctly so the main thing is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.119 
function correctly so the main thing is
that<00:01:00.030> my<00:01:00.239> backup<00:01:00.600> hard<00:01:00.750> drive<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.680> depends

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that my backup hard drive it all depends

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.850 
that my backup hard drive it all depends
on<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> Final<00:01:02.730> Cut<00:01:02.850> pros<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.329> there<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:04.170> if

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
on a Final Cut pros on there or not if

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.469 
on a Final Cut pros on there or not if
it<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.760> means<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.240> could<00:01:06.360> probably

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it is there that means it could probably

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.810 
it is there that means it could probably
start<00:01:06.840> editing<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> video<00:01:07.950> again<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.520> three

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
start editing the video again in three

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.510 
start editing the video again in three
four<00:01:09.150> days<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.439> could<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
four days if it's not there could take a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.620 
four days if it's not there could take a
week<00:01:11.869> I'm<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.260> sure<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.390> said

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

really<00:01:20.280> depressed<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.820> uh<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.479> was

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
really depressed because uh I was

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.590 
really depressed because uh I was
ninety-five<00:01:23.250> percent<00:01:23.460> done<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> video

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
ninety-five percent done with a video

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.320 
ninety-five percent done with a video
just<00:01:25.140> uh<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.430> my<00:01:26.729> last<00:01:26.850> I've<00:01:27.090> had<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
just uh and then my last I've had the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.270 
just uh and then my last I've had the
crash<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.200> completely<00:01:28.350> gone<00:01:28.770> but

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
crash and now it's completely gone but

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.630 
crash and now it's completely gone but
the<00:01:29.490> bright<00:01:29.670> side<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:31.310> what<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> right

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the bright side is that what the right

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630 
the bright side is that what the right
side<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.780> it'll<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.560> very<00:01:34.799> easy<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.310> me

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
side is that it'll be very easy for me

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
side is that it'll be very easy for me
to<00:01:35.670> put<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> quips<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.229> since<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to put that the quips in there since I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.140 
to put that the quips in there since I
already<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:37.920> belongs<00:01:38.369> where<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> it'd

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
already know what belongs where and it'd

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.450 
already know what belongs where and it'd
probably<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.479> even<00:01:39.600> better<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.229> also<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
probably be even better and also the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
probably be even better and also the
quality<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.119> clips<00:01:42.420> will<00:01:42.600> probably<00:01:42.869> be

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
quality of game clips will probably be

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.469 
quality of game clips will probably be
better<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.460> main<00:01:44.610> point<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> right

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
better but the main point of it right
