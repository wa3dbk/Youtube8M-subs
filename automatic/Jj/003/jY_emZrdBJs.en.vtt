reptiles<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.240> did<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.689> didn't

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
reptiles as much as I did I didn't

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
reptiles as much as I did I didn't
really<00:01:46.590> start<00:01:46.920> off<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> quick<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
really start off that quick because I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
really start off that quick because I
was<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.259> little<00:01:49.350> kid<00:01:49.880> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
speaking of which I think leopard geckos

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
speaking of which I think leopard geckos
make<00:01:53.340> great<00:01:53.579> pets<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:53.970> kids<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.570> their

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
make great pets for kids if their

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.330 
make great pets for kids if their

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
parents are going to help them out

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.679 
parents are going to help them out
because<00:01:56.549> obviously<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.119> didn't<00:01:57.329> take<00:01:57.450> care<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
because obviously I didn't take care of

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
because they are not tell there's a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.930 
because they are not tell there's a
cactus<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.800> sort<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.100> fit<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.580> desert

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
cactus to sort of fit in with the desert

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.380 
cactus to sort of fit in with the desert
theme<00:02:36.380> here's<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.770> foam<00:02:38.100> like<00:02:38.700> tunnel<00:02:39.300> i

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
theme here's a little foam like tunnel i

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.970 
theme here's a little foam like tunnel i
guess<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.900> he<00:02:40.380> doesn't<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:40.680> spend<00:02:40.950> much

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
guess and he doesn't really spend much

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.759 
guess and he doesn't really spend much
time<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:41.430> cuz<00:02:41.730> he's<00:02:41.880> quite<00:02:42.540> big<00:02:42.840> he's

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
time in here cuz he's quite big he's

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:44.960 
time in here cuz he's quite big he's
above<00:02:43.950> 80<00:02:44.190> grams<00:02:44.430> i<00:02:44.640> don't<00:02:44.760> know<00:02:44.849> what<00:02:44.940> that

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
above 80 grams i don't know what that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.449 
above 80 grams i don't know what that
really<00:02:45.180> means<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.780> terms<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.739> genetics<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
really means in terms of genetics I

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.610 
really means in terms of genetics I
think<00:02:47.850> that's<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> giant<00:02:48.510> thing<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.140> i'm

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
think that's like a giant thing but i'm

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.229 
think that's like a giant thing but i'm
not<00:02:49.800> sure<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.130> i<00:02:50.250> don't<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.489> care<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.970> think

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
not sure and i don't really care I think

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.000 
not sure and i don't really care I think
he's<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.900> prettiest<00:02:52.230> lap<00:02:52.590> reactors

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
he's one of the prettiest lap reactors

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.949 
he's one of the prettiest lap reactors
I've<00:02:53.130> ever<00:02:53.310> seen<00:02:53.519> he<00:02:53.819> has<00:02:53.940> no<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.540> special

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
I've ever seen he has no like special

I've ever seen he has no like special
color<00:02:55.140> morph<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:56.090> mean<00:02:57.090> my<00:02:57.239> guess<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.569> tails

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
color morph I mean my guess is tails

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.210 
color morph I mean my guess is tails
purple<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.260> don't<00:02:58.440> know<00:02:58.500> what<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.799> means<00:02:58.980> but

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
purple I don't know what that means but

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.500 
purple I don't know what that means but
um<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.730> don't<00:02:59.910> really<00:03:00.000> care<00:03:00.209> about<00:03:00.299> color

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
um I don't really care about color

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.080 
um I don't really care about color
morphs<00:03:01.040> that's<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.130> water<00:03:02.370> dish<00:03:02.640> right<00:03:02.819> there

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
morphs that's a water dish right there

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.300 
morphs that's a water dish right there
obviously<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.230> there's<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.650> cave<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.100> cool

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
obviously and there's a cave on the cool

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.870 
obviously and there's a cave on the cool
