00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 players who are interested in your 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.950

 wait for another player to 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.570
 fit your requirements 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.340
 and search for a match pre-defined by 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.200
 another player until you find a team of 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.580
