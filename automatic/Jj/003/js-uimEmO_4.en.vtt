 super super mega good and good in the day 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.940
 today they talk about the review of this 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.429
 eyelash mask that terms the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.280
 mark ymy this one says it's look 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.920
 Intense mask with seed oil 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.050
 reading and this mask not by poking the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 effect intensity diversity to the maximum 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 volume also this mascara 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.970
 in its packaging it says it's against water 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 and here he says he's a dramatic black 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.160
 no bankruptcy situation new formula and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 is an intense black these masks are 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.830
 made in mexico this I have the review 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 from another brand eyelash mask 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.490
 and in me but the other one is oil 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.080
 argan so I'm going to Israel if 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.630
 they want to go see that review this 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.790
 mask then in this super mega account 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.950
 I also have the demonstration of how 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.390
 there are the tabs and if you want 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.430
 start watching it here is going to be the link 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.780
 so that from a single clip they can see it 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.970
 also to see that they will see each other 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 more than the other review of the other looking for 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.660
 tabs and you compare what is the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 that they like more and good we are going to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.610
 start as he told us this mask says 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.180
 which is with bone oil 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 with argan oil and that had finished 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 while with emergencies and method there is a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.440
 more than eyelashes urgently 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.540
 through sea water and was looking for long 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.250
 and I did not find him and to play I'm going to 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 to carry is and that is how I see them 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 review the girls and we see that more key 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 eyelashes is better follow in the seed 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.360
 of shift or leave it 6 argan is good 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 is at a price in walmart of 30 pesos 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.850
 while the other one if it charges you is worth 25 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.060
 pesos but you buy it in the center of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.570
 my city and well I will teach you the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.570
 brush 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.970
 so is this mask's brush like 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.880
 can see is a very hard brush is a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.280
 Rigid outbreak and the bristles are as in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.280
 spiral effect as you can see 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.420
 and something that I do not like about this mask 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.970
 is exactly the brush is super super 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.729
 mega stiff is very hard at the time of this 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.350
 art as applied in the people who 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.990
 changes and from above the one that your brush 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.239
 super super hard and the truth I feel that 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.280
 if I fight something at the time of putting 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.400
 in the tabs to the first layer of 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.709
 rhythm I felt that it does not sting me with nothing 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.900
 of mascara when I just understand it 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.520
 apply I was duplicating as 3 this 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.959
 layers for them to feel that 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.600
 really if I was doing a 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.489
 effect this motor rhythm and james are going 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.120
 drying and they are holding a consistency 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:41.019
 a little more this most because if 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.150
 more this as we will choose more thick for 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.030
 grabbing a wish for a little more thick 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.700
 and they were like they already work 100% of 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.310
 how is your formula and good girls I the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.650
 true in my most sincere opinion friends 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.420
 I did not like this mask, I do not say it's 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.640
 bad I've heard that several girls 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.220
 fascinated but I feel that this mask 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.019
 this rhyme is not for me like you 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.019
 you can see that if he leaves my eyelashes 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.510
 if it leaves me lashes long and 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.310
 defined but I feel that they do not give me 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.840
 it does not give me as much volume as it gives me 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.420
 Like the argan oil has them 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.220
 liked this mini review on this 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.660
 mascara they also know that I'm going to leave them 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.850
 the demonstration of how it looks with the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.920
 first layer with the second layer for 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.170
 that you see how it is forming my 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.110
 eyelashes ok girls I'll start 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.600
 placing a stage in this this eye already 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.490
 I bring it with two layers with this mask 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.860
 of tabs on top and in 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.530
 the bottom part and I'm going to start the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.860
 show how it looks with a first 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.860
 cap 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.069
 as you can see the brush as that 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.239
 it makes them look a little longer and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.239
 as separating them 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.970
 ok girls like that you see my eye with one in 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.800
 form mascara layers on 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.560
 the top part of the bottom part 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.390
 and my lashes below are very rare 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.390
 with any mask is that very 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.390
 very that are very very small 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.349
 ok I will accept and now I show you 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.889
 how is that seen with the second stage 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:31.370
 ok girls I'm going to start placing the 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.370
 Second layer 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.750
 you can place the other layer 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.840
 This is how the eyelashes look like they can see 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:05:01.430
 if he extended them 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:05.479
 if you separated them a little bit if you separated them and 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.880
 if it gives you let's say as volume no if there's 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.880
 too much volume but if you give them volume 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.040
