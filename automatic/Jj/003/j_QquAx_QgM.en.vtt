00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.820
 hi minecraft friends this video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.900
 tutorial I will explain how to make a 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.110
 tnt explosion at a distance 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.049
 what we are going to occupy is a lever 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.240
 we are going to occupy remaining cable cable that 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.029
 I call him remember for me this 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.009
 red stone is a cable and obviously what 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.259
 that we are in this we put the lever 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.960
 there we learn it we pay it we go to 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.570
 have it off ok what I want to do 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.710
 a parenthesis when placing the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.510
 which is the cable are 15 cubes 15 4 for 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.949
 that the ge energy comes 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.410
 leverage to see what I want them 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.750
 give explain 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.390
 ab observe I will put more tablets now 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.190
 energy does not come here, that's why 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.989
 many do not know how to do this from this 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.320
 detonation in the distance what we 're going to 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.080
 put the well-known repeater ok this already 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.879
 it's a bit of advanced connections from 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.120
 advanced circuits that I do not I have not 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.590
 done a tutorial of basic circuits 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.690
 I think there are already many videos on youtube 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.190
 for these basic circuits but if I 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.659
 they ask it I'm going to upload them I do not have any 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.749
 problem here we put another repeater 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:15.149
 to throw more energy into the wiring and 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:17.219
 ok I remind you to have tnt 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.000
 you have to get gunpowder are in the 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:23.520
 gunpowder clippers if they do not like that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.140
 kill zombies because it always ends them 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.689
 killing you 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.539
 They can make the generator zombies 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.909
 uploaded in a tutorial and so can 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.280
 get gunpowder and sand sand is 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.539
 next to the water there is no problem 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.429
 ok I'll keep putting a little more 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.629
 wiring to see what can be 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.259
 do at any distance there is no 

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:44.670
 problem here is going to need a 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.640
 repeater but you can first place the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.500
 has eye I have placed the tnt but 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.649
 if you observe my wiring has no power 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.789
 that 's why the tnt still does not explode 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.739
 you have to be very careful with that 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.930
 before starting to do what 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.570
 they want to stop you 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 and I'm putting it a little more topic 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.510
 to make the explosion look a little more 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.429
 observe that I repeat my 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.020
 wiring is off so that's why 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.030
 is exploiting me I will release a little 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.800
 of space here for what 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.520
 to lower the wiring and do the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.520
 tnt connections 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.110
 ok ok I'm going to remove a little more 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.230
 to remove these pictures we are going to 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.350
 put the cnt here too 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.540
 ok it's left I'm going to connect all the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.050
 possible trains that can be without 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.790
 crash the cables of subtract ok observe 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.740
 how not not something that I have done that none 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.510
 so that the direct signal enters him 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.360
 towards the dmt 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.849
 and I plug it in, I have not plugged it in because 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.349
 I have turned on what is the lever 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.599
 I have told my friend that he is in the 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.170
 map that disables me the lever 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.170
 observe how you are going to pay 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.800
 There you are going to pay now you have already 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.400
 and he paid me either disabled or 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.620
 a friend 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.349
 now yes without any problem they will be able to 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.290
 make the connection and we move away 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.910
 we move away to learn what is the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.770
 lever 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.570
 here I will put a repeater in case not 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.790
 they throw many signals to everyone 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.100
 remember to always have repeaters what 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.320
 more often as close as possible 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.530
 there is no problem I repeat it helps us 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.810
 to help us and not affect anything 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.340
 ok what you are going to do is turn on 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.130
 lever and they will observe how from here 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.940
 I will make polka dots to have 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.880
 okay 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.030
 watch how they detonate without problem 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.610
 some without any risk and a good 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.350
 friends I am now yes that is in the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.030
 connections that to make a tnt to 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.250
 distances I remind you of miguelÃ­n tar 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.250
 mx rmx and see you in the next
