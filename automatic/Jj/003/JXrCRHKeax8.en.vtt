and<00:01:43.600> I'm<00:01:43.810> gonna<00:01:43.930> press<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:45.240> by<00:01:46.240> touch<00:01:46.810> chunk<00:01:47.200> up

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
and I'm gonna press it by touch chunk up

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.990 
and I'm gonna press it by touch chunk up
parallel<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.960> lead<00:01:50.790> remember<00:01:51.790> we<00:01:51.910> already

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
parallel to the lead remember we already

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.870 
parallel to the lead remember we already
did<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.390> line<00:01:52.690> there<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.230> all<00:01:53.440> I<00:01:53.470> have<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.830> do<00:01:54.160> is

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
did a line there so all I have to do is

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.660 
did a line there so all I have to do is
follow<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:56.080> line<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:56.590> did<00:01:56.890> time<00:01:57.460> and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
follow that line that we did time and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.870 
follow that line that we did time and
time<00:01:57.850> again

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
time again

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.100 
time again
so<00:01:59.450> as<00:01:59.900> we<00:02:00.170> go<00:02:00.320> out<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.009> eye<00:02:01.990> towards<00:02:02.990> the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
so as we go out of the eye towards the

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.160 
so as we go out of the eye towards the
brow<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.650> will<00:02:03.950> find<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.720> line<00:02:05.720> becomes

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
brow you will find that the line becomes

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.449 
brow you will find that the line becomes
