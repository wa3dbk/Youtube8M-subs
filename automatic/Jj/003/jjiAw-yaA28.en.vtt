lame<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.789> I<00:00:47.789> kept<00:00:48.000> bumping<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> hunch<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
lame and I kept bumping to hunch of

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
lame and I kept bumping to hunch of
branches<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:52.039> usually<00:00:53.039> don't<00:00:53.340> upload<00:00:53.640> videos

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
branches I usually don't upload videos

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
branches I usually don't upload videos
like<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.530> had<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> feeling<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
like this but I just had a feeling this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.170 
like this but I just had a feeling this
would<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.489> fun<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.469> don't<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.180> guess

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
would be fun and I don't know I guess

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:12.970 
would be fun and I don't know I guess
I'm<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.510> bored<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.140> i'm<00:01:02.010> doing<00:01:02.280> random<00:01:02.579> stuff

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.190 

it's<00:01:13.980> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.400> faster<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.480> is<00:01:15.690> going<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it's going to get faster it is going to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's going to get faster it is going to
get<00:01:16.290> faster<00:01:23.030> wonder<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.360> an<00:01:24.450> end<00:01:24.660> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
get faster wonder if there's an end to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.060 
get faster wonder if there's an end to
this<00:01:25.220> well<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.430> mirror<00:01:26.640> over<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:28.070> so

maybe if I can cluck enough apples in

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.090 
maybe if I can cluck enough apples in
time<00:01:31.520> something<00:01:32.520> magical<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:33.210> happen<00:01:33.330> aww<00:01:34.100> i
