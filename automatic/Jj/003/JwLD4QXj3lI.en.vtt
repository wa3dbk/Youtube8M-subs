00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.229
 no no no 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.030
 do not 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.080
 why a school is that really 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.830
 there is a learning by experience 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.349
 own and my workshop was the trip was the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.119
 border the great problem of a 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.520
 student big problem of a young 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.520
 creator when he starts having 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.400
 desires or before having wishes arrives 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.620
 to see desires to create is that you do not know 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.160
 dare to go a little beyond your 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.370
 circle 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.210
 to take more hours sar more tenacity to throw more 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.149
 daring to overcome fears 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.860
 undertake a trip to anticipate the one that supposes 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.640
 pass a border 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 and that's why I've had contact with the students 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 two or three weeks before we have seen 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.900
 a long time to first meet us 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.660
 so that I know who they are and make them 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.040
 a series of questions depending on what 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.010
 what are they saying you have to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.070
 prepare a personal trip an appetite 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 a wish a ghost although you have not 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.680
 daring to do because if you make yourself 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 an author will have to confess those 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.120
 needs and you'll have to live them and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.250
 upload them and what I pretend I do not 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.440
 I intend that in this workshop you do the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.420
 photos of your life that in four days I 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.450
 bring pictures I do not even want 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.890
 know what you feel to know what it is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.440
 difficult for here I want to know what 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.360
 you have to be aware of what 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.869
 you have to overcome to get to have 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.660
 your developed voice every student had 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.360
 prepared a trip within a space 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.280
 it was possible and told us to madrid 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.649
 return in the afternoon what he had lived 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.979
 what had felt what had been 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.510
 difficult or joyful and where they started from 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.010
 it was important for what 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.040
 each student could contribute the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.570
 experience to the other after there was a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.840
 very important thing is to make them understand 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.420
 that a creator is a curious person is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.060
 a person who collects with passion 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.070
 everything that surrounds you and you have to know 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.340
 choose we have also talked about the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.410
 visual culture culture the culture of 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.210
 great beyond the photographic scope or 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.090
 be literature can be movies can 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.000
 being news can be very much 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.890
 that was remembering we followed him to 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.910
 base of images based on documentaries 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.220
 based on flash information about 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.010
 artists they did not know expand or 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.160
 expand expand knowledge but to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.570
 through enjoying to feel that there is 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.240
 to feel your life to feel what 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.370
 surrounds what other artists do 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.010
 for you also to create what is important 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 also have their own references 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.410
 referents and then to chapter e 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.370
 insist on the heavy in hours 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.379
 of work 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.019
 the hours propitious to night work 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.970
 dawn morning so they understand 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.379
 that the work of the creator as 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.000
 it's a school it 's a job 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.640
 official is an independent job 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.450
 risky and that's why I wanted them 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.760
 have experiences beyond seeing me 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.900
 to me and to be able to work themselves from 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.900
 meet other people 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.070
 you want to be an author yes that is a work 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.290
 that makes you happy, alive, the one that live and 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.820
 that you have to know that I care 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.490
 the mind I'm going to throw into the river though 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.100
 it is cold or boiling but you will have to 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.870
 endure this cold this heat 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.210
 unbearable at first to be able 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.560
 It's suddenly saying that I'm comfortable and that 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.260
 even if you have to take a picture of your life 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.320
 it makes sense to make sense that it is not 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.010
 a fake thing in a creator and it 's from 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.010
 that went to the workshop 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.670
 um
