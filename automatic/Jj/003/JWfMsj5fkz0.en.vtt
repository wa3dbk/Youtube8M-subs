second<00:00:47.850> card<00:00:48.120> an<00:00:49.520> ideal<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.910> second<00:00:51.329> card<00:00:51.570> face

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
second card an ideal my second card face

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.790 
second card an ideal my second card face
up<00:00:52.309> now<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> two<00:00:54.539> players<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.710> be

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
up now I have a two players will be

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.160 
up now I have a two players will be
looking<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.760> card<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
looking at the card that I have to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.279 
looking at the card that I have to
determine<00:00:58.590> whether<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.789> should<00:00:59.820> hit

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
determine whether or not they should hit

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
determine whether or not they should hit
now<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.770> always<00:01:02.039> assume<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.660> ten

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
now you always assume that I have a ten

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.190 
now you always assume that I have a ten
the<00:01:04.500> highest<00:01:04.979> value<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the highest value of what I have is a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
the highest value of what I have is a
twelve<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.549> don't<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
twelve we don't know but that's the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.039 
twelve we don't know but that's the
easiest<00:01:10.680> assumption<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.549> make<00:01:11.659> this<00:01:12.659> player

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
easiest assumption to make this player

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.399 
easiest assumption to make this player
has<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> fifteen<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> twelve<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
has a fifteen now if I have a twelve I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.719 
has a fifteen now if I have a twelve I
must<00:01:17.009> hit<00:01:17.720> dealer<00:01:18.720> must<00:01:19.049> hit<00:01:19.470> until<00:01:19.830> she

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
must hit dealer must hit until she

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.640 
must hit dealer must hit until she
reaches<00:01:21.119> 17<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.869> least<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> 15<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
reaches 17 at least so on a 15 with a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.090 
reaches 17 at least so on a 15 with a
two<00:01:26.040> showing<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.509> probably<00:01:27.750> stand<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
two showing I would probably stand the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.789 
two showing I would probably stand the
chances<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> my<00:01:29.880> busting<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.570> great<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.770> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
chances of my busting are great so I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.980 
chances of my busting are great so I
think<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.430> wise<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.090> player<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.630> stand

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
think it's wise for this player to stand

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.999 
think it's wise for this player to stand
we'll<00:01:34.500> move<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> five<00:01:36.890> obviously<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
we'll move on to the five obviously you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.190 
we'll move on to the five obviously you
can't<00:01:38.250> win<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.970> five<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.020> you'll

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
can't win with just five so you'll

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
can't win with just five so you'll
definitely<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> hit<00:01:41.479> now<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> have

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
definitely want to hit now you have

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.830 
definitely want to hit now you have
eight<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> keep<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.509> until

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
eight you want to keep going until

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.120 
eight you want to keep going until
you're<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.170> least<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> double<00:01:47.250> digits<00:01:49.130> now

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you're at least in the double digits now

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
you're at least in the double digits now
you<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.520> 12<00:01:52.579> that's<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.729> tough<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.119> since<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you have 12 that's a tough one since I

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
you have 12 that's a tough one since I
do<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:55.140> showing<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> would

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
do have a two showing but I would

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.410 
do have a two showing but I would
actually<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:57.090> ahead<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.509> take<00:01:57.659> another<00:01:57.780> hitch

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
actually go ahead and take another hitch

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.800 
actually go ahead and take another hitch
that<00:02:00.420> idea<00:02:00.890> busted<00:02:01.920> clean<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> cards<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that idea busted clean up the cards and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.649 
that idea busted clean up the cards and
take<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.469> bet
