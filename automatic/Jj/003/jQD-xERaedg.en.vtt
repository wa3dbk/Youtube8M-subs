00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
fastest base route than the fastest way

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.900 
fastest base route than the fastest way
to<00:00:57.480> earn<00:00:57.690> ten<00:00:57.930> coins<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.500> say<00:00:59.190> base<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.760> we

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to earn ten coins I say base because we

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.400 
to earn ten coins I say base because we
need<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> learn<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> fastest<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.379> to
