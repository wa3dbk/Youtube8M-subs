00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.740
 nvidia just introduced geforce 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.320
 gtx 650 tribute a more powerful version 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.150
 of 650 there 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 manufacturer's goal with this model 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.770
 is to bring a video card capable of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.350
 run current games at full resolution 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.240
 hd and good graphic quality 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.900
 the biggest difference is in the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.000
 memory that went from 128 to 192 bits 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.250
 other novelties are the increase in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 inventory and the implementation of the gpu resource 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.980
 bush to ensure some pictures by 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 second most during matches 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.829
 if we consider that the geforce gtx 650 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.129
 has the same gpu interface as the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.989
 memory that gtx 660 is not difficult 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.449
 understand why the two boards are so 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 physically similar model 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.199
 reference we tested the following 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.449
 Traditional enterprise standard bringing 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.890
 a cooler in the blog format that gives account 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.960
 to cool the hob 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.750
 even though the energy consumption of the model 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.680
 has increased over gtx 650 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.229
 original 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.659
 the average plate 24 centimeters 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 being of that size 17 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.610
 centimeters are reserved when you realize 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.189
 and the rest to the cooler at the top 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.130
 the card has a power connector of 6 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.650
 and a sl connector on the side of the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.950
 front we have the video connectors are 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.110
 two vehicle exits one hdmi and one 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.689
 displayport positions around the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.820
 opening for refrigeration one of the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.100
 The biggest news of this board is the gpu 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 bush resource that is not present in the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.250
 original model 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.400
 thanks to the processor clock 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.369
 rose from the 925 mega network version 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.890
 original for up to 1033 mega hertz in 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.590
 new board a considerable leap of 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 speed that is reflected in performance 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.189
 the geforce gtx 650 and bush brings a series 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.170
 resources aimed at ensuring 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.659
 excellent visual quality during 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880
 games such as full compatibility with 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.640
 directx 11 that offers features 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 advanced third-party rendering 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.520
 axis 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.890
 the board also brings the adaptive time in 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.480
 that allows vertical synchronization without 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.670
 drop in performance 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.760
 tx here is a new way to eliminate 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.860
 of the images and the physicists who 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.989
 guarantees more special effects inside 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.989
 of games 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.849
 the geforce gtx 650 ground bush was 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.280
 developed to be a video card 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.769
 accessible but still offering a 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.540
 satisfactory performance to prove 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.340
 we performed some tests with the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.379
 and we can verify that it can 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.480
 offer good graphics and performance 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.879
 interesting in most current games 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.400
 and full HD resolution 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.829
 belfield 3 brings beautiful graphics and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.220
 many effects of destruction despite 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.799
 Moreover, the gtx 650tm bush 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.390
 keep above 40 frames per second 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.049
 even with the video settings 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.140
 the remake of the racing game of 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.269
 2005 brings a refurbished look and the same 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.220
 original issue of the police escape 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.150
 riding the most incredible sports 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.950
 of the world 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.569
 the game features vehicles with many 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.370
 details but it was still possible to 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.879
 achieve good performance with this 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.530
 plate the renavan sea tooth was 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.900
 developed to explore all the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.639
 features of video cards by testing 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 limits of hardware in situations 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.200
 specific 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.579
 the test based on the graphic engine where 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.489
 uses the most modern system 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:33.109
 of physical lighting etc l'echo for 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.109
 To Determine The Power Of Your Video Card 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.240
 although the gt x 600 nvidia family already 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.040
 have video cards framed in 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.230
 practically all categories of 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.510
 price and performance the company decided 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.340
 launch another intermediate model for 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.709
 conquer the range of users who do not 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.170
 can afford the costs of a 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.300
 the last generation and often 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.730
 years without switching components 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.050
 the nvidia in block that plate in the same 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.209
 hd radio category 78 50 and in the tests 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.790
 you can see that it ties or surpasses 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.830
 competitor in most situations 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.780
 in addition the new video card 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.079
 even close to your sister 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.640
 older the geforce gtx 660 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.609
 the one that most calls attention in the equipment 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.370
 is the price the nvidia put the model of 2 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.080
 gb on the market for $ 170 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.380
 Furthermore the company should launch a 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.720
 model with 1 gb costing 150 dollars 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.760
 this makes it very attractive 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.660
 and bring great value for money 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.730
 benefit 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.130
 In Brazil, the plate is not yet 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.780
 available on the market but zotac already 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.290
 announced that the first model to be 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.870
 launched in our country must arrive by 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:50.260
 759 reais, which puts it practically in the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.450
 same price range of gtx 660 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.700
 this ends with the original strategy of 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.710
 nvidia and at least here takes the 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.720
 main differential of the model 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.120
 but this video card is shown 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.860
 very efficient and possibly will be 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.440
 able to run games with quality 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.690
 reasonable for a good time 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.729
 check the complete analysis with all 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.390
 tecund tests and even our next 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.390
 video
