00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.930
 hello microsoft friends 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.810
 commenting together for you in which 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.650
 today we are here with our mico rafael 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.690
 crazy 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.369
 look what movements like that with your head 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:25.050
 to top of six blasts of subscribing 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.750
 but good rafa everything something and well then 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.029
 let's see this mechanism of doors 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 without piston is a resiston tutorial 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.050
 no laborious distances clear there 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.920
 we see how it works with a plate 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.149
 No pressure of buttons and closes open 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.149
 rafa passes 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.300
 it closes vale 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.860
 then now we go through again it opens 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.090
 He passed 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.520
 It closes well, I'm going to take what 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.130
 I need to prepare the space for this 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.380
 and we return 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.070
 let's see it is about the portrait 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.070
 expression 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 to remove them and well with the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 materials and the barbecue we return 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.700
 Well, we are already here, we are already 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 here that we have come from 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.500
 choose the space and all that as 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.060
 you have seen here we have already emptied it 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.429
 we need below the mechanism what 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 that is such a good space, not 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.500
 very large, but not too small or 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.689
 a little bit big and good we have to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.159
 start by putting two normal pistons 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.399
 A) Yes 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.560
 from the normal issues and what 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.329
 is going to be the material of the door in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.490
 this branch and leaves things terni one to 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.999
 one from a distance of what is going to be 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.170
 the door we put another two pistons 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.359
 normal as you are seeing here is worth 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.420
 then what will the door be like 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.640
 1 let's first prepare this behind 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 of each piston we place like this and two of the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.760
 rest we put one behind the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.430
 pistons and two rest 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.430
 well now we will do what it does in 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.100
 the door frame that is going to be this 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.940
 It is worth the stone that we have placed 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.460
 in what will be the door accordros 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.910
 you always have to go where will the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.690
 be the door to the left of 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.190
 mechanism if we are in front is worth and 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.660
 well now we are going to place so that 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.820
 opens and closes then to a 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.400
 distance from the door we place the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.540
 pressure plate then for us 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.190
 we go down and see where the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.110
 space for the pressure dish here 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.370
 without wanting to take it off but good here 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.500
 I have to prepare a little more 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.090
 space but never what's wrong 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.120
 make a little more space so 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.390
 dig a pretty good big hole 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.890
 rather not a big, good hole 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.810
 then let's put the plate again 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.610
 Pressure 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.290
 because we need the signal to go through 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.060
 below not to take them with digits 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.379
 Well, that is now like your plate 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.120
 pressure to one away from what 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.120
 pass by the door and just below the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.659
 pressure plate we put a block like 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.329
 I'm saying and then on top of the rest 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.349
 then it is what goes raffo for 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.329
 press for another pressure so you can see 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.459
 how it works we have to put each 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.920
 side a torch as it is being there 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.739
 so then the track goes out 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.590
 saints three takes off and feels worth 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.939
 we have to put only two torches 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.489
 now we want them to work what they are 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.670
 the pistons then we go to where 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.409
 is the network are worth and we put another 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.169
 block below where we have placed the 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.740
 network are and a torch with which 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.450
 understands the network are from above 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.840
 and how we want that is so much the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.340
 paid management what we need is 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.620
 take the sign of the two torches that 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.840
 we have put before and take it to the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.720
 inverter s that we have had there is worth 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.340
 so now let's see where it would be 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.020
 the other the other piston for 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.200
 function 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:10.380
 we work underneath and we get off we do not 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.510
 we go down from below we put the 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.400
 torch to light the piston 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.650
 then how do we think that first 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.420
 open is to enter the door and 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.230
 so that we have time to move on and 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.620
 closing 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.090
 we are going to need a series of 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.400
 repeaters here that are going to be 6 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:32.300
 repeaters which from him the torch 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.300
 we put 1 2 3 4 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.600
 now this is a mechanism of this that 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.400
 I made the hidden trap that I'm going to 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.440
 break because good it will come out again 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.250
 without saving and I'm not interested right now 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.250
 this mechanism here 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.220
 we are like this 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.479
 with a repeater a resistor and a 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.220
 repeater looking towards the torch with 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.520
 which is going to be an invest and it's going to 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.520
 pay 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.090
 to this the torch so there are six 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.000
 repeaters the six repeaters to 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.830
 maximum delay is worth nothing more as 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.440
 delay as you are doing 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.290
 and well, we have prepared what 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.340
 it is the entrance we will have the entrance 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.310
 as you can see 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.470
 if the door is opened and closed here 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.470
 rafa gets there all motivated 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.940
 if I open the door closes himself 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.650
 opens it leaves us time to pass and it 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.570
 close now what we would lack would be 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.090
 enter here then we go back to 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.860
 do we come back to make the frame and good 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.860
 Well, we're going through here making the frame 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.650
 thus covering as we have covered 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.450
 previously better than one away 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.730
 we put what is the pressure plate 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.400
 as you are seeing right now and we 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.590
 we go down to see where it hits where 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.870
 catch the pressure plate we place the 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.610
 block but the signal will come and in 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.730
 instead of placing torches again with the 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.440
 previous mechanism is valid and we take the network 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.510
 stones and we take you to the two torches 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.900
 of the previous pressure plate as 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.610
 you just watched ballet and good here rafa 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.950
 floor a lot of meters of plate 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.440
 pressure but good in itself nothing happens 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.320
 ok as you are seeing we would have 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.900
 prepared our door mechanism 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.500
 Hidden without buttons or sticky pistons 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.820
 having put we do not know if it 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.850
 closes 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.680
 we come back from inside the house and he 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.020
 close then here we would have 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.110
 our house with our door without 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.820
 sticky pistons nor buttons and good 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.630
 I hope you liked this one 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.700
 tutorial this door has taken me out of my 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.220
 mind but as always I tell you the 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.990
 interest is very little to invent is 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.480
 almost everything invented is almost impossible 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.280
 mental be you something so sure that 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.860
 this door and nobody in another channel but 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.960
 I have not taken from any other and good 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.670
 Well, I hope you liked to go up in 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.440
 more things without seen in mirrors give to 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:19.260
 the former favorites subscribe are you and 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.260
 rafa wants to tell you why madness
