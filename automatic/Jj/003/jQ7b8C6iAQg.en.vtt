 a lot of volume is the shot was 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.269
 men lately came on this side 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.460

 creams or waxes that so soft fabric 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 selection to do well you still want 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.950
 be fabric cutting several times and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.079
 constantly until I could not you 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.610
 it goes well it is not seen with some hairs 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.230
 new abbot more and some holes in 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 some parts of the face we're going to leave 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.309
 some photos of some two of men with 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.360
 his beards in some different ways 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.360
 to give you some idea 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.840
 the mustache is also being made in 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.309
 long with some shape you can also 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.670
 leave you the video direct and big cut 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.670
 you lose 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.820
 you need to procure and take away the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.980
 hand because in the mustache and the beard 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.120
 can play with the mustache 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.120
 as you also take off 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.229
 We are going to give you more tips to cut your 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.390
 beard and his mustache and his face is very 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.979
 round to cut you in the shape of I have 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.360
 what you can see here to give us 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.460
 a little more aesthetics on your face 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.170
 I also try to cut this part of 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.420
 down here to give a good 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.259
 shape your face and this part of here for 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.259
 Do not keep those customers 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.909
 the hair colors of man that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.700
 we have seen more lately are the hair 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.189
 long the one that is very short or with a crest 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.320
 the one with the pompadour that I bring may be 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.990
 next regulation or it can be also 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 very reduced and the agreement decides if 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.049
 It's too long to touch the market 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.929
 I have it is so long because it makes 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.250
 be more elongated understand after 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.709
 commented a boy can be maybe a 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.810
 little more than crest for us to give 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.790
 expensive format and you're going to see a little bit 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.340
 shorter than mine try to have 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.170
 shape and continue with your beard and it depends on 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.610
 the sizes so it is not too short 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.290
 and the beard too long 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.569
 then you can see how it is 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.640
 your cut to see how to work your beard 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.470
 and your life and also if it is very long and is 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.819
 very is aligned do not have anything else so 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.040
 long because it makes it between your 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.049
 nation partners equal the dog a long 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.940
 of the beard not well cropped but such 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.590
 time with a good shape so that this one 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.239
 Give a clean look to all the style 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.099
 Now I'm in a haircut 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.019
 remember to look at what kind of face 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.610

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.410
 photos that you can take 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.510
 has more or less what the who 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.400
 it's up to you and color more with your type 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.200
 of camera also another recommendation is 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.120
 that you look at the celebrities that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.430

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.810
