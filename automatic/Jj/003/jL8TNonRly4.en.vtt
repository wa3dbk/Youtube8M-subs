00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520 
I describe I'm not sure the color will
really<00:02:49.910> sharp<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:50.570> find<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.930> be<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.260> there

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
really sharp you can find it be it there

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
really sharp you can find it be it there
um<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.930> more<00:02:54.050> like<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.380> pale<00:02:54.830> orange<00:02:55.250> e

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550

um it's more like a pale orange e
bronzer<00:02:55.940> rather<00:02:56.180> than<00:02:56.480> other<00:02:57.140> brown<00:02:57.560> ones<00:02:57.920> if

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
bronzer rather than other brown ones if

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.090 
bronzer rather than other brown ones if
that<00:02:58.310> makes<00:02:58.520> sense<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.150> then<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.500> blush

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
that makes sense and then the blush

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.860 
that makes sense and then the blush
it's<00:03:02.400> really<00:03:02.640> pretty<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:04.530> blush<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:05.480> there<00:03:06.480> I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870

that<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.610> see<00:03:14.670> how<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.000> goes<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:16.170> was<00:03:17.270> cheap

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
that and see how that goes it was cheap

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.350 
that and see how that goes it was cheap
on<00:03:18.450> 50<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:20.370> mean<00:03:20.610> it's<00:03:20.880> probably<00:03:21.060> not<00:03:21.330> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
on 50 and I mean it's probably not the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.050 
on 50 and I mean it's probably not the
same<00:03:21.570> quality<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.530> benefit<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:23.850> you

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
same quality is the benefit one but you

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.100 
same quality is the benefit one but you
know<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.420> you're<00:03:24.570> probably<00:03:24.750> looking

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
know if you're probably looking

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.080 
know if you're probably looking
something<00:03:25.500> similar<00:03:25.920> then<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.760> would<00:03:26.910> probably

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
something similar then I would probably

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.970 
something similar then I would probably
say<00:03:27.270> yeah<00:03:27.630> give<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> try<00:03:28.230> can<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.890> in
