00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
was released as a card game now these

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
was released as a card game now these
Sega<00:01:17.610> cards<00:01:18.060> will<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.630> were<00:01:19.289> a<00:01:19.350> format<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
Sega cards will be were a format that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.219 
Sega cards will be were a format that
was<00:01:20.039> used<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> mass<00:01:20.700> system<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
was used for the mass system and the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.370 
was used for the mass system and the
idea<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:23.130> were<00:01:23.250> cheaper<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.700> make<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
idea was they were cheaper to make and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.980 
idea was they were cheaper to make and
smaller<00:01:25.380> games<00:01:25.649> could<00:01:25.860> put<00:01:26.039> onto<00:01:26.220> him

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
smaller games could put onto him

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.660 
smaller games could put onto him
unfortunate<00:01:27.990> never<00:01:28.140> reads<00:01:28.350> took<00:01:28.560> off<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
unfortunate never reads took off so this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.790 
unfortunate never reads took off so this
game<00:01:29.910> was<00:01:29.940> eventually<00:01:30.330> released<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.590> card

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the time or game a very simple time the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.990 
the time or game a very simple time the
games<00:02:10.140> were<00:02:10.380> just<00:02:10.560> simple<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.489> knew<00:02:11.760> exactly

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
games were just simple you knew exactly

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.440 
games were just simple you knew exactly
what<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.830> trying<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
what to do but trying to do it was the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.380 
what to do but trying to do it was the
challenge<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:17.670> simple<00:02:18.209> and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
challenge just because it's simple and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.610 
challenge just because it's simple and
you<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.599> what<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.989> do<00:02:19.080> doesn't<00:02:19.200> mean<00:02:19.470> you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
you know what to do doesn't mean you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.820 
you know what to do doesn't mean you
could<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.770> do<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.560> basically

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
could just do it like that so basically

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.000 
could just do it like that so basically
there<00:02:23.760> are<00:02:23.790> six<00:02:24.120> levels<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.470> first<00:02:25.800> three

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
there are six levels now the first three

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.790 
there are six levels now the first three
levels<00:02:26.220> are<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.330> exact<00:02:27.629> same<00:02:27.870> as<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> last<00:02:28.440> free

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
levels are the exact same as a last free

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.190 
levels are the exact same as a last free
but<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.700> difficulty<00:02:30.209> on<00:02:30.360> those<00:02:30.690> levels<00:02:31.050> is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
but the difficulty on those levels is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.890 
but the difficulty on those levels is
increased<00:02:31.739> okay<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.450> start<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:33.690> level

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
increased okay so you start with level

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.250 
increased okay so you start with level
one<00:02:34.129> you<00:02:35.129> gotta<00:02:35.280> kill<00:02:35.489> five<00:02:35.730> vampires<00:02:36.170> now<00:02:37.170> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
one you gotta kill five vampires now you

at the bottom the screen somewhere and I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.440 
at the bottom the screen somewhere and I
just<00:03:52.829> load<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.069> little<00:03:53.340> quirkiness<00:03:53.910> about<00:03:54.299> this

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450
