the show so here's the problem you got

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
the show so here's the problem you got
all<00:00:16.859> these<00:00:17.100> devices<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:18.060> got<00:00:18.180> computers

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
all these devices you got computers

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.740 
all these devices you got computers
you've<00:00:19.289> got<00:00:19.470> files<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.250> folders<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.789> home<00:00:21.000> but

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
you got a firewall so you can't actually

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.759 
you got a firewall so you can't actually

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
access that stuff at home when you're

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.099 
access that stuff at home when you're
out<00:00:25.949> somewhere<00:00:26.430> else<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.869> try<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
out somewhere else and if you try and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
out somewhere else and if you try and
set<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> these<00:00:28.859> cameras<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.939> ever

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
set up one of these cameras you ever

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.250 
set up one of these cameras you ever
done<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> these<00:00:30.779> surveillance

done it one of these surveillance

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.479 
done it one of these surveillance
cameras<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.920> impossible<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
cameras you know it's impossible to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.620 
cameras you know it's impossible to
actually<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.090> from<00:00:33.239> anywhere<00:00:33.450> else

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
actually see it from anywhere else

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually see it from anywhere else
without<00:00:33.719> paying<00:00:34.079> someone<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> lot<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> money

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
without paying someone a lot of money

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
without paying someone a lot of money
well<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.880> company<00:00:36.180> yikes<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
well that's what this company yikes is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.180 
well that's what this company yikes is
trying<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> solve<00:00:37.410> they've<00:00:37.680> got<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.980> new

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
trying to solve they've got this new

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.970 
trying to solve they've got this new
software<00:00:38.670> program<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.500> basically

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
software program that it it's basically

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.430 
software program that it it's basically
VPN<00:00:41.610> made<00:00:41.879> easy<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.750> turns<00:00:42.989> anything

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
VPN made easy and it turns anything

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.310 
VPN made easy and it turns anything
virtually<00:00:44.370> anything<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.660> web

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
virtually anything into a little web

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
virtually anything into a little web
server<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.460> happens<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.239> load<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> up

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
server so what happens is you load it up

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
server so what happens is you load it up
on<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.050> desktop<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.649> computer<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
on your desktop this computer and you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
on your desktop this computer and you
take<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> folder<00:00:51.690> or<00:00:51.719> anything<00:00:52.110> else<00:00:52.230> drag<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
take a folder or anything else drag it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
take a folder or anything else drag it
in<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.280> turn<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> into<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.149> call

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
in here and turn it into what they call

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.569 
in here and turn it into what they call
a<00:00:54.570> device<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.949> these<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.370> different

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
a device so these are all different

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
a device so these are all different
folders<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> been<00:00:57.809> shared<00:00:58.170> inside

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
folders that have been shared inside

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.819 
folders that have been shared inside
this<00:00:59.190> yikes<00:01:00.120> interface<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.559> could<00:01:01.739> be

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this yikes interface and they could be

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.560 
this yikes interface and they could be
from<00:01:01.949> anywhere<00:01:02.250> computers<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.090> over<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
from anywhere computers all over the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.929 
from anywhere computers all over the
world<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.460> rather<00:01:05.700> than

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
world and what they do is rather than

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
world and what they do is rather than
opening<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> port<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.990> your<00:01:07.020> router<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.710> are

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
opening up a port on your router or are

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.950 
opening up a port on your router or are
doing<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> those<00:01:09.299> things<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> try<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
doing one of those things to try and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
doing one of those things to try and
give<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.170> access<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
give you access to it they have the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
give you access to it they have the
secret<00:01:11.700> sauce<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.270> wouldn't<00:01:12.720> explain

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
secret sauce which they wouldn't explain

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
secret sauce which they wouldn't explain
to<00:01:13.320> me<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> any<00:01:13.680> detail<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.490> don't

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
to me in any detail so I really don't

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
to me in any detail so I really don't
understand<00:01:14.970> how<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.240> works<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.200> basically

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
understand how it works but basically

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.649 
understand how it works but basically
they<00:01:16.799> allow<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.270> an

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
they allow you to go in there and in an

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.200 
they allow you to go in there and in an
encrypted<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:20.280> access<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.909> any<00:01:21.060> of

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
encrypted way and get access to any of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210 
encrypted way and get access to any of
these<00:01:21.330> things<00:01:21.659> behind<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> firewall<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.979> home

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
these things behind the firewall at home

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
these things behind the firewall at home
wherever<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.060> might<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.290> on
