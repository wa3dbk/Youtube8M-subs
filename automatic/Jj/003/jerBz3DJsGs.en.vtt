magnificent and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.070 
magnificent and
to<00:03:06.920> think<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.250> we're<00:03:07.460> going<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.730> have<00:03:08.080> four

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
to think that we're going to have four

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.920 
to think that we're going to have four
and<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.200> half<00:03:09.230> times<00:03:09.620> out<00:03:09.920> again<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.460> I<00:03:11.210> think

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and a half times out again and I think

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.140 
and a half times out again and I think
we<00:03:12.380> blow<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.280> for<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.490> players<00:03:13.730> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
we blow it for the players the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.340 
we blow it for the players the
inspiration<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:14.960> them<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:16.690> only<00:03:17.690> gave<00:03:18.050> us<00:03:18.200> our

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
inspiration for them it only gave us our

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.720 
inspiration for them it only gave us our
advantage<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:18.980> if<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:19.310> can<00:03:19.370> get<00:03:19.520> we're

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
advantage I think if we can get we're

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.410 
advantage I think if we can get we're
playing<00:03:19.940> well<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.390> doing<00:03:20.780> well<00:03:20.990> in<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.230> game
