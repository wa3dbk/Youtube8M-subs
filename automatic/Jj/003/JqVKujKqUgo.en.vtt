00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
and make a little 180 move as he heads

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.440 
and make a little 180 move as he heads
towards<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.520> basket<00:01:46.729> he'll<00:01:47.030> turn<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:47.360> get

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
towards the basket he'll turn and get

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.880 
towards the basket he'll turn and get
his<00:01:47.540> back<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:47.930> basket<00:01:48.020> there's<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.619> spin

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
his back to the basket there's the spin

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.100 
his back to the basket there's the spin
move<00:01:49.040> now<00:01:49.490> he<00:01:49.550> floats<00:01:50.060> he<00:01:50.450> glides<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.990> he

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
move now he floats he glides and he

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.930 
move now he floats he glides and he
throws<00:01:51.350> his<00:01:51.530> full<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.860> power<00:01:52.070> as<00:01:52.280> he<00:01:52.369> passes<00:01:52.610> by

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
48 for Michael Jordan and once again the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.030 
48 for Michael Jordan and once again the
judges<00:01:56.149> being<00:01:56.420> very<00:01:56.690> tough<00:01:57.649> on<00:01:57.860> the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
judges being very tough on the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.680 
judges being very tough on the
competitors<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.700> think<00:01:59.060> maybe<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.450> judges

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
competitors I think maybe the judges

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.990 
competitors I think maybe the judges
expect<00:02:00.260> too<00:02:00.500> much<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.770> Michael<00:02:01.340> Jordan<00:02:01.610> and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000
