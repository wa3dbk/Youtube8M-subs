00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.250
 The first thing we are going to do is place 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.440
 cookies Mary or your 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 preference in a blender or also 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.540
 they can be crushed by placing it inside 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.249
 of a plastic bag any of 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.949
 the two ways works perfectly 

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:36.929
 because after they are well textured 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.570
 remove the we are going to place inside a 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:43.230
 deep container and we will add two 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.679
 tablespoons of sugar and a teaspoon 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.679
 of salt 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.340
 now let's integrate well the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.340
 ingredients 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.930
 done this we are going to add the 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.150
 melted butter at this point if 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.910
 you want the base to fit more 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.530
 soft you add more butter for the 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.290
 otherwise if you want to have more 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.770
 durita then do not add so much 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.869
 butter I add a bar of 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.850
 melted butter ok when you already 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.119
 you see that induces and flour 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.070
 beach and that can be flipped 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.460
 then you help with the spatula 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.440
 even with your hand you can level it 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.240
 ok now for the preparation of the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.490
 milks you're going to need a milk can 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.539
 of coconut a cup of regular milk and 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.539
 half a cup of sugar 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.420
 and we're going to put the milk in a 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.670
 we're going to bring it to a simmer 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 does not have to come to boil but if 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.170
 it has to be hot then the can 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.109
 of coconut milk that does not happen to you 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.079
 it happened to me ok and we're going to leave it 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:57.590
 then after having stirred it 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.530
 let's leave to fire straight ok now 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.490
 let's prepare custard a cream 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.710
 a custard 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.710
 We are going to need 4 egg yolks 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.790
 and we put it in invasion and we're going to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.550
 start to beat 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.640
 and we are going to add sugar 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.480
 this cream has to be a yellow 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.310
 pale 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.890
 so I'll show you on the screen 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.319
 when you see that it looks like a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.349
 pale yellow is that it is almost 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.379
 list you are going to add a third cup 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.370
 of cornstarch or maizina according to how 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.370
 tell you in your country 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.159
 with this is that we are going to prepare the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.409
 custard when it is already at its point 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.720
 you see that everything is already integrated and 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.360
 homogenous good we are going to add it to 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.780
 the milks that previously are already 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.109
 warm and this is with the purpose that the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.709
 corn starch is well integrated into 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:04.579
 milks and the egg is also cooked 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.920
 then we keep stirring 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:12.140
 continuously until you see that already 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.140
 is a custard a cream 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.239
 and good now you are going to add that touch 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.239
 of red that you know that running and 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.340
 coconut they get along very well and good after 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.989
 done this we are going to stir and what 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.989
 let's integrate to the cookie base 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.330
 then you will place 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.380
 in bop and we will bring 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.030
 to the refrigerator at least 4 hours or better 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.420
 the night because the idea is that this 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.640
 custard people return consistent and not 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.740
 when we are going to use it, do not go to 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.470
 drop or melt now let's prepare 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.360
 the cream chantilly we need the cream 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.690
 whipped a spoonful of extract of 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.340
 vanilla and two tablespoons of sugar 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.260
 we started to beat and we added the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:07.020
 vanilla extract and sugar yes 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.760
 you are watching this video on youtube there 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.680
 I put an image that if you give 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.920
 Clicking on the image will take you to a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.870
 video where I show the step by step how 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.320
 make the chantilly cream and the tricks 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.180
 so that you have left to grow and you have left 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.990
 Consistent must always be 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.510
 refrigerate then tests will be very 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.470
 generous and you will place enough 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.470
 Chantilly cream 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.290
 and you 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.169
 it's really delicious that this country of 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.919
 I recommend it is 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.340
 extremely delicious has a lot of flavor 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.340
 Red 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.750
 ok after you 've already placed then 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.949
 the chantilly cream on a tray 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.289
 to place the grated coconut and we're going to 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.360
 disperse well we will take it to standard 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.720
 has to be very aware because the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.380
 coconut burns very easily minimum 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.419
 5 minutes and ready but always miracle and 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.979
 after the gold is already oval 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:15.310
 place the disc on top of the pay 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:20.889
 true that this country is extremely 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.889
 delicious good I hope the theme
