inches<00:01:28.310> having<00:01:29.310> figured<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.759> out<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.509> layout

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
inches having figured this out we layout

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
inches having figured this out we layout
the<00:01:31.020> position<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> walk<00:01:31.890> using<00:01:32.189> stakes

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the position of the walk using stakes

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.960 
the position of the walk using stakes
and<00:01:33.000> string<00:01:33.290> then<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.560> time<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> dig<00:01:35.310> great

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and string then it's time to dig great

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
and string then it's time to dig great
oK<00:01:36.360> we've<00:01:36.479> got<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.840> outline<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:37.590> with

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
oK we've got this outline now with

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230 
oK we've got this outline now with
stakes<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.159> strings<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.880> time<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
stakes and strings I think it's time to

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
after different reet the sand will also

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.430 
after different reet the sand will also
help<00:02:44.680> with<00:02:44.920> drainage<00:02:45.989> now<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.319> the

help with drainage now this is the
pressure<00:02:48.010> treated<00:02:48.400> six<00:02:48.760> by<00:02:48.910> six<00:02:49.239> we're<00:02:49.390> gonna

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
pressure treated six by six we're gonna

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.289 
pressure treated six by six we're gonna
use<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.900> create<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.170> retaining<00:02:50.560> wall<00:02:50.709> here

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
use to create a retaining wall here

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.150 
use to create a retaining wall here
after<00:02:52.299> our<00:02:52.420> sand<00:02:52.780> base<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.200> level<00:02:53.590> will<00:02:53.860> start

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
after our sand base is level will start

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.720 
after our sand base is level will start
to<00:02:54.280> assemble<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.880> retaining<00:02:55.269> wall<00:02:56.730> because

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
to assemble the retaining wall because

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.580 
to assemble the retaining wall because
pressure-treated<00:02:58.329> lumber<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.170> dense

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
pressure-treated lumber is so dense

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.949 
pressure-treated lumber is so dense
we'll<00:03:00.100> need<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.370> drill<00:03:00.579> pilot<00:03:00.639> holes<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.720> order

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
we'll need to drill pilot holes in order

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.900 
we'll need to drill pilot holes in order
to<00:03:02.170> drive<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.620> spikes<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.250> we're<00:03:03.430> using<00:03:03.609> to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.700 

right<00:03:27.940> now<00:03:28.330> we're<00:03:28.840> going<00:03:29.020> to<00:03:29.170> build<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.470> slight

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
right now we're going to build a slight

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.740 
right now we're going to build a slight
slope<00:03:30.100> into<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.490> wall<00:03:30.670> away<00:03:31.180> from<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
slope into the wall away from the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.070 
slope into the wall away from the
retaining<00:03:32.110> wall<00:03:32.410> right<00:03:32.650> that's<00:03:33.520> good

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
retaining wall right that's good

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.660 
retaining wall right that's good
this<00:03:35.080> will<00:03:35.320> allow<00:03:35.530> water<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:35.950> run<00:03:36.100> off<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
this will allow water to run off the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.670 
this will allow water to run off the
walk<00:03:36.850> towards<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.570> driveway<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.260> little<00:03:38.560> bit

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
walk towards the driveway a little bit

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.680 
walk towards the driveway a little bit
more<00:03:38.890> preventing<00:03:39.520> puddles<00:03:39.970> from<00:03:40.210> forming

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
more preventing puddles from forming

good okay let's mix up some concrete now
we're<00:03:46.720> going<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.870> use<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.020> fiber<00:03:47.380> reinforced

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
we're going to use a fiber reinforced

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.740 
we're going to use a fiber reinforced
concrete<00:03:48.280> today<00:03:48.790> that'll<00:03:49.060> make<00:03:49.180> everything<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
concrete today that'll make everything a

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
concrete today that'll make everything a
lot<00:03:49.870> stronger

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
lot stronger

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.320 
lot stronger
so<00:03:51.070> you've<00:03:51.220> cut<00:03:51.640> this<00:03:51.760> open<00:03:51.910> on<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.210> bottom

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
so you've cut this open on the bottom

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.910 
so you've cut this open on the bottom
pad<00:03:52.660> once<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.930> go<00:03:53.020> ahead<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.410> dump<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.680> in

there you would asked if we could make

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.710 
there you would asked if we could make
use<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.290> color<00:03:56.680> right<00:03:57.340> maybe<00:03:58.030> we'll<00:03:58.360> go<00:03:58.510> with

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
use of color right maybe we'll go with

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.510 
use of color right maybe we'll go with
your<00:03:58.840> steps<00:03:59.170> up<00:03:59.380> there<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.400> the

let's<00:04:58.210> see<00:04:58.330> what<00:04:58.419> we've<00:04:58.510> got<00:04:58.540> here<00:04:58.720> I'm<00:04:59.050> going

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
let's see what we've got here I'm going

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.659 
let's see what we've got here I'm going
to<00:04:59.200> tap<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.620> pharmacist<00:05:00.160> I'll<00:05:00.280> break<00:05:00.520> this

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
to tap the pharmacist I'll break this

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:01.670 
to tap the pharmacist I'll break this
loose<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:01.060> little<00:05:01.150> bit

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
loose a little bit

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.170 
loose a little bit
you<00:05:02.680> know<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.860> idea<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.490> lift<00:05:03.640> this<00:05:03.790> up<00:05:04.000> as

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
you know the idea is to lift this up as

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.940 
you know the idea is to lift this up as
straight<00:05:04.479> as<00:05:04.630> possible<00:05:04.720> he<00:05:05.470> must<00:05:05.650> be<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.800> little

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
straight as possible he must be a little

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.170 
straight as possible he must be a little
tricky<00:05:06.280> because<00:05:06.340> we<00:05:06.520> can't<00:05:06.760> get<00:05:06.850> a<00:05:06.910> hold<00:05:06.970> that

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
tricky because we can't get a hold that

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.570 
tricky because we can't get a hold that
rear<00:05:07.419> corner<00:05:07.870> as<00:05:08.770> soon<00:05:08.950> as<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.160> can<00:05:09.280> get<00:05:09.430> on

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
rear corner as soon as you can get on

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.890 
rear corner as soon as you can get on
there<00:05:09.729> Carolyn<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.240> get<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> grip<00:05:10.570> on<00:05:10.690> that

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
there Carolyn and get a grip on that

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.610 
there Carolyn and get a grip on that
yeah<00:05:11.680> there<00:05:11.860> we<00:05:11.950> go<00:05:11.979> okay<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.180> there<00:05:14.050> is<00:05:14.470> our

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
yeah there we go okay and there is our

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.159 
yeah there we go okay and there is our
first<00:05:14.919> set<00:05:15.100> of<00:05:15.190> stones<00:05:15.370> not<00:05:15.729> bad<00:05:15.970> huh<00:05:16.390> that's

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
first set of stones not bad huh that's

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.180 
first set of stones not bad huh that's
good

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
good

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.910 
good
in<00:05:19.030> order<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:19.390> add<00:05:19.630> an<00:05:19.840> interesting<00:05:20.200> texture

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
in order to add an interesting texture

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.340 
in order to add an interesting texture
to<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.280> tops<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.790> stones<00:05:22.150> will<00:05:22.780> dab<00:05:23.110> the

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
to the tops of the stones will dab the

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.980 
to the tops of the stones will dab the
wet<00:05:23.530> concrete<00:05:23.830> with<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> damp<00:05:24.610> sponge<00:05:24.990> you'll

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
wet concrete with a damp sponge you'll

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.140 
wet concrete with a damp sponge you'll
also<00:05:26.170> use<00:05:26.350> our<00:05:26.650> fingers<00:05:27.130> to<00:05:27.310> shape<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.850> edges

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
also use our fingers to shape the edges

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.600 
also use our fingers to shape the edges
of<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.390> stones<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:28.990> slight<00:05:29.410> bevel<00:05:29.710> well

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
of the stones to a slight bevel well

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.730 
of the stones to a slight bevel well
let's<00:05:30.790> do<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.030> second<00:05:31.390> one<00:05:31.420> okay<00:05:31.840> Pat<00:05:32.440> grab

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
let's do the second one okay Pat grab

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.070 
let's do the second one okay Pat grab
the<00:05:32.860> form<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.820> we<00:05:33.940> want<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.150> rotate<00:05:34.300> this<00:05:34.720> 90

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
the form and we want to rotate this 90

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.810 
the form and we want to rotate this 90
degrees<00:05:35.380> so<00:05:35.650> that<00:05:35.680> we<00:05:35.890> stagger<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.460> pattern

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
degrees so that we stagger the pattern

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.530 
degrees so that we stagger the pattern
there<00:05:37.060> you<00:05:37.180> go

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
there you go

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.720 
there you go
and<00:05:37.780> that<00:05:37.870> interlocks<00:05:38.320> just<00:05:38.710> like<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.070> using

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
and that interlocks just like that using

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.610 
and that interlocks just like that using
the<00:05:39.820> concrete<00:05:40.150> for<00:05:40.480> working<00:05:41.320> our<00:05:41.410> way<00:05:41.440> down

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
the concrete for working our way down
