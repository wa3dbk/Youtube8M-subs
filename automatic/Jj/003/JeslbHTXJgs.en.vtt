00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
but in the Garnett race which is three

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.130 
but in the Garnett race which is three
stakes<00:04:27.169> race<00:04:27.500> she<00:04:27.740> really<00:04:28.480> didn't<00:04:29.480> she<00:04:29.990> was

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
stakes race she really didn't she was

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.350 
stakes race she really didn't she was
she<00:04:30.320> one<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.710> course<00:04:31.160> but<00:04:31.520> she<00:04:31.790> was<00:04:31.940> troubling

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
she one of course but she was troubling

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.440 
she one of course but she was troubling
and<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:33.370> reason<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.460> because<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.970> was<00:04:35.090> also<00:04:35.419> a

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
and the reason is because it was also a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.210 
and the reason is because it was also a
sprint<00:04:35.870> race<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.350> she<00:04:36.530> doesn't<00:04:36.740> do<00:04:36.890> very<00:04:37.070> well

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
sprint race and she doesn't do very well

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.680 
sprint race and she doesn't do very well
with<00:04:37.580> all<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:37.880> chaos<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.510> beginning

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
with all that chaos in the beginning

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.969 
with all that chaos in the beginning
she's<00:04:38.960> like<00:04:39.080> oh<00:04:39.140> my<00:04:39.260> gosh<00:04:39.440> what's<00:04:39.620> going<00:04:39.830> on

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
she's like oh my gosh what's going on

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.159 
she's like oh my gosh what's going on
and<00:04:40.280> she<00:04:40.760> barely<00:04:41.060> was<00:04:41.300> able<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.630> hold<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.990> to

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
and she barely was able to hold on to

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.690 
and she barely was able to hold on to
the<00:04:42.260> first<00:04:42.470> position<00:04:42.710> as<00:04:43.690> her<00:04:44.690> camy<00:04:45.020> um<00:04:45.700> I

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
the first position as her camy um I

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.630 
the first position as her camy um I
figured<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.750> with<00:04:48.050> her<00:04:48.260> stats<00:04:48.740> let's<00:04:49.430> see
