00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
found it I the case and cut it out with

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.009 
found it I the case and cut it out with
the<00:02:22.000> scissors<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:24.069> couldn't<00:02:24.610> make<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:25.000> hose<00:02:25.660> I

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
the scissors I couldn't make I hose I

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.470 
the scissors I couldn't make I hose I
was<00:02:26.260> too<00:02:26.470> small<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:27.040> make<00:02:27.190> holes<00:02:27.489> in<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.450> I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
was too small to make holes in so I

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120 
was too small to make holes in so I
thought<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.140> would<00:02:29.200> still<00:02:29.620> look<00:02:29.739> good<00:02:29.890> if<00:02:30.040> I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
thought it would still look good if I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.520 
thought it would still look good if I
just<00:02:30.310> left<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.580> blank<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> yeah<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.350> pretty
