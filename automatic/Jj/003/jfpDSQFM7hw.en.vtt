yep<00:03:17.110> I'm<00:03:17.530> gonna<00:03:17.800> made<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.069> monster<00:03:20.370> each<00:03:21.370> one<00:03:21.580> of

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
yep I'm gonna made a monster each one of

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.699 
yep I'm gonna made a monster each one of
these<00:03:21.760> motors<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.300> 90<00:03:22.660> watts<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.260> don't<00:03:23.650> know

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
these motors is 90 watts I don't know

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.150 
these motors is 90 watts I don't know
what<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.980> reduction<00:03:24.640> ratio<00:03:24.819> on<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.600> is

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
what the reduction ratio on this is

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.820 
what the reduction ratio on this is
might<00:03:27.160> be<00:03:27.190> eighty<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.850> one<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:28.300> don't<00:03:28.830> know

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
might be eighty to one I don't know

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.860 
might be eighty to one I don't know
maybe<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.880> one<00:03:31.030> actually<00:03:31.390> sounds<00:03:31.690> about

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
maybe the one actually sounds about

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.930 
maybe the one actually sounds about
right<00:03:31.900> 50<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.830> one's<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.100> little<00:03:33.280> bit<00:03:33.370> faster

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
right 50 to one's a little bit faster

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.420 
right 50 to one's a little bit faster
than<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:35.290> 50<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.860> use<00:03:36.010> fifty<00:03:36.340> to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
than this like 50 and I use fifty to

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.540 
than this like 50 and I use fifty to
sixty<00:03:36.580> one<00:03:36.970> ratio<00:03:37.480> boxes<00:03:37.989> all<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.260> time<00:03:38.550> I'd

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
sixty one ratio boxes all the time I'd

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.040 
sixty one ratio boxes all the time I'd
say<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.850> probably<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.390> about<00:03:40.600> eighty<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.930> one

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
say this probably is about eighty to one

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.910 
say this probably is about eighty to one
and<00:03:42.300> yeah<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.720> kicks<00:03:43.959> ass<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.560> lot<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.580> us<00:03:46.920> it'll
