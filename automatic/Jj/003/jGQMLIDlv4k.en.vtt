00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.549 
so in this video we're now going to look
at<00:00:06.520> anticipating<00:00:07.390> where<00:00:07.990> the<00:00:08.080> cue<00:00:08.290> ball<00:00:08.440> is

where the cue ball is going to go after

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.150 
where the cue ball is going to go after
I've<00:00:28.510> potted<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.260> red<00:00:29.500> ball<00:00:29.680> into<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.980> corner

I've potted the red ball into the corner

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.790 
I've potted the red ball into the corner
so<00:00:31.000> I've<00:00:31.090> set<00:00:31.630> up<00:00:31.660> two<00:00:31.960> yellow<00:00:32.230> balls<00:00:32.529> on<00:00:32.680> the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
so I've set up two yellow balls on the

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.040 
so I've set up two yellow balls on the
raelia<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:33.430> what<00:00:34.030> I'm<00:00:34.090> going<00:00:34.239> to<00:00:34.269> do<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.570> I'm

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
raelia so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.120 
raelia so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.260> pop<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.530> red<00:00:35.650> ball<00:00:35.800> into<00:00:35.949> the

going to pop the red ball into the

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.970 
going to pop the red ball into the
corner<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.610> as<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.600> natural<00:00:38.260> reaction<00:00:38.410> so<00:00:38.860> I'm

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
corner and as a natural reaction so I'm

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.639 
corner and as a natural reaction so I'm
playing<00:00:39.280> with<00:00:39.489> no<00:00:39.760> side<00:00:40.059> spin<00:00:40.450> no<00:00:40.780> top<00:00:41.050> spin<00:00:41.380> no

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
playing with no side spin no top spin no

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.200 
playing with no side spin no top spin no
bottoms<00:00:41.980> when<00:00:42.160> I'm<00:00:42.250> hitting<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.610> cue<00:00:42.790> ball<00:00:43.000> in

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
bottoms when I'm hitting the cue ball in

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.510 
bottoms when I'm hitting the cue ball in
the<00:00:43.600> middle<00:00:43.750> so<00:00:44.410> then<00:00:44.590> this<00:00:44.980> is<00:00:45.160> what's<00:00:45.340> known

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
the middle so then this is what's known

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.780 
the middle so then this is what's known
as<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.760> natural<00:00:46.510> line<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:48.100> cue<00:00:48.309> ball<00:00:48.489> comes

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
as the natural line the cue ball comes

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.360 
as the natural line the cue ball comes
off<00:00:49.059> after<00:00:49.329> potting<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:49.989> ball<00:00:50.170> I'm<00:00:51.040> going<00:00:51.309> to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
off after potting the ball I'm going to

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.430 
off after potting the ball I'm going to
try<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.670> make<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.969> cue<00:00:52.210> ball<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.230> yellow

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
try and make the cue ball it the yellow

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.979 
try and make the cue ball it the yellow
ball<00:00:53.770> and<00:00:54.250> it's<00:00:54.550> all<00:00:54.700> about<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.149> natural<00:00:55.690> line

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
ball and it's all about the natural line

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.680 
ball and it's all about the natural line
that<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.350> ball<00:00:56.530> comes<00:00:56.800> off<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.550> this<00:00:58.450> would

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
that the ball comes off so this would

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.999 
that the ball comes off so this would
something<00:00:59.289> like<00:00:59.559> this<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.530> there<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.800> can<00:01:05.860> see

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
something like this so there you can see

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.070 
something like this so there you can see
the<00:01:06.550> natural<00:01:07.030> path<00:01:07.270> that<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.570> white<00:01:07.750> took

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
the natural path that the white took

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.040 
the natural path that the white took
after<00:01:08.380> potting<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.130> red<00:01:09.369> ball<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:10.630> hitting

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
after potting the red ball was hitting

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.600 
after potting the red ball was hitting
the<00:01:11.140> yellow<00:01:11.319> ball<00:01:11.649> that<00:01:11.890> I'd<00:01:11.979> set<00:01:12.220> up<00:01:12.250> on<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
the yellow ball that I'd set up on the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.809 
the yellow ball that I'd set up on the
on<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.390> on<00:01:13.539> the<00:01:13.630> side<00:01:13.810> cushion<00:01:14.050> there<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:15.640> is

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
on the on the side cushion there this is

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:17.249 
on the on the side cushion there this is
something<00:01:16.149> that's<00:01:16.300> really<00:01:16.720> important<00:01:17.170> to

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
something that's really important to

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.010 
something that's really important to
practice<00:01:17.440> because<00:01:18.360> players<00:01:19.360> struggle<00:01:19.810> to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
practice because players struggle to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.410 
practice because players struggle to
work<00:01:20.800> out<00:01:21.069> where<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.640> cue<00:01:21.849> ball<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.179> going<00:01:22.209> to

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
work out where the cue ball is going to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.990 
work out where the cue ball is going to
go<00:01:22.599> after<00:01:23.440> you've<00:01:24.099> potted<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.550> ball<00:01:24.819> that<00:01:24.940> you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
go after you've potted the ball that you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.230 
go after you've potted the ball that you
intend<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.479> put<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:27.190> this<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.550> set<00:01:28.000> up<00:01:28.149> a

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
intend to put so this is a set up a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.210 
intend to put so this is a set up a
practice<00:01:28.420> routine<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.410> as<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.649> can<00:01:29.800> see<00:01:29.860> I've

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
practice routine and as you can see I've

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.999 
practice routine and as you can see I've
put<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.700> yellow<00:01:31.240> red<00:01:31.720> yellow<00:01:31.929> red<00:01:32.349> going<00:01:32.830> all

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
put the yellow red yellow red going all

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.639 
put the yellow red yellow red going all
the<00:01:33.130> way<00:01:33.160> up<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.490> table<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.410> good

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
the way up the table this is a good

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.290 
the way up the table this is a good
routine<00:01:35.979> for<00:01:36.190> anticipating<00:01:36.910> where<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.119> cue

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
routine for anticipating where the cue

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.440 
routine for anticipating where the cue
ball<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.569> going<00:01:37.810> because<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:39.550> objective<00:01:40.179> of

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
ball is going because the objective of

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.960 
ball is going because the objective of
this<00:01:40.599> particular<00:01:41.140> routine<00:01:41.619> is<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.069> pop<00:01:42.610> the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
this particular routine is to pop the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.150 
this particular routine is to pop the
yellow<00:01:43.179> then<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.750> red<00:01:44.020> than<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> yellow<00:01:44.709> then<00:01:45.130> red

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
yellow then a red than a yellow then red

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.600 
yellow then a red than a yellow then red
and<00:01:45.670> take<00:01:45.849> the<00:01:45.970> balls<00:01:46.179> out<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:46.660> order<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
and take the balls out in order but the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.040 
and take the balls out in order but the
reason<00:01:48.849> why<00:01:48.970> it's<00:01:49.119> good<00:01:49.300> is<00:01:49.420> because<00:01:49.599> you<00:01:49.899> can

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
reason why it's good is because you can

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.410 
reason why it's good is because you can
work<00:01:50.289> out<00:01:50.530> where<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.429> cue<00:01:51.640> ball<00:01:51.819> is<00:01:51.910> going<00:01:52.270> off

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
work out where the cue ball is going off

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.809 
work out where the cue ball is going off
the<00:01:53.349> cushions<00:01:53.770> you've<00:01:54.130> got<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.399> make<00:01:54.640> sure

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
the cushions you've got to make sure

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
so you know allowed to come in through

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.330 
so you know allowed to come in through
the<00:01:59.020> ball<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.440> you<00:01:59.530> have<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.800> take<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.130> balls

the ball and you have to take the balls
in<00:02:00.640> order<00:02:01.860> working<00:02:02.860> your<00:02:02.979> way<00:02:03.009> all<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.399> way<00:02:03.520> up

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
in order working your way all the way up

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.580 
in order working your way all the way up
the<00:02:03.789> table<00:02:04.179> and<00:02:04.569> this<00:02:04.750> is<00:02:04.959> just<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.229> really<00:02:05.470> good

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
the table and this is just a really good

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.460 
the table and this is just a really good
routine<00:02:06.039> that<00:02:06.459> gets<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.880> into<00:02:07.319> working<00:02:08.319> out

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
routine that gets you into working out

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.080 
routine that gets you into working out
where<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> cue<00:02:09.130> ball<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.399> going<00:02:09.700> after<00:02:09.819> you've

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
where the cue ball is going after you've

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.449 
where the cue ball is going after you've
potted<00:02:10.479> one<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.810> balls<00:02:11.020> if<00:02:11.260> sometimes<00:02:12.250> you

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
potted one of the balls if sometimes you

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.280 
potted one of the balls if sometimes you
come<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.700> little<00:02:12.879> bit<00:02:13.180> too<00:02:13.599> straight<00:02:13.959> on<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
come a little bit too straight on the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.830 
come a little bit too straight on the
ball<00:02:14.439> you<00:02:14.620> then

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
ball you then

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.720 
ball you then
got<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.080> manipulate<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.739> cue<00:02:15.950> ball<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.430> be

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
got to manipulate the cue ball and be

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.220 
got to manipulate the cue ball and be
careful<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.360> don't<00:02:17.569> touch<00:02:17.810> one<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.080> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
careful that you don't touch one of the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.900 
careful that you don't touch one of the
other<00:02:18.379> balls<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.950> be<00:02:19.340> careful<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.819> you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
other balls and be careful that you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.369 
other balls and be careful that you
don't<00:02:20.030> knock<00:02:20.300> want<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.599> do<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> balls<00:02:21.050> into

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
don't knock want to do the balls into

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.750 
don't knock want to do the balls into
one<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> other<00:02:21.800> balls<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.610> a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
one of the other balls so it's just a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.670 
one of the other balls so it's just a
really<00:02:23.030> good<00:02:23.150> routine<00:02:23.540> for<00:02:24.170> trying<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.470> keep

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
really good routine for trying to keep

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.320 
really good routine for trying to keep
hold<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.129> cue<00:02:25.340> ball<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:26.209> argument's

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
hold of the cue ball so for argument's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.410 
hold of the cue ball so for argument's
sake<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:28.129> first<00:02:28.370> shot<00:02:28.640> he<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.790> potting<00:02:29.300> the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
sake the first shot he is potting the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.650 
sake the first shot he is potting the
yellow<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:29.900> know<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.709> natural<00:02:31.280> line<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.480> this

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
yellow I know the natural line of this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.630 
yellow I know the natural line of this
shot<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:33.140> topspin<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.459> take

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
shot with just topspin is going to take

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.670 
shot with just topspin is going to take
the<00:02:34.790> cue<00:02:35.030> ball<00:02:35.239> off<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.480> back<00:02:36.080> cushion<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the cue ball off the back cushion and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.280 
the cue ball off the back cushion and
back<00:02:37.160> out<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.760> then<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.599> next<00:02:38.629> ball<00:02:39.019> is<00:02:39.170> going

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
back out and then the next ball is going

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.720 
back out and then the next ball is going
to<00:02:39.379> be<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.519> on

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
to be this one and so on

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.210 
to be this one and so on
so<00:02:41.660> I'll<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:41.989> play<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.319> first<00:02:42.530> shot<00:02:42.769> here<00:02:42.980> so

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so I'll just play the first shot here so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.440 
so I'll just play the first shot here so
you<00:02:43.280> can<00:02:43.519> see<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:43.760> going<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:43.940> pop<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> yellow

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
you can see I'm going to pop the yellow

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.490 
you can see I'm going to pop the yellow
the<00:02:44.690> white<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:44.989> going<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.230> come<00:02:45.349> off<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
the white it's going to come off the

the white it's going to come off the
cushion<00:02:46.120> roughly<00:02:47.120> lined<00:02:47.390> around<00:02:47.540> here<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.880> pop

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
this is just going to be the natural

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.630 
this is just going to be the natural
line<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.260> cue<00:02:54.530> ball<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:54.860> going<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.099> potted<00:02:55.489> the
