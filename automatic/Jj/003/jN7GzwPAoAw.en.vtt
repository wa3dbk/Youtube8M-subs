00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 so hello everyone with you internet 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.969
 resources for review. we county on 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.750
 tests a set of memories of the company Kingston 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.260
 This Hyper X Fury We chose the top 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 model 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.830
 these are two strips with a total amount of 16 gigabytes 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.350
 with a frequency of 1866 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.570
 This is the top of the hour for this line 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.070
 I remind you that at one time this line 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.330
 replaced hyip on the market 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.660
 ics blue and after that she was 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.269
 replaced us and what is now top and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 flagship ruler to do it we and 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.960
 recently tested and test you can 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.819
 watch with us on the channel I will 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.069
 I will give a link to this test that is you 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:46.319
 can compare the fury we left on 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:50.219
 then in principle during this test we 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:53.370
 compare manufacturer ethics of these slats 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.499
 and whether or not to overpay 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 choose eventually fury is a memory yet 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:01.170
 available on the Russian market to buy it 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.359
 can it be the way it will cost for example 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.300
 Us 2000 is cheaper than a similar set 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.820
 savage and so shipped hyper x 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.810
 Yuriev traditionally plastic blister with 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.410
 transparent cover 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.460
 the plant is well protected from mechanical 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.690
 damage from static and at the same time 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 technical data here is printed on 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.190
 a sticker with the customerâ€™s memory 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.240
 will also receive a logo sticker 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.770
 Kingston Hyper X and warranty card 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 fell asleep several color options 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.900
 the performance of these slats is red 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.830
 black blue white several available 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.770
 variations with a frequency of 1333 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.890
 1600 and 1756 times on tests plus 4 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.380
 and 8 gigabytes and they are just 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.450
 we combine there is an option for 8 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.210
 for example if dual channel memory or 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.250
 16 our memory came in red 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.740
 performance looks striking spectacular 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.260
 aggressively the radiator here comes with 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.020
 complex configuration of cutouts and 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.790
 planes and in doing so it performs non 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.970
 only a decorative function but also 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.710
 improves heat dissipation from microcircuits 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.750
 the average working temperature of the chips is not 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.480
 more than 40 times I think that this is quite 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.370
 excellent stock recommended 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.000
 slat temperature 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.110
 It's 85 grams, two of us are lower than 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.290
 recommends 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.230
 and maximum manufacturer's bar when 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.239
 this musaevich and as in the jurassic 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.780
 the manufacturer has thought up compatibility 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.030
 radiator cooling system memory 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.350
 only slightly speaks on textolite 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.170
 just a couple of millimeters that is 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.390
 compatibility issues compatibility 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.550
 CPU cooling systems here 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.560
 arose should not under the radiator and 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.840
 we have black textolite 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.340
 and eight are soldered on each side 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.620
 types that are produced by phoenix 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.140
 companies this solution is well known 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.660
 they were the same and the solution was good 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.019
 being chased and at the same time working reliably on 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.180
 declared by the manufacturer clean yet 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.040
 one advantage of the Kingston Hyper X plan 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.650
 fury is a low level worker 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.060
 voltage of one and a half wool does not go 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.160
 like ordinary modules with 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.370
 effective work is starting from 1700 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.440
 6 megahertz though in ordinary slats 1033 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.329
 remember memory starts working on 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.739
 recommend in timings and read immediately 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.540
 after installation on the payment with no need 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.700
 understand climbing bells you will have 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.370
 works as it should be used here 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.380
 combination of intel technology and technology 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.769
 ampy, that is, we work stone 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.560
 1011 10-30 and by tradition we hold 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.600
 attempts to overclock the memory modules according to our 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.150
 managed to set managed to reach better 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.890
 results is the frequency of 2000 megahertz 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.970
 storing the voltage block it 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.650
 eleven twelve eleven 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.100
 timings purity 2133 megahertz 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.590
 demanded an increase in voltage to 55 and 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.650
 155 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.780
 these are migi 1 out of 11 11 and maximum 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.780
 the bar for these of our set 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.810
 us fix the article 2400 megahertz 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.040
 but the voltage was filed raised to 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.780
 165 and 113 timings 12 somehow so let's 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.940
 look at the data of synthetic tests 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.709
 also suggest to compare this memory with 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.030
 those sets that we had previously 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.019
 that is, all these tests can also 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.989
 look at our site and get acquainted 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.910
 with these slats the whole is summing up 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.880
 packingtown hyper iks fury they 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.600
 sold great results 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.190
 the performance of the interesting will be in 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.810
 first enthusiast here is a good one 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.540
 overclocking potential stylish appearance 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.040
 compatibility of the cooling system and there are 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.630
 interest to ordinary users then 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.790
 we have nude modules 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.800
 set and forget does not require special 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.990
 knowledge bios settings that is just 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.690
 put on pay us everything works on 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.410
 frequency of 1756 megahertz and and good 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.880
 speed and performance 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.630
 is achieved 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.030
 and of course Hyper X Savich will 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.479
 bypass and by frequencies and whenever possible 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.120
 acceleration 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.100
 this memory is of course newer and plus a little 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.320
 the level of performance is also higher 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.870
 at base frequencies it is noticeable and 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.840
 graphics you could see it but Hyperix 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.610
 fury is obtained memory can be said 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.280
 outdated of so can be called and 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.240
 this allows you to save on the purchase 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.610
 memory modules 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.710
 decide and of course you. but then or 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.599
 no your attention span signed channel 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.110
 and many many many thanks and thanks 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.110
 bye Bye
