00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.233
Metamorphosis of Insects

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.966
In 4 B.C,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.300
"Living things are spontaneously
generated from non-living things." -Aristotle

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.133
In 17th century in Germany,

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:49.633
Merian's Metamorphosis

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.933
Larvae are born from trash

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.833
and fireflies are born from
dew found on the grass.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:06.333
For 2,000 years, a general idea
on insects has been

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.666
"I wish those petty,
annoying things would disappear!"

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:27.333
But there was a girl who took pleasure
only in observing insects.

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:35.433
Her eyes watched the beautiful stroke,
then were fixed at a certain thing.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:41.700
Something stuck on the branch.
A solid seed?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.400
After a season of observation,
she witnessed

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:57.166
a magical transformation.

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:05.533
"That's when I realized."

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.333
The ordinary girl was encouraged by

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:18.833
this dramatic change.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:26.000
"My job is to tell people
about this miracle!"

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:29.866
However

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:34.733
"A woman should learn
housework and get married!"

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.200
Despite all sorts of prejudice

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:46.166
Merian never stopped
observing insects.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:51.366
At last, at the age of 52,
she left for a remote tropical area

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.633
and published "Metamorphosis of
the Insects of Surinam" (1705).

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:07.966
"A caterpillar had an enormous appetite and
flipped over swiftly when slightly nudged."

00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:17.466
"For about 15 minutes, a pupa could not hold still
and kept on twitching for about 15 minutes."

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:27.733
"A pupa became a moth with six dark
yellow spots and dark unique patterns."

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.333
Eggs

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.633
A caterpillar

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.266
A pupa

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:44.100
A moth

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:49.033
People's reaction

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:55.033
"Finally, everyone now believes
the metamorphosis of the insects."

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:02.300
An ordinary girl's metamorphosis
to a female entomologist

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.966
Maria Sibylla Merian (1647 - 1717)
