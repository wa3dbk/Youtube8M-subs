00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.179
 good evening here to something 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.839
 and today so I will show you how michel beaulac and your pay not 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:25.779
 two 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.880
 to the firmware 4 1 3 points 3 with the missing jumbo software is committed which is 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.640
 released today so that m 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.580
 by the comex since the time she had announced in which children 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.140
 so there we can see falling in the company of a must not be no 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.500
 mine 2 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.180
 so that's kind of big for the army camera 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.469
 so with her 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.430
 the camera 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 we are well then but we have teeth in settings 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
 wait it takes a little space on the screen sorry 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.070
 it's not like an iphone we'll try to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.070
 they put themselves well as it should 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.380
 here 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.610
 so 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.750
 innovation 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.240
 my general m 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.430
 information 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.119
 sorry sir as I'm a little on the side 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.030
 but maybe too big 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.940
 83 'takes three tries less 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.220
 we did a little zoom that you have seen that we are green 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.450
 for four in 3 against 3 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 so here are more likely subjects 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.480
 setting up 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.420
 so from there% you have to connect to wifi of course 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.610
 so for me on safari 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.090
 one day advise you to clear 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.640
 all your screens tori tian 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 so you have his dionne taste 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.969
 this is where you type michel beaulac 8 common points i believe in it 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 good summer mid 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400
 but in some common points 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.289
 frankly I am a possible 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.999
 at 29 years old dancing the first bone so 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.579
 click on I could not anymore 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.789
 so there you will arrive on a small windows at the top 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.789
 in which also to say you just have to press 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:25.719
 right here 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.479
 then installs 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.049
 so I'm going to have a little pop-up window 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.869
 who will you ask if 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.010
 still not you see so you already have 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.259
 waiting for the kid who is on the side of cydia 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:41.009
 who is lining up loading here you can see 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:43.619
 So here is 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.489
 I thought he had a little pop-up window that would fail 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.019
 to ask if he wanted the job wauquiez 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.049
 good apparently it did not do so much better 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.659
 maybe it'll come after 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.709
 so that's me downloadable 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.019
 can I tell you in what interest tobin especially good hesitate 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.209
 not to visit them so that our site 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.429
 women than men 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:09.459
 and also an inquiry go on our youtube channel and subscribe 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.350
 so that will allow you to have a little 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.350
 all the videos we put online 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:21.229
 alassane soon finished not come forward the little advance bar that goes ahead 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.729
 quietly 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.559
 we are on cydia 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.559
 my heart ban courses together since 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.179
 I'm doing it for the first time the user 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:38.529
 so that seems to be 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.529
 like that day it takes now it's the same thing 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.040
 for me it was not very long ago for the dge volokhine our 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.719
 city 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.719
 a little less than 24 minutes 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.909
 so the army to have passed so we changed them well 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.839
 so that all applications 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.049
 we want 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.979
 according to not once are you there and that's exactly like for your 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.889
 iphone you enter your sources 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.979
 but then what will allow you blockade to bet rewards 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.839
 everything you need 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.870
 So that's a hundred percent 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.900
 it ends up 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.920
 so we can see that in good english so that's where we see the same thing 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.120
 so we have 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.800
 if 10 hours 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.650
 6th category 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.289
 the news 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.610
 to install here 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.680
 the sources and if the searches but that's it 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.479
 so all that finish 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.680
 so to let finish 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.240
 loaded rondot 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.970
 for the bank will listen to it was very fast for the job for which 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.440
 would have no follow-up it would have taken a long time to accommodate 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.879
 excellent to go out without his patch may 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.249
 the main thing is that it's done we learn from elsewhere so I you 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.409
 advise to put the patch the pdf 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.379
 to just seemingly avoid and small flaws 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.080
 so for him some other 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.349
 p at the time the iphone we did not see tonight 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.930
 be violated we will say 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.240
 so I grant you the enstone patch 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.730
 so that was not like coach helps us for the turbo and 4-3-3 for 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.009
