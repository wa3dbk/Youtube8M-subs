00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.770
 good and now since I've got the 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.169
 who teaches me the passport I will teach 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.209
 a series of things here the bureaucracy what 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.889
 is everything and then to get out 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.860
 of the country you need is that on your ticket 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.439
 the you put a series of stamps up 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.390
 four seals are you to the fireman who 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.269
 Of course I do not check anything on the bike 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 these two are from these customs these two 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:34.230
 are this national security 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.899
 right now I do not remember but also 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.250
 It is a gymkhana to get each one of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.899
 the stamps so you can get through 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.899
 tests well the most important 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:53.179
 that I have managed to follow me the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.329
 hunting exit visa are even though my 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.960
 Azerbaijani visa is not right I 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.750
 I will explain why my visa 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.380
 officially begins on June 20, 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.289
 2013 is to say tomorrow today we are up to date 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.070
 19 but it turns out that when I 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:17.420
 delivered yesterday the ship was leaving today or 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.190
 yesterday it was supposed and the boat leaves every 7 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.200
 days and you never know exactly when 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.789
 I could not miss this opportunity and for 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.159
 I have not come so bad either 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:30.259
 delay then absolutely not have 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.459
 fixed that today is not day 20 but 19 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.490
 I could have always argued that the 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.709
 bakÃº ship reached last at 12 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.270
 tonight is to say the 20th but 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.270
 according to your legislation very 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.299
 strict they could have sent me 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 back because you have to remember that the 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.709
 boats are territory of the country of their 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.680
 flag and the ship where I'm going to get 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:54.990
 It is a boat from Azerbaijan 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 I hope this video 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.570
 Just be a joke and when you go to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.270
 go up do not notice the cake and I 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.860
 return because you have to be clear 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.570
 to all those who travel the world 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.280
 is that the countries of the old union 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.360
 Soviet are Stalinist mentality 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.690
 bureaucratized to the top and details as 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.810
 a wrong date on a visa makes 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.650
 everything goes back 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.870
 are not 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.010
 flexible at all nobody assumes a 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.580
 risk and this administration is not 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.470
 no joke 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.640
 but nothing big man that seems to have 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.640
 luck again to the hands
