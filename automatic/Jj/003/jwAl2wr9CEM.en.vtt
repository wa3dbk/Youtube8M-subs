00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.800
 for friends a cordial greeting from your 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.510
 trainer marcelo today I'm going to 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.849
 answer my friend johnny that I 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.150
 write from colombia 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.249
 johnny tells me meeting people I'm 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.170
 doing a lot of exercise studying the 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.890
 gym and lifting a lot of weight but not 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.990
 he managed to increase muscle mass me 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.180
 I should take a vacation rest 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.970
 for a few weeks and bring back 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.040
 exercises I can tell johnny is 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.890
 that if you want to take a vacation 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.390
 a few weeks to rest from so much 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.240
 exercise of both lifting 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.270
 Weights you can do will not do anything 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.120
 even up to force as we are 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.880
 lifting weights the strength that we have 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 acquired lasts up to 90 days 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.410
 after 90 days and we are already 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.350
 lifting the same weight the force goes to 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.239
 start to decrease but always when 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.520
 we go back to the gym we will not be of 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.500
 new to where 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.240
 to the same amount of weights of 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 we raised before because the force 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.410
 force was diminishing true but if 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.910
 it takes about two weeks of vacation 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.370
 nothing will happen to you, you will have the 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.800
 same strength when I come back from the gym 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.070
 will continue to raise the same 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.900
 amount of weight now not that mass grows 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.900
 muscle can be because it is not 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.420
 consuming enough protein 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.690
 protein because in the examples are the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.660
 more meat the chicken the fish the egg 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.570
 and the beans or by others as they say 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.640
 Some of our countries in South America 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 that's protein and protein what 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 does in the body is that it repairs keeps 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 and increases muscle mass ok I can 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.619
 do all the weight lifting and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.600
 I want but if I do not consume protein, 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.610
 I'm going to grow in muscle mass if I do not go 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.830
 to put super strong I'll be super 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.160
 super strong super slim too 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.810
 because the protein is not enough for 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.310
 example I will give an example to me 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.750
 friend sionni 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 which it is my particular case to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.170
 keep my muscle mass according to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.229
 my weight and the amount of exercises that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.020
 I do I need around 100 grams 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.870
 of protein and how much does it do 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.140
 no gram of protein for example a 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.330
 chicken breast is like 25 according 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.920
 the size also of course but a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.650
 chicken breast is more or less between 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.230
 25 and 30 grams each chicken breast 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.380
 let's say 25 grams to make the numbers 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.370
 round 25 grams would be a breast of 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.230
 chicken I need 4 chicken breast 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.310
 during the day to keep my mass 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.739
 muscular 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.830
 now if I want to grow muscle mass by 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.739
 course lifting weights I have to 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.080
 increase that consumption of breasts 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.849
 chicken I think it increases 56 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.950
 families to 125 150 grams of protein if 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.739
 is that I lift a lot of weight if I do not lift 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.550
 I do not need the excess protein 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.440
 why 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.110
 what happens also is that the body goes 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.970
 to consume the necessary protein and the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.700
 rest will be stored somewhere 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.130
 that is going to be in grasita we do not want that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.440
 so do not exceed the consumption of 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.000
 protein either if they are not 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.680
 exercising or lifting weights 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.070
 remember that the protein is going to help 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.890
 to increase muscle mass always and 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.440
 when to lift the heavy weight right 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.330
 ok then in my particular case I in 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.460
 Site 4 chicken breasts during 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.230
 day to maintain my muscle mass if 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.030
 I want to increase muscle mass 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.120
 because I'm increasing the weight 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.980
 I need more protein so that my mass 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.870
 muscle grow I have to add more 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.280
 Breasts for rest I do not go to 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.740
 eat chicken breasts all day 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.870
 also as I told you before the meats the 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.560
 fish the liquors and the egg also 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.170
 they are sources of 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.610
 protected everything a diet is based 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.489
 balanced but this is only a 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.099
 example and in my particular case that are 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.090
 pairs summarizing johnny and for all 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.819
 the people who are in it 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.319
 situation that I neither is that one two three 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.730
 weeks of vacation is not going to do 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.200
 nothing force is still going to be there 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.769
 when I return the gym will continue 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.110
 lifting the same weight where it goes to 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.940
 do anything so take a break and 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.340
 now to grow muscle mass very 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.440
 important the weight is increased and 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.209
 wants to grow muscle mass is not left 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.329
 another one that has to increase the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.690
 protein consumption also that yes I do not 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.520
 they grow is because they are not giving much 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.070
 necessary consumption to the body so that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.450
 grow muscle mass 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.250
 good from her thanks for looking at this 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.470
