00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.009
 in many consumer elements the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.750
 user has information 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.480
 important product that acquires 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 where can you check the qualities the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.340
 origin or indicators that warn of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.290
 the conditions of use 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 the new European labeling is 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.680
 mandatory for those tires 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.990
 manufactured as of July 1 , 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.730
 2012 offering useful information to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 user so you can take the best 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.990
 purchase decision the three parameters 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.140
 that are taken into account are 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.180
 the fuel efficiency 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.070
 tires are responsible for the consumption 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.470
 of about one in five 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.910
 deposits the savings in the consumption of a 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.180
 car with four efficient tires 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.090
 of class a can reach 75 percent 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.980
 which represents a saving of more than 300 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.710
 euros throughout the life of the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.540
 tire the Spaniards could save 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.460
 more than one billion euros in 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.500
 fuel if the tires sold 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.300
 in a year they were efficiency class 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.610
 energy 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.680
 regarding missions the European commission 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.140
 estimated that thanks to the label 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 will reduce CO2 emissions in 20 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.369
 millions of tons per year 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.780
 the grip on wet 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.170
 A class tires can reduce 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.030
 braking distance up to 30% at 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.759
 80 kilometers per hour is a 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.829
 reduction of 18 meters the equivalent to 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.829
 4 times the length of a vehicle 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.750
 the external noise level 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.759
 a tire with three or more emit 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.580
 four times more noise compared to another 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.690
 with a wave the quieter a 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.850
 tire better for the environment 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.100
 in the development of the tires it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.020
 take into account more than 50 criteria 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.480
 benefits such as the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.290
 planning the water resistance 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.990
 Handling on wet and dry 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.070
 the dry braking distance the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.070
 high speed stability 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.680
 or also the useful life and 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.950
 durability in good condition 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 tire
