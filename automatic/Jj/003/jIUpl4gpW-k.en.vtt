this with one part of this this is the
hardener<00:02:13.810> actually<00:02:14.350> have<00:02:14.440> two<00:02:14.560> reducer

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
hardener actually have two reducer

there<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.019> go<00:02:19.110> that's<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.620> hardener<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
there we go that's the hardener and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
there we go that's the hardener and
you'll<00:02:20.790> do<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.180> part<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.599> hardener<00:02:21.900> twelve

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
you'll do one part of hardener twelve

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.740 
you'll do one part of hardener twelve
parts<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.680> color<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.430> kinds<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.120> cool<00:02:24.390> colors

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.449 
the way still couldn't get it to shoot
properly<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.319> what<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.500> did<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.919> connected<00:03:32.370> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
properly so what I did is connected it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.110 
properly so what I did is connected it
to<00:03:32.489> my<00:03:32.639> little<00:03:32.970> craftsman<00:03:34.280> shop<00:03:35.280> compressor

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
to my little craftsman shop compressor

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.599 
to my little craftsman shop compressor
and<00:03:36.660> then<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.109> were<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.290> business<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:38.040> did

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
and then we were in business I did

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.759 
and then we were in business I did
notice<00:03:38.910> here's<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.480> airbrush<00:03:39.959> as<00:03:40.349> it<00:03:40.590> comes

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
notice here's the airbrush as it comes

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.020 
notice here's the airbrush as it comes
out<00:03:40.859> still<00:03:41.160> got<00:03:41.280> color<00:03:41.519> in<00:03:41.700> there<00:03:41.819> I'm<00:03:41.880> gonna

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
out still got color in there I'm gonna

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.879 
out still got color in there I'm gonna
have<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.209> clean<00:03:42.389> it<00:03:42.419> real<00:03:42.660> quick<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.139> but

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
have to clean it real quick here but

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.349 
have to clean it real quick here but
this<00:03:44.069> little<00:03:44.220> hose<00:03:44.459> right<00:03:44.639> here<00:03:44.700> kept<00:03:45.090> popping

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
this little hose right here kept popping

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.509 
this little hose right here kept popping
off<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.530> have<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> hold<00:03:46.919> on<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.190> that'll

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
off so you have to hold on to that'll

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.520 
off so you have to hold on to that'll
I'll<00:03:47.669> figure<00:03:48.150> out<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.359> way<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.630> attach<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.410> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
I'll figure out a way to attach that and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.190 
I'll figure out a way to attach that and
keep<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.709> attached<00:03:50.250> solidly<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.840> as<00:03:52.049> you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
keep that attached solidly but as you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.509 
keep that attached solidly but as you
can<00:03:52.319> see<00:03:52.560> at<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.739> beginning<00:03:52.799> in<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.190> video

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
can see at the beginning in the video

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.849 
can see at the beginning in the video
with<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:53.910> compressor<00:03:54.630> man<00:03:55.019> we<00:03:55.590> were<00:03:55.709> in

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
with that compressor man we were in

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.069 
with that compressor man we were in
business<00:03:56.099> was<00:03:56.819> able<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.180> cope<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.750> scope

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
business was able to cope this scope

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.699 
business was able to cope this scope
this<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> Bushnell<00:03:59.720> 3200<00:04:00.720> tactical<00:04:01.260> scope<00:04:01.500> I

this is a Bushnell 3200 tactical scope I
think<00:04:02.010> 5<00:04:02.280> by<00:04:02.519> 15<00:04:02.579> power<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.919> smooth

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
think 5 by 15 power it is smooth

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.390 
think 5 by 15 power it is smooth
anodized<00:04:06.239> aluminum<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.109> anything<00:04:08.069> that<00:04:08.099> is

just<00:05:36.300> degreased<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.200> really<00:05:37.469> good<00:05:37.620> actually

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
just degreased it really good actually

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.089 
just degreased it really good actually
twice<00:05:38.400> washed<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.599> let<00:05:40.169> it<00:05:40.289> air<00:05:40.440> dry<00:05:40.469> and<00:05:40.979> then

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
twice washed it let it air dry and then

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.300 
twice washed it let it air dry and then
we<00:05:41.159> shot<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:42.050> I<00:05:43.050> think<00:05:43.440> I<00:05:43.529> had<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.710> little<00:05:43.860> spot

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
we shot it I think I had a little spot

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.879 
we shot it I think I had a little spot
of<00:05:44.639> oil<00:05:45.060> on<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.659> barrel<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.229> it<00:05:46.320> was<00:05:46.440> beating

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
of oil on the barrel and it was beating

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.080 
of oil on the barrel and it was beating
up<00:05:47.099> I<00:05:47.750> think<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:48.840> overshot<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.469> though<00:05:49.560> so<00:05:50.090> same

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
up I think I overshot it though so same

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.820 
up I think I overshot it though so same
with<00:05:51.240> stock<00:05:51.479> just<00:05:51.719> degreased<00:05:52.200> it<00:05:52.349> cleaned<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
with stock just degreased it cleaned it

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.469 
with stock just degreased it cleaned it
really<00:05:53.130> well<00:05:53.279> since<00:05:53.520> it's<00:05:53.729> already<00:05:53.969> a<00:05:54.150> matte

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.790 
color didn't go with a camo pattern
right<00:06:43.210> off<00:06:43.389> I<00:06:43.630> might<00:06:43.900> in<00:06:44.050> the<00:06:44.169> future<00:06:44.590> with

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
right off I might in the future with

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.320 
right off I might in the future with
future<00:06:45.100> projects<00:06:45.610> and<00:06:45.669> my<00:06:45.789> buddies<00:06:46.090> and<00:06:46.240> I

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
future projects and my buddies and I

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.129 
future projects and my buddies and I
will<00:06:46.990> try<00:06:47.199> that<00:06:47.229> too<00:06:47.699> but<00:06:48.699> the<00:06:49.389> only<00:06:49.570> downside

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
will try that too but the only downside

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.980 
will try that too but the only downside
I<00:06:50.169> would<00:06:50.350> say<00:06:50.530> to<00:06:50.590> the<00:06:50.860> Dirk<00:06:51.039> hope<00:06:51.810> process<00:06:52.810> is

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
I would say to the Dirk hope process is

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.580 
I would say to the Dirk hope process is
probably<00:06:53.530> cost<00:06:54.130> it<00:06:54.460> is<00:06:54.580> not<00:06:54.960> inexpensive<00:06:55.960> it

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
probably cost it is not inexpensive it

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.500 
probably cost it is not inexpensive it
costs<00:06:57.010> a<00:06:57.070> fair<00:06:57.280> amount<00:06:57.370> of<00:06:57.580> money<00:06:57.760> and<00:06:58.000> some

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
costs a fair amount of money and some

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.990 
costs a fair amount of money and some
