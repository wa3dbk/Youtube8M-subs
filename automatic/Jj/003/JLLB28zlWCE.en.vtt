00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello, I think everything is already in the know 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.200
 latest news about what 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.910
 microsoft bought mojang 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 and for a pretty tidy sum 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.410
 two and a half billion dollars 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.859
 after that the internet started 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.949
 spread srach like oh god it's the end 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 brand all mine craft never again 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.090
 will become the same and so on 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 I would like to express my point of view 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.039
 about this which of course nobody 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.619
 not interested but still let's for 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.110
 begin to understand what follows after all this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 well first brand official mine 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.950
 will start to belong to microsoft and they 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.059
 will be able to control further 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.250
 game development 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.160
 but don't forget what they bought 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 company in addition it means that rather 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.539
 all development will continue the same 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.449
 Well, what works Mahjong, what is there 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.750
 Like everything should not change in the second 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.809
 can begin and quite tough fight with 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.930
 piracy is of course pretty bad 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.600
 because I myself am a pirate of significant changes 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.070
 there should be no more microsoft 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.260
 stated that he was going to do 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.610
 maynkravt more affordable well by 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.920
 financial exactly sphere 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.299
 make it on different platforms this 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.939
 the way is very cool and nothing else 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.189
 just understand one thing minkravt 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.570
 continue to develop mojang just 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.030
 now under the guidance and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.960
 financing by microsoft no more 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.850
 so I guess just for now 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.250
 exactly the purpose of why they did it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.470
 yet still mysterious well, most likely 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.409
 to cut the dough but I'm still not 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.840
 I will get into these things because it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.840
 to some extent my business i'm not 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.479
 completely understand the only thing sorry 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 the fact that the night leaves the studio after all he 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 its founder and so just go away well we 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.210
 never forget him well on that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 all now you understand that in principle 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.880
 nothing bad happened and if 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.970
 minecraft will start to happen 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.510
 bad blame everything on jam 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.790
 that's the way i mk and microsoft too well i 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.860
 I think that microsoft will not allow itself 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.990
 just so take and roll this brand 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.810
 because damn microsoft will hit by 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.450
 your lip in reputation well, just understand 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 correct that at least nothing 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.230
 bad things must happen that are not 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.010
 everything is done for the better 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.060
 Okay, so I hope so good luck 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.060
 bye everyone
