this<00:00:44.550> problem<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.510> we've<00:00:45.719> been<00:00:45.750> using

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this problem you know we've been using

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
think it's better to go back to the

think it's better to go back to the
using<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> good<00:00:50.489> old<00:00:50.640> bar<00:00:50.789> soap<00:00:51.120> now<00:00:51.840> this
