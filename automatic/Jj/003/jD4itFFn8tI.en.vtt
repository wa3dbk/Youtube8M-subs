00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.810
 hey here burned again in the music house 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.529
 Kirstein and I want to tell you something about 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.050
 tell the pdf that td is 11 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.020
 also in the supernatural series of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.870
 how james settled the td 11 is 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.540
 equipped with 190 grams and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.210
 percussion sounds of this song you can 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.200
 of course also change 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.270
 so for example in tuning but you can 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.310
 even in tgf as in the big ones 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.040
 Brothers, for example, the rustling of the 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.810
 new carpet nehrbass called for 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.770
 example at the toms or bites the 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.530
 bassdrum add more or lose weight 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.409
 which of course is more realistic 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.790
 According to the game , you have equipped 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.420
 also with a four-volume 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.780
 equalizer twice heights twice deep 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 and an ambiance effect section 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.260
 of course, you can content of the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.960
 Change drum sets 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.360
 You can put the drums in for example 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.330
 put different spaces and also 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.960
 thus again a completely new environment for 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.080
 equip your drums equipped 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000
 the tdl is also the function as 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.450
 cd 11 is with the function of the quick 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.520
 recording equipped the smallest 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.409
 study the world with a push of a button 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.409
 reachable I just press the button 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:02:06.990
 standby and as soon as I start now 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:02:08.640
 play it absorbs also included 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.879
 is also the coach function 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.340
 that means I have shared checks check 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.109
 count or warm up that I have 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.129
 a proper training partner with the 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.859
 I can work 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.389
 For example, Quaid Count wants that 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.139
 i only show it once when i see it 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.170
 accepting 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.389
 I have one click that means he is running 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.609
 for two or four clocks and then 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:41.540
 he is gone then gets loud again 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:44.669
 added away now and 23 42 34 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.120
 So that means four clocks 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.680
 the fourth clock then simply rented 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.379
 is or very sorry and you are trying 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.150
 alone to keep your timing thereby 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.029
 Do you have the possibility of your timing 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.379
 to improve enormously 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:03:02.040
 I'll play you some more different ones 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:24.559
 for example drum'n'bass 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:24.559
 at the time well- waged bankrupt 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:44.900
 or processes and since the turn will be us 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.180
 Team this for area for example 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:04:03.579
 of course is also on the way 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:04:21.620
 but also for example 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:25.370
 a ballad sit &amp; feel a lot more 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.130
 there are also you have to discover 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.669
 the possibility of your usb stick 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.270
 to connect and thus can directly from the 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.610
 usb stick for example own mp3 songs 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.800
 you can also play these mp3 songs 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.900
 change in speed 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.580
 for example, there is a feeling 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.289
 to hear or just if I have one 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.220
 song too fast that they too 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.289
 I can play directly with internally 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.430
 but also some songs and music 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.620
 grind to the selection 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.030
 I have a music loop now 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.840
 loop called for you over 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.479
 I really like the topic 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.310
 11 in the music house kirstein check out times 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.310
 I wish you a lot of fun watch out
