00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.259
 here is a real pilot, let's go 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.320
 you know it this car is 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.079
 an audi lmp1 the queen category of 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.730
 four categories present at 24 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.120
 mans hours and that's fine 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.699
 to win 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.010
 in 2008 its particularity is that it 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.220
 is open no coach and as they say 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.949
 but beware from 2014 it's 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.879
 finished all that there will be more lmp1 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.760
 open leaves no stone the category 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.109
 lmp1 they are real prototypes 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.510
 that is, engineers have 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.070
 carte blanche to design its 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.269
 cars unlike the category 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.179
 great tourism 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.330
 the gt which are cars but by 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.920
 production that changes in 2014 and the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.289
 width of the cars they are more 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.530
 narrow 10 cm tires in 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.479
 reality are 5 cm narrower in lmp1 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.250
 all cars now his 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.110
 coach and cut themselves off at 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.570
 contrary of the trays previously 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.940
 for security reasons but the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.649
 big fred change this will be the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.209
 visibility is better to have an eye in 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.030
 the retro ones because there so to speak 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:30.300
 we only see in front of cameras 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 embedded 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.060
 I would like us to talk about the car 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.409
 lmp1 2014 the news makes them the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.539
 cars that you will see on the track 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.520
 apart from maybe a few screws my 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.170
 strictly nothing in common with with 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.700
 that of energy exactly that's 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.110
 completely new and why to which 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.210
 level at the security level the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.610
 security has been improved 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.579
 on three major points the visibility 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.880
 the viewing angles of the 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.799
 pilots to see better we introduced 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.289
 wheel retention cables for 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.360
 avoid in a crash that a wheel then 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.069
 fly into the public or on 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.530
 commissioners etc and finally the last 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.900
 point they are zion panels this 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.510
 which is a specific material that 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 allows on the sides of the chassis the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.410
 car to avoid the intrusion of 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.760
 of metallic elements that could 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.959
 hurt the pilot so here is a 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.580
 little three big news 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.040
 in terms of security 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.299
 but after that the builders have the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.160
 possibility of reducing their consumption 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.870
 as he wishes 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 each manufacturer has the possibility of 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.780
 do the engine he wants he has a very 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.660
 great freedom in the hall 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.920
 architecture of its engine now 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.530
 the man enters a new 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.630
 racing generation for 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.799
 save 30% fuel the key 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.930
 it's the hybrid engine 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.000
 there are several recovery systems 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.470
 of energy I believe today in two 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.290
 large families that will be found in 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.459
 2014 energy recovery system 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.799
 kinetic 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.989
 that is, we will recover from 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.750
 energy when the car brakes and 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.280
 there is another energy that is 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.170
 recoverable again it's the one on 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.760
 the exhaust gases the builders 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.019
 are going to play essentially on these two 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.380
 recovery systems there are some 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.660
 other 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.819
 so there are no others that are 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.069
 imposed by the Regulation they are 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.420
 free it turns out that so far is 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.790
 so the knowledge that we have of 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.829
 cars that will compete in 2014 this 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.510
 will be his two main types of 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.549
 energy recovery energy 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.109
 kinetics and gas energy 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.780
 exhaust that will be put in 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.400
 account 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.220
 with the new rules the lmp1 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.700
 change and the tires also they will 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.220
 less wide 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.990
 it's good doha - rubbing but 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.690
 that we'll talk about in our next 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.650
 meet ten long stone is expected 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.650
 murray of orange was played
