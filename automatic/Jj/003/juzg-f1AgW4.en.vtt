00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello andré in today's video I show 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.350
 you a typical shoulder training 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 I do the same for the back 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.529
 the shoulder two different 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 workouts the first one is here in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.769
 my studies and then the second one 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.600
 again at mcfit where i am then 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.600
 mainly heavy dumbbells users 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.289
 my shoulder is typically there 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.030
 training from five different exercises 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.040
 It is always a serious exercise here 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.170
 today in my studio at the multi 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.640
 press is always an exercise for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.010
 the lateral shoulder area so one 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.570
 since then someday 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.879
 front and rear shoulder area 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.879
 each and an exercise for the neck area 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.039
 I do two heavy exercises per exercise 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.360
 eight to twelve repetitions and im 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.399
 there is something else to add 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 lighter set up to 15 repetitions 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 and again really nice blood in the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.339
 Musculature 1 I could start 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.040
 usually my shoulder work garden 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.420
 with shoulders back at the multi press 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.979
 I do the first two sentences without 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.090
 backrest so that hull and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.070
 abdominal muscles right again 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.689
 have to work and all 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.610
 stabilizing shoulder muscles still 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.610
 times to use properly 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.900
 the court did not do much so that the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.610
 Arms in any case so far down 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.220
 it can leave the upper arms under the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.630
 Parallel should come to the bottom rod 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.880
 be drained under the child 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.049
 at the back there are about 50 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.049
 kilo for the first two sets 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.750
 the heavy shoulder make pullback 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.860
 I can lay it down here with me 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.580
 me now completely on the back 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.580
 focus 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.560
 It is important that the city ​​is slow 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 is lowered and controlled 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 is pressed high 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.430
 what I'm working on next 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.820
 all picture that with live since 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.080
 cable train 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.850
 It is important for me that 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.730
 The traders come to the front 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.500
 Crossing over means that means the poor 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.570
 Be practically beyond the middle 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.760
 taken forward together 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.620
 the first little piece of movement 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.690
 bring the lateral deltas again 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 really great tension and maximum 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.080
 burden 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.850
 here I try the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.680
 upwards movement controlled nicely 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.310
 make the downward movement relative 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.780
 Slowly try to get maximum tension 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.780
 to keep in the deltas 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.200
 Next, I edit the back 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.060
 shoulder head with or presented with 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.730
 further in handy in this case a 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.079
 multi press here it is important that in the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.189
 highest point of the movement 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.340
 shoulder blades really nice 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.079
 the exercises are compressed 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.090
 should always be a bit of 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.799
 body splayed so really 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.010
 the deltas work and not the 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.010
 Messiah 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.430
 in this exercise I try in 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.980
 the highest point of the movement is the voltage 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.540
 to keep very short and again a 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:04:00.310
 little muscle feeling in the inner 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:04:02.320
 delta to stick the front shoulder 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.320
 head, I work with frank races 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.120
 a dumbbell bar I lean back 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.390
 here with the back and with the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.530
 I avoid pools on a wall 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.700
 just that I am swinging 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.040
 deflect 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.209
 so the front delta really has to be 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.209
 to do all the work 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.599
 next there are trucks at the multi 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.099
 press on the come when you at the 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.229
 multi presse training should in 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.240
 Upper body very slightly forward 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.620
 bend then you actually have one 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.970
 optimal train angle for the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.740
 neck muscles the upward movement 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.539
 is a little faster here 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.009
 For that I try the top point the 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.780
 a bit to hold us tension 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.780
 slow and controlled to let down 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.990
 pay attention to the fact that the 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.490
 legs should remain completely unmoved 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.270
 in no case swing out of the two 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.270
 rausholen 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.170
 ok friends day of recording is day 32 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.240
 out of 60 the last two weeks very much 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.730
 suboptimal by private stress and 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.080
 was through a lot of work nutrition 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.820
 okay, but I have a lot 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.170
 Water pulled by the stress of what you get 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.690
 now looks just so in the abdomen 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.980
 a little bit soft 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.810
 that means for me I have four now 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.240
 weeks to give gas properly many 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.740
 cardio training nutrition really needs 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:58.350
 hundred percent agree that 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:06:00.270
 Of course, I will also do weight training 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.890
 from this week now four to five 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.600
 cardio units in the week pure in 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.900
 That means 40 minutes of interval training 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.240
 on the spinning and again completely 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.680
 on low carb I felt the last 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.680
 do not fit one hundred percent fit 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:24.930
 what do we learn from this, let yourself be private 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:26.610
 do not stress willi info well in advance 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.200
 people today I thank you from the 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.900
 place to watch I hope you are 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.370
 again next time 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.370
 say goodbye and thanks
