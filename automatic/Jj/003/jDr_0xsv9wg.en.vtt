hi I'm Stefano from visual impact in

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.550 
hi I'm Stefano from visual impact in
Cape<00:00:05.850> Town<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:07.109> gonna<00:00:07.230> run<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.529> through

Cape Town and I'm gonna run you through
some<00:00:07.710> interesting<00:00:08.040> tests<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.639> did<00:00:08.820> using

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
some interesting tests that we did using

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.190 
some interesting tests that we did using
the<00:00:09.960> f5<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> f55<00:00:11.550> Sony's<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.929> area

in terms of a normal exposure I would

in terms of a normal exposure I would

okay<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.400> not<00:02:08.520> getting<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.150> okay<00:02:09.930> so

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
okay but I'm not getting that okay so

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.410 
okay but I'm not getting that okay so
straight<00:02:10.770> away<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.760> see<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.120> exposure

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
straight away I can see the exposure
