00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 the new sample that is really a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.500
 small sample for a workshop that 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.530
 will dictate the technique is stone paste 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.080
 It is a special pasta that among its 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.759
 components has cement is important 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.039
 because they can come to give it and because you 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.720
 you can make things with textures 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.060
 this has a practical application for 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.660
 example we see basins for the bathroom if 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.689
 has house application for 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.360
 decoration for the exterior also because 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.170
 the material is so noble that it allows them 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.940
 an indoor and outdoor use no return no 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.680
 need oven I need time from 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.489
 set, of course, because we're 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.660
 working with cement but I do not know 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.519
 I think this is important that what 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.070
 come and see one thing is to explain it and 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.620
 another thing is to give the teacher is called 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.110
 Laura and she's going to start dictating this 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.719
 pasta workshop stones who is in 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.789
 the culture and the swallows 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.430
 also good and some elements 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.820
 basic to work in the course of 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.810
 this one that will have some cost the people the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.810
 people have to bring 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.690
 here we have the list of machines for 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:24.240
 work as a small board to 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.700
 knead the same and many front how many 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.730
 hours are of the course for a person 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.980
 say good took the course and I start 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.020
 produce in how much 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.030
 that depends on the hand and the skill 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.900
 of the person on the one hand and on the other 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.580
 side have a quota of 6 people for 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.720
 work is a pretty teaching 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.900
 personalized that the teacher went to bed 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.930
 two hours per week and the cost 170 per 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.080
 month but they take an an element that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.830
 can get to go out a lot in the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.050
 knowledge and technique developed 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.640
 that is beautiful I invite you all 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.700

 everything that is modeled and everything that is 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.060
 work with your hands has something of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.580
 tera and some relaxation 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.620
 to work with all the senses 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.450
 in which other proposals are working 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.940
