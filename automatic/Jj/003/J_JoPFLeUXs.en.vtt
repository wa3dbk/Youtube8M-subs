00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.520
 hello how are you I hope you are better and 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.070
 welcome in this sir is a new 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.960
 video on the west teaching occasions 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.330
 something a little different I 'm going to 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.189
 be teaching how to build innovate 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.470
 or expand your imagination so that 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.840
 winning the new sticks these 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.640
 they were added in the last nap sets in 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.200
 the three versions that go for the 1.9 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.239
 what are the root 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.220
 then these sticks are so 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.440
 beautiful good as we are us 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.880
 get enough in designing things 100 in 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.399
 decorate many things too 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.180
 then why can we put 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.180
 horizontally we can put 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.510
 vertically and well then they are not done 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.910
 quite a nice appearance as 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.190
 when you combine not as with other 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.350
 sites that we have out there and good 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.360
 right now nothing I 'm talking about I'm going 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.190
 to be building weights and for what 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.200
 we are going to build dams as it happens some 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.600
 kind of gym not then if you guys 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.250
 they have others saying a small city 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.470
 or they have a house that who puts in a 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.380
 gym obviously the weights do not the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.060
 you can lift because then there is no me 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.950
 I think I will be to overtake 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.399
 the weights 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 obviously it is not possible in search of 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.659
 a touching is not very well it looks very 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 well then it's going to bring you going to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.840
 decide what you put is to innovate as 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.670
 learn by doing these in red and with 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.049
 different so do not worry 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.720
 we are before in these blocks in our 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.539
 inventory the coal block it in 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.170
 road in any other block in this 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.500
 case of one of grass in the skull of we 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.469
 there 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.829
 we're also this trap door of 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.990
 iron and finally the rest I'm not 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.569
 not to say that the last three 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.979
 then to build the first piece 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.349
 Well, it's very simple, it's not a problem 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.200
 giant with some coal and with the 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:55.349
 centers we join them and we have a weight not 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.759
 but I say that it looks better 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.299
 the way I'm going to teach them 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.489
 that obviously we do this one 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.890
 this way we put them we put a 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:10.350
 little floating so to speak 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.480
 that 's right and we put iron bars 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.700
 as if they were the supports of the weight and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.410
 then shortly we put him as if 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.530
 outside the bank not the bank where you 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.110
 you put on and you put on 123 obviously not 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.350
 we can lift the ajaylat person in 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.110
 ubs hand this is the first design the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.720
 second design in day consisting of this 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.420
 with the use of the scala granites 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.100
 these two obviously widder skulls 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.050
 the face is going to be on one side increases 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.010
 is the one who raises this dam is going to say 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.840
 something else I'm raising a face to a 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.580
 skull that's a bit strange 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.140
 We have probably design action myself 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.060
 that is a little bit more realistic, not because 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.550
 the fact that it was smaller than it is 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 more size we are not like that anymore 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.820
 feasible because the car is a weight 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.530
 total you have to be 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.850
 arnold sachs in black with pronounce 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.890
 not that he has been able to pronounce this name 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.959
 the last examples were drawn 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.959
 good you have to be the one to lift 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.770
 this if not then it may be relevant 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.740
 of the little girl 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.600
 then you can apply it in the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.930
 dumbbell that for the dumbbell 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.689
 blessing 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.519
 but I'm thinking what would be the 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.519
 dumbbell the dumbbell would be like that 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.260
 and we also have the dumbbell which is the 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.410
 more tiny this I do not know you can 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.690
 go do not go to be able to do their gyms 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.250
 whatever is true and the last one 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.920
 we have here because they are with the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.020
 trap doors these we have so 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.010
 beautiful and so loved then what 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.190
 we have to do is place place the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.459
 duckling and place the sticks first 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.040
 then we put the trap doors 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.290
 pointing towards the sticks points and 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.209
 then we look down and down the 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.070
 block cited this we put so much 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.890
 charleston so that the trap is activated 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.620
 we close this there and obviously and 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.120
 we have like a dumbbell and then what 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.700
 same the other side we put four 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.460
 because if we do not put it below what 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.650
 that this one we put a torch 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:18.770
 stone and there we have our gym already 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.320
 you can this innovate can not 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.390
 appropriate or try to do things 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.450
 better than me because maybe they have 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.860
 more chairs than me but they are nothing 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.860
 bad not then 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.130
 I'm being like that trying to innovate 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.110
 people for this nice nobody what is 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.120
 alright so well then you can 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.160
 draw their own ideas can follow 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.500
 changing things but questioned as 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.330
 an idea not to build your own 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.100
 gym then good the singing is yes 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.870
 the video of today has not 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.210
 liked and this video has worked 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.250
 Let's see if they do not forget me 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.410
 like but too much to the channel and not 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.740
 it costs nothing more than a click please 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.740
 but well I'm already shut up 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.850
 just take good care of yourself 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.850
 and it is already thought
