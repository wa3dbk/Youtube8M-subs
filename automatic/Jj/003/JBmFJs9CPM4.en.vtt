00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that first if the axles going to hit

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.029

has<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.639> same<00:03:58.819> thing<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.479> it<00:03:59.659> has<00:03:59.870> the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
has the same thing on it it has the

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.330 
has the same thing on it it has the
notches<00:04:01.579> so<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.060> can<00:04:02.239> line<00:04:02.449> it<00:04:02.479> up<00:04:03.129> you<00:04:04.129> can

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
notches so you can line it up you can

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.860 
notches so you can line it up you can
see<00:04:04.519> now<00:04:04.699> what<00:04:04.909> I'm<00:04:05.000> talking<00:04:05.359> about<00:04:05.449> with<00:04:05.750> the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
see now what I'm talking about with the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.960 
see now what I'm talking about with the
axle<00:04:06.290> coming<00:04:06.620> out<00:04:06.799> okay<00:04:07.250> if<00:04:07.370> your<00:04:07.519> mufflers

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
axle coming out okay if your mufflers

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.330 
axle coming out okay if your mufflers
and<00:04:08.000> everything<00:04:08.540> we're<00:04:08.690> right<00:04:08.840> here<00:04:09.139> that<00:04:09.859> you

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
and everything we're right here that you

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.890 
and everything we're right here that you
would<00:04:10.489> not<00:04:10.639> be<00:04:10.819> able<00:04:10.879> to<00:04:11.000> get<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.359> out<00:04:11.419> so<00:04:11.870> you

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
would not be able to get that out so you

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.159 
would not be able to get that out so you
have<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.909> take<00:04:13.909> the<00:04:14.090> exhaust<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.629> mufflers<00:04:15.019> at

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
have to take the exhaust the mufflers at

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.050 
have to take the exhaust the mufflers at
least<00:04:15.379> off<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.769> you<00:04:15.859> can<00:04:15.979> get<00:04:16.099> that<00:04:16.340> out<00:04:16.519> now

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
least off so you can get that out now

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.180 
least off so you can get that out now
some<00:04:17.419> bikes<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.989> can<00:04:18.019> kind<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.500> pull<00:04:18.769> on<00:04:18.979> this

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
some bikes you can kind of pull on this

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.469 
some bikes you can kind of pull on this
and<00:04:19.430> some<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.239> can<00:04:20.539> so<00:04:21.289> what<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.650> want<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:21.919> do

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
and some you can so what you want to do

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.560 
and some you can so what you want to do
if<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:24.440> have<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.650> helper<00:04:25.159> if<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:26.330> take<00:04:26.539> a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
if you have a helper if you take a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.240 
if you have a helper if you take a
little<00:04:26.870> weight<00:04:27.139> and<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.500> lift<00:04:27.740> up<00:04:27.889> on<00:04:28.130> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
little weight and you lift up on the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.149 
little weight and you lift up on the
wheel<00:04:28.570> see<00:04:29.570> it'll<00:04:29.900> come<00:04:30.110> out<00:04:30.139> but<00:04:30.800> this<00:04:30.950> is<00:04:31.010> a

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
wheel see it'll come out but this is a

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.140 
wheel see it'll come out but this is a
fairly<00:04:31.400> new<00:04:31.610> bike

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
fairly new bike

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.890 
fairly new bike
so<00:04:32.450> it'll<00:04:32.690> come<00:04:32.810> out<00:04:32.870> pretty<00:04:33.200> easy

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
so it'll come out pretty easy

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.890 
so it'll come out pretty easy
okay<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:36.180> really<00:04:36.450> hard

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
okay if it's really hard

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.020 
okay if it's really hard
it's<00:04:37.230> either<00:04:37.440> corrosion<00:04:38.190> or<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.640> have<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
it's either corrosion or you have the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.910 
it's either corrosion or you have the
weight<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.510> wheel<00:04:39.630> hanging<00:04:40.320> on<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.680> and

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
weight of the wheel hanging on that and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.500 
weight of the wheel hanging on that and
it's<00:04:41.070> making<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.520> hard<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:41.970> if<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.150> lift<00:04:42.420> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
it's making it hard so if you lift the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.180 
it's making it hard so if you lift the
wheel<00:04:42.780> up<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.230> a<00:04:43.350> little<00:04:43.380> bit<00:04:43.590> it'll<00:04:43.920> take

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
wheel up just a little bit it'll take

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.930 
wheel up just a little bit it'll take
the<00:04:44.340> weight<00:04:44.370> off<00:04:44.730> of<00:04:44.760> that<00:04:45.060> now<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.140> one<00:04:46.410> thing

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
the weight off of that now the one thing

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.820 
the weight off of that now the one thing
that<00:04:47.940> you're<00:04:48.120> going<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.360> watch<00:04:48.540> is<00:04:48.930> when<00:04:49.680> we

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
that you're going to watch is when we

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.190 
that you're going to watch is when we
pull<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.280> axle<00:04:50.730> out<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.240> axle<00:04:51.720> adjuster

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
pull that axle out this axle adjuster

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.380 
pull that axle out this axle adjuster
here<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.740> can<00:04:52.890> see<00:04:53.070> is<00:04:53.190> loose<00:04:53.460> that'll

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
here you can see is loose that'll

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.770 
here you can see is loose that'll
basically<00:04:54.510> fall<00:04:55.200> out<00:04:55.550> okay<00:04:56.550> it'll<00:04:56.910> not<00:04:57.480> really

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
basically fall out okay it'll not really

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.750 
basically fall out okay it'll not really
fall<00:04:57.990> out<00:04:58.170> but<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.470> will<00:04:58.560> drop<00:04:58.770> down<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.610> other

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
fall out but it will drop down the other

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.250 
fall out but it will drop down the other
thing<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.120> have<00:05:00.150> here<00:05:00.570> is<00:05:00.660> your<00:05:00.810> caliper

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
thing you have here is your caliper

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.100 
thing you have here is your caliper
bracket<00:05:01.710> when<00:05:02.640> you<00:05:02.760> pull<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.150> axle<00:05:03.630> out<00:05:03.780> all

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
bracket when you pull that axle out all

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.720 
bracket when you pull that axle out all
these<00:05:04.470> things<00:05:04.740> are<00:05:04.890> going<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.070> kind<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.550> fall

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
these things are going to kind of fall

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.090 
these things are going to kind of fall
down<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:06.570> also<00:05:06.780> have<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.140> spacer<00:05:07.740> in<00:05:07.770> there

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
down you also have a spacer in there

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.190 
down you also have a spacer in there
make<00:05:08.730> sure<00:05:08.760> you<00:05:09.030> keep<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.420> spacers<00:05:09.930> on<00:05:10.080> the

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
make sure you keep the spacers on the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.810 
make sure you keep the spacers on the
right<00:05:10.380> side<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:10.950> when<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.160> go<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.340> reassemble

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
right side so when you go to reassemble

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.320 
right side so when you go to reassemble
everything<00:05:12.390> you<00:05:12.840> don't<00:05:13.050> get<00:05:13.380> confused<00:05:14.330> to

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
everything you don't get confused to

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.910 
everything you don't get confused to
which<00:05:15.510> side<00:05:15.750> it<00:05:15.960> goes<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:16.350> because<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:16.740> does

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
which side it goes on because it does

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.340 
which side it goes on because it does
matter<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:18.180> I'll<00:05:18.360> go<00:05:18.570> on<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.780> other<00:05:18.810> side<00:05:19.170> I'll

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
matter so I'll go on the other side I'll

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.990 
matter so I'll go on the other side I'll
pull<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.680> axle<00:05:20.070> out<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.370> can<00:05:20.520> kind<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.820> watch

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
pull the axle out you can kind of watch

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.129 
pull the axle out you can kind of watch
what<00:05:21.060> I'm<00:05:21.390> talking<00:05:21.750> about<00:05:21.810> there

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.779 

see<00:05:31.139> how<00:05:31.229> that's<00:05:31.410> getting<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:32.100> little<00:05:32.340> bit<00:05:32.580> more

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
see how that's getting a little bit more

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:39.680 
see how that's getting a little bit more
loose<00:05:36.620> okay<00:05:37.620> so<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.160> pulled<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.639> axle<00:05:39.060> out<00:05:39.180> so

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
loose okay so I pulled the axle out so

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.620 
loose okay so I pulled the axle out so
that's<00:05:39.960> out<00:05:40.199> now<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:41.729> wheel<00:05:41.940> will<00:05:42.120> still<00:05:42.389> kind

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
that's out now the wheel will still kind

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.150 
that's out now the wheel will still kind
of<00:05:42.720> hang<00:05:42.930> in<00:05:43.139> there<00:05:43.319> so<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:43.620> got<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.860> kind<00:05:44.009> of

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
of hang in there so you got to kind of

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:55.010 
of hang in there so you got to kind of
jiggle<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.639> a<00:05:44.669> little<00:05:44.849> bit<00:05:53.720> and<00:05:54.720> this<00:05:54.840> is

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
jiggle it a little bit and this is

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.439 
jiggle it a little bit and this is
definitely<00:05:55.199> if<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:55.919> have<00:05:56.099> a<00:05:56.130> helper<00:05:56.580> it's<00:05:57.300> a

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
definitely if you have a helper it's a

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.709 
definitely if you have a helper it's a
little<00:05:57.690> bit<00:05:57.810> easier

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.019 

now<00:06:02.709> if<00:06:02.830> you<00:06:02.949> come<00:06:03.129> on<00:06:03.279> this<00:06:03.429> side<00:06:03.669> I'll<00:06:03.789> kind

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
now if you come on this side I'll kind

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.939 
now if you come on this side I'll kind
of<00:06:04.089> try<00:06:04.269> to<00:06:04.299> get<00:06:04.509> the<00:06:04.659> belt<00:06:04.929> off<00:06:05.110> because<00:06:05.709> the

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
of try to get the belt off because the

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:13.169 
of try to get the belt off because the
belts<00:06:06.279> what's<00:06:06.489> holding<00:06:06.819> us<00:06:06.939> up<00:06:12.029> so<00:06:13.029> you<00:06:13.089> just

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:13.179 
belts what's holding us up so you just

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:16.559 
belts what's holding us up so you just
kind<00:06:13.629> of<00:06:14.219> pull<00:06:15.219> we<00:06:15.610> on<00:06:15.729> the<00:06:15.879> right<00:06:16.029> spot<00:06:16.419> and

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
kind of pull we on the right spot and

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.819 
kind of pull we on the right spot and
pry<00:06:16.809> the<00:06:16.869> belt<00:06:17.169> off<00:06:18.719> okay<00:06:19.719> there's<00:06:20.229> a<00:06:20.349> spacer

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:20.829 
pry the belt off okay there's a spacer

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:26.830 
pry the belt off okay there's a spacer
that<00:06:20.860> fell<00:06:21.219> out

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.550 

okay<00:06:27.440> so<00:06:27.500> we<00:06:27.770> got<00:06:27.919> the<00:06:28.070> belt<00:06:28.280> off<00:06:28.490> now<00:06:29.260> and<00:06:30.260> the

okay so we got the belt off now and the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.590 
okay so we got the belt off now and the
wheel<00:06:31.419> caliper

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
wheel caliper

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.960 
wheel caliper
there's<00:06:33.260> the<00:06:33.440> caliper<00:06:33.919> just<00:06:34.100> comes<00:06:34.340> off<00:06:34.520> you

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
there's the caliper just comes off you

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.939 
there's the caliper just comes off you
don't<00:06:35.210> have<00:06:35.479> to<00:06:35.660> unbolt<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.169> caliper<00:06:36.620> off<00:06:36.770> the

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:36.949 
don't have to unbolt the caliper off the

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.610 
don't have to unbolt the caliper off the
bracket<00:06:37.400> everything<00:06:37.580> will<00:06:37.970> just<00:06:38.150> come<00:06:38.330> on

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
bracket everything will just come on

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.740 
bracket everything will just come on
your<00:06:39.620> spacer<00:06:40.130> your<00:06:40.669> adjuster<00:06:41.150> is<00:06:41.330> still<00:06:41.600> in

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
your spacer your adjuster is still in

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.670 
your spacer your adjuster is still in
there<00:06:42.070> here's<00:06:43.070> the<00:06:43.250> spacer<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:45.110> you<00:06:45.260> can<00:06:45.440> see

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
there here's the spacer and you can see

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.129 
there here's the spacer and you can see
how<00:06:46.100> they're<00:06:46.280> different<00:06:46.400> sizes<00:06:46.870> so<00:06:47.870> what<00:06:48.020> you

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
how they're different sizes so what you

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:49.540 
how they're different sizes so what you
want<00:06:48.320> to<00:06:48.410> do<00:06:48.500> is<00:06:48.650> make<00:06:48.830> sure<00:06:48.860> you<00:06:49.160> keep<00:06:49.340> them

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
want to do is make sure you keep them

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.360 
want to do is make sure you keep them
separate<00:06:50.419> you<00:06:50.870> know<00:06:50.900> good<00:06:51.650> way<00:06:51.830> is<00:06:51.889> put<00:06:52.250> them

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
separate you know good way is put them

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.920 
separate you know good way is put them
in<00:06:52.460> a<00:06:52.490> little<00:06:52.669> sandwich<00:06:53.120> bag<00:06:53.360> keep<00:06:53.630> all<00:06:53.810> the

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
in a little sandwich bag keep all the

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.990 
in a little sandwich bag keep all the
bolts<00:06:54.229> on<00:06:54.350> that<00:06:54.500> side<00:06:54.770> went<00:06:55.490> in<00:06:55.639> a<00:06:55.729> sandwich

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
bolts on that side went in a sandwich

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.390 
bolts on that side went in a sandwich
bag<00:06:56.270> and<00:06:56.300> all<00:06:56.570> the<00:06:56.690> bolts<00:06:56.930> on<00:06:57.020> this<00:06:57.199> side<00:06:57.440> so

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
bag and all the bolts on this side so

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.940 
bag and all the bolts on this side so
now<00:06:58.580> your<00:06:59.030> wheel<00:06:59.210> is<00:06:59.240> basically<00:06:59.870> loose<00:07:02.950> just

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:03.950 
now your wheel is basically loose just

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.370 
now your wheel is basically loose just
take<00:07:04.190> it<00:07:04.340> out<00:07:04.490> so<00:07:05.479> it's<00:07:05.660> not<00:07:05.780> that<00:07:06.050> big<00:07:06.229> good

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
take it out so it's not that big good

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.770 
take it out so it's not that big good
job<00:07:06.590> it's<00:07:06.860> actually<00:07:07.250> pretty<00:07:07.460> easy<00:07:07.550> if<00:07:08.030> you

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 
job it's actually pretty easy if you

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.920 
job it's actually pretty easy if you
wanted<00:07:09.080> to<00:07:09.200> take<00:07:09.410> your<00:07:09.560> wheel<00:07:09.770> apart<00:07:10.160> farther

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
wanted to take your wheel apart farther

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.360 
wanted to take your wheel apart farther
you<00:07:11.930> would<00:07:12.050> just<00:07:12.260> take<00:07:12.440> the<00:07:12.620> studs<00:07:12.889> out<00:07:13.100> right

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
you would just take the studs out right

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.370 
you would just take the studs out right
here<00:07:13.610> your<00:07:13.910> pulley<00:07:14.180> will<00:07:14.479> come<00:07:14.660> right<00:07:14.870> off<00:07:15.050> its

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
here your pulley will come right off its

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.200 
here your pulley will come right off its
that<00:07:15.620> easy<00:07:15.650> nothing<00:07:16.370> more<00:07:16.550> take<00:07:16.820> the<00:07:16.940> studs

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
that easy nothing more take the studs

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.420 
that easy nothing more take the studs
out<00:07:17.440> sometimes<00:07:18.440> they're<00:07:18.650> locked<00:07:18.889> tight<00:07:18.979> it<00:07:19.250> in

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
out sometimes they're locked tight it in

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.640 
out sometimes they're locked tight it in
so<00:07:20.090> you<00:07:20.120> got<00:07:20.389> a<00:07:20.419> they<00:07:20.750> may<00:07:20.930> be<00:07:20.990> hard<00:07:21.320> to<00:07:21.470> break

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
so you got a they may be hard to break

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.290 
so you got a they may be hard to break
loose<00:07:21.950> but<00:07:21.979> that's<00:07:22.490> all<00:07:22.669> you<00:07:22.789> do<00:07:22.910> take<00:07:23.150> the

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300 
loose but that's all you do take the

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.240 
loose but that's all you do take the
pulley<00:07:23.510> or<00:07:23.810> take<00:07:24.020> the<00:07:24.139> bolts<00:07:24.440> out<00:07:24.560> and<00:07:24.740> the

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250 
pulley or take the bolts out and the

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.000 
pulley or take the bolts out and the
pulley<00:07:25.550> will<00:07:25.760> come<00:07:25.940> off<00:07:26.090> if<00:07:26.840> you<00:07:27.650> want<00:07:27.830> to<00:07:27.889> do

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.010 
pulley will come off if you want to do

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.189 
pulley will come off if you want to do
your<00:07:28.160> brake<00:07:28.370> rotor<00:07:28.669> same<00:07:29.539> deal<00:07:29.780> you're<00:07:30.050> just

your brake rotor same deal you're just

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.440 
your brake rotor same deal you're just
going<00:07:30.350> to<00:07:30.380> unbolt<00:07:30.770> these<00:07:31.039> bolts<00:07:31.820> here<00:07:31.880> and<00:07:32.240> the

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.450 
going to unbolt these bolts here and the

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.360 
going to unbolt these bolts here and the
rotor<00:07:32.660> will<00:07:32.900> come<00:07:33.110> right<00:07:33.289> off<00:07:33.320> that's<00:07:34.100> all

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.370 
rotor will come right off that's all

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.680 
rotor will come right off that's all
there<00:07:34.550> is<00:07:34.669> to<00:07:34.850> take<00:07:35.030> in<00:07:35.150> the<00:07:35.240> wheel<00:07:35.419> off<00:07:35.660> of

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 
there is to take in the wheel off of
