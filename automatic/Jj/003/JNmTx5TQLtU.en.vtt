 in individual mode with michael good 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.089
 because what we will do will not be a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 Extra video but a complete video or is 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.180
 and in this video I will show you how 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.180
 steal the train not the store 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.180
 Supermarket 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 I will show you how to steal string what 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.940
 I discovered 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
 and I already get on the train in motion 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 I will teach you how to get on 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
 movement is very easy to the first one 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 does miren 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.000
 while you run here 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710
 pedrín 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 I'm floating 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.880
 pedrín I leave 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.360
 good 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.080
 at once 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.080
 without what this 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.950
 they will let themselves fall 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.140
 and there is the conduit 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.039
 once the driver is there with him 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.579
 the only thing they will do is with a 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.350
 sniper or any weapon that 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:41.100
 have look very good looking to give the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.159
 well, the driver is not 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.570
 they will hit him in the head or anywhere 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.570
 but your body is given 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.400
 did once giving the driver 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.680
 the train driver will keep going more 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.869
 slow because the train is stopping 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.300
 or will be losing speed but little to 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.580
 little will not be like that from the salon like that of weaver 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.380
 and william ury will not be a bit slow on 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.850
 bloc was losing speed as 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.490
 a project state first speed and 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.450
 a lot of diversity this was not going so 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.220
 Quick 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.080
 as we were not going so fast well 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.970
 we have lost a lot of speed so 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.460
 once 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.940
 doing this the only thing that you have to 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.940
 make will be here around the corner 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.880
 I do not know why he 's here 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.140
 that I do not throw me here 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.490
 is 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.310
 sometimes if they do not throw around here next to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.310
 driver 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.030
 awaited by the door where they can 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.370
 enter her inside to handle the train and 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.489
 the train will be able to drive it 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.860
 I will only give it until it 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.780
 stop the train because if it takes because 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.620
 we are losing a lot of speed when 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.560
 stop the train the only thing they are going to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.450
 have to do is give it and there when it 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.950
 stop or moving has been like 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.890
 right now because you can not when 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:44.159
 stop this she will be able to climb the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.909
 this vehicle I already drive it you can go 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.310
 much more very fast very fast and if 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.920
 leaves the tracks if you go very fast I already 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.160
 I tried it is good it is a chulada 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.170
