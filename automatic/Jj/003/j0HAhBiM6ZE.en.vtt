take<00:02:02.470> in<00:02:02.770> there<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.100> that's<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.430> way<00:02:03.580> it's

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
take in there and that's the way it's

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.480 
take in there and that's the way it's
supposed<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:05.380> far<00:02:05.620> as<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.830> know<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.430> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
supposed to as far as I know it's the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.740 
supposed to as far as I know it's the
other<00:02:06.640> one<00:02:07.140> check<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.290> out<00:02:08.729> no<00:02:09.729> wow<00:02:10.300> wow

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
other one check this out no wow wow

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.090 
other one check this out no wow wow
that's<00:02:10.960> what<00:02:11.170> happens<00:02:11.440> when<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.740> knockoff

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
that's what happens when it's a knockoff

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.130 
that's what happens when it's a knockoff
so<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.430> looks<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:12.720> because<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.990> knock

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so it looks like because it's a knock

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.300 
so it looks like because it's a knock
off<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> top<00:02:14.830> peg<00:02:15.100> here<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:16.020> functional

dealy but honestly I think it looks

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.399 
dealy but honestly I think it looks
pretty<00:05:57.969> stupid<00:05:59.159> so<00:06:00.159> what<00:06:00.279> I<00:06:00.339> like<00:06:00.519> doing<00:06:00.550> is
