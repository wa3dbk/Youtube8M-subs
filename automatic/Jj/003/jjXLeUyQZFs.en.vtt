I've<00:02:51.640> got<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.850> big<00:02:52.180> dry<00:02:52.630> sponge<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.980> said

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
I've got a big dry sponge and I said

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.830 
I've got a big dry sponge and I said
that<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.850> any<00:02:55.000> time<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.269> go<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.540> water

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
that there and any time I go to water

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.890 
that there and any time I go to water
with<00:02:56.170> my<00:02:56.319> brush<00:02:56.680> or<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.069> q-tip<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.940> touch<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:58.750> to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
with my brush or a q-tip I touch it to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.600 
with my brush or a q-tip I touch it to
that<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.440> pulls<00:02:59.709> all<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.069> excess

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
that and that pulls all the excess

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.960 
that and that pulls all the excess
moisture<00:03:01.360> out<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:02.079> that<00:03:02.260> whatever<00:03:02.709> you've<00:03:02.890> got

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.180 

so<00:03:07.450> we've<00:03:07.630> got<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> really<00:03:08.140> nice<00:03:08.410> blue<00:03:08.830> sky

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
so we've got a really nice blue sky

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.180 
so we've got a really nice blue sky
going<00:03:09.520> here

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.730 

this<00:03:15.850> lets<00:03:16.120> me<00:03:16.210> work<00:03:16.480> around<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.960> detail<00:03:17.440> of

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
this lets me work around the detail of

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.490 
this lets me work around the detail of
my<00:03:18.100> piece<00:03:18.400> without<00:03:18.790> getting<00:03:19.480> smeared<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.380> but

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
my piece without getting smeared it but

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.690 
my piece without getting smeared it but
a<00:03:20.530> lot<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.770> times<00:03:20.950> when<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.280> work<00:03:21.490> with<00:03:21.520> a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
a lot of times when you work with a

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.700 
a lot of times when you work with a
towel<00:03:22.030> or<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:23.710> rag<00:03:24.580> you'll<00:03:25.510> actually<00:03:25.810> smear<00:03:26.590> it

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
towel or a rag you'll actually smear it

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.090 
towel or a rag you'll actually smear it
on<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.720> piece<00:03:28.960> of<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.470> rest<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.920> piece

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
on to the piece of the rest of the piece

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.650 
on to the piece of the rest of the piece
that<00:03:30.280> you've<00:03:30.460> already<00:03:30.670> got<00:03:30.820> painted<00:03:31.360> or<00:03:31.480> got

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
that you've already got painted or got

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.970 
that you've already got painted or got
something<00:03:31.990> done<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.500> next<00:03:35.830> thing

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
something done with and the next thing

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.470 
something done with and the next thing
that<00:03:36.010> we<00:03:36.250> kind<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.550> want<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.820> do<00:03:36.940> with<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.210> sky

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
that we kind of want to do with this sky

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.810 
that we kind of want to do with this sky
is<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:38.140> we<00:03:38.290> want<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:40.200> give<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.230> different

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
is that we want to give it different

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.000 
is that we want to give it different
intensities<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.840> we're<00:03:44.110> going<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.380> pick<00:03:44.770> up<00:03:44.920> a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
intensities so we're going to pick up a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.180 
intensities so we're going to pick up a
little<00:03:45.130> bit<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.490> antiquing<00:03:46.060> medium<00:03:50.190> again

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
little bit of the antiquing medium again

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.680 
little bit of the antiquing medium again
we're<00:03:51.550> going<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.760> kind<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:51.970> wave<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.420> in<00:03:52.570> the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
we're going to kind of wave this in the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.100 
we're going to kind of wave this in the
air<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.050> let<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.200> dry<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.860> little<00:03:53.980> bit<00:03:55.110> so

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
air and let it dry for a little bit so

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.140 
air and let it dry for a little bit so
we<00:03:56.230> don't<00:03:56.410> keep<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.770> too<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.580> then<00:03:57.910> I'm<00:03:58.030> gonna

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
we don't keep it too and then I'm gonna

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:06.380 
we don't keep it too and then I'm gonna
start<00:03:58.390> pulling<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:59.020> blue<00:03:59.320> back<00:03:59.620> off<00:03:59.830> again

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.690 

the<00:04:06.900> antiquing<00:04:07.380> medium<00:04:07.770> will<00:04:07.950> dry<00:04:08.250> out<00:04:08.280> of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
the antiquing medium will dry out of

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.350 
the antiquing medium will dry out of
this<00:04:08.880> really<00:04:09.480> fast<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.910> just<00:04:12.060> have<00:04:12.240> to

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
this really fast so you just have to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.770 
this really fast so you just have to
give<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.690> few<00:04:12.990> seconds<00:04:13.620> to

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.720 

to<00:04:19.230> get<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.560> where<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.829> can<00:04:20.040> use<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.519> without

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
to get to where you can use it without

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:32.250 
to get to where you can use it without
overpowering<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:22.079> pulling<00:04:22.620> too<00:04:22.830> much<00:04:22.860> off

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.880 

I<00:04:32.380> think<00:04:32.950> I'm<00:04:33.040> going<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.280> get<00:04:33.400> another<00:04:33.640> q-tip

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
I think I'm going to get another q-tip

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.420 
I think I'm going to get another q-tip
