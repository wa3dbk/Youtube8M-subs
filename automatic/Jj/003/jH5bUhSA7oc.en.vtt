00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:37.880 

sure<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.560> guys<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> mod<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.910> game

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100 

first<00:00:38.820> thing<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.180> know<00:00:39.360> about<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.720> mod<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
first thing you know about this mod is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.700 
first thing you know about this mod is
that<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.740> replaces<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.490> logos<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:43.320> teams

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that it replaces the logos of the teams

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.760 
that it replaces the logos of the teams
only<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.460> game<00:00:44.900> it's<00:00:45.900> not<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.350> noticeable

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
only in game it's not really noticeable

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.460 
only in game it's not really noticeable
but<00:00:47.220> uh<00:00:47.540> just<00:00:48.540> thought<00:00:48.690> I'd<00:00:48.990> let<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.230> guys

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
but uh just thought I'd let you guys

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.910 
but uh just thought I'd let you guys
know<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> before

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
know that before

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.950 
know that before
it<00:00:52.920> doesn't<00:00:53.220> change<00:00:53.250> them<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> menu<00:00:54.180> order

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it doesn't change them in the menu order

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960 
it doesn't change them in the menu order
and<00:00:55.200> anything<00:00:55.680> else<00:00:55.770> only<00:00:56.100> inside<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.670> game

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970
