going<00:03:41.859> this<00:03:42.280> way<00:03:42.519> that's<00:03:43.200> kind<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.230> an<00:03:44.410> easy

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
going this way that's kind of an easy

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.310 
going this way that's kind of an easy
way<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.400> hold<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.299> up<00:03:46.390> tight<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.810> then<00:03:47.230> of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
way to hold it up tight and then of

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.470 
way to hold it up tight and then of
course<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.709> can<00:03:47.859> fold<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.190> down<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.519> way<00:03:48.760> by

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
course you can fold it down this way by

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.380 
course you can fold it down this way by
doing<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.930> can<00:03:50.260> easily<00:03:50.380> type<00:03:50.739> over<00:03:51.070> here

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
doing that you can easily type over here

version<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.820> I<00:03:55.090> believe<00:03:55.780> that's<00:03:55.989> all<00:03:56.590> the

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
version so I believe that's all the

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.699 
version so I believe that's all the
different<00:03:57.220> ways<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:58.090> works<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.230> goes

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
different ways that it works and goes

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.670 
different ways that it works and goes
we'll<00:04:00.100> see<00:04:00.130> if<00:04:00.310> maybe<00:04:01.260> it's<00:04:02.260> kind<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.470> another

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
we'll see if maybe it's kind of another

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.960 
we'll see if maybe it's kind of another
way<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.100> could<00:04:03.310> take<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.640> do<00:04:03.730> right
