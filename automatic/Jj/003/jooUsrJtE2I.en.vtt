this it's a guy listen this
perpendicular<00:01:15.390> arm<00:01:15.869> action<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> he<00:01:16.619> create

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
perpendicular arm action and he create

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
perpendicular arm action and he create
that<00:01:17.130> scapular<00:01:17.700> load<00:01:17.999> the<00:01:18.960> elbow<00:01:19.289> ends<00:01:19.649> up

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that scapular load the elbow ends up

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.489 
that scapular load the elbow ends up
coming<00:01:20.159> below<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.640> shoulders<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:22.469> shoulders

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499 
coming below the shoulders the shoulders

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.830 
coming below the shoulders the shoulders
and<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> elbows<00:01:23.189> aren't<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.819> the<00:01:23.880> same<00:01:24.179> plane

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and the elbows aren't on the same plane

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.149 
and the elbows aren't on the same plane
a<00:01:26.420> third<00:01:27.420> common<00:01:27.719> thing<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.079> happens<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.859> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
a third common thing that happens is a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.779 
a third common thing that happens is a
one-sided<00:01:30.060> load<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> player<00:01:31.560> lifts<00:01:32.100> creates

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
one-sided load as a player lifts creates

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.109 
one-sided load as a player lifts creates
this<00:01:32.939> perpendicular<00:01:33.719> matching<00:01:34.880> they'll<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this perpendicular matching they'll just

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.249 
this perpendicular matching they'll just
load<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.869> side<00:01:38.479> we<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.749> two-sided

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
load on one side we want a two-sided

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.469 
load on one side we want a two-sided
load<00:01:40.649> we<00:01:40.889> want<00:01:41.749> equal<00:01:42.749> or<00:01:42.929> symmetrical<00:01:43.590> lows

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
load we want equal or symmetrical lows

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.669 
load we want equal or symmetrical lows
again<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:45.869> reasons<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.289> that's

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
again one of the reasons that that's

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.069 
again one of the reasons that that's
been<00:01:46.920> taught<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.429> because<00:01:47.909> without<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> aid

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
been taught is because without the aid

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.459 
been taught is because without the aid
of<00:01:49.109> high-speed<00:01:49.409> video<00:01:49.859> coaches<00:01:51.259> thought<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
of high-speed video coaches thought that

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.199 
of high-speed video coaches thought that
they<00:01:52.590> were<00:01:52.649> seeing<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.130> arm<00:01:53.399> perpendicular

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
they were seeing that arm perpendicular

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.300 
they were seeing that arm perpendicular
to<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.389> ground<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.619> arm<00:01:55.829> doesn't<00:01:56.069> go

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to the ground the arm doesn't go

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.949 
to the ground the arm doesn't go
perpendicular<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> ground<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
perpendicular to the ground to have a

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.139 
perpendicular to the ground to have a
picture<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.799> players<00:01:59.100> start<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.609> rotate<00:01:59.789> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
picture of players start to rotate the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.789 
picture of players start to rotate the
shoulders<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> arm<00:02:01.560> goes

perpendicular<00:02:02.609> to<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> ground<00:02:03.170> as<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
perpendicular to the ground as the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
is going to allow me maximum arm speed

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.820 
is going to allow me maximum arm speed
and<00:02:12.650> get<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.800> arm<00:02:14.040> moving

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
and get that arm moving

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.760 
and get that arm moving
with<00:02:14.950> some<00:02:15.130> philosophy
