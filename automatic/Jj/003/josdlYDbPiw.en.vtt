00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.210
 part of the army police should not 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.530

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.390
 before attacks like this that the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.519
 Presidency advocates a favorable ruling 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.710

 use 100 of the 900 million for today 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.739
 frozen the president of the republic 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.489
 has made a vehement call to the room 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.050
 of the constitutional to reconsider 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.430
 sentences of that natural table the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.960
 communications secretary of the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.640

 has taken a decision on the subject of 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.580
 a security tax despite the fact that 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.490
 two of his ministers last week 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.250

 acted by the national council of 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.600
 security we do not have any 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.000
 problem in sharing in this case the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.040
 investment decisions and who want 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.860
 this 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.110
