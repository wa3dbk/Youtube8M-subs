00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.500
 Video title we are going to talk like 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.150
 of some outfits and those things in 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.460
 reality is a video that they ask me and I 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.110
 They ask and they put and they ask me but I do not know no 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.820
 I do so many but if you want I'll go 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.619
 to do more often many were 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.270
 asking how could they combine 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.519
 like that color clothing clothes 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.289
 hard or non-hard colors and a powerful 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.940
 with the different ones to what normally 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.010
 we had been seeing and that is that right now 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.079
 they are super father the pastel colors and 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.670
 the phosphorescent colors in the me 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.499
 I'm with the cakes like I like 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.969
 more I also like our presents 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.920
 I also like it and I'm going to give you two 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.839
 ideas as it seemed at night talk of 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.999
 this one and also it would be for suggest 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.739
 You never know hope you like let 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.420
 start with the video let's start with 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.309
 those of Díaz Acosta is to say that's why 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.809
 a powerful color a color that 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.629
 It's usually a little bit more 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.670
 visually durán is therefore you play 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.860
 to the monkey or that you put black colors 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.440
 I actually think that in my case what 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.390
 europe is to say if you put a super color 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.550
 how crazy do you see me with something more clear or 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.690
 black so that it complements well and not 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.670
 look so exaggerated 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.680
 I 'm going to put everything in park 96 what 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.240
 let's start with a lusa shirt 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.820
 as you want to say 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.830
 it is super intense in color how can you 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.050
 see almost looks like that too 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.640
 they have some things like 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.370
 I do not know how they're called to charge you 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.590
 superbien this part and then like that 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.660
 do not decant since you would have to see 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.900
 as I do not have that thing to rid 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.150
 good afternoon tapas a little more and in 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.020
 legs is going to put on some jeans 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.400
 black color 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 If you do not have or have jeans 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.310
 claritos also be nice 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.369
 blacks I like because it's not a 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.960
 Lady looks fabric are common and 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.119
 currents but black and 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.009
 extremely on plate 2 and the goods 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.820
 they would put the shoes as very color 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.820
 clarito 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.390
 and we talked to others would be used 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.010
 like a shirt, it's a super look, but 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.440
 good is also to use it in what you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.730
 They said man and I would put it as it looks 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.319
 a bit formal, that is, you can not see 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.170
 transform but like you have it as 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.940
 very not so much as you see so sharp but if 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.099
 it's like formalistic medium I would put you some 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.879
 normal but dark jeans almost did not 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.879
 they like it clearly 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.470
 of blacks true and unleashes all I myself 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.959
 would put a match Miami tells us that 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.519
 they are super super hard for the list 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.440
 Well, I like the truth is that 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.569
 it does not matter that you do not mind you like it and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.280
 you feel comfortable the other teams to you 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.910
 you put on a bust and now let's see 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.910
 how would it be 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.440
 and this I put on is super during 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.360
 for and I spent today 'he did not say read and I 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.220
 I bought a skirt but as it is average 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.170
 transparent would put a job that 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.730
 be as a means to remove that you see a 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.100
 little bit but that does not look like 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.900
 everything has had to save me I have 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.819
 two projects already the difference 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.069
 we have this one 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.780
 I know that this seems like a top 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.459
 I told him so short that I proposed and 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.130
 I wear it as it covers me super well 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.020
 and give me everything for everything do not worry and 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.269
 we also have this because of the differences 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.100
 that this one has some things here with 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.959
 some stripes but without quotes from 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.940
 quite because if you have one if you do not 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.519
 go buy another I say if you have a 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.200
 list and another with little things is preferable 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.989
 use the list because this already has 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.000
 much cost then stir it up like that 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.160
 not though I did not write an alert that 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.050
 I see better proposal a visit and the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.180
 feet would put black heels 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.100
 these are super hard heels but it's 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.750
 I love them very much I like them very much 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.660
 heels but mostly for 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.150
 because I do not know I usually suffer a lot 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.280
 quality because I'm super well and the bara 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.290
 I would use it too black I am very 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.810
 black but in age I think that is what 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.910
 better as it goes with everything so much 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.250
 I really like both rings and 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.169
 necklaces but bracelets does not print the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.880
 super thin doll then all of me 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.290
 sales I always use my watch but what 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.669
 I left at my grandmother's house because if I 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.350
 question then you are not using it 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.450
 the pressure that I have on my watch 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.720
 better warnings about cheating how 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.720
 would be 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.880
 and sale 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:57.220
 you go 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.200
 from now 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.030
 and now he says it's basic because I think that 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.890
 we all have a black dress you do not take 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.170
 but I think we should have some 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.030
 because the years and years can pass 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.710
 and a black dress like that of us 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.510
 any trouble but the thing is that if 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.370
 you do not like colors so strong in 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.140
 the clothes you can add accessories or 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.970
 shoes that make the difference 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.290
 they look super cool and well that's 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.600
 what I'm going to do right now I'm going to do 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.030
 a black dress a few Japanese super 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.410
 color and they are super high and good for 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.000
 make them appear learn to use them 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.440
 because I'm the expert in saying that 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.450
 because before I heat two sides 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.250
 come from accessories that could support 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.870
 that I like for example to use a 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.850
 dress the same color as the same 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.620
 shoes of the same makeup and the same 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.810
 bag I think it does not look as father as 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.580
 all the dress is black put a 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.210
 necklace that go with the shoes I think that 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.210
 yes, nice 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.710
 I will need the full videos already 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.870
 justified sas that has to do with clothes 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.319
 and in the comments tell me what you 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.319
 liked more 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.630
 10 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.630
 and in this 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.460
 for number 4 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.210

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.410
 that says subscribe for the thing 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.550

 has seen him on the screen so that 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.139
 take the theme 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.120
 but anyway I have the links in
