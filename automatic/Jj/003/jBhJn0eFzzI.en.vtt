let's go ahead and get there and it's

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.840 
let's go ahead and get there and it's
actually<00:02:18.550> one<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.000> harder<00:02:19.330> wish<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:20.850> have

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
actually one of the harder wish I have

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.190 
actually one of the harder wish I have
to<00:02:21.970> say<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.330> probably<00:02:22.630> one<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.050> my<00:02:23.140> least

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
to say it's probably one of my least

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.100 
to say it's probably one of my least
favorite<00:02:23.890> missions<00:02:24.600> that's<00:02:25.600> how<00:02:25.750> freaking

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
favorite missions that's how freaking

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.530 
favorite missions that's how freaking
hard<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.560> no<00:02:27.490> actually<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:27.880> think<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.330> use

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
hard it is no actually I think I can use

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.200 
hard it is no actually I think I can use
a<00:02:28.570> little<00:02:28.690> shortcut<00:02:29.380> which<00:02:29.890> probably<00:02:30.220> use<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
a little shortcut which probably use the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.980 
a little shortcut which probably use the
school<00:02:31.540> bus<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:32.170> get<00:02:32.290> next<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.800> school

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
school bus to get next to the school

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.030 
school bus to get next to the school
this<00:02:34.990> is<00:02:35.140> school<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.470> closer<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.860> that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
this is school is closer to that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:45.560 
this is school is closer to that
location<00:02:36.250> will<00:02:36.670> be<00:02:36.700> easier<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.150> get<00:02:37.360> there

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.690 

there<00:02:46.570> we<00:02:46.630> go<00:02:47.490> annales<00:02:48.660> now<00:02:49.660> we<00:02:49.720> pretty<00:02:50.110> much

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
there we go annales now we pretty much

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.630 
there we go annales now we pretty much
are<00:02:51.700> halfway<00:02:52.030> there<00:02:52.240> by<00:02:52.690> now<00:02:53.430> let's<00:02:54.430> go<00:02:54.610> ahead

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
are halfway there by now let's go ahead

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:09.380 
are halfway there by now let's go ahead
and<00:02:54.790> skate<00:02:55.120> them<00:02:55.330> there<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.990> rest<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.350> way
