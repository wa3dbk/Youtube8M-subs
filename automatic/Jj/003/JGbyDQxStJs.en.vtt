 come a very very big secret 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.470
 from what you can clearly see out 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.350
 can 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 He now has around 600,000 subscribers 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.429
 So just in any case already has 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.960
 more than half a million 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.570
 That's why he wants to be 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.610
 not show you can try what you can 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.520
 You can plan it on the bed 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.410
 did not do everything and that's all 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.079
 just the point and many really want 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.890

 welcome the community and then have 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.300
 I still press you and a way 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.660
 problem because it is short on my main 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.519
 screen goal so there it is already 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.430
 wiki for goma hd open 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.729
 So here we have some data of this 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.100
 not so up to date but that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.159
 profile picture it was natural jacket that was 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:24.509
 once again logical and yes so it was 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.670
 almost everything for the seven yes hd 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.360
 stir channel with gaming 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.890
 and young website ghom hd.de there is indeed 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.079
 did not want to be so active is yes 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 and no matter how you can interpret here 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.090
 started on the third 12 2011 be first 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.189
 channel me the gaming 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.680
 There he and his brother played which 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.530
 see and the dynamics is known with 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.479
 a hidden voice speaks thus 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.579
 how to get out of it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.659
 disguised voice that means there is 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.560
 what a lazy thing 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.759
 how can a certain guy yes with his 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.439
 brother yes make certain things as well 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.719
 and that under private as well 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.219
 needs the right mood 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.940
 actually the right voice secret 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.220
 kept why come 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.950
 the thing is simply komatsu 's fear 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.750
 that you could betray him because of me 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 guess if you already agree 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.660
 adjusted there must be a very very large 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.380
 identity hamburgern from which one also into the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.200
 Finale can close that one just there 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.730
 his identity does not reveal in that 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.000
 you would from mountain camps en face 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.400
 Listen to milkbubis right voice 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.940
 then you would have been in the dramatic 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.040
 youtube scene then so much to him 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.050
 Yes, that is speculated and there it is 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.530
 just that and that you can do that 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.680
 do 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.300
 I met you and when we did 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.740
 his brother is already running and then he leaves 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.430
 I'm fine with his brother, too 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.430
 imagine 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.800
 and he that just now and the voice of 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.470
 Hiding or hiding me well 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.260
 or as far as requested, take his 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.200
 say his website once again nothing 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.990
 cards are his wings 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 who used to call the channel michel gaming kant 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.260
 there will be many things there 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.050
 wood days completely different there is 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.260
 at that time videos there has shown this 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.850
 but unfortunately privately they speak well 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.239
 are not visible to us anyway for 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.570
 Gomez they are still one on one leg 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.500
 as visible in the sense of being now 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.260
 but a little bit on the website of 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.150
 goma hd home looks then you can find me 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.360
 this is just the loading process right now 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.040
 screen brightness so yes 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.090
 if you just take a closer look and the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.750
 bulbs can be seen here most accurately 2 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.750
 channel hd and yes it is also like that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.160
 a lot has been shown and that is not 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.380
 more as I said the videos here 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.080
 some are private for us speaks for 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.000
 michaela karl summer are visible when 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.280
 the interest of goma the punkt.de 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.160
 in order to score points net then looks 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.350
 Here's some data once you know it 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.350
 then logged in dilemma 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.440
 it is all registered to me too 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.750
 everything in a certain way 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.459
 ran out and he was responsible for the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.280
 content according to clause 55 paragraph 2 rstv 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:27.330
 is christoph frank i want you this 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.980
 now reluctant to show because yes then would 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.730
 I could say that break and me 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.860
 Show yourself that there are there too 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.260
 Of course my name is not censored 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.810
 above but just here all the names 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.980
 the left so I've tried 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.820
 blobs to m 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:49.400
 there was also a certain Michael Kraus 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:53.220
 with every blob that means come 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.260
 michael wiemann him the market is up 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.660
 any case the official gomma the 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.880
 account is blob why are you that 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.500
 can prove or it can too 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.419
 So christoph janker is christoph 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.120
 frank but that's just the usa 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.090
 reported but the question is gome 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.970
 why is the name clegg under michael 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.270
 enk registered there are many peoples like that 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.700
 it is a popular way michael 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.990
 schrenk but that times enter the 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.320
 Of course, many, but let's go now 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.040
 again clegg his not coming now 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.500
 lots 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.510
 that's the thing yes when 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.760
 milchbubi look at the names 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.600
 Sixth of a good one finds the fake 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.800
 but if you can find michael enk here 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.849
 then there is something in it 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.580
 why can i tell you 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.419
 if here christoph dislocated specified 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.789
 becomes as website owner also as 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.569
 networks aetn hager as confidential 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.189
 for content then it can also be 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.289
 that michael gang 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.809
 the official blob account speaks 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.199
 the official goma account, too 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.599
 always 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.309
 that just concludes for a moment 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.539
 that if you're a bit specific 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:04.610
 researched when exactly on the 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.919
 information comes and m 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.270
 but you see two michael kottwitz here 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.469
 I can already assure you 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.779
 that's definitely not coming because 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:16.219
 researches given that the macho very much 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.439
 similar comes and there is also a picture 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.819
 from them where he used to show himself 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.769
 now that's just then to be on 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:24.019
 current image directed in the the 

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:27.019
 evil sparkle and christoph wenk and 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:28.999
 elektra michael enk there is only something 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:31.339
 identical that means if now one me 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:33.199
 would do a little research now 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.789
 exactly on the dates we can on 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.490
 destination arrives we can address 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.809
 rankommt that's why everyone means 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:46.219
 if you have a last name 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:48.589
 christopher and michael enk that's it 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:50.389
 whole hiding game what comedy years 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:52.789
 who did not show up 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:56.659
 was Werder and the home has not 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:59.089
 but at what price it is quite 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:03.079
 just so it is represented by 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:07.009
 christoph or christof frank and 

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:08.959
 Michael rink so in short your god 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.490
 you can see from 

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:11.569
 I like the name christoph 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.729
 wenk search 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:15.199
 That's something I like about you 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.719
 to pursue further chances if you me 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.459
 do not you think you can be just like that 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.800
 bring members out against us 

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:24.289
 you can say exactly 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.479
 You can even if you police I 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:29.120
 be on the go and somehow through 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:30.770
 Crimes I think you see 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.870
 something 600 then he could be in too 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.879
 my political and he could be too 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.210
 to data-ran is why it is 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:41.479
 just say not confirmed means 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.669
 michael and milchbubi as christoph or 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.710
 the other way 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:48.650
 that's all secret what to summer hd 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.780

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.159
 so that 's it thanks
