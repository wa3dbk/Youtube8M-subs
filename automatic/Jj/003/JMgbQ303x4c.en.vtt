now that's not an engineering term the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.750 
now that's not an engineering term the
truth<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.549> closely

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
truth is it's because it's so closely

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.969 
truth is it's because it's so closely
