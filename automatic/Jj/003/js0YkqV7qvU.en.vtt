a<00:01:41.820> wig<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.480> ended<00:01:42.870> up<00:01:42.990> styling<00:01:43.590> myself<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
a wig that I ended up styling myself to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.150 
a wig that I ended up styling myself to
my<00:01:44.850> liking<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.480> I'll<00:01:46.290> show<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.770> picture

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:55.330 
my liking and I'll show you the picture
right<00:01:47.340> here

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.570 

so<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.820> picture<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.330> I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
so that's the picture that I

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.870 
so that's the picture that I
get<00:01:57.790> asked<00:01:58.180> about<00:01:58.270> most<00:01:59.080> often<00:01:59.410> and<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.400> think

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
get asked about most often and I think

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.860 
get asked about most often and I think
it's<00:02:01.030> because<00:02:01.510> the<00:02:02.350> hair<00:02:02.620> looks<00:02:03.040> very<00:02:03.870> natural

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
it's because the hair looks very natural

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.560 
it's because the hair looks very natural
like<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.830> hair<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.250> probably<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.270> most

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
like that hair is probably the most

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.950 
like that hair is probably the most
natural<00:02:08.260> hair<00:02:09.160> or<00:02:09.610> natural<00:02:10.420> wig<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.869> I've

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960

natural hair or natural wig that I've
ever<00:02:11.140> had<00:02:11.410> like<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:12.220> doesn't<00:02:12.490> even<00:02:12.640> look<00:02:12.970> like

went<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.630> movies<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.350> when<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.709> got<00:03:42.010> up<00:03:42.160> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
went to the movies and when I got up it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.310 
went to the movies and when I got up it
was<00:03:42.489> like<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.970> nest<00:03:43.270> in<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.660> back<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.989> my<00:03:44.080> head

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
was like a nest in the back of my head

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.990 
was like a nest in the back of my head
it<00:03:44.560> was<00:03:44.709> horrible<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.400> remember<00:03:45.670> what's<00:03:45.850> how<00:03:45.970> I

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
it was horrible I remember what's how I

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.330 
it was horrible I remember what's how I
went<00:03:46.270> shopping<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:47.380> scarf<00:03:47.770> that<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.010> weren't

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
went shopping the scarf that I weren't

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.390 
went shopping the scarf that I weren't
got<00:03:48.700> caught<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.330> my<00:03:50.110> hair<00:03:50.140> or<00:03:50.770> in<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.250> wig

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
got caught in my hair or in the wig

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.690 
got caught in my hair or in the wig
because<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.750> hair<00:03:53.290> got<00:03:53.500> tangled<00:03:53.560> around<00:03:54.489> the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
because the hair got tangled around the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.640 
because the hair got tangled around the
scarf<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.269> mean<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.750> was<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.200> bad<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:57.690> um<00:03:58.690> what

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
scarf I mean it was that bad but um what

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.979 
scarf I mean it was that bad but um what
I<00:03:59.680> did<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.250> make<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.489> more<00:04:00.820> wearable<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.810> what<00:04:01.959> I

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
I did to make it more wearable so what I

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.530 
I did to make it more wearable so what I
ended<00:04:02.290> up<00:04:02.410> doing<00:04:02.650> was<00:04:03.060> straightening<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.390> wig

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
ended up doing was straightening the wig

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.340 
ended up doing was straightening the wig
out<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.400> cutting<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.550> too

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
out and cutting it too

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.710 
out and cutting it too
I<00:04:07.460> think<00:04:08.460> about<00:04:09.120> right<00:04:09.450> here<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:11.540> sometimes<00:04:12.540> I

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
I think about right here and sometimes I

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.150 
I think about right here and sometimes I
just<00:04:12.780> kind<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.380> wear<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.680> straight<00:04:13.980> or

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
just kind of wear it straight or

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.479 
just kind of wear it straight or
sometimes<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.790> would<00:04:14.940> kind<00:04:15.210> of<00:04:16.310> curl<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.459> back

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
sometimes I would kind of curl it back

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.660 
sometimes I would kind of curl it back
as<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.300> have<00:04:18.480> it<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:18.810> right<00:04:19.410> now<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.650> did<00:04:20.340> end<00:04:20.550> up

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
as I have it now right now I did end up

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.210 
as I have it now right now I did end up
straightening<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.330> out<00:04:21.480> as<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.530> can<00:04:22.680> see<00:04:22.920> and

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
straightening it out as you can see and

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.300 
straightening it out as you can see and
I<00:04:23.880> just<00:04:24.150> curled<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.020> front<00:04:25.320> kind<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.770> back<00:04:25.950> and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
I just curled the front kind of back and

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.460 
I just curled the front kind of back and
I<00:04:26.760> did<00:04:27.000> layer<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.450> little<00:04:27.660> bit<00:04:27.930> more<00:04:28.170> in<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
I did layer it a little bit more in the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.080 
I did layer it a little bit more in the
front<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.310> could<00:04:29.460> have<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.880> layers

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
front so that it could have the layers

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:38.930 
front so that it could have the layers
that<00:04:30.210> kind<00:04:30.630> of<00:04:30.720> go<00:04:30.870> back<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.410> way

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.790 

I'll<00:04:39.570> probably<00:04:39.900> end<00:04:40.080> up<00:04:40.170> cutting<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.560> even

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
I'll probably end up cutting it even

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.590 
I'll probably end up cutting it even
shorter<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.370> about<00:04:41.610> here<00:04:41.940> because<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.270> still

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
shorter to about here because it still

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.050 
shorter to about here because it still
tangles<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.350> once<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.070> hair<00:04:44.280> is<00:04:44.460> cut<00:04:44.700> shorter

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
tangles and once the hair is cut shorter

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.200 
tangles and once the hair is cut shorter
it<00:04:45.210> does<00:04:45.420> tangle<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.080> lot<00:04:46.800> less<00:04:47.160> sometimes<00:04:47.820> I

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
it does tangle a lot less sometimes I

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.090 
it does tangle a lot less sometimes I
get<00:04:48.390> asked<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.960> know<00:04:49.080> why<00:04:49.440> don't<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.890> make<00:04:50.040> a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
get asked you know why don't you make a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.400 
get asked you know why don't you make a
review<00:04:50.490> for<00:04:50.700> every<00:04:50.850> Eno<00:04:51.480> hair<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.200> wear

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
review for every Eno hair that you wear

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.590 
review for every Eno hair that you wear
and<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.770> lot<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.070> times<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:54.180> hair<00:04:54.390> isn't

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
and a lot of times the hair isn't

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.440 
and a lot of times the hair isn't
different<00:04:55.140> it's<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.830> same<00:04:56.070> way<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.760> just<00:04:56.910> um

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
different it's the same way it's just um

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.810 
different it's the same way it's just um
I<00:04:57.930> flat<00:04:58.530> ironed<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.950> straightened<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.610> or

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
I flat ironed it straightened it or

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.230 
I flat ironed it straightened it or
styled<00:05:00.390> it<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.460> different<00:05:02.820> way<00:05:02.910> than<00:05:03.150> it

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
styled it in a different way than it

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.940 
styled it in a different way than it
actually<00:05:03.420> came<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:04.860> actually<00:05:05.250> prefer<00:05:06.240> to

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
actually came and I actually prefer to

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.030 
actually came and I actually prefer to
buy<00:05:07.950> iron<00:05:08.220> most<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.270> my<00:05:09.330> wigs<00:05:09.570> that<00:05:09.860> come<00:05:10.860> with

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
buy iron most of my wigs that come with

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.730 
buy iron most of my wigs that come with
their<00:05:11.190> own<00:05:11.220> curl<00:05:11.790> pattern<00:05:12.150> because<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:13.020> noticed

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
their own curl pattern because I noticed

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.010 
their own curl pattern because I noticed
that<00:05:13.800> once<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.190> Flatiron<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:14.790> it<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.750> curl

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
that once I Flatiron it it just the curl

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.720 
that once I Flatiron it it just the curl
just<00:05:16.290> looks<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.650> lot<00:05:16.830> more<00:05:17.010> natural<00:05:17.070> than<00:05:17.700> the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
just looks a lot more natural than the

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.780 
just looks a lot more natural than the
package<00:05:18.090> curl<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.840> comes<00:05:19.050> with<00:05:19.220> also<00:05:20.220> it

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
package curl that it comes with also it

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.730 
package curl that it comes with also it
doesn't<00:05:21.120> take<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.300> little<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:22.230> stuff<00:05:22.590> like

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
doesn't take a little and stuff like

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.230 
doesn't take a little and stuff like
that<00:05:22.950> so<00:05:23.250> that's<00:05:23.520> what<00:05:23.670> I<00:05:23.730> normally<00:05:23.790> do<00:05:24.210> I

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
that so that's what I normally do I

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.690 
that so that's what I normally do I
usually<00:05:24.690> only<00:05:24.870> leave<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.860> curl<00:05:26.100> pattern<00:05:26.190> that

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
usually only leave the curl pattern that

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.730 
usually only leave the curl pattern that
it<00:05:26.820> comes<00:05:27.060> with<00:05:27.210> in<00:05:27.480> for<00:05:27.960> two<00:05:28.260> weeks<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.710> a

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
it comes with in for two weeks to a

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.160 
it comes with in for two weeks to a
month<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:29.190> then<00:05:29.340> after<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.760> I<00:05:29.970> kind<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.870> do

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
month and then after that I kind of do

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.450 
month and then after that I kind of do
my<00:05:31.200> own<00:05:31.410> thing<00:05:31.590> with<00:05:32.040> it

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
my own thing with it

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.730 
my own thing with it
so<00:05:33.060> like<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.300> said<00:05:33.360> this<00:05:33.750> is<00:05:33.960> scarlet<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:34.590> this

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
so like I said this is scarlet and this

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.150 
so like I said this is scarlet and this
