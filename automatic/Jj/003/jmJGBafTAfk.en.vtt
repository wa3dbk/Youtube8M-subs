with<00:01:16.070> those<00:01:16.190> slider<00:01:16.460> pins<00:01:16.730> out<00:01:16.880> we<00:01:17.090> can

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
with those slider pins out we can

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.550 
with those slider pins out we can
actually<00:01:17.450> rotate<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:18.020> caliper<00:01:18.380> now<00:01:18.500> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
actually rotate the caliper now to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.470 
actually rotate the caliper now to

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
compress the piston to remove it off of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.970 
compress the piston to remove it off of
the<00:01:20.570> old<00:01:20.690> pads<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.320> before<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:21.800> do<00:01:21.950> that

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
the old pads but before you do that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.140 
the old pads but before you do that
you're<00:01:22.220> gonna<00:01:22.310> want<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.610> make<00:01:22.760> sure<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.030> your

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
you're gonna want to make sure that your

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.550 
you're gonna want to make sure that your
brake<00:01:23.360> fluid<00:01:23.390> reservoir<00:01:23.690> under<00:01:24.290> your<00:01:24.410> hood

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
brake fluid reservoir under your hood

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:35.290 
brake fluid reservoir under your hood
isn't<00:01:25.010> going<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.190> overflow<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:34.090> then<00:01:35.090> place

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
isn't going to overflow and then place

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.100 
isn't going to overflow and then place
it<00:01:35.450> where<00:01:35.570> it's<00:01:35.690> gonna<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:35.930> secure<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:38.110> can

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
it where it's gonna be secure you can

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.110 
it where it's gonna be secure you can
see<00:01:39.350> an<00:01:39.440> old<00:01:39.530> pad<00:01:39.830> here<00:01:40.160> it's<00:01:40.400> it's<00:01:40.700> fairly

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
see an old pad here it's it's fairly

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.240 
see an old pad here it's it's fairly
thin<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.260> can<00:01:42.380> see<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.770> rotor<00:01:43.010> is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
thin you can see that the rotor is

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.510 
thin you can see that the rotor is
rusted<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.030> pitted<00:01:44.960> it's<00:01:45.770> definitely<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.430> good

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
rusted and pitted it's definitely a good

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.780 
rusted and pitted it's definitely a good
idea<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.119> good<00:01:47.270> time<00:01:47.510> to<00:01:47.690> replace<00:01:47.990> these

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.190 

this<00:01:55.790> next<00:01:56.119> step<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.660> is<00:01:56.780> probably<00:01:57.050> one<00:01:57.170> of

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
this next step here is probably one of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.840 
this next step here is probably one of
the<00:01:57.290> most<00:01:57.410> difficult<00:01:57.619> in<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> entire<00:01:58.340> process

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the most difficult in the entire process

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.630 
the most difficult in the entire process
as<00:01:59.000> you'll<00:01:59.570> see<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.960> top<00:02:00.200> one<00:02:00.500> only<00:02:01.250> has<00:02:01.610> a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
as you'll see the top one only has a

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.790 
as you'll see the top one only has a
little<00:02:02.210> bit<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.420> space<00:02:02.660> available<00:02:03.260> these

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
little bit of space available these

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.430 
little bit of space available these
bullets<00:02:04.310> are<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.850> 20s<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.690> they<00:02:05.869> are<00:02:06.080> locked

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
bullets are a 20s and they are locked

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.840 
bullets are a 20s and they are locked
tight<00:02:06.650> it<00:02:06.800> in<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.220> you'll<00:02:07.369> want<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> remove

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
tight it in so you'll want to remove

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.490 
tight it in so you'll want to remove
them<00:02:08.030> very<00:02:08.240> carefully<00:02:08.450> make<00:02:09.170> sure<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.380> don't

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
them very carefully make sure you don't

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:48.180 
them very carefully make sure you don't
strip<00:02:09.740> them<00:02:09.890> out

it off you'll see here we do have a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.750 
it off you'll see here we do have a
little<00:03:15.590> bit<00:03:15.710> of<00:03:15.740> rust<00:03:15.980> surrounding<00:03:16.460> our<00:03:16.550> hub

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
little bit of rust surrounding our hub

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.130 
little bit of rust surrounding our hub
it<00:03:16.940> wasn't<00:03:17.210> enough<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.480> hold<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.750> rotor<00:03:17.930> on

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
it wasn't enough to hold the rotor on

it wasn't enough to hold the rotor on
but<00:03:18.350> I<00:03:18.380> don't<00:03:18.650> want<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.010> turn<00:03:19.160> into<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.460> so

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
but I don't want it to turn into that so

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.190 
but I don't want it to turn into that so
I'm<00:03:20.120> gonna<00:03:20.240> hit<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.450> with<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.630> bit<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.810> an<00:03:20.900> emery

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
around that hub is gonna act as a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.270 
around that hub is gonna act as a
sacrificial<00:03:33.200> metal<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.739> prevent<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.070> rust

from actually adhering to the rotor or
the<00:03:36.410> hub<00:03:36.650> it's<00:03:36.920> gonna<00:03:37.100> actually<00:03:37.790> adhere<00:03:38.360> to

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
the hub it's gonna actually adhere to

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.530 
the hub it's gonna actually adhere to
the<00:03:38.630> anti-seize<00:03:39.170> instead<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.880> it's<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.390> very

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
the anti-seize instead so it's a very

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.330 
the anti-seize instead so it's a very
thin<00:03:41.750> coat<00:03:41.959> helped<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.620> lot<00:03:42.800> next<00:03:43.100> time<00:03:43.250> you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
thin coat helped a lot next time you

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.330 
thin coat helped a lot next time you
have<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.550> do<00:03:43.610> your<00:03:43.730> brakes<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.130> said

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
have to do your brakes like I said

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.890 
have to do your brakes like I said
before<00:03:46.459> we're<00:03:46.820> using<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.150> Miley<00:03:47.480> platinum

zinc coated rotors for this brake job

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.920 
zinc coated rotors for this brake job
and<00:03:49.730> there's<00:03:50.120> something<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.570> want<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.810> say

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
and there's something that I want to say

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.360 
and there's something that I want to say
about<00:03:51.020> these<00:03:51.230> rotors<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.739> always<00:03:52.010> say<00:03:52.310> in

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
about these rotors that I always say in

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.010 
about these rotors that I always say in
the<00:03:52.489> brake<00:03:52.670> videos<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.270> that's<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.750> these

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
the brake videos and that's that these

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.229 
the brake videos and that's that these
rotors<00:03:54.440> are<00:03:54.620> coated<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.220> zinc<00:03:55.250> already<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.090> do

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
rotors are coated in zinc already you do

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.210 
rotors are coated in zinc already you do
not<00:03:56.390> want<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.840> clean<00:03:57.110> them<00:03:57.350> with<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.890> brake

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
not want to clean them with a brake

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.070 
not want to clean them with a brake
cleaner<00:03:58.550> it<00:03:59.180> can<00:03:59.330> actually<00:03:59.600> damage<00:03:59.780> the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
cleaner it can actually damage the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.570 
cleaner it can actually damage the
coating<00:04:00.230> these<00:04:00.830> are<00:04:00.950> good<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> go<00:04:01.370> they're

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
coating these are good to go they're

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.920 
coating these are good to go they're
clean<00:04:01.880> they're<00:04:02.060> ready<00:04:02.270> to<00:04:02.420> go<00:04:02.510> right<00:04:02.690> on<00:04:02.720> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
clean they're ready to go right on the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.810 
clean they're ready to go right on the
car<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:03.380> let's<00:04:03.530> do<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:03.709> now<00:04:03.950> go<00:04:04.550> ahead<00:04:04.700> and

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
car so let's do that now go ahead and

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.010 
car so let's do that now go ahead and
place<00:04:04.970> your<00:04:05.120> rotor<00:04:05.300> right<00:04:05.660> on<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.870> hub

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
place your rotor right on the hub

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.570 
place your rotor right on the hub
aligning<00:04:06.770> it<00:04:06.830> with<00:04:06.860> where<00:04:07.130> your<00:04:07.280> set<00:04:07.459> screw

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
aligning it with where your set screw

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.820 
aligning it with where your set screw
would<00:04:07.820> go<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.930> then<00:04:09.050> complete<00:04:09.410> with<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.560> little

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
would go and then complete with a little

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.380 
would go and then complete with a little
dab<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:09.980> anti-seize<00:04:10.160> go<00:04:10.910> ahead<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.180> replace

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
dab of anti-seize go ahead and replace

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.780 
dab of anti-seize go ahead and replace
that<00:04:11.480> sets<00:04:11.900> group

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.979 

now<00:04:18.790> before<00:04:19.060> we<00:04:19.150> go<00:04:19.239> any<00:04:19.389> further<00:04:19.540> we've<00:04:19.840> got

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
now before we go any further we've got

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.720 
now before we go any further we've got
an<00:04:20.109> important<00:04:20.500> step<00:04:20.650> we<00:04:20.769> wanna<00:04:20.950> complete<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
an important step we wanna complete the

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.280 
an important step we wanna complete the
caliper<00:04:22.060> carrier<00:04:22.389> here<00:04:22.630> is<00:04:22.780> not<00:04:22.930> in<00:04:23.139> bad

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
caliper carrier here is not in bad

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.530 
caliper carrier here is not in bad
condition<00:04:23.860> but<00:04:24.430> we<00:04:24.910> do<00:04:25.150> want<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.420> make<00:04:25.510> sure

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
the carrier now I'm not a masochist so I

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.590 
the carrier now I'm not a masochist so I
haven't<00:04:57.130> put<00:04:57.370> Loctite<00:04:57.760> back<00:04:57.970> on<00:04:58.120> these<00:04:58.270> bolts

I actually put a dab of anti-seize to

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.830 
I actually put a dab of anti-seize to

follow it the way the original
manufacturer<00:05:05.530> did<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:05.830> go<00:05:06.010> ahead<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.310> put

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
manufacturer did it go ahead and put

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:20.939 
manufacturer did it go ahead and put
that<00:05:06.460> Loctite<00:05:06.940> on<00:05:07.090> it

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.350 

next<00:05:21.949> we<00:05:22.190> want<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.490> get<00:05:22.580> our<00:05:22.699> brake<00:05:22.910> pads<00:05:23.120> ready

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
next we want to get our brake pads ready

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.240 
next we want to get our brake pads ready
I'm<00:05:23.780> going<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.110> use<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.440> grease<00:05:24.650> they<00:05:24.860> supply

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
I'm going to use the grease they supply

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.310 
I'm going to use the grease they supply
to<00:05:25.520> put<00:05:25.910> a<00:05:25.940> little<00:05:26.210> bit<00:05:26.389> around<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.750> contact

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
to put a little bit around the contact

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.170 
to put a little bit around the contact
points<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:27.889> around<00:05:28.580> where<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.820> caliper

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
points and around where the caliper

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:54.930 
points and around where the caliper
actually<00:05:29.570> touches<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.530> brake<00:05:30.919> pad

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.670 

all<00:05:55.540> right<00:05:55.690> these<00:05:56.110> are<00:05:56.260> good<00:05:56.350> to<00:05:56.440> go<00:05:56.530> in<00:05:56.620> the

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
all right these are good to go in the

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.410 
all right these are good to go in the
car<00:05:56.830> now<00:05:57.520> before<00:05:57.820> we<00:05:57.910> actually<00:05:58.000> put<00:05:58.210> those

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
car now before we actually put those

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.330 
car now before we actually put those
pads<00:05:58.660> on<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:59.020> car<00:05:59.230> we<00:05:59.710> need<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.860> make<00:06:00.070> sure<00:06:00.220> we

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
pads on the car we need to make sure we

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.250 
pads on the car we need to make sure we
take<00:06:00.580> our<00:06:00.790> caliper<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.510> retract<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.110> piston

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
take our caliper and retract the piston

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.720 
take our caliper and retract the piston
just<00:06:02.590> use<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.770> pair<00:06:03.010> of<00:06:03.040> channellocks

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
just use a pair of channellocks

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.050 
just use a pair of channellocks
and<00:06:03.850> pinch<00:06:04.780> gently<00:06:05.770> until<00:06:06.010> the<00:06:06.580> piston<00:06:06.970> is

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
and pinch gently until the piston is

and pinch gently until the piston is
fully<00:06:07.450> retracted<00:06:08.170> the<00:06:08.740> new<00:06:08.860> pads<00:06:09.070> are<00:06:09.220> going

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
fully retracted the new pads are going

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.920 
fully retracted the new pads are going
to<00:06:09.400> be<00:06:09.460> thicker<00:06:09.760> so<00:06:10.300> we<00:06:10.420> want<00:06:10.570> to<00:06:10.690> make<00:06:10.810> sure

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
to be thicker so we want to make sure

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.180 
to be thicker so we want to make sure
there's<00:06:11.110> enough<00:06:11.320> room<00:06:11.440> to<00:06:11.650> slide<00:06:11.950> them<00:06:12.130> over

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
there's enough room to slide them over

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.520 
there's enough room to slide them over
the<00:06:12.430> new<00:06:12.520> rotor<00:06:16.080> next<00:06:17.080> you<00:06:17.140> can<00:06:17.290> take<00:06:17.410> the

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
the new rotor next you can take the

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.290 
the new rotor next you can take the
outer<00:06:17.680> pad<00:06:17.950> and<00:06:18.250> place<00:06:18.550> it<00:06:18.760> into<00:06:18.910> its<00:06:19.120> home

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
outer pad and place it into its home

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.630 
outer pad and place it into its home
make<00:06:19.900> sure<00:06:19.930> that<00:06:20.230> the<00:06:20.410> clip<00:06:20.680> on<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:21.310> pad<00:06:21.460> is

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
make sure that the clip on the pad is

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.070 
make sure that the clip on the pad is
actually<00:06:21.760> facing<00:06:22.270> down<00:06:22.480> this<00:06:22.690> is<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.870> way<00:06:22.990> it

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
actually facing down this is the way it

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.900 
actually facing down this is the way it
came<00:06:23.230> from<00:06:23.290> the<00:06:23.500> factory<00:06:23.800> you<00:06:24.460> can<00:06:24.580> then<00:06:24.730> take

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
came from the factory you can then take

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.670 
came from the factory you can then take
the<00:06:25.060> inner<00:06:25.210> pad<00:06:25.450> and<00:06:25.750> snap<00:06:26.290> it<00:06:26.440> into<00:06:26.500> the

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
the inner pad and snap it into the

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.410 
the inner pad and snap it into the
piston<00:06:26.950> by<00:06:27.520> those<00:06:27.760> clips<00:06:28.500> and<00:06:30.150> then<00:06:31.150> slide

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
piston by those clips and then slide

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.690 
piston by those clips and then slide
that<00:06:31.570> caliper<00:06:32.050> over<00:06:32.380> the<00:06:32.470> entire<00:06:32.740> assembly

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.010 

now<00:06:39.700> is<00:06:39.760> a<00:06:39.880> great<00:06:39.940> time<00:06:40.030> to<00:06:40.330> check<00:06:40.510> the<00:06:40.720> quality

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
now is a great time to check the quality

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.750 
now is a great time to check the quality
of<00:06:41.320> your<00:06:41.440> slider<00:06:41.710> pins<00:06:42.040> mine<00:06:42.250> still<00:06:42.460> have<00:06:42.580> some

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
grease on them but if you've got some

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.350 
grease on them but if you've got some
rust<00:06:44.440> you<00:06:45.100> can<00:06:45.250> put<00:06:45.520> the<00:06:45.640> threads<00:06:45.970> into<00:06:46.210> the
