00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
stalkers he put up so much pressure that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.540 
stalkers he put up so much pressure that
the<00:02:27.420> term<00:02:27.720> played<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> father<00:02:28.740> for<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.280> father

the term played a father for a father

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.210 
the term played a father for a father
and<00:02:29.700> father<00:02:30.000> behind<00:02:30.720> as<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.410> game<00:02:31.560> proposed

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
and father behind as the game proposed

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.040 
and father behind as the game proposed
equity<00:02:32.700> really<00:02:32.970> nice<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.330> watch<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.690> think<00:02:33.960> he

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
equity really nice to watch I think he

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.780 
equity really nice to watch I think he
was<00:02:34.200> facing<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.740> SDC<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:35.580> hundred

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
was facing the SDC and one hundred

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
was facing the SDC and one hundred
percent<00:02:35.820> sure<00:02:36.060> about<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.600> don't<00:02:36.660> think

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
percent sure about it but I don't think

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.990 
percent sure about it but I don't think
so<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.740> chrono<00:02:38.040> boost<00:02:38.280> saved<00:02:38.580> up<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
so and we have chrono boost saved up and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.300 
so and we have chrono boost saved up and
this<00:02:39.180> might<00:02:39.390> exactly<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.050> what<00:02:40.620> Tesla<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
this might exactly be what Tesla is

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.680 
this might exactly be what Tesla is
trying<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.880> there's<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.870> stalker<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
trying to do there's the stalker and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.550 
trying to do there's the stalker and
chrono<00:02:45.690> boost<00:02:45.990> only<00:02:46.770> on<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:48.560> cybernetics

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
chrono boost only on to the cybernetics

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.080 
chrono boost only on to the cybernetics
core<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:50.010> keeping<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.580> zealot<00:02:50.880> as<00:02:51.000> he

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
core is keeping the zealot as he

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.580 
core is keeping the zealot as he
realized<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.570> his<00:02:51.720> opponent<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.140> not<00:02:52.350> going

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
realized that his opponent is not going

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.920 
realized that his opponent is not going
to<00:02:52.710> put<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.250> any<00:02:53.520> early<00:02:53.880> game<00:02:54.030> pressure<00:02:54.360> but

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
to put up any early game pressure but

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.800 
to put up any early game pressure but
for<00:02:55.350> now<00:02:55.500> he's<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.280> krona<00:02:56.580> boosting<00:02:57.090> here's<00:02:57.600> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
for now he's not krona boosting here's a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900 
for now he's not krona boosting here's a
gateway<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.980> distance<00:02:59.460> between<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.880> two

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
gateway the distance between the two

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.510 
gateway the distance between the two
basis<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.600> really<00:03:01.080> really<00:03:01.290> huge<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.010> that's

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
basis is really really huge so that's

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.490 
basis is really really huge so that's
one<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.910> reasons<00:03:03.270> well<00:03:03.420> takes<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.020> ages

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
one of the reasons well takes just ages

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.230 
one of the reasons well takes just ages
to<00:03:04.710> walk<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> stalker<00:03:05.640> over<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.120> your

to walk with a stalker over to your
opponent's<00:03:06.660> main<00:03:06.810> base<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.290> he<00:03:07.680> might<00:03:07.890> not<00:03:08.100> be

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
opponent's main base and he might not be

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.880 
opponent's main base and he might not be
there<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.850> time<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> warp<00:03:10.800> in

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
there in time but we have a warp in

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.040 
there in time but we have a warp in
Thailand<00:03:11.340> he's<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.150> warp<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.810> power

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
Thailand he's going for warp in power

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.410 
Thailand he's going for warp in power
he's<00:03:13.320> trying<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:14.130> get<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> little<00:03:15.120> bit

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
he's trying to get a little bit

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.800 
he's trying to get a little bit
aggressive<00:03:16.110> about<00:03:16.230> oh<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.310> proxy<00:03:18.000> Stargate

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
aggressive about oh the proxy Stargate

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.320 
aggressive about oh the proxy Stargate
but<00:03:21.140> look<00:03:22.140> at<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.410> sv<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.430> SCV<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:23.970> already

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
but look at that sv the SCV is already

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.180 
but look at that sv the SCV is already
scouting<00:03:24.870> all<00:03:25.050> supernova<00:03:25.710> maybe<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.040> little
