00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.370
 every day with him 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 I think the song was that easy 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.650
 really good and it's just fun 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
 Driving with him is just great 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 Do you know other bus drivers? 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.200
 Given names justins ombo is in rÃ¼sselsheim 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.750
 he has been driving for ten years 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.629
 his passengers in a very special way 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 Every child knows the 42-year-old and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.680
 he trained with his bus in front of the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:59.250
 stops then almost hysteria breaks out 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 as with a popstar is likely in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.390
 germany unique student 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.979
 can be with a bus driver 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.799
 take pictures as if he was not a guest 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 in congo but justin bieber would be as 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:18.000
 he started it in the bus ten years ago 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:20.850
 to sing the kids were thrilled if 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.210

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.159
 always off my bus 17 years ago 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 Justin Zongo from Ivory Coast 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:50.220
 Germany fled and had asylum 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:52.649
 do not work and but I am 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.500
 really like i love germany 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.990
 about everything I I know my america yes 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.450
 but I'm never imagine that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.380
 to deal with others I prefer to stay here 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.430
 I totally love that and in spite of the big one 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.829
 mentality differences mentality 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.349
 quite different here the people are circling 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.069
 always sad there I say you do not have to 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.250
 be sad 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.110
 You have to settle for so many 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.700
 what you have I'm content with what I'm getting 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.470
 and that satisfaction radiated one 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.950
 also out and transfer it to his 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.629
 Guests 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.400
 But it's not just students that are hers 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:51.900
 with his African zest for life 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:53.970
 It is definitely different 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.680
 to drive with justin zongo bus because 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.960
 which driver was already on it 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.630
 charming way before the next turn 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.720
 rightly stuck to beer and again 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.550
 fly force very strong but not only 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.170
 the centrifugal force is very strong but 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.450
 also his positive attitude towards life 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.520
 and it's contagious 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.990
 So who has a bad mood just times 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.600
 with justin zongo through rÃ¼sselsheim 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.880
 drive out of his bus to get on 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.180
 every case in a good mood again from each 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.180
 bet
