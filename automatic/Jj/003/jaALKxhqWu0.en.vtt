00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.200
 57 86 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 at the mobile world congress in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 barcelona was presented 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 I'll show you that first and we'll go 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.439
 just around the device 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.890
 we have a small 14 5 inch here 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.900
 Large LCD display can be used here 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 via this button on and off and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.980
 I have a menu button on the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.600
 top over that yes through the menu 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.989
 to navigate once 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 otherwise no heating buttons and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.879
 you just confirm that it stands 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 through these buttons on the bottom 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.960
 we have a micro-usb connection then 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.670
 continue here connection for two antennas 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 there you can see it very well 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.689
 and then of course you can top right 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.280
 as always open the device and there 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.470
 you can see that again and again 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.689
 plastic cover of the battery is apparently 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.280
 so you can not fix it 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.320
 readily exchange 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.840
 on the top we have one 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.299
 micro SIM card connection and once 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.820
 mito means that you can too 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.649
 a 64 gigabyte or a small card 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.090
 in here and bring the memory with 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:33.970
 all connected devices in the network 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.600
 do not use any other connections 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.759
 I'm around here 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.740
 on the bottom we still have 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:44.350
 a reset button so what else can 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.429
 The device we have a new July one 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.149
 new app for the android and iphone 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.860
 smartphones then we have up to ten 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.369
 devices that can connect to it 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.060
 and of course category 6 lte that is 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.759

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.670
 second 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.160
 we have 3000 milliliter big ones 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.819
 Battery installed there is enough for up to ten 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.020
 hours 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.420
 and otherwise you can also about this 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.470
 micro-usb connection also be smartphone 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.319
 that is, if the smartphone is charging 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.390
 empty is just plug in the cable 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.610
 that share of smartphone and already becomes 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.000

 But even so will soon 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.640
 to be announced I guess it 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.150
 will be over 200 euros 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.519
 because it just becomes a world for 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:55.360

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:57.280
