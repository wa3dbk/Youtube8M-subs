what it looks like from far away it is a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.930 
what it looks like from far away it is a
normal<00:00:39.780> tree<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.950> only<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.489> I've<00:00:41.610> done<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
normal tree the only thing I've done to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.729 
normal tree the only thing I've done to
make<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> different<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.020> planted<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.680> tree

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
make it different is I planted this tree

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440 
make it different is I planted this tree
here<00:00:44.340> because<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.820> accidentally<00:00:45.239> broke

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
here because I accidentally broke

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.100

through the leaves there otherwise

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
through the leaves there otherwise
that's<00:00:49.559> completely<00:00:49.950> natural<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.570> you

to look out on the world we um but yeah
I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.720> best<00:01:30.900> thing<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I think the best thing about this is the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.830 
I think the best thing about this is the
water<00:01:31.740> slides<00:01:32.070> only<00:01:32.340> mini<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.850> obviously

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
water slides only mini and obviously

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840 
water slides only mini and obviously
because<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:34.950> venture<00:01:35.280> editor<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> had

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
because it's not in venture editor I had

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.310 
because it's not in venture editor I had
to<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.180> stingy<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.259> my<00:01:37.740> blocks<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.840> often

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
to be stingy with my blocks so it often

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
to be stingy with my blocks so it often
breaks<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.670> down<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.600> here's<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.990> clip

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
breaks on the way down but here's a clip

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.170 
breaks on the way down but here's a clip
of<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.470> working<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.430> enjoy<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:46.970> okay<00:01:47.970> if

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of it working so enjoy that okay if

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.840 
of it working so enjoy that okay if
you're<00:01:48.360> being<00:01:48.570> rather<00:01:49.290> observant<00:01:50.009> you'll

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you're being rather observant you'll

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.330 
you're being rather observant you'll
have<00:01:51.000> noticed<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.829> has<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.189> been

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
have noticed that that bit has just been

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.139 
have noticed that that bit has just been
widened<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.509> pretty<00:01:54.659> much<00:01:54.780> because<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
widened and that's pretty much because I

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.819 
widened and that's pretty much because I
thought<00:01:57.149> maybe<00:01:57.450> my<00:01:57.810> brother<00:01:58.170> kept<00:01:58.439> crashing

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
thought maybe my brother kept crashing

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
thought maybe my brother kept crashing
because<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.549> getting<00:01:59.670> damaged<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
because it's getting damaged here at the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.740 
because it's getting damaged here at the
beginning<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.579> attempt<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.479> think

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
beginning so here is attempt I think

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.560 
beginning so here is attempt I think
number<00:02:03.899> three<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.860> getting<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:05.640> just

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
number three of getting it right just

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.210 
number three of getting it right just
turn<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.899> right<00:02:07.170> way

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
turn the right way

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.790 
turn the right way
ah<00:02:08.509> there<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.570> go<00:02:09.600> right<00:02:10.110> hopefully<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.649> won't

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
ah there we go right hopefully it won't

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.720 
ah there we go right hopefully it won't
crash<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:11.340> time<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.770> right<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.700> you

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
crash this time here we go right and you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.200 
crash this time here we go right and you
got<00:02:15.000> ya<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.990> always<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.290> hurt<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:17.210> and

you're<00:02:18.630> into<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.050> end<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.740> then<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
you're into the end bit and then you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.950
