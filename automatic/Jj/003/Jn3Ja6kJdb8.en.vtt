hello and welcome to PLC cable comm in
this<00:00:04.859> video<00:00:05.220> we're<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> cover<00:00:05.819> using<00:00:06.540> a

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
this video we're going to cover using a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.340 
this video we're going to cover using a
1747<00:00:08.220> u<00:00:08.910> IC<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:10.309> connecting<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.840> 503<00:00:12.840> slit

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
1747 u IC and connecting to a 503 slit

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.250 
1747 u IC and connecting to a 503 slit
first<00:00:16.350> open<00:00:16.680> up<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:16.830> control<00:00:17.279> panel

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
first open up your control panel

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
first open up your control panel
and<00:00:19.670> your<00:00:20.670> device<00:00:21.000> manager<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.510> we

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and your device manager this is so we

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
and your device manager this is so we
can<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:24.990> where<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.529> cables<00:00:25.949> being<00:00:26.220> loaded<00:00:26.670> -

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
can see where the cables being loaded -

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880 
can see where the cables being loaded -
what<00:00:27.090> comport<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> being<00:00:28.140> assigned<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.680> the
