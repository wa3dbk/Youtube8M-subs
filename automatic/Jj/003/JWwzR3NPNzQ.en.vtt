00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.840
 hello very good I come to realize you a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.079
 game that although I think I already did it in 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.290
 one occasion, just in case I do 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.389
 he made them again 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.360
 and see if you like it anyway 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.990
 this is the realization in a next 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.439
 video the revelation and in a second 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.410
 rather the third video a rod 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.970
 mind 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.010
 I explain 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.890
 deliveries 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.730
 the deck of a spectator so that the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.070
 mix freely as many times as 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.239
 want and the way you want 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.260
 and as a last step it tells you to make 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.260
 a cut 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.610
 you ask your viewer to cut the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.400
 shuffle approximately in half and you 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.250
 deliver half of them 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.070
 and you play with one half 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.070
 and the neutral viewer is to say in this 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 moment you are a logical spectator 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.080
 I am a magician so I ask you to 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.640
 do an extension or fan and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.270
 you extract any letter and the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.320
 you see, I do not open but I'll do what 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.210
 own made an extension and I extract 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.450
 I take a letter from my pile 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.539
 you will see 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.790
 we have done this what remains for me 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.200
 Obviously observe my letter 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.369
 and return it to the downside 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.460
 short and complete to lose it through 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.579
 from you do the same I show you your 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.679
 letter I do not look so how am I 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.939
 sure you believe in fully in my 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.159
 good faith as there is no 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.409
 inconvenience so come I turn then 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.630
 monster in harp over you see I hope 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.430
 yes when you edited the video you know 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.530
 and the flight 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.590
 how to continue believing my good faith 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.929
 short by any point of the low not 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.170
 sorry now I expose the letter high 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.590
 as I have done before, short so that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 point to low and lose it by the center 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.959
 father made this you have a letter 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.490
 lost in a bunch I have a letter 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.280
 lost in good 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.780
 what happened I know my letter but I did not 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.910
 I know yours, I can not ask you either 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 because we do not interact this is 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.820
 recorded obviously but there is no 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.690
 problem in looking we put together the two 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.940
 mounds 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.000
 we cut and complete a father of three 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.470
 and how my baggage is magical because I have 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.950
 more than making a magic snap 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.040
 I would ask you your letter and I'll tell you 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.870
 my my letter is yours 7s 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.700
 I do not know because I have not seen it but I have not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.770
 there is no problem as I said 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.480
 after the magical game what we have 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.760
 fact is that the two letters despite 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.430
 the difference they had between them was 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.410
 They have automatically joined so 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.400
 totally magical so I have no more 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.780
 to look for my letter and next to it the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.120
 yours but half hugo your letter was on 8 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.530
 of clubs next to my seven of spades 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.670
 without any doubt 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.209
 I hope you liked the game 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.820
 You can perform freely with a deck 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.000
 standard to any viewer in 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.790
 Quarte the moment very simple but 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.110
 very shocking thank you very much and until the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.110
 next video despite the assessment
