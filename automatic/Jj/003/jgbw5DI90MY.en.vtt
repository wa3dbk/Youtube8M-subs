 And click on "Services". 

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.699
 On the General tab, do not change anything ... 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.666
 On the UPnp tab check the option "Allow Kodi control via UPnP". 

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:46.666
 In the Webserver tab check "Allow Kodi control over HTTP". 

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:50.666
 I recommend using port 8080. 

00:00:50.666 --> 00:01:01.432
 Now enter a password, you will need to enter the login and password in the control application. 

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:09.599
 On the Remote Control tab mark the second option as in the video. 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.466
 And on the Zeroconf tab mark the first and only option. This option can only be checked if you have installed Bonjour.
