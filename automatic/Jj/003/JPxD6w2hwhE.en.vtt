00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
 getting to know two new people a day 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.630

 Schöller is very extensive 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 to offer 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.660
 Of course, secondary is not 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.699
 secondary but almost the same 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.159
 Acquisition of new customers is very important 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.040
 this is the market in all areas 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.050
 what to do with gastronomy 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.039
 furthermore we have some small ones 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.880
 tasks still with threatening delivery 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.439
 threaten tenants change financing the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.759
 We also have to do it with the customer 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.009
 prepare 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.890
 My daily routine looks like that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.290

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.280
 once with greater success once, of course 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.170
 even with minor setbacks but that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.970
 happens from monday to thursday 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.509

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.140
 to work where I list too 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.829

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.590
 are new ways for our company 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.930
 and to open up new channels 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.730
 These lists will be on friday 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.260
 and of course the planning for 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.470
 the next week is also very fridays 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.200
 important 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.590
 I come I'm native born off road 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.260

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.360

 also allowed to do my instructor 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.740
 I am then for professional reasons 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.330
 Retired from the hotel industry in 2005 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.790
 then I went into the field service 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.270
 both in retail and in the retail sector 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.030

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.870
 area and then 2011 to nestlé 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.920
 Schöller came over as District Manager 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.990
 a known namely earlier in the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.910

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.440
 I'm applying at nestlé schöller 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.660
 now at nestlé for two and a half years 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.670
 schöller has wehrmacht one there 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.140
 going through if so in the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.530
 so-called Förderkreis 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.860
 been 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.480
 in order to easily later also leading position 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.120
 to take over 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.980
 it would partly without my career 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.750
 yes yes that by saying in the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.400
 sales you can sell everything 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.769
 of course it helps me my career 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.330
 as a cook and as the chef 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.530
 better to bring products to the man 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.269
 for sale 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.430
 also the product knowledge also the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.200
 market knowledge to the competitors or 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.739
 of course helps me to the competitors 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.209
 in the field service area in the sales man 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.400
 should definitely pay in sales 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.560
 you should have a lot of knowledge 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.209
 you should bring the knowledge of humanity 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.090
 but also be open to people 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.160
 can go and with people too 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.670
 can handle and communicate that 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.980
 very important 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.720
 So restrictions are natural 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.900
 every day to overcome 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.989
 really 10 to 88 it's the customer's dates 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.120
 or anyone, of course 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.100
 day in the car every day also a lot 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.389
 spending time in the car of course 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.410
 in between also much to telephone 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.020
 and many besides noise undertake 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.669
 things that you have to work on 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.530
 Not only to work with phone 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.110
 his ten customer dates but also 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.419
 his whole things the one by one 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.760
 it has to be processed, if there is a change of tenants 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.530
 be it the customer stornos one 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.720
 Reclamation from the customer who can enter 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.700
 of course, that all in harmony 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.510
 to bring a day 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.040
 Restrictions actually less though 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.540
 Challenges are, of course, yourself 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.060
 on the different cultures 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.500
 various needs also the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.940
 hire customers 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.350
 on the most diverse 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.180
 requirements a customer for example 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.430
 in the hotel industry or in the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.150
 hospital or just in the kiosk or in the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.070
 gas station area has daily with 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.350
 different customers to deal with 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.870
 and also adjust 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.910
 So my first roger is me 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.000
 Spicy would be natural 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.320
 So, really, okay to say okay 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.520
 because it is the basis for 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.830
 his further life also for the 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.630
 Career history something completely 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.440
 It is always important to be true to yourself 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.450
 and really go your way and as 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.310
 third is very important to me 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.050
 Father always said without no effort 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.060
 Price and I think that it quite quite 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.790
 important today in our job too 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.740
 say if I can see something somewhere 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.970
 then it can also reap some point so 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.890
 that is when I have a product at 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.750
 I can also provide customer lists 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.130
 someday take the sales with him 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.680
 I think so this is for also for 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.870
 14-year-old is very important to say is 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.920
 always busy because who does what for the 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.450
 there is also something around 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.450
 who does not do anything stays on the track
