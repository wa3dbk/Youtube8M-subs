00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hello everyone, it was cancer and today I want 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.010
 share with you relatively fresh 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.710
 information about diablo 3 and the reaper of souls 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.139
 so immediately would like to note also on 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.850
 very often asking questions first 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.350
 question and yes of course, how much will it be 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.779
 cost this patch and whether it will be at all 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.300
 paid yes it will be paid will cost 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.789
 30 dollars would also like to say about 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.929
 what is it almost like that in him 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 add a new 5 act add a level up 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.649
 70 also a new character will appear. 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.420
 paladin 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.309
 rather the crusader who used to be 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.059
 called the paladin in the second part he 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.719
 by the way take from there enough 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.670
 popular character 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.789
 would also like to say that he 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 there will be a middle battle he will not no 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.289
 close to monsters not very far away 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.430
 distance is his main parameter 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.500
 there will be power and in the right hand in his right 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.420
 hardened right hand he will have 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.750
 two-handed mace well as everyone knows 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.740
 comrades who abstain from 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.380
 some kind of connections for the knee right hand 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.220
 what about some new additions 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.140
 to this patch 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 of course the system will be introduced 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.710
 para 20 which will be originally 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.810
 summarize your entire paragon from all 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 characters that you had that is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.280
 if you had 10 characters 100 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.640
 paragon then in the new patch you will have 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.799
 all characters 360 of some kind of paragon 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.470
 and accordingly all those characteristics 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.320
 which you got with all these 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.240
 cultivation levels you can 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 scatter yourself as in the second part 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 diablo that is the power you can do yourself 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 scatter intelligence vitality agility and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.149
 all other parameters that will be there 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.320
 are given 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 The following is what I would like for you 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.750
 tell it a system of drop 20 that is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.070
 system dropout of legendary things yet 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.009
 I repeat that now 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.399
 legends will be tied to an account and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.110
 plus everything that you knocked out 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.390
 By the way there is more information about what 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.080
 gold will also be tied to an account in 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.960
 In this case, be bent 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.060
 many sites selling gold die 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.490
 sites also selling things so 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530
 keep that in mind but still why me 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.860
 it seems that gold does not tie 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.990
 account is a little bit silly but in 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.540
 beta version gold is tied to an account 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.310
 unfortunately so something like this means 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.710
 the situation is as follows 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.710
 way this is a dropout system 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.570
 clothes 20 that is now everyones 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.940
 legends that you will fall 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.620
 Of course they are much cooler than yellow ones. 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.880
 clothes will be this time that is there already 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.380
 right on order and plus to all 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.959
 Legends will be customized 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.300
 of your particular character 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.000
 let's say if you play as a sorcerer 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.700
 then you legend will fall with 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.130
 more likely to that in them 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.620
 proc no intelligence or any 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.350
 another characteristic is necessary 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.570
 your character would also like 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.760
 tell a little about the clan system 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.220
 which will be released in the new patch she of course 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.890
 does it mean ordinary clans 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.130
 which is for example like warcraft or 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.820
 in other online games it means that 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.830
 such a clan is this division of people 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.800
 which are combined under a certain 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.630
 flag sweat time zone or just by 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.430
 interests, that is, we probably have 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.380
 group will also be a clan that will 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.040
 be called oddly enough herringbone burn 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.830
 so I tentatively invite you to 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.209
 this clan in order for us to say so 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.400
 whether cancer is related to 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.070
 means new such chips as a dungeon 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.310
 it will probably be introduced already on 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.440
 Currently there is information about what 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.260
 there is a secret level taken from the second 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.480
 parts diablo is a secret level with 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.420
 cows there are also present cow 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.500
 whose king do you kill 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.019
 get pretty solid 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.150
 rewards will also be introduced 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.489
 dungeon once again in which 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.519
 you will run a group kill 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.280
 mean last boss in the end 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.250
 and if you killed him then you get out 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.530
 dungeons quite so good that you 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.700
 gathered up in this dungeon if you don't 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.120
 killed them 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.540
 rather, they didn't kill him, then you all lose 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.950
 Here is such an unfair system 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.230
 I would also like to tell a little about 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.750
 the fortune teller is interesting enough 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.050
 character because with her 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.570
 abilities you can add to your 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.890
 to certain things 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.050
 characteristics that will rise but 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.910
 only one will be possible 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.250
 raise to my knowledge that is 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.150
 if you have any mace 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.790
 200 strength 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.270
 you can raise this power to 600 k 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.790
 for example 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.400
 but the damage and other parameters will remain 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.010
 as they were before 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.560
 so also with the help of fortunetellers can 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.960
 means to change the look of any thing 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.360
 which you will have if you do not like 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.640
 like the view in the legend of what you are 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.970
 you can change it and give it a look 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.370
 any white or blue things that you 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.350
 knocked out that is now plus to everything else 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.450
 white and blue clothes 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.970
 do not lose their certain 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.400
 values so they will now need 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.950
 you in order to make your 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.250
 character individual or even 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.520
 unique also want to remind you 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.710
 that is likely to close the auction 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.780
 so there is such a connection 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.450
 unique opportunity to visit you 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.340
 wonderful site loot hunter on which 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.770
 just sold all sorts of 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.560
 wonderful things where you can easily 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.150
 get them there buy there of course 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.190
 there are very good things 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.400
 accordingly , their prices are also very 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.380
 high after the patch I think this site 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.430
 it will be very well in demand after all 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.520
 I can not 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.970
 means to resist such a big 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.860
 the site is why I better say so 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.630
 I will advertise it in order to 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.910
 it was more convenient for you to buy some 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.740
 certain things but just in case you 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.870
 can go to the VKontakte group 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.280
 our and there, too, there is a post in which you 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.380
 you can post some 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.060
 certain things to them 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.190
 sell or find something for 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.990
 yourself that's actually on this and everything 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.820
 you had cancer subscribe to 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.440
 channel join the VKontakte group 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.440
 all the best and goodbye 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.090
 I also want to remind you that I 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.680
 still no one gave 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.300
 customer beta testing therefore me 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.639
 you have to shoot like this 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.650
 in a similar way let me remind you again 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.439
 what if you have a key 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.449
 please let me take some 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:52.909
 good full patch videos 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.650
 because i have to scoff 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.710
 over some definite 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.590
 life situations so that at least 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.759
 something on the channel was because neither about 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.759
 what is not easy to shoot 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.490
 I also want to say that now 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:12.400
 the complexity of the monsters will cancel now 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.130
 five kinds of difficulties is the norm 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.880
 above normal slightly above normal ahtung and 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.880
 full ahtung
