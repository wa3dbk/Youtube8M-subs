one in the claw for a month and karen is
it<00:00:33.540> looks<00:00:33.840> pretty<00:00:33.960> cool<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.739> does<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it looks pretty cool it does not have a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
it looks pretty cool it does not have a
functional<00:00:35.880> scope<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.450> looks<00:00:37.050> exactly<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
functional scope it looks exactly the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.810 
functional scope it looks exactly the
same<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:40.040> just<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.190> 1i<00:00:41.399> winter

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
same as this one just this 1i winter

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.799 
same as this one just this 1i winter
camo<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.620> functional<00:00:43.980> hood

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
camo but this one is the functional hood

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.010 
camo but this one is the functional hood
so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.649> because<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:48.239> if

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
so I like this one because like if

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
so I like this one because like if
there's<00:00:49.350> long<00:00:49.559> range<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.520> for

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there's long range it's good for

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
there's long range it's good for
accurate<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.329> doesn't<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> best<00:00:52.170> rate

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
accurate it doesn't have the best rate

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.779 
accurate it doesn't have the best rate
of<00:00:52.469> fire<00:00:52.910> but<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.180> still<00:00:54.600> pretty<00:00:54.660> good<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of fire but it's still pretty good so it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.299 
of fire but it's still pretty good so it
has<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.149> 30<00:00:57.449> round<00:00:57.629> mag<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.649> should<00:00:58.949> spare

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
has a 30 round mag but it should spare

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.709 
has a 30 round mag but it should spare
in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.430> slope

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
in the slope

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.509 
in the slope
but<00:01:02.719> when<00:01:02.960> we<00:01:03.110> used<00:01:03.350> combined<00:01:03.920> with<00:01:04.159> burning

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
but when we used combined with burning

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.550 
but when we used combined with burning
bullets<00:01:04.850> from<00:01:04.970> long<00:01:05.210> range<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:06.229> is<00:01:06.380> pretty

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
bullets from long range it is pretty

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.680 
bullets from long range it is pretty
