out on DVD so it's only on VHS which is
I<00:03:47.820> believe<00:03:47.970> how<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.269> print<00:03:48.570> now<00:03:48.720> although<00:03:49.320> I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
I believe how to print now although I

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.900 
I believe how to print now although I
think<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:49.860> considered<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.310> classic<00:03:50.550> by<00:03:50.760> some

think it's considered a classic by some

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.880 
think it's considered a classic by some
people<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:51.739> very<00:03:52.739> 70s<00:03:53.010> movie<00:03:54.530> although<00:03:55.530> it's

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
people it's very 70s movie although it's

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.740 
people it's very 70s movie although it's
based<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.550> true<00:03:56.820> account<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.540> young

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
based on the true account of this young

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.000 
based on the true account of this young
schoolteacher<00:03:58.019> who<00:03:58.380> was<00:03:58.560> brutally<00:03:58.980> murdered

schoolteacher who was brutally murdered

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.150 
schoolteacher who was brutally murdered
so<00:03:59.870> not<00:04:00.870> something<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.680> necessarily<00:04:01.830> want

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
so not something you necessarily want

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.030 
so not something you necessarily want
associated<00:04:02.790> with<00:04:02.940> your<00:04:03.150> chocolate<00:04:03.720> bar<00:04:04.050> but<00:04:04.709> I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
associated with your chocolate bar but I

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.940 
associated with your chocolate bar but I
think<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.180> book<00:04:06.360> there<00:04:06.600> was<00:04:06.739> some<00:04:07.739> sort<00:04:07.860> of

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
think in the book there was some sort of

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.410 
think in the book there was some sort of
allusions<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.459> finding<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.910> right<00:04:09.030> kind<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.360> a

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
allusions to finding the right kind of a

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.490 
allusions to finding the right kind of a
man<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:10.400> obviously<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.550> girl<00:04:11.760> didn't<00:04:12.720> let's

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
man and obviously the girl didn't let's

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.979 
man and obviously the girl didn't let's
