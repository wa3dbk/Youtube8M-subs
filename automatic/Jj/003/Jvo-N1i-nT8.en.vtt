00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.660 

this<00:02:11.270> made<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.660> hard<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.260> work<00:02:12.590> her<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.190> do

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
this made it hard to work her and do

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.150 
this made it hard to work her and do
many<00:02:14.000> other<00:02:14.180> skills<00:02:14.570> like<00:02:14.810> fishing<00:02:15.410> and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
hunting I think no not hunting all some

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.780 
hunting I think no not hunting all some
of<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> skills<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:23.290> Jag<00:02:24.290> jagex<00:02:25.280> had<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.640> do

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
of the skills and a Jag jagex had to do

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.510 
of the skills and a Jag jagex had to do
something<00:02:26.270> about<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.080> they<00:02:27.770> took<00:02:28.070> out<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
something about it so they took out the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.570 
something about it so they took out the
wilds<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:29.600> said<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> trade<00:02:30.260> with<00:02:30.500> me<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:30.980> they

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
wilds they said a trade with me and they

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.680 
wilds they said a trade with me and they
made<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.940> game<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.150> lot<00:02:32.770> more<00:02:33.770> boring<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:37.190> I

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
made the game a lot more boring but I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.780 
made the game a lot more boring but I
guess<00:02:38.690> that's<00:02:39.170> all<00:02:39.770> they<00:02:39.980> could<00:02:40.040> do<00:02:40.490> pretty

guess that's all they could do pretty

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.940 
guess that's all they could do pretty
much

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.429

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
some agreement between us and everybody

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.740 
some agreement between us and everybody
for<00:03:11.459> us<00:03:12.459> have<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:13.629> wild<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:15.000> these<00:03:16.000> BOTS<00:03:16.329> and

stuff just disappear and just make the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.119 
stuff just disappear and just make the
game<00:03:24.700> how<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.209> used<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.689> the<00:03:26.409> main<00:03:26.680> reason

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
game how it used to be the main reason

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.720 
game how it used to be the main reason
why<00:03:27.280> most<00:03:27.519> people<00:03:27.939> would<00:03:28.150> play<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.459> have

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
why most people would play so I have

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.339 
why most people would play so I have
some<00:03:31.090> suggestions<00:03:31.530> suggestions<00:03:32.530> amount<00:03:33.310> and

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
some suggestions suggestions amount and

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:41.420 
some suggestions suggestions amount and
they<00:03:35.349> are

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.960 

my<00:03:42.430> first<00:03:42.880> suggestion<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:44.280> when<00:03:45.280> somebody

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
my first suggestion is when somebody

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.270 
my first suggestion is when somebody
tries<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.870> work<00:03:47.080> cut<00:03:47.350> they<00:03:47.650> have<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.980> press<00:03:48.250> a

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
tries to work cut they have to press a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.430 
tries to work cut they have to press a
random<00:03:48.880> key<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:50.020> keyboard<00:03:50.490> for<00:03:51.490> example<00:03:52.000> L

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
random key on the keyboard for example L

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.930 
random key on the keyboard for example L
when<00:03:53.440> if<00:03:53.710> they<00:03:53.920> don't<00:03:54.160> press<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.520> key<00:03:54.730> they

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
when if they don't press the key they

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.350 
when if they don't press the key they
won't<00:03:55.330> be<00:03:55.480> able<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.780> walk<00:03:55.930> up<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:57.160> if<00:03:58.150> they<00:03:58.300> do

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
won't be able to walk up and if they do

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.100 
won't be able to walk up and if they do
is<00:03:58.630> they<00:03:59.410> can<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.910> random<00:04:00.910> key<00:04:01.060> like<00:04:01.240> IL<00:04:01.900> 09<00:04:02.560> and

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
is they can a random key like IL 09 and

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.130 
is they can a random key like IL 09 and
it<00:04:05.110> might<00:04:05.710> be<00:04:05.740> a<00:04:05.980> little<00:04:06.400> more<00:04:06.850> difficult<00:04:07.630> to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
it might be a little more difficult to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.110 
it might be a little more difficult to
work<00:04:08.320> up<00:04:08.620> but<00:04:08.920> at<00:04:09.160> least<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.580> have<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.910> wall

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
work up but at least you have the wall

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.500 
work up but at least you have the wall
back<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:12.520> can<00:04:12.670> also<00:04:12.820> do<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.150> follow<00:04:13.360> the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
back and you can also do is follow the

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.780 
back and you can also do is follow the
skills<00:04:13.810> like<00:04:14.050> fishing<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.770> whatever<00:04:15.460> else

skills like fishing and whatever else
BOTS<00:04:16.299> do<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.739> could<00:04:18.220> stop<00:04:18.580> BOTS<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.770> hope

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
BOTS do this could stop BOTS and hope

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.990 
BOTS do this could stop BOTS and hope
people<00:04:22.060> have<00:04:22.300> fun<00:04:22.570> in<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.960> game

do nothing you can't log out if you get

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.180 
do nothing you can't log out if you get
a<00:05:31.360> pickup<00:05:31.629> penalty<00:05:32.229> can't<00:05:32.740> leave<00:05:34.830> your<00:05:35.830> force

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
a pickup penalty can't leave your force

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.790 
a pickup penalty can't leave your force
then<00:05:36.520> you<00:05:36.759> get<00:05:36.970> jumped<00:05:37.419> a<00:05:37.509> lot<00:05:37.690> it's<00:05:38.020> just<00:05:38.530> not

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
then you get jumped a lot it's just not

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.559 
then you get jumped a lot it's just not
cool<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:41.340> it's<00:05:42.340> made<00:05:42.639> a<00:05:42.669> lot<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:42.970> people<00:05:43.090> quit

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
cool and it's made a lot of people quit

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.140 
cool and it's made a lot of people quit
and<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:44.440> think<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:45.069> will<00:05:45.310> be<00:05:45.370> better<00:05:45.729> for<00:05:45.849> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
and I think it will be better for the

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.159 
and I think it will be better for the
game<00:05:46.360> if<00:05:46.539> you<00:05:46.690> just<00:05:46.990> lighten<00:05:47.710> up<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.130> little<00:05:48.310> if

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
game if you just lighten up a little if

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.629 
game if you just lighten up a little if
everyone's<00:05:50.169> really<00:05:50.409> willing<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:51.159> help<00:05:51.220> we

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
everyone's really willing to help we

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.450 
everyone's really willing to help we
could<00:05:51.940> change<00:05:52.720> this<00:05:54.240> if<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.690> have<00:05:55.900> your<00:05:56.139> own

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
could change this if you have your own

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.939 
could change this if you have your own
