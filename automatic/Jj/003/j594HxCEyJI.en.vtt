hi<00:00:11.070> my<00:00:11.280> name<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.460> Ovechkin<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.330> I'd<00:00:12.509> like<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
hi my name is Ovechkin and I'd like to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.900 
hi my name is Ovechkin and I'd like to
show<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.410> latest<00:00:13.559> creation<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.549> reason

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
show you my latest creation the reason

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.990 
show you my latest creation the reason
Bambino<00:00:15.590> the<00:00:16.590> main<00:00:16.800> design<00:00:17.369> objective<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
Bambino the main design objective of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.080 
Bambino the main design objective of
this<00:00:18.150> app<00:00:18.390> was<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.109> create<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.830> small<00:00:20.430> low-power

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
this app was to create a small low-power

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.779 
this app was to create a small low-power
damp<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.080> had<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> sound<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.130> feel<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
damp that had the sound the feel and the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.779 
damp that had the sound the feel and the
nuances<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.930> bigger<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.529> low<00:00:25.890> power<00:00:25.920> amps

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
nuances of a bigger on low power amps

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.910 
nuances of a bigger on low power amps
our<00:00:26.939> single<00:00:27.390> ended<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.869> design<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.619> that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
our single ended in design and that

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.209 
our single ended in design and that
doesn't<00:00:29.580> sound<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> same<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:31.019> push-pull<00:00:31.920> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
doesn't sound the same as push-pull a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
doesn't sound the same as push-pull a
larger<00:00:33.090> answer<00:00:33.420> push-pull<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
larger answer push-pull so we have a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.069 
larger answer push-pull so we have a
push-pull<00:00:35.250> circuit<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.570> captures

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
push-pull circuit and it really captures

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.369 
push-pull circuit and it really captures
the<00:00:37.260> feel<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.879> tone<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.239> larger<00:00:39.600> round<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the feel and tone of a larger round the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.530 
the feel and tone of a larger round the
amp<00:00:40.559> has<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.950> full<00:00:41.190> recent<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.030> channel

really responds to different cabinets
well<00:02:24.480> too<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:27.209> got<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.050> track<00:02:28.319> let's

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
well too so I got a little track let's

00:02:28.560 --> 00:03:01.830 
well too so I got a little track let's
give<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.830> listen

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.380 

on<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.140> Bambino<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:03.739> included<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.390> lineout

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
on the Bambino we included a lineout

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.869 
on the Bambino we included a lineout
feature<00:03:05.959> on<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.590> back<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.159> this<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.459> not<00:03:07.670> like

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
feature on the back and this is not like

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.780 
feature on the back and this is not like
any<00:03:08.060> other<00:03:08.150> line<00:03:08.540> out<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:09.409> just<00:03:09.709> taps<00:03:10.519> off

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
any other line out that just taps off

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.699 
any other line out that just taps off
the<00:03:10.940> speaker<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:11.510> something<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.049> it's

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
the speaker or something like that it's

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.910 
the speaker or something like that it's
it's<00:03:13.400> got<00:03:13.640> inductive<00:03:14.239> coils<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.080> simulate<00:03:15.379> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
it's got inductive coils to simulate the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.309 
it's got inductive coils to simulate the
speaker<00:03:16.549> response<00:03:16.940> curve<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:18.290> a

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
speaker response curve and then a

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.400 
speaker response curve and then a
complex<00:03:18.799> filter<00:03:19.250> network<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.840> simulate<00:03:21.049> it's

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
complex filter network to simulate it's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.830 
complex filter network to simulate it's
frequency<00:03:21.739> response<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.640> recorded<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.660> couple

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
frequency response I recorded a couple

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.869 
frequency response I recorded a couple
of<00:03:24.049> clips<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.470> let's<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.860> go<00:03:25.069> ahead<00:03:25.129> and<00:03:25.400> give

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
of clips so let's just go ahead and give

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.789 
of clips so let's just go ahead and give
it<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> listen<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.390> AV<00:03:26.750> comparison<00:03:27.349> between<00:03:27.590> a

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
it a listen the AV comparison between a

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.299 
it a listen the AV comparison between a
microphone<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.819> right<00:03:29.150> now
