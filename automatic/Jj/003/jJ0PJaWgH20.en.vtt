00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.820 

hi<00:00:07.450> Dave<00:00:07.720> here<00:00:07.870> with<00:00:07.899> cross<00:00:08.230> rope<00:00:08.469> and<00:00:08.620> today<00:00:08.800> I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
hi Dave here with cross rope and today I

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.860 
hi Dave here with cross rope and today I
want<00:00:09.070> to<00:00:09.160> talk<00:00:09.340> about<00:00:09.580> an<00:00:10.090> issue<00:00:10.360> that<00:00:10.750> I<00:00:10.840> think

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
want to talk about an issue that I think

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.660 
want to talk about an issue that I think
is<00:00:11.170> a<00:00:11.200> point<00:00:11.410> of<00:00:11.500> confusion<00:00:11.680> for<00:00:12.370> a<00:00:12.400> lot<00:00:12.580> of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
is a point of confusion for a lot of

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.369 
is a point of confusion for a lot of
people<00:00:12.940> in<00:00:13.030> Fitness<00:00:13.420> when<00:00:14.080> they're<00:00:14.199> looking

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379 
people in Fitness when they're looking

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.100 
people in Fitness when they're looking
into<00:00:14.680> jumping<00:00:15.039> rope<00:00:15.340> and<00:00:15.639> that's<00:00:16.240> weighted

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
into jumping rope and that's weighted

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.620 
into jumping rope and that's weighted
ropes<00:00:17.410> so<00:00:18.369> there's<00:00:18.550> two<00:00:18.789> different<00:00:18.820> kinds<00:00:19.510> of

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
ropes so there's two different kinds of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.210 
ropes so there's two different kinds of
weighted<00:00:19.900> ropes<00:00:20.140> there's<00:00:20.380> one<00:00:20.619> kind<00:00:20.890> where

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
weighted ropes there's one kind where

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.760 
weighted ropes there's one kind where
the<00:00:21.310> weight<00:00:21.460> is<00:00:21.490> in<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:21.940> handles<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:22.900> then

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
the weight is in the handles and then

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.680 
the weight is in the handles and then
there's<00:00:23.980> another<00:00:24.100> kind<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.700> where<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.480> weight

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
there's another kind of where the weight

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.140 
there's another kind of where the weight
is<00:00:25.720> in<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.380> rope<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:27.430> a<00:00:27.490> lot<00:00:27.670> of<00:00:27.760> people<00:00:27.970> don't

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
is in the rope and a lot of people don't

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.210 
is in the rope and a lot of people don't
have<00:00:28.360> a<00:00:28.539> fundamental<00:00:29.380> understanding<00:00:29.470> what

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
have a fundamental understanding what

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.859 
have a fundamental understanding what
the<00:00:30.340> difference<00:00:30.730> is<00:00:30.910> between<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.450> two<00:00:31.570> types

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
the difference is between the two types

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.450 
the difference is between the two types
and<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.460> benefits<00:00:34.120> that<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:35.649> type<00:00:35.890> has<00:00:36.129> over

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
and the benefits that one type has over

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.050 
and the benefits that one type has over
another<00:00:36.699> so<00:00:37.540> for<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.200> sake<00:00:38.410> of<00:00:38.910> creating<00:00:39.910> an

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
another so for the sake of creating an

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.850 
another so for the sake of creating an
example<00:00:40.600> today<00:00:40.780> I've<00:00:41.079> actually<00:00:41.260> got<00:00:41.560> two

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
example today I've actually got two

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.270 
example today I've actually got two
pounds<00:00:42.180> wrist<00:00:43.180> weights<00:00:43.420> on<00:00:44.079> each<00:00:44.590> of<00:00:44.739> my<00:00:44.770> arms

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
pounds wrist weights on each of my arms

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.330 
pounds wrist weights on each of my arms
and<00:00:45.430> I'm<00:00:46.030> using<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.570> standard<00:00:47.320> weight<00:00:47.860> jump

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
and I'm using a standard weight jump

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.900 
and I'm using a standard weight jump
rope<00:00:48.610> that's<00:00:49.270> very<00:00:49.540> similar<00:00:49.899> in<00:00:50.170> weight<00:00:50.440> as

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
rope that's very similar in weight as

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.690 
rope that's very similar in weight as
the<00:00:52.110> jump<00:00:53.110> ropes<00:00:53.350> with<00:00:53.620> weighted<00:00:53.980> handles<00:00:54.489> for

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
the jump ropes with weighted handles for

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.280 
the jump ropes with weighted handles for
the<00:00:54.730> weight<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.120> inside<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.809> handle<00:00:56.140> so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
the weight is inside the handle so

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.720 
the weight is inside the handle so
normally<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.710> weight<00:00:56.890> will<00:00:57.040> be<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.190> half<00:00:57.399> pound

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
normally the weight will be a half pound

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.870 
normally the weight will be a half pound
or<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.940> pound<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.710> instance<00:01:00.100> I've<00:01:00.219> got<00:01:00.250> two

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
or a pound in this instance I've got two

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.540 
or a pound in this instance I've got two
pounds<00:01:01.120> on<00:01:01.390> each<00:01:01.420> wrist<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.890> issue<00:01:03.340> with

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
pounds on each wrist now the issue with

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.580 
pounds on each wrist now the issue with
these<00:01:04.089> type<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.449> weighted<00:01:04.809> ropes<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.350> when<00:01:05.469> to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
these type of weighted ropes and when to

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.010 
these type of weighted ropes and when to
design<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.340> that<00:01:07.000> when<00:01:07.270> you're<00:01:07.420> jumping<00:01:07.719> with

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
design is that when you're jumping with

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.559 
design is that when you're jumping with
proper<00:01:08.469> form<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.159> holding<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.179> rope<00:01:10.389> you're

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
proper form and holding the rope you're

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.239 
proper form and holding the rope you're
not<00:01:10.719> actually<00:01:10.899> moving<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.499> weight<00:01:11.709> very<00:01:12.009> much

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
not actually moving the weight very much

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:13.620 
not actually moving the weight very much
whether<00:01:12.490> it's<00:01:12.729> in<00:01:12.819> your<00:01:12.850> handle<00:01:13.270> or<00:01:13.389> on<00:01:13.509> the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
whether it's in your handle or on the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.629 
whether it's in your handle or on the
wrist<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.590> when<00:01:14.740> I'm<00:01:14.859> jumping<00:01:15.130> with<00:01:15.520> these

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:15.639 
wrist so when I'm jumping with these

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.020 
wrist so when I'm jumping with these
weights<00:01:15.909> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.369> weights<00:01:18.579> are<00:01:18.759> almost

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
weights on the weights are almost

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.319 
weights on the weights are almost
staying<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.539> same<00:01:19.780> spot<00:01:20.139> not<00:01:20.439> moving<00:01:20.889> a<00:01:21.039> lot

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
staying the same spot not moving a lot

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.440 
staying the same spot not moving a lot
and<00:01:22.329> the<00:01:23.049> more<00:01:23.590> my<00:01:23.889> forms<00:01:24.369> or<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.759> more<00:01:25.149> work

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
and the more my forms or the more work

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.870 
and the more my forms or the more work
out<00:01:25.569> of<00:01:25.630> getting<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.369> using<00:01:27.369> waves<00:01:27.639> or<00:01:27.850> a

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
out of getting so using waves or a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.639 
out of getting so using waves or a
weighted<00:01:28.179> rope<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.659> almost<00:01:28.840> encourages<00:01:29.499> you

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
weighted rope it almost encourages you

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.029 
weighted rope it almost encourages you
to<00:01:29.979> have<00:01:30.969> poor<00:01:31.329> government<00:01:31.929> forms<00:01:32.319> moving

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
to have poor government forms moving

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.289 
to have poor government forms moving
your<00:01:33.189> arms<00:01:33.459> all<00:01:33.579> over<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.880> place<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.179> that

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
your arms all over the place so that

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.749 
your arms all over the place so that
you're<00:01:34.420> actually<00:01:34.659> moving<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.229> weight<00:01:35.409> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you're actually moving the weight and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.440 
you're actually moving the weight and
getting<00:01:36.759> worked<00:01:37.119> up<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.759> reason<00:01:40.090> that's<00:01:40.179> a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
getting worked up the reason that's a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.629 
getting worked up the reason that's a
problem<00:01:40.479> as<00:01:40.929> well<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.409> because<00:01:41.770> with<00:01:42.340> all<00:01:42.490> this

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:42.639 
problem as well is because with all this

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:44.879 
problem as well is because with all this
weight<00:01:42.880> body<00:01:43.209> now<00:01:43.630> your<00:01:44.409> wrists<00:01:44.709> whether

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
weight body now your wrists whether

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.410 
weight body now your wrists whether
you're<00:01:45.069> wearing<00:01:45.219> with<00:01:45.520> wrist<00:01:45.819> weights<00:01:45.999> or

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
you're wearing with wrist weights or

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.550 
you're wearing with wrist weights or
whether<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.139> the<00:01:47.229> weight<00:01:47.349> of<00:01:47.469> the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
whether it's in the weight of the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.469 
whether it's in the weight of the
handles<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.340> becomes<00:01:48.999> a<00:01:49.060> little<00:01:49.179> bit<00:01:49.270> more

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
handles it becomes a little bit more

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.819 
handles it becomes a little bit more
difficult<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.959> feel<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.529> light<00:01:50.709> away

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
difficult to feel the light away

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.239 
difficult to feel the light away
troponin<00:01:51.369> hampers<00:01:51.880> your<00:01:52.119> coordination

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
troponin hampers your coordination

00:01:53.249 --> 00:02:01.669 
troponin hampers your coordination
so<00:01:57.029> the<00:01:58.029> difference<00:01:58.539> with<00:01:58.719> a<00:01:58.749> weighted<00:01:59.200> rope

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.199 

like<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.859> ropes<00:02:03.039> that<00:02:03.249> cross<00:02:03.579> rope<00:02:03.819> carries

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
like the ropes that cross rope carries

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.569 
like the ropes that cross rope carries
is<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:05.109> the<00:02:05.439> overall<00:02:05.919> weight<00:02:06.310> might

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
is that the overall weight might

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.309 
is that the overall weight might
actually<00:02:06.819> be<00:02:07.209> less<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:07.749> this<00:02:07.840> is

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
actually be less so this is

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.390 
actually be less so this is
Rover<00:02:09.090> however<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:11.079> encourages<00:02:11.739> proper<00:02:12.129> form

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
Rover however it encourages proper form

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.880 
Rover however it encourages proper form
and<00:02:12.459> technique<00:02:13.230> because<00:02:14.230> I'm<00:02:14.379> going<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.769> be

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and technique because I'm going to be

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.860 
and technique because I'm going to be
keeping<00:02:15.040> my<00:02:15.340> wrists<00:02:15.670> stable<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.390> rotating

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
keeping my wrists stable on rotating

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.599 
keeping my wrists stable on rotating
using<00:02:17.230> good<00:02:17.349> format<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.920> faster<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.579> I

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
using good format the faster that I

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.699 
using good format the faster that I
rotate<00:02:18.969> the<00:02:19.150> rope<00:02:19.359> because<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.379> way<00:02:20.469> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
rotate the rope because of the way the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.709 
rotate the rope because of the way the
weight<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.069> distributed<00:02:21.219> and<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.239> distance

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.719 
weight is distributed and the distance

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.599 
weight is distributed and the distance
that<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.930> moving<00:02:23.230> around<00:02:23.349> me<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.159> more

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
that is moving around me the more

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.220 
that is moving around me the more
resistance<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.390> more<00:02:25.569> benefits<00:02:26.019> that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
resistance and the more benefits that

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.319 
resistance and the more benefits that
I'm<00:02:26.319> getting<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.400> if<00:02:27.459> I'm<00:02:27.609> rotating<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.180> rope

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
I'm getting so if I'm rotating the rope

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.729 
I'm getting so if I'm rotating the rope
here<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.870> actually<00:02:29.019> much<00:02:29.409> more

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
here this is actually much more

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:30.809 
here this is actually much more
challenging<00:02:30.099> than<00:02:30.549> what<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.760> just

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
challenging than what I just

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.190 
challenging than what I just
demonstrated<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:31.689> wrist<00:02:31.959> weights

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
demonstrated with the wrist weights

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
demonstrated with the wrist weights
because<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.129> weight<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.340> moving<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:34.060> much

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
because the weight is moving a much

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.960 
because the weight is moving a much
greater<00:02:34.720> distance<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.400> start<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.790> rotate

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
greater distance and I start to rotate

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.530 
greater distance and I start to rotate
faster<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.340> lot<00:02:39.549> more<00:02:39.790> suitable<00:02:40.299> force

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
faster it's a lot more suitable force

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.490 
faster it's a lot more suitable force
being<00:02:40.810> generated<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.489> lot<00:02:42.700> more

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
being generated it's a lot more

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.920 
being generated it's a lot more
challenging<00:02:44.500> for<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.459> upper<00:02:45.700> body<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.900> just

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
challenging for the upper body so just

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.440 
challenging for the upper body so just
something<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.379> take<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.620> consideration

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
something to take into consideration

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.580 
something to take into consideration
when<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.599> jump<00:02:49.840> ropes<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.139> the<00:02:50.230> weight<00:02:50.409> in<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
when you jump ropes to the weight in the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.069 
when you jump ropes to the weight in the
handle<00:02:50.950> or<00:02:51.040> using<00:02:51.340> wrist<00:02:51.579> weights<00:02:52.079> you're

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
handle or using wrist weights you're

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.339 
handle or using wrist weights you're
barely<00:02:53.650> moving<00:02:53.919> that<00:02:54.099> weight<00:02:54.340> at<00:02:54.489> all

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
barely moving that weight at all

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.170 
barely moving that weight at all
weighted<00:02:56.349> rope<00:02:56.530> or<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.829> weight<00:02:57.069> is<00:02:57.370> actually

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
weighted rope or the weight is actually

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.899 
weighted rope or the weight is actually
distributed<00:02:58.450> throughout<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.959> rope<00:02:59.909> creates

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
distributed throughout the rope creates

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.580 
distributed throughout the rope creates
a<00:03:01.000> lot<00:03:01.209> more<00:03:01.480> resistance<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.409> going<00:03:02.530> to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
a lot more resistance and it's going to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.120 
a lot more resistance and it's going to
offer<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.859> lot<00:03:03.069> more<00:03:03.129> upper-body<00:03:03.549> benefits
