00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.950
 the temperatures are falling and maybe 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.319
 it is with them so that the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.120
 cravings for sweets rise with it but 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.190
 not even the kilos on the hips anymore 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 jennifer frank has become for us 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.769
 for absolutely healthy sweets 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 looked 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:26.519
 whether cakes or energy balls with 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:28.560
 raw food is possible in the shooting master 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.070
 house in ardagger market in mostviertel 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.360
 Today is sweet without oven must 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.950
 I agree with myself today 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.170
 We are very much looking forward to the results 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.610
 make a coconut cake today and then 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.510
 in connection two more 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.940
 energy ball 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.469
 It is all sweet, still very healthy 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.469
 and that's because of the acoustic 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.910
 ingredients we use we think about 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.930
 going from 42 degree fever we die 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.710
 it's also about the temperature at the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 foods 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.500
 that means from 42 degrees change like 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 and more specifically, every day the point 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.730
 Tastes or really at 600 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.320
 markets that means we will not be 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.670
 our first task is to heat 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.540
 but to get this coconut on 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.479
 been made 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.970
 So before the coconut is in mine 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 you have to open the hand 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.950
 It can be very simple 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.360
 the coconut water running out 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.500
 now with the blunt knife side 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.090
 hit the coconut a couple of times 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.130
 the easiest way is the coconut meat 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.990
 with a spoon out between peel 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.520
 and meat products and pry again and again 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.490
 and then we throw the cocoons pieces in 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.450
 a good stand mixa now come there to do 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.890
 Add cocoa powder and mix again 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.810
 the finished mass will be in a great 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.920
 form and smooth and painted 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.110
 for a few hours in the refrigerator 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.580
 make it especially nice now 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 how fast is a paper going now? 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.440
 off and is still on the pie tracht 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.030
 and sprinkled with coconut flakes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.190
 as you know , that's the eye with 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.830
 Now we come to the next sweet 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.820
 temptation to show and have almonds 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.350
 cut it now then 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.740
 easier to formula energy balls 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.450
 can 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.940
 they are both very valuable for 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.979
 our body why yes that is in the 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.080
 bowls you have in here like that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.780
 very for antioxidants and we have 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.640
 show large amounts of magnesium and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.730
 chop almonds together and still 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.950
 To give poppies to bring the daniela 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.959
 you sit lemons for good taste 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.239
 and his readers too dear and towards 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.519
 its roots so clearly faster the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.940
 mass to form a dough kneading balls 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.260
 and pivot in residential and in the cocoons 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.340
 energy balls the game begins 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.230
 again from the front 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.540
 this time will be dates and almonds 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.880
 minced coconut water or normal 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.070
 Pour water over it and add coconut 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.799
 and lemon juice again 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.720
 mold and sprinkle with coconut and then 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.410
 Can enjoy without a bad conscience 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.810
