speed<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.430> think<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:54.000> would<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.330> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
speed and so I think it would be a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.780 
speed and so I think it would be a
fascinating<00:02:54.690> matchup<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:56.310> i<00:02:56.460> have<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.760> tell
