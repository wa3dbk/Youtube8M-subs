ahead and connect a red link to our hook

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.460 
ahead and connect a red link to our hook
and<00:01:36.910> then<00:01:37.300> we'll<00:01:37.420> go<00:01:37.509> on<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:37.810> bottom<00:01:38.200> here

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
and then we'll go on to the bottom here

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.980 
and then we'll go on to the bottom here
and<00:01:38.590> we'll<00:01:38.800> pull<00:01:39.039> our<00:01:39.130> tensioning<00:01:39.610> cable

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and we'll pull our tensioning cable

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.270 
and we'll pull our tensioning cable
again<00:01:40.990> try<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.410> get<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:41.679> far<00:01:41.890> as<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.100> can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
again try to get as far as you can

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.680 
again try to get as far as you can
underneath<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.789> tape<00:01:43.000> underneath<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.479> tire

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
underneath the tape underneath the tire

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.919 
underneath the tape underneath the tire
here<00:01:43.960> it<00:01:44.560> really<00:01:44.890> helps<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.280> lot<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.690> then

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
here it really helps that a lot and then

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.630 
here it really helps that a lot and then
you<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.170> put<00:01:47.440> it<00:01:47.530> through<00:01:47.619> its<00:01:47.679> buckle<00:01:48.160> did

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
you can put it through its buckle did

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.870 
you can put it through its buckle did
you<00:01:48.759> just<00:01:48.880> open<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.330> up<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.750> just<00:01:50.789> kind<00:01:51.789> of

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
you just open this up and just kind of

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.800 
you just open this up and just kind of
stick<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.149> in<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:54.060> try<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.119> get<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.270> few<00:01:55.390> links<00:01:55.630> in

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
stick it in I try to get a few links in

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.810 
stick it in I try to get a few links in
there<00:01:56.020> hold<00:01:56.679> that<00:01:56.770> then<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.460> go<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.670> our

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
there hold that then you go to our

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.399 
there hold that then you go to our
attention<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.240> device<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:58.899> we<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.140> pull<00:01:59.350> it

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
attention and device and we just pull it

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.839 
attention and device and we just pull it
down<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.710> make<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.920> last<00:02:00.070> connection<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:03.670> it

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
down and make the last connection as it

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.460 
down and make the last connection as it
looks<00:02:04.030> right<00:02:04.209> now<00:02:04.300> lecture<00:02:04.959> looks<00:02:05.140> pretty

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
looks right now lecture looks pretty

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.830 
looks right now lecture looks pretty
awkward<00:02:05.649> but<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.459> fact<00:02:06.670> as<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:06.970> rotate<00:02:07.479> it'll

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
awkward but in fact as you rotate it'll

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.660 
awkward but in fact as you rotate it'll
actually<00:02:07.989> self<00:02:08.410> Center<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:08.860> all<00:02:09.520> right<00:02:09.640> now

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
actually self Center it so all right now

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.460 
actually self Center it so all right now
we<00:02:09.819> got<00:02:10.000> both<00:02:10.179> four<00:02:10.360> tires<00:02:10.569> chained<00:02:10.989> up<00:02:11.170> we'll

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
we got both four tires chained up we'll

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:33.610 
we got both four tires chained up we'll
go<00:02:11.590> ahead<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.860> take<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.130> for<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> test<00:02:12.640> drive

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.920 

as<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.489> can<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.940> self-centering<00:02:35.540> system

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
as you can see the self-centering system

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.930 
as you can see the self-centering system
actually<00:02:36.260> worked<00:02:36.410> pretty<00:02:36.620> good<00:02:36.739> we<00:02:37.580> started

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
actually worked pretty good we started

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.940 
actually worked pretty good we started
off<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.660> only<00:02:38.840> about<00:02:39.080> right<00:02:39.319> here<00:02:39.769> and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
off with the only about right here and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.890 
off with the only about right here and
it<00:02:40.250> actually<00:02:40.370> pulled<00:02:40.879> itself<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.480> our<00:02:41.510> towards

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
it actually pulled itself to our towards

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.690 
it actually pulled itself to our towards
the<00:02:42.019> middle<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:43.010> see<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> chain<00:02:43.519> is

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
the middle and you can see the chain is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.390 
the middle and you can see the chain is
relatively<00:02:44.209> centered<00:02:45.140> around<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.440> tire<00:02:45.650> cut

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
relatively centered around the tire cut

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.500 
relatively centered around the tire cut
through<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.550> couple<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.849> little<00:02:47.000> Tufts<00:02:47.269> runs

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
through a couple of little Tufts runs

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.820 
through a couple of little Tufts runs
here<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.900> can<00:02:48.050> actually<00:02:48.200> tell<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
here you can actually tell that the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.470 
here you can actually tell that the
chain<00:02:49.069> is<00:02:49.250> actually<00:02:49.400> centered<00:02:50.000> itself<00:02:50.269> even

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
chain is actually centered itself even

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.210 
chain is actually centered itself even
more<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.870> tire<00:02:51.080> which<00:02:51.319> proves<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.890> system

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
more in a tire which proves the system

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.430 
more in a tire which proves the system
worked<00:02:52.370> quite<00:02:52.670> well<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.870> there<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.170> it

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
worked quite well and there you have it

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.160 
worked quite well and there you have it
for<00:02:54.590> part<00:02:54.620> number<00:02:54.799> XG<00:02:55.640> dash<00:02:55.940> 12<00:02:56.360> with<00:02:56.930> thule

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
for part number XG dash 12 with thule
