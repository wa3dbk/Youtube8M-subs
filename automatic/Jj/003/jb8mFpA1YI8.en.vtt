00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.100
 Let's see if we can calculate how much 3 is 60. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.300
 There are several ways we can do it. 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:15.100
 You can look at it literally like three times 60, or 60 plus 60 plus 60. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.600
 And maybe you can think that in mind. 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.700
 60 plus 60 is 120, plus another 60 is 180. And we are ready. 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.500
 Another way is to introduce 3 in 60 as 3 in ... 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.800
 But instead of writing 60, we will record it as 6 in 10. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.100
 3 at 6 in 10. 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.000
 When you multiply three numbers like these, it does not matter in what order you will do the action. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 We could multiply the troy on the sixth and get 18, which we then multiply by 10. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.400
 A 18 by 10 will be equal to 180, ie 18 with 0 added. 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.300
 This will be equal to 180. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.400
 The more you exercise, you will understand that I could say: 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.500
 "3 by 6 is 18, but then I have to take care of this 0 here here, 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 so I'll put one more zero at the end, and I'll get 180. " 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
 The same answer we got here is here. 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.100
 Let's solve one more of these. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.500
 Let's say we want to multiply by 50 by 7. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.400
 I encourage you to stop the video and think about it, 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.100
 then release it again and see what I'm going to do. 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.800
 So 50 ... Well, there are several ways to think about it. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.000
 First: You can literally try to collect 50 times. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 Gathering 7 fifty times can take forever, but you can say straight away: 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.600
 50 plus 50 plus 50 plus 50 (here are four) plus 50 plus 50 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 (already 6, I will write it here again) plus 50. 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 And this is 50 times seven times. 50 plus 50 is 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350. 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.700
 You can think so, but you can assume there's an easier way. 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.500
 We only need to realize that 50 is exactly the same as 10 in 5. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.500
 And we can record this as 10 by 5, and multiply it by 7. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.100
 The order we multiply does not matter, so we can multiply first by 7. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 We know it's 35, and we'll multiply it by 10. 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:36.700
 10 by 35 (all we have to do is stick to zero after 35) will be equal to 350. 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.800
 (Now I want to color the scratch in the same color.) Will be equal to 350. 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.400
 Now you may understand that you can only see the fifth here, 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.700
 multiply it by the week and get 35, but you should not forget that it's not 5, 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.000
 and 50, and you must multiply by 10 or add this 0 at the end. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 So 50 by 7 is 350.
