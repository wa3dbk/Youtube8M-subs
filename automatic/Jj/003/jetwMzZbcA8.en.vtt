right off the canvas kind of changes
them<00:04:08.070> up<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:09.180> they<00:04:09.270> all<00:04:09.480> don't<00:04:09.660> start<00:04:10.080> where<00:04:10.650> we

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
them up so they all don't start where we

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.650 
them up so they all don't start where we

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
bit of white we can add tiny a little

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.400 
bit of white we can add tiny a little
bit<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.550> mist<00:04:26.880> down<00:04:27.510> here<00:04:27.750> at<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.930> bottom<00:04:28.320> of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
bit of mist down here at the bottom of

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.280 
bit of mist down here at the bottom of
the<00:04:28.470> waterfall<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:31.800> don't<00:04:31.980> need<00:04:32.130> too<00:04:32.430> much

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
the waterfall you don't need too much

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.830 
the waterfall you don't need too much
I'll<00:04:34.290> just<00:04:34.470> cap<00:04:34.770> in<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.010> little<00:04:35.730> bit<00:04:35.910> not<00:04:36.570> too

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
I'll just cap in a little bit not too

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.550 
I'll just cap in a little bit not too
bright<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:38.340> don't<00:04:38.550> mix<00:04:38.700> with<00:04:38.970> some<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.240> that

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
bright they don't mix with some of that

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.820 
bright they don't mix with some of that
green<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.920> blue<00:04:41.220> we<00:04:41.400> put<00:04:41.610> down<00:04:42.560> if<00:04:43.560> it'll

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
green and the blue we put down if it'll

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.590 
green and the blue we put down if it'll
help<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.310> from<00:04:44.520> being<00:04:45.470> too<00:04:46.470> white<00:04:47.600> otherwise

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
help it from being too white otherwise

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.620 
help it from being too white otherwise
it'd<00:04:48.810> be<00:04:48.900> way<00:04:49.410> too<00:04:49.470> bright<00:04:50.240> with<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.390> 2<00:04:51.600> inch

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
it'd be way too bright with the 2 inch

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.400 
it'd be way too bright with the 2 inch
brush<00:04:52.050> we<00:04:52.680> can<00:04:52.890> blend<00:04:53.310> this<00:04:53.940> out<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:55.050> tiny

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
brush we can blend this out the tiny

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.140 
brush we can blend this out the tiny
circles<00:04:56.750> don't<00:04:57.750> destroy<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.460> just<00:04:59.460> soften<00:05:00.000> it

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
circles don't destroy it just soften it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.100 
circles don't destroy it just soften it
a<00:05:00.180> little<00:05:00.410> so<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.470> picks<00:05:01.800> up<00:05:01.980> some<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.310> that

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
a little so it picks up some of that

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.730 
a little so it picks up some of that
blue<00:05:04.110> with<00:05:04.260> green<00:05:05.240> yeah<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:07.440> can<00:05:07.620> make

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
blue with green yeah you can make

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.960 
blue with green yeah you can make
another<00:05:08.100> layer<00:05:08.430> mist<00:05:09.530> just<00:05:10.530> like<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:11.010> see

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
another layer mist just like that see

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.860 
another layer mist just like that see
leave<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.510> little<00:05:12.780> bit<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:13.050> dark<00:05:13.320> showing<00:05:14.870> it'll
