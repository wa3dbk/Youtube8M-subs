00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.040
 who could believe we could 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.109
 to invent and produce in France 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.029
 a 4/4 fully electric utility 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.009
 with incredible performances for 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.969
 its size and for a price identical to 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.799
 its diesel equivalent 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.419
 yet this is what made this 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.160
 year the young society hch via de 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.720
 toll-town specialized in 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.310
 distribution of specific products 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.109
 for maintenance cleaning the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.609
 roads and green spaces for 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.029
 local authorities and businesses 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.029
 private 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.869
 the vehicle is an existing vehicle that 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.610
 is made in France and so we have 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.010
 developed a collaboration with this 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.860
 society by bringing in touches of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.570
 design and innovation touch that is 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.300
 I would say the leitmotif of society 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.410
 rhodia and the idea eventually with the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.240
 sales development 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.130
 it is to be able to gather ourselves 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.570
 the vehicles 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.980
 existing in two-wheel drive version 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.090
 without a license or four wheel drive 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.550
 with license b1 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.100
 the quad worm is a vehicle running at 45 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.280
 65 km hour following the model with a 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.360
 range of 55 to 100 km it benefits in 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.770
 option of two types of boxes 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.720
 allowing use in 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.610
 extreme conditions and leaflets and 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.750
 more than 2 tons in addition to these 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.670
 basic characteristics very 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.350
 interesting returns brings his 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.390
 expertise in proposing models 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.840
 even more functional adapted to its 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.840
 customer base 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.000
 the vehicle was originally equipped with the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.520
 manufacturer of a very small bucket and 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.900
 we sell in virtually all our 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.490
 Sales with veins of a doctor 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.660
 parma and ain that allow to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.770
 ask a palette for example to 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.509
 inside so that's the function 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.729
 utility 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.110
 we can modulate the vehicle with 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.450
 same as a larger wider 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.860
 it's easy benefits and that's what 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.110
 search to be able to fetch 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.869
 a clientele and provide solutions 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.520
 complete to other customers 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.530
 remarkable innovations are also 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.240
 included as the possibility of mounting 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.950
 all electrical equipment already 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.450
 provided by wishes via is also from 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.160
 propose different solutions of 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.600
 clever storage at the front of the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.580
 vehicle depending on the type 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.500
 of use down to what cities 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.509
 what if she had what with a 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.490
 top-case in the front remove your top 16 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.600
 and go to the office like that you go 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.729
 do your shopping etc 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.069
 and then for the weekend you can 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.690
 turn your vehicle into him 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.420
 more storage including one 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.880
 big chest or casal that is you can 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.830
 go to the fields with your vehicle or

 in the garden to maintain your 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.440
 green spaces and then go to the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.900
 dump so that's the idea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.150
 vehicle to what then is to have a 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.590
 versatile vehicle so both for 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.390

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.970
 and created by come back including his look 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.500
 very nice 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.300
 [Music] 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.070
 we have a small advantage is that we 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.070
 still arrive to offer a vehicle 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.780
 completely innovative and that brings 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.390
 additional solutions 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.390
 we really answer a request and we 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.240
 open completely I will go to our market 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.890
 but we also manage to touch a 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.690
 customers of individuals that we 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.140
 did not have before with too much products 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.910
 focus really the leitmotiv of returns 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.680
 it is to have flexibility and to be 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.680
 listen to it and tailor
