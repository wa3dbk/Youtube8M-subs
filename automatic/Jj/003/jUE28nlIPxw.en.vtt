00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
hardware of course if you said that you

want to install the drivers and it

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.850 
want to install the drivers and it
reinstalled<00:00:36.760> right<00:00:37.030> away<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.590> would<00:00:38.710> lead

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
reinstalled right away that would lead

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.450 
reinstalled right away that would lead
me<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.070> believe<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:39.850> probably<00:00:40.329> isn't

me to believe that it probably isn't

me to believe that it probably isn't
necessarily<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:43.289> hardware<00:00:44.289> problem<00:00:44.320> because

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
necessarily a hardware problem because

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.900 
necessarily a hardware problem because
it<00:00:44.829> was<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.980> hardware<00:00:45.280> problem<00:00:45.309> than<00:00:45.730> vista

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
it was a hardware problem than vista

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.639 
it was a hardware problem than vista
wooden<00:00:46.210> or<00:00:46.629> any<00:00:46.780> operating<00:00:47.170> system<00:00:47.260> wouldn't

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
wooden or any operating system wouldn't

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.110 
wooden or any operating system wouldn't
be<00:00:47.739> able<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.950> recognize<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.579> hardware<00:00:48.940> i

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
be able to recognize the hardware i

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.850 
be able to recognize the hardware i
guess<00:00:49.450> that's<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.719> next<00:00:50.350> troubleshooting

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
guess that's the next troubleshooting

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.250 
guess that's the next troubleshooting
step<00:00:51.010> i<00:00:51.129> i'd<00:00:51.309> ask<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:51.820> when<00:00:52.750> rebooting<00:00:53.079> your

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
step i i'd ask you when rebooting your

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.830 
step i i'd ask you when rebooting your
machine<00:00:53.620> if<00:00:54.219> you<00:00:54.460> can<00:00:54.610> see<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.879> diagnostic<00:00:55.719> of

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
machine if you can see a diagnostic of

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.380 
machine if you can see a diagnostic of
what<00:00:56.020> pops<00:00:56.410> up<00:00:56.559> on<00:00:56.649> your<00:00:56.710> screen<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.850> may<00:00:58.090> it'll

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
what pops up on your screen it may it'll

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.299 
what pops up on your screen it may it'll
tell<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.719> how<00:00:58.899> many<00:00:58.960> how<00:00:59.559> many<00:00:59.620> ports<00:01:00.100> are<00:01:00.219> how

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
tell you how many how many ports are how

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.540 
tell you how many how many ports are how
many<00:01:00.370> hubs<00:01:00.730> that<00:01:00.910> you<00:01:01.030> have<00:01:01.239> connected<00:01:02.170> by<00:01:02.320> USB

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
many hubs that you have connected by USB

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.969 
many hubs that you have connected by USB
is<00:01:03.550> one<00:01:03.879> way<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.059> detecting<00:01:04.740> you<00:01:05.740> know<00:01:05.830> whether

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
is one way of detecting you know whether

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.980 
is one way of detecting you know whether
or<00:01:06.039> not<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.850> hardware<00:01:07.300> is<00:01:07.390> actually<00:01:07.750> fried

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
or not the hardware is actually fried

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.699 
or not the hardware is actually fried
now<00:01:08.920> another<00:01:09.190> question<00:01:09.550> is<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:11.080> USB<00:01:11.470> port

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:11.709 
now another question is is the USB port

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:12.930 
now another question is is the USB port
you<00:01:11.740> said<00:01:11.979> you've<00:01:12.130> tried<00:01:12.369> uninstalling<00:01:12.610> the

you said you've tried uninstalling the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.400 
you said you've tried uninstalling the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
software it it only did have it

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.809

in order to run their kind of two

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.230 
in order to run their kind of two
different<00:01:24.250> things<00:01:24.490> but<00:01:24.670> you're<00:01:24.819> saying<00:01:24.970> since

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
different things but you're saying since

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.430 
different things but you're saying since
you're<00:01:25.330> saying<00:01:25.509> they<00:01:25.660> reinstall<00:01:26.110> themselves

you're saying they reinstall themselves

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.800 
you're saying they reinstall themselves
right<00:01:26.530> away<00:01:26.800> it's<00:01:27.789> kind<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.060> odd<00:01:28.209> so<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.509> sounds

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
right away it's kind of odd so it sounds

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.419 
right away it's kind of odd so it sounds
like<00:01:28.840> your<00:01:29.020> USB<00:01:29.410> ports<00:01:29.770> are<00:01:29.950> kind<00:01:30.399> of

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
like your USB ports are kind of

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.400 
like your USB ports are kind of
malfunctioning<00:01:31.240> here's<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.840> question<00:01:32.020> for<00:01:32.349> you
