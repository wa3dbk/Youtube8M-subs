00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
not like the new iOS 7 but anyway this

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.970 
not like the new iOS 7 but anyway this
is<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> very<00:00:20.699> easy<00:00:20.850> 7<00:00:21.630> step<00:00:21.930> guide<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
is a very easy 7 step guide to

is a very easy 7 step guide to
downgrading<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> iOS<00:00:24.630> 6<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:26.160> step<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
downgrading to iOS 6 so step one is to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.130 
downgrading to iOS 6 so step one is to
make<00:00:27.090> sure<00:00:27.119> you're<00:00:27.420> running<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> correct

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
make sure you're running the correct

make sure you're running the correct
version<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.590> itunes<00:00:29.029> anything<00:00:30.029> newer<00:00:30.810> than

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
version of itunes anything newer than

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
version of itunes anything newer than
eleven<00:00:31.800> point<00:00:32.040> zero<00:00:32.369> point<00:00:32.700> five<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.270> not

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
eleven point zero point five will not

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.690 
eleven point zero point five will not
work<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.140> need<00:00:34.410> eleven<00:00:34.920> point<00:00:35.160> zero<00:00:35.399> point

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
work so you need eleven point zero point

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.240 
work so you need eleven point zero point
five<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.120> earlier<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:37.020> anything<00:00:37.320> later<00:00:37.620> delete

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
five or earlier so anything later delete

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
five or earlier so anything later delete
it<00:00:38.460> delete<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:39.090> traces<00:00:39.440> including<00:00:40.440> things

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it delete all traces including things

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
it delete all traces including things
like<00:00:40.770> apple<00:00:41.190> mobile<00:00:41.340> device<00:00:41.820> apple<00:00:42.420> software

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
used old apps there are other programs

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.799 
used old apps there are other programs
which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> similar<00:00:53.850> their<00:00:54.239> link<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
which is similar their link is in the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.290 
which is similar their link is in the
description<00:00:54.899> below<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.920> install<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.180> if

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
description below so install that and if

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
description below so install that and if
you<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> error<00:00:58.140> iTunes<00:00:58.770> music
