00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
in this particular view I need to be

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.730 
in this particular view I need to be
outside<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.530> room<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:31.499> what<00:01:32.499> would<00:01:32.590> normally

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
outside the room so what would normally

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.440 
outside the room so what would normally
happen<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.490> just<00:01:33.670> see<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.030> back<00:01:34.179> of<00:01:34.390> the

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
wall now we've got the option of auto

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:46.920 
wall now we've got the option of auto
I'd<00:01:38.469> walls<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:40.060> we<00:01:40.209> click<00:01:40.390> on<00:01:40.539> that

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.560 

as<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.740> see<00:01:47.950> them<00:01:48.220> all<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.970> also<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
as you can see them all and also the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.920 
as you can see them all and also the
unit

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
unit

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.430 
unit
it's<00:01:50.050> automatically<00:01:50.650> hidden<00:01:52.260> we've<00:01:53.260> got

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
it's automatically hidden we've got

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's automatically hidden we've got
another<00:01:53.890> option<00:01:54.010> within<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:55.030> as<00:01:55.210> well<00:01:56.070> we

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
another option within that as well we

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.920 
another option within that as well we
could<00:01:57.250> have<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.460> unit's<00:01:57.930> semi-transparent

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
could have the unit's semi-transparent

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.850 
could have the unit's semi-transparent
so<00:01:59.320> we<00:01:59.440> can<00:01:59.590> still<00:01:59.860> see<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.160> units<00:02:00.660> only<00:02:01.860> sort

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
so we can still see the units only sort

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.550 
so we can still see the units only sort
of<00:02:02.920> highlighted<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.750> if<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.050> can<00:02:05.200> see<00:02:05.380> more

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
of highlighted but if you can see more

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.690 
of highlighted but if you can see more
that<00:02:05.680> well<00:02:05.860> but<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.040> can<00:02:06.190> see<00:02:06.370> this<00:02:06.490> or<00:02:06.640> a

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
