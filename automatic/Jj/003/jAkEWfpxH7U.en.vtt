and in the next few minutes we're going

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.170 
and in the next few minutes we're going
to<00:00:03.540> take<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.720> look<00:00:03.990> at<00:00:04.170> exporting<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.279> number<00:00:06.029> of

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
to take a look at exporting a number of

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.240 
to take a look at exporting a number of
files<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.960> different<00:00:07.440> file<00:00:07.620> format<00:00:08.069> in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
files to a different file format in

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.770 
files to a different file format in
lightroom<00:00:08.700> so<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.269> hand<00:00:09.540> them<00:00:09.630> off

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
lightroom so that you can hand them off

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.770 
lightroom so that you can hand them off
to<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.080> client<00:00:10.769> or<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> friend<00:00:11.450> so<00:00:12.450> let's

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
to a client or to a friend so let's

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.930 
to a client or to a friend so let's
select<00:00:12.990> these<00:00:13.320> three<00:00:13.679> images<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.519> library

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
select these three images in the library

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
select these three images in the library
module<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.780> course<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.139> could<00:00:16.350> select<00:00:16.529> 30

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
module and of course I could select 30

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.540 
module and of course I could select 30
images<00:00:17.250> or<00:00:17.699> 300<00:00:18.449> images<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.990> doesn't<00:00:19.260> matter

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
images or 300 images it doesn't matter

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.220 
images or 300 images it doesn't matter
usually<00:00:20.550> when<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:20.820> using<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.270> export<00:00:21.779> module

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
usually when I'm using the export module

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.349 
usually when I'm using the export module
it<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> large<00:00:23.609> volume<00:00:23.880> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it is because I have a large volume of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.029 
it is because I have a large volume of
images<00:00:24.779> if<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> wanted<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> work<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
images if I just wanted to work on a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.980 
images if I just wanted to work on a
single<00:00:26.400> image<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.420> wanted<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> work<00:00:27.810> with

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
single image and I wanted to work with

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.990 
single image and I wanted to work with
that<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.260> Photoshop<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:29.820> probably

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that in Photoshop then I would probably

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
that in Photoshop then I would probably
go<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> photo<00:00:30.750> menu<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.380> choose<00:00:31.679> edit<00:00:31.890> in

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
go to the photo menu and choose edit in

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.340 
go to the photo menu and choose edit in
and<00:00:32.669> edit<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.329> Photoshop<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.260> this

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and edit that in Photoshop but in this

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.930 
and edit that in Photoshop but in this
case<00:00:34.590> I'm<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> assume<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.760> am

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
case I'm going to assume that I am

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.280 
case I'm going to assume that I am
finished<00:00:36.480> working<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:36.899> these<00:00:37.020> files

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
finished working with these files

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.260 
finished working with these files
they're<00:00:37.590> ready<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.040> hand<00:00:38.250> off<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.790> client

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they're ready to hand off to the client

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
they're ready to hand off to the client

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740 
to use that well you might want to use
that<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.970> example<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that if for example you have a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.200 
that if for example you have a
collection<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.500> images<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.220> instead<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
collection of images and instead of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.910 
collection of images and instead of
collecting<00:01:09.720> those<00:01:09.840> images<00:01:10.260> into<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.470> folder

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
collecting those images into one folder

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
collecting those images into one folder
you<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.280> want<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> save<00:01:11.790> each<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you actually want to save each one of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.840 
you actually want to save each one of
these<00:01:12.720> files<00:01:12.990> back<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:14.010> original<00:01:14.159> folder

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
these files back to that original folder

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
these files back to that original folder
but<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.509> now<00:01:15.600> we'll<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.020> specific<00:01:16.320> folder

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
but for now we'll use a specific folder

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
but for now we'll use a specific folder
we<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:17.850> choose<00:01:18.180> where<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.659> folder<00:01:19.229> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
we will choose where that folder is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.020 
we will choose where that folder is
going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.770> by<00:01:20.009> clicking<00:01:20.400> choose<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
can select to put this into a subfolder

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.359 
can select to put this into a subfolder
and<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:29.189> will<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.490> called<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.200> Japan<00:01:31.369> for

whether<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.439> want<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> add<00:01:38.130> these

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610

this<00:01:42.090> case<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.420> probably<00:01:42.600> don't<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.409> I

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
this case I probably don't because I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.740 
this case I probably don't because I
have<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.979> original<00:01:44.070> RAW<00:01:44.610> files<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.299> they've

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have the original RAW files and they've

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.319 
have the original RAW files and they've
all<00:01:46.049> been<00:01:46.579> enhanced<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.700> Lightroom<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.270> I

all been enhanced in Lightroom all I

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.090 
all been enhanced in Lightroom all I
want<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.320> create<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> bunch<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> JPEGs

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
want to do is create a bunch of JPEGs

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.760 
want to do is create a bunch of JPEGs
hand<00:01:50.850> those<00:01:51.060> off<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> client<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.590> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
hand those off to the client and then I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 
hand those off to the client and then I
don't<00:01:53.040> need<00:01:53.430> those<00:01:53.759> JPEGs<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.540> ever<00:01:54.659> needed

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
don't need those JPEGs if I ever needed

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899 
don't need those JPEGs if I ever needed
a<00:01:55.259> copy<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.710> JPEGs<00:01:56.070> again<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.460> could<00:01:56.729> always

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
a copy of the JPEGs again I could always

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
a copy of the JPEGs again I could always
recreate<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.409> way<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> don't<00:01:58.710> have

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
recreate them and this way I don't have

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.910 
recreate them and this way I don't have
to<00:01:59.009> keep<00:01:59.130> track<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.700> multiple<00:02:00.270> files<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to keep track of multiple files so I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.850 
to keep track of multiple files so I
will<00:02:02.100> leave<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.520> off<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.990> there's<00:02:04.710> ever

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
will leave this off and if there's ever

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.160 
will leave this off and if there's ever
a<00:02:04.950> case<00:02:05.219> where<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.000> might<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.540> conflict

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
a case where you might have a conflict

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
a case where you might have a conflict
with<00:02:07.439> existing<00:02:07.979> files<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.209> choose<00:02:09.479> from

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
with existing files you can choose from

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
with existing files you can choose from
the<00:02:09.810> options<00:02:10.229> right<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:10.730> now<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.910> up<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the options right here now it's up to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.730 
the options right here now it's up to
you<00:02:12.330> whether<00:02:12.569> or<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.989> want<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you whether or not you want to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070 
you whether or not you want to
name<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.190> files<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.700> export<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.390> would<00:02:15.930> suggest

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
name the files on export I would suggest

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.230 
name the files on export I would suggest
that<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.680> do<00:02:16.980> rename<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> files<00:02:17.940> just

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
that if you do rename the files just

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.800 
that if you do rename the files just
rename<00:02:18.690> them<00:02:18.990> by<00:02:19.440> adding<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> little

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
rename them by adding like a little

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.120 
rename them by adding like a little
appendix<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> end<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.860> name

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
appendix to the end of the name

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.070 
appendix to the end of the name
otherwise<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.030> rename<00:02:24.510> all<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> files

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
otherwise if you rename all the files

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.210 
otherwise if you rename all the files
while<00:02:25.380> you're<00:02:25.500> handing<00:02:25.860> them<00:02:25.980> off<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
while you're handing them off to a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.270 
while you're handing them off to a
client<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:27.180> your<00:02:27.540> original<00:02:28.110> files<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.740> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
client then your original files and the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.070 
client then your original files and the
files<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.850> hand<00:02:30.090> off<00:02:30.270> might<00:02:30.840> be

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
files that you hand off might be

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.020 
files that you hand off might be
different<00:02:31.710> in<00:02:31.890> names<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.520> then<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:32.910> going

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
different in names and then it's going

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.540 
different in names and then it's going
to<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.180> very<00:02:33.360> confusing<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.680> if<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.070> wanted<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
to be very confusing so if I wanted to I

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.450 
to be very confusing so if I wanted to I
could<00:02:36.060> check<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.540> rename<00:02:37.050> I'd<00:02:37.350> come<00:02:37.890> down<00:02:37.920> here

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
could check to rename I'd come down here

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.610 
could check to rename I'd come down here
to<00:02:38.670> edit<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.270> create<00:02:39.570> my<00:02:39.690> own<00:02:39.930> file<00:02:40.350> naming

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
to edit to create my own file naming

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620 
to edit to create my own file naming
convention<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.460> I'd<00:02:41.850> probably<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.450> put

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
convention and I'd probably just put

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.580 
convention and I'd probably just put
like<00:02:42.690> an<00:02:42.840> underscore<00:02:43.850> lr4<00:02:44.850> low-res<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.530> I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
like an underscore lr4 low-res then if I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.290 
like an underscore lr4 low-res then if I
wanted<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> save<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.550> we<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.030> save<00:02:48.270> it

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
wanted to save that we can just save it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.940 
wanted to save that we can just save it
as<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.600> new<00:02:48.780> preset<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:50.280> would<00:02:50.490> be<00:02:50.640> my<00:02:50.820> J<00:02:51.270> cost

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
as a new preset this would be my J cost

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.310 
as a new preset this would be my J cost
file<00:02:52.950> naming<00:02:53.450> convention<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:55.050> would<00:02:55.200> just

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
file naming convention and I would just

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.370 
file naming convention and I would just
put<00:02:55.530> underscore<00:02:56.280> LR<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.420> let<00:02:57.810> me<00:02:57.930> know<00:02:57.960> what

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
put underscore LR to let me know what

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.940 
put underscore LR to let me know what
that<00:02:58.410> is

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that is

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.890 
that is
and<00:02:59.040> then<00:02:59.250> click<00:02:59.490> create<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.240> can<00:03:00.390> see<00:03:00.600> here

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
and then click create you can see here

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.050 
and then click create you can see here
we<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.170> an<00:03:01.260> example<00:03:01.560> I'll<00:03:01.950> click<00:03:02.520> done<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
we have an example I'll click done and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060 
we have an example I'll click done and
then<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> would<00:03:03.690> rename<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.890> course

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
then it would rename this and of course

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.650 
then it would rename this and of course
you<00:03:05.130> don't<00:03:05.160> have<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:06.030> uncheck<00:03:06.480> this

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
you don't have to I could uncheck this

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.090 
you don't have to I could uncheck this
if<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.900> don't<00:03:06.960> want<00:03:07.320> but<00:03:07.530> let's<00:03:07.680> go<00:03:07.800> ahead<00:03:07.890> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
if I don't want but let's go ahead and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.190 
if I don't want but let's go ahead and
rename<00:03:08.280> them<00:03:08.610> I'm<00:03:09.300> not<00:03:09.600> working<00:03:09.900> with<00:03:10.020> video

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
rename them I'm not working with video

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.530 
rename them I'm not working with video
so<00:03:10.560> we<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.800> skip<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.640> far<00:03:12.180> as<00:03:12.210> file

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
so we can skip that as far as file

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.680 
so we can skip that as far as file
settings<00:03:12.930> go<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:14.040> want<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.580> change<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.450> file

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
settings go I do want to change the file

increase the quality to a hundred

I<00:03:39.000> might<00:03:39.420> want<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.840> decrease<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.530> quality

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
I might want to decrease the quality

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.520 
I might want to decrease the quality
because<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.850> will<00:03:42.060> also<00:03:42.600> decrease<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.320> file

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
because that will also decrease the file

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.010 
because that will also decrease the file
size<00:03:43.830> if<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.640> decrease<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> quality<00:03:45.570> down<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
size if I decrease the quality down to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.020 
size if I decrease the quality down to
about<00:03:46.260> ninety<00:03:46.860> probably<00:03:47.640> going<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.850> trim

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
about ninety probably going to trim

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.990 
about ninety probably going to trim
about<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.360> third<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.950> file<00:03:50.160> size<00:03:50.460> off<00:03:50.730> of

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
about a third of the file size off of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.570 
about a third of the file size off of
each<00:03:51.210> image<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.380> bring<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:52.800> down<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.190> 80

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
each image if I bring this down to 80

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.670 
each image if I bring this down to 80
I'll<00:03:53.940> probably<00:03:54.240> knock<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.960> file<00:03:55.170> size<00:03:55.440> in

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
I'll probably knock the file size in

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.370 
I'll probably knock the file size in
half<00:03:56.430> but<00:03:56.820> of<00:03:57.030> course<00:03:57.480> as<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.930> lower<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
half but of course as I lower the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.710 
half but of course as I lower the
quality<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.250> lower<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.790> file<00:04:00.030> size<00:04:00.360> but<00:04:00.630> the

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
quality I lower the file size but the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.170 
quality I lower the file size but the
image<00:04:01.050> might<00:04:01.320> not<00:04:01.560> look<00:04:01.800> as<00:04:02.010> good<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.760> it's

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
image might not look as good so it's

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.880 
image might not look as good so it's
always<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> balancing<00:04:04.110> act<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.620> need<00:04:04.770> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
always a balancing act and you need to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.460 
always a balancing act and you need to
figure<00:04:05.010> out<00:04:05.160> where<00:04:05.880> exactly<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.690> fall<00:04:06.990> in<00:04:07.290> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
figure out where exactly you fall in the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.000 
figure out where exactly you fall in the
quality<00:04:07.980> versus<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.880> size<00:04:09.150> scale<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:10.110> can<00:04:10.740> also

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
quality versus the size scale I can also

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.770 
quality versus the size scale I can also
change<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.550> color<00:04:11.760> space<00:04:12.120> if<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.450> think<00:04:12.690> that

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
change the color space if I think that

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.940 
change the color space if I think that
I'm<00:04:12.870> handing<00:04:13.230> them<00:04:13.350> off<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.620> someone<00:04:13.860> who's

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
I'm handing them off to someone who's

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.560 
I'm handing them off to someone who's
going<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.130> be<00:04:14.250> viewing<00:04:14.520> them<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.910> screen<00:04:15.240> and

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
going to be viewing them on a screen and

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.449 
going to be viewing them on a screen and
maybe<00:04:15.750> their<00:04:15.930> screen<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.500> not<00:04:16.680> color<00:04:16.980> managed

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
maybe their screen is not color managed

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.699 
maybe their screen is not color managed
and<00:04:17.730> if<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.299> really<00:04:18.600> needed<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.080> limit<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.560> file

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
and if I really needed to limit the file

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.229 
and if I really needed to limit the file
size<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.100> could<00:04:20.160> actually<00:04:20.370> check<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:21.000> option

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
size I could actually check this option

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.510 
size I could actually check this option
on<00:04:21.600> an<00:04:21.810> enter<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.500> file<00:04:22.680> size<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.190> need

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
on an enter in the file size that I need

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.840 
on an enter in the file size that I need
now<00:04:24.510> I'm<00:04:25.169> also<00:04:25.620> going<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.010> decrease<00:04:26.220> my<00:04:26.460> file

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
now I'm also going to decrease my file

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.590 
now I'm also going to decrease my file
size<00:04:27.150> by

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
size by

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.350 
size by
resizing<00:04:28.500> my<00:04:28.650> image<00:04:29.070> if<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.820> have<00:04:30.090> some

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
resizing my image if you have some

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.000 
resizing my image if you have some
vertical<00:04:30.810> images<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.470> some<00:04:31.650> horizontal

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
images what you might want to do is just

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.880 
images what you might want to do is just
put<00:04:35.370> in<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.970> dimension<00:04:36.720> for<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.140> long<00:04:37.470> edge

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
put in the dimension for the long edge

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.100 
put in the dimension for the long edge
or<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.520> short<00:04:38.880> edge<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.510> way<00:04:39.720> if<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:39.990> have

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
or the short edge that way if you have

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.900 
or the short edge that way if you have
some<00:04:40.290> horizontal<00:04:40.560> images<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.310> some<00:04:41.430> vertical

some horizontal images and some vertical

images if the horizontal is the long
edge<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:45.210> might<00:04:45.450> be<00:04:45.660> like<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.230> 800<00:04:46.710> pixels

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
edge that might be like the 800 pixels

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.950 
edge that might be like the 800 pixels
that<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.340> define<00:04:47.670> whereas<00:04:48.510> if<00:04:48.750> it's<00:04:48.900> a

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
that you define whereas if it's a

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.260 
that you define whereas if it's a
vertical<00:04:49.440> image<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:50.190> vertical<00:04:50.850> side<00:04:51.030> would

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
vertical image the vertical side would

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.270 
vertical image the vertical side would
be<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.390> 800<00:04:51.930> pixels<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:52.680> let's<00:04:52.860> go<00:04:53.010> ahead<00:04:53.070> and

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
be the 800 pixels so let's go ahead and

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.580 
be the 800 pixels so let's go ahead and
do<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.610> we'll<00:04:54.060> just<00:04:54.240> type<00:04:54.450> in<00:04:54.630> 800<00:04:54.900> pixels

of what the device is that they're going
to<00:05:15.270> sharpen<00:05:15.780> for<00:05:16.230> you<00:05:16.620> then<00:05:16.800> want<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.190> dial<00:05:17.520> in

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
to sharpen for you then want to dial in

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.450 
to sharpen for you then want to dial in
the<00:05:18.000> amount<00:05:18.360> solo<00:05:18.930> standard<00:05:19.560> or<00:05:19.710> high<00:05:19.890> and<00:05:20.220> of

the amount solo standard or high and of

the amount solo standard or high and of
course<00:05:20.640> this<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:20.910> more<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.270> an<00:05:21.360> aesthetic

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
course this is more of an aesthetic

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.160 
course this is more of an aesthetic
choice<00:05:21.960> if<00:05:22.530> I<00:05:23.040> was<00:05:23.630> handing<00:05:24.630> off<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.780> bunch<00:05:25.080> of

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
choice if I was handing off a bunch of

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.870 
choice if I was handing off a bunch of
images<00:05:25.380> that<00:05:25.560> had<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.830> bunch<00:05:26.040> of<00:05:26.130> clouds<00:05:26.550> in

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
images that had a bunch of clouds in

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.060 
images that had a bunch of clouds in
them<00:05:27.060> then<00:05:27.480> maybe<00:05:27.690> I<00:05:27.810> might<00:05:28.200> just<00:05:28.410> add<00:05:28.530> a<00:05:28.590> low

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
them then maybe I might just add a low

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.980 
them then maybe I might just add a low
amount<00:05:29.310> of<00:05:29.490> sharpening<00:05:29.850> if<00:05:30.090> I'm<00:05:30.540> handing<00:05:30.900> off

something that has high frequency and a
lot<00:05:32.880> of<00:05:32.910> detail<00:05:33.420> like<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.750> landscape<00:05:34.260> with<00:05:34.530> a

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590

lot of detail like a landscape with a
lot<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.740> trees<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.280> might<00:05:35.640> want<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.910> boost<00:05:36.090> the

lot of trees I might want to boost the
sharpening<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.900> little<00:05:37.080> bit<00:05:37.200> more<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.620> add<00:05:37.830> a

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
sharpening a little bit more and add a

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.740 
sharpening a little bit more and add a
high<00:05:38.190> amount<00:05:38.490> for<00:05:39.180> now<00:05:39.300> we'll<00:05:39.450> just<00:05:39.480> leave<00:05:39.690> it

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
high amount for now we'll just leave it

high amount for now we'll just leave it
to<00:05:39.930> standard<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:41.220> can<00:05:41.370> also<00:05:41.580> determine<00:05:41.820> what

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
to standard you can also determine what

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.300 
to standard you can also determine what
metadata<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.320> want<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.680> travel<00:05:43.920> with<00:05:44.190> the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
data on your images because maybe you've

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.340 
data on your images because maybe you've
captured<00:05:56.520> them<00:05:56.850> with<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.210> camera<00:05:57.780> phone<00:05:57.810> you

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
captured them with a camera phone you

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.900 
captured them with a camera phone you
might<00:05:58.500> want<00:05:58.710> to<00:05:58.770> be<00:05:58.920> a<00:05:58.950> little<00:05:59.190> careful<00:05:59.460> here

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
might want to be a little careful here

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.820 
might want to be a little careful here
if<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.150> don't<00:06:00.330> want<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.690> send<00:06:00.930> that<00:06:00.990> GPS<00:06:01.560> data

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
if you don't want to send that GPS data

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.980 
if you don't want to send that GPS data
with<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:02.310> file<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.760> just<00:06:02.820> switch<00:06:03.480> this<00:06:03.720> to

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
you can also leave it to the other

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.050 
you can also leave it to the other
options<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.560> then<00:06:10.950> check<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.610> remove<00:06:11.910> the

location information but I think it's

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.260 
location information but I think it's
easier<00:06:14.070> just<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.340> do<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.640> copyright<00:06:15.120> and

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639
