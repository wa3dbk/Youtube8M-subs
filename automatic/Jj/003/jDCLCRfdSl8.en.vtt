all the way through but I end up doing

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.600 
all the way through but I end up doing
it<00:00:24.899> wrong<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.439> because<00:00:25.710> you're<00:00:26.250> supposed<00:00:26.520> to

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
it wrong here because you're supposed to

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.060 
it wrong here because you're supposed to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
go to the right side of the corner and I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.400 
go to the right side of the corner and I
ended<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.399> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.700> the<00:00:29.849> left<00:00:30.029> which<00:00:30.329> I<00:00:30.630> don't

just plan your attack there on this
barrier<00:01:02.159> under<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.640> map<00:01:02.819> and<00:01:03.120> make<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.050> way

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
barrier under the map and make your way

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.150 
barrier under the map and make your way
around<00:01:04.680> these<00:01:05.190> barriers<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.920> pass<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
around these barriers and pass this

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.100 
around these barriers and pass this
mountain<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.700> until<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.750> until

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
mountain here until all the way until

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.730 
mountain here until all the way until
you<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:11.270> here<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.480> by<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.590> you're

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you get here and by here you're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.860 
you get here and by here you're
basically<00:01:14.250> outside<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.820> map<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.660> just

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
basically outside of the map you just

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.170 
basically outside of the map you just
need<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.230> on<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.710> real<00:01:17.520> land<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
need to get on some real land that you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.360 
need to get on some real land that you
can<00:01:18.330> walk<00:01:18.480> around<00:01:18.800> so<00:01:19.800> make<00:01:20.010> your<00:01:20.160> way<00:01:20.250> around

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
can walk around so make your way around

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.900 
can walk around so make your way around
all<00:01:20.700> these<00:01:20.850> buildings<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:22.250> run<00:01:23.250> towards<00:01:23.670> that

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
all these buildings and run towards that

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.300 
all these buildings and run towards that
building<00:01:24.510> with<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.660> satellite<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.710> top<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
building with a satellite on top and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
building with a satellite on top and
you'll<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.730> airplane<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.570> some<00:01:27.780> real

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you'll see out airplane and some real

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.130 
you'll see out airplane and some real
ground<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:29.070> top<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.820> you're<00:01:30.420> outside<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
ground just top up and you're outside of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.550 
ground just top up and you're outside of
the<00:01:31.200> map<00:01:31.320> good<00:01:31.590> job<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:33.320> there's<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.410> lot<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the map good job and there's a lot of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.820 
the map good job and there's a lot of
real<00:01:34.800> ground<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:36.560> there's<00:01:37.560> some

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
real ground out here there's some

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.670 
real ground out here there's some
airplanes<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.580> they're<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.090> real<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.680> from

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
airplanes but they're not real and from

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
airplanes but they're not real and from
out<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.250> could<00:01:41.400> probably<00:01:41.640> kill<00:01:42.030> some

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
out here you could probably kill some

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
out here you could probably kill some
people<00:01:42.360> inside<00:01:42.780> map<00:01:43.080> again<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.740> that's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
people inside map again that's that's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
people inside map again that's that's
cheating<00:01:44.550> we<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:44.970> cheaters<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.570> just

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
cheating we don't like cheaters we just

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.110 
cheating we don't like cheaters we just
like<00:01:45.960> glitching<00:01:46.550> offline<00:01:47.550> where<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> can't

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
like glitching offline where we can't

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.070 
like glitching offline where we can't
hurt<00:01:48.360> anyone<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:50.510> again<00:01:51.510> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
hurt anyone and again you can see you

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.330 
hurt anyone and again you can see you
can<00:01:52.110> shoot<00:01:52.440> through<00:01:52.620> that<00:01:52.830> window<00:01:52.980> where<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
can shoot through that window where the

here you can see the map over there I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.320 
here you can see the map over there I
sped<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.680> bit<00:02:28.710> though<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.640> little

you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.070> just<00:03:56.220> walk<00:03:56.730> along<00:03:56.880> these<00:03:57.180> barriers

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
you can just walk along these barriers

the building bears about the same height
give<00:04:05.250> or<00:04:05.400> take<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.850> couple<00:04:05.940> buildings<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.959> are

give or take a couple buildings that are
I'm<00:04:07.950> not<00:04:08.220> sure<00:04:08.400> how<00:04:08.610> much<00:04:08.820> higher<00:04:09.090> because<00:04:09.120> we

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I'm not sure how much higher because we

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.690 
I'm not sure how much higher because we
can<00:04:09.690> get<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:09.989> top<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.380> them<00:04:10.500> guessing<00:04:10.980> not<00:04:11.519> that

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
can get on top of them guessing not that

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.090 
can get on top of them guessing not that
much<00:04:11.850> higher<00:04:12.090> anyways<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.019> can<00:04:13.470> run<00:04:14.070> along

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
much higher anyways you can run along

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.970 
much higher anyways you can run along
this<00:04:14.459> wall<00:04:15.060> here<00:04:15.300> but<00:04:15.690> but<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.380> didn't<00:04:16.680> realize

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
this wall here but but I didn't realize

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.220 
this wall here but but I didn't realize
when<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.340> was<00:04:17.430> doing<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.690> left<00:04:18.989> me

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
when I was doing this is to the left me

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.229 
when I was doing this is to the left me
where<00:04:19.380> all<00:04:19.500> those<00:04:19.650> trees<00:04:19.980> are<00:04:20.040> this<00:04:21.000> is

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
where all those trees are this is

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.450 
where all those trees are this is
actually<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.900> big<00:04:22.380> solid<00:04:22.830> barrier<00:04:23.070> and

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
actually just a big solid barrier and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.409 
actually just a big solid barrier and
you<00:04:23.490> don't<00:04:24.150> need<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:25.860> run<00:04:26.100> rate<00:04:26.880> with<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.240> wall

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
you don't need to run rate with the wall

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.330 
you don't need to run rate with the wall
you<00:04:27.570> can<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:27.900> run<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:28.410> huge

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
you can just run on this huge

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.610 
you can just run on this huge
barrier<00:04:29.639> if<00:04:29.699> you<00:04:29.820> want<00:04:30.060> or<00:04:30.300> like<00:04:30.330> oh<00:04:30.720> look<00:04:31.260> whoo

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
barrier if you want or like oh look whoo

derp all right the next one here you

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.060 
derp all right the next one here you
want<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.630> just<00:04:43.080> put<00:04:43.290> down<00:04:43.470> your<00:04:43.590> attacker<00:04:43.800> and

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
want to just put down your attacker and

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.430 
want to just put down your attacker and
pass<00:04:44.250> those<00:04:44.490> two<00:04:44.729> trees<00:04:45.060> there<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.510> all<00:04:46.410> the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
pass those two trees there and all the

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.129 
pass those two trees there and all the
way<00:04:46.800> over<00:04:47.070> here<00:04:47.449> right<00:04:48.449> before<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:48.900> little

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
way over here right before that little

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.830 
way over here right before that little
incline<00:04:49.560> in<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.830> mountain<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.360> you<00:04:51.360> just<00:04:51.600> do

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
incline in the mountain and you just do

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.129 
incline in the mountain and you just do
a<00:04:51.889> nice<00:04:52.889> straight<00:04:53.250> off<00:04:53.669> that<00:04:53.940> land<00:04:54.840> on<00:04:54.990> this

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
a nice straight off that land on this

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.969 
a nice straight off that land on this
building<00:04:55.530> barrier<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:57.350> I'll<00:04:58.350> tell<00:04:58.590> my<00:04:58.740> friend

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
building barrier and I'll tell my friend

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.219 
building barrier and I'll tell my friend
to<00:04:59.010> jump<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.550> but<00:04:59.880> he<00:05:00.000> insisted<00:05:00.510> i<00:05:01.020> went

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
to jump to that but he insisted i went

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.909 
to jump to that but he insisted i went
first<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:02.270> decided<00:05:03.270> hey<00:05:03.570> why<00:05:03.600> not<00:05:03.960> but

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
first so I I decided hey why not but

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.800 
first so I I decided hey why not but
before<00:05:05.100> you<00:05:05.310> go<00:05:05.610> I've<00:05:05.850> recommend<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.450> do<00:05:06.630> this

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
before you go I've recommend you do this

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.930 
before you go I've recommend you do this
you<00:05:07.080> prone<00:05:07.410> move<00:05:07.800> sideways<00:05:08.070> just<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.639> you<00:05:08.700> know

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
you prone move sideways just so you know

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.240 
you prone move sideways just so you know
or<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.150> end<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.479> barriers<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.229> then<00:05:10.950> just

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
or the end of the barriers and then just

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.700 
or the end of the barriers and then just
do<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.430> nice<00:05:11.700> strength<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.330> you<00:05:13.080> can<00:05:13.320> land<00:05:13.530> on

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
do a nice strength and you can land on

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.580 
do a nice strength and you can land on
top<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.100> this<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:15.120> building<00:05:15.780> or<00:05:15.990> whatever

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
top of this this building or whatever

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.790 
top of this this building or whatever
the<00:05:16.800> thing<00:05:16.830> is<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:18.050> there's<00:05:19.050> actually<00:05:19.200> I

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
the thing is and there's actually I

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.560 
the thing is and there's actually I
believe<00:05:21.080> 55<00:05:22.080> forces<00:05:22.650> building<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.419> all<00:05:24.419> of

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
believe 55 forces building and all of

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.890 
believe 55 forces building and all of
them<00:05:24.750> are<00:05:24.840> basically<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.650> same<00:05:26.010> as<00:05:26.900> down

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
them are basically the same as down

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.629 
them are basically the same as down
there<00:05:28.169> which<00:05:28.800> I'll<00:05:28.949> show<00:05:29.070> in<00:05:29.190> a<00:05:29.250> second

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
there which I'll show in a second

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.950 
there which I'll show in a second
they're<00:05:29.729> all<00:05:29.850> the<00:05:29.970> same<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:30.510> then<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:30.750> can<00:05:30.930> go

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
they're all the same and then you can go

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.690 
they're all the same and then you can go
all<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.229> way<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.620> bottom<00:05:32.930> and<00:05:34.639> here<00:05:35.639> i

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
all the way to the bottom and here i

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.390 
all the way to the bottom and here i
feel<00:05:36.240> feel<00:05:36.750> that<00:05:36.930> jump<00:05:37.169> that's<00:05:37.380> fine<00:05:37.680> but<00:05:38.250> yeah

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
feel feel that jump that's fine but yeah

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.830 
feel feel that jump that's fine but yeah
here's<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.600> I've<00:05:40.410> got<00:05:40.620> stuck<00:05:40.830> but<00:05:41.280> here's<00:05:41.520> the

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
here's the I've got stuck but here's the

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.620 
here's the I've got stuck but here's the
different<00:05:42.840> floors<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:43.470> and<00:05:44.210> all<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.330> rest<00:05:45.479> of

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
different floors I and all the rest of

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:52.370 
different floors I and all the rest of
them<00:05:45.690> are<00:05:45.990> like<00:05:46.289> that<00:05:50.599> anyways<00:05:51.599> if<00:05:51.840> you<00:05:52.020> want

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.959 
and
do<00:06:42.779> a<00:06:42.809> nice<00:06:43.139> nice<00:06:43.769> long<00:06:44.009> straight<00:06:44.429> over<00:06:44.819> to

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:48.589 
do a nice nice long straight over to
this<00:06:45.199> tower<00:06:46.199> here<00:06:46.649> all<00:06:47.580> this<00:06:47.939> is<00:06:47.999> basically

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
this tower here all this is basically

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.049 
this tower here all this is basically
buried<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.229> same<00:06:49.439> height<00:06:49.649> and<00:06:50.249> this<00:06:50.879> is

buried the same height and this is

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.939 
buried the same height and this is
probably<00:06:51.599> the<00:06:51.749> last<00:06:51.989> barrier<00:06:52.499> that<00:06:52.679> we<00:06:52.799> could

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
probably the last barrier that we could

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.519 
probably the last barrier that we could
find<00:06:53.249> in<00:06:53.489> the<00:06:54.389> time<00:06:54.629> that<00:06:54.659> we<00:06:54.929> spent<00:06:55.229> on<00:06:55.379> this

find in the time that we spent on this

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.129 
find in the time that we spent on this
map<00:06:55.769> and<00:06:56.009> I<00:06:56.969> ended<00:06:57.299> up<00:06:57.419> trying<00:06:57.599> to<00:06:57.719> strafe<00:06:57.929> this
