to<00:00:07.319> divide<00:00:07.919> perennials<00:00:08.760> now<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.330> understand

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
to divide perennials now I understand

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.780 
to divide perennials now I understand
it's<00:00:10.200> kind<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.530> scary<00:00:10.889> thing<00:00:11.190> cutting<00:00:11.639> up

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it's kind of a scary thing cutting up

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.629 
it's kind of a scary thing cutting up
your<00:00:11.820> plans<00:00:12.269> but<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.110> really<00:00:13.410> helps<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.160> lot<00:00:14.190> of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
your plans but it really helps a lot of

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.000 
your plans but it really helps a lot of
plants<00:00:15.089> thrive<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.049> bloom<00:00:16.289> better<00:00:16.590> when<00:00:16.890> you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
plants thrive and bloom better when you

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.920 
plants thrive and bloom better when you
divide<00:00:17.430> them<00:00:17.670> every<00:00:17.940> three<00:00:18.150> or<00:00:18.240> four<00:00:18.390> years

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
divide them every three or four years

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.960 
divide them every three or four years
now<00:00:19.170> perennials<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.160> plants<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.550> come<00:00:20.820> back

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
now perennials are plants that come back

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.370 
now perennials are plants that come back
year<00:00:21.029> after<00:00:21.270> year

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
year after year

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.130 
year after year
a<00:00:22.410> ground<00:00:23.130> cover<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.880> isn't<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> juga<00:00:24.750> it

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
a ground cover like this isn't a juga it

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.560 
a ground cover like this isn't a juga it
doesn't<00:00:25.590> need<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.859> divided<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.330> kind

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
doesn't need to be divided it just kind

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
doesn't need to be divided it just kind
of<00:00:27.630> takes<00:00:27.930> over<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.380> then<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.560> rip<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> out

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
of takes over and then you rip it out

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.580 
of takes over and then you rip it out
when<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.369> gets<00:00:29.460> too<00:00:29.730> dense<00:00:30.050> or<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> place<00:00:31.410> we

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
when it gets too dense or a place we

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.930 
when it gets too dense or a place we
don't<00:00:31.619> want<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.279> don't<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> grow

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
don't want it you don't want it to grow

Primrose and the primroses Plus this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.490 
Primrose and the primroses Plus this
hosta<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.789> heuchera<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
hosta and this heuchera are all going to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
hosta and this heuchera are all going to
do<00:00:46.649> better<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.160> divide<00:00:47.460> them<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.180> here's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
do better if we divide them so here's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.459 
do better if we divide them so here's
the<00:00:48.539> secret<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.140> use<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.190> root<00:00:50.640> pruning<00:00:51.239> saw<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the secret I use a root pruning saw to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.010 
the secret I use a root pruning saw to
actually<00:00:52.860> saw<00:00:53.160> hunks<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> plant<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
actually saw hunks of the plant now you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
actually saw hunks of the plant now you
can<00:00:55.260> also<00:00:55.469> use<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> trowel<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.820> sharp<00:00:57.120> or

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can also use a trowel if it's sharp or

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
can also use a trowel if it's sharp or
this<00:00:57.750> trial<00:00:58.109> has<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.620> ridges<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.160> side

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this trial has little ridges on the side

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.330 
this trial has little ridges on the side
so<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.210> helps<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.260> usually<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
so that helps as well and usually you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.799 
so that helps as well and usually you
wait<00:01:02.550> till<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> plants<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.510> finishing

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
wait till the plants are just finishing

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.490 
wait till the plants are just finishing
their<00:01:04.260> bloom<00:01:04.680> cycle<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
their bloom cycle or you can do it in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.280 
their bloom cycle or you can do it in
the<00:01:07.680> fall<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.520> before<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.390> dormant<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the fall right before they go dormant so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
the fall right before they go dormant so
you<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> search<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.180> kind

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you just kind of search in here and kind

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530 
you just kind of search in here and kind
of<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:14.070> move<00:01:14.280> around<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.240> there's<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
of see you move around that there's a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.530 
of see you move around that there's a
space<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:16.380> there's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.759> separate<00:01:17.759> plant<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
space where there's a separate plant and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.530 
space where there's a separate plant and
simply<00:01:18.930> saw<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.540> cutting

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
simply saw the it's kind of like cutting

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.240 
simply saw the it's kind of like cutting
through<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> umbilical<00:01:22.320> cord<00:01:22.350> separating<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
through the umbilical cord separating a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.520 
through the umbilical cord separating a
little<00:01:23.280> baby<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.820> its<00:01:23.939> momma<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.960> now

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
little bit of that ground cover ajuga on

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.460 
little bit of that ground cover ajuga on
there<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.939> tears<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.450> very<00:01:30.780> easily<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.259> can

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
there that tears up very easily I can

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.920 
there that tears up very easily I can
add<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.829> someplace<00:01:32.130> else<00:01:32.750> through<00:01:33.750> some

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
add that someplace else through some

I'm just going to put this right next
door<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:43.040> instead<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> using<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.880> liquid

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
door here instead of using like a liquid

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
door here instead of using like a liquid
plant<00:01:45.689> food<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.740> ahead<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:46.950> use<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> slowly
