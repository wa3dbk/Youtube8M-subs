00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.020 
to assemble of course and hopefully if
we<00:02:27.530> have<00:02:27.769> time<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.130> will<00:02:28.160> post<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.640> assembly

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
we have time we will post the assembly

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.120 
we have time we will post the assembly
