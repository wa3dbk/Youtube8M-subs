00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.259
 underground channel of giga I am 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.820
 me on the first official event 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.620
 here in berlin we are here on one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 kartbahn some of the colleague 's go 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.099
 but now we are working too 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 it will be why we are 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.119
 here because way resp 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.980
 summer has a new device that is 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.180
 holly and i have my hand here 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.850
 and let's take a look 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.019
 together at one or the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 It's a bit difficult there 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.529
 the brand was now a little bit about 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 called and actually wanted to be with 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.740
 the horn with the new products in 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.260
 Germany actually only under 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.120
 that name is synonymous often run 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.160
 for devices which is a very good price 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 offer a performance ratio that is too 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 In this device we will not come otherwise 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.460
 maybe a little bit too close 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.829
 the outer sex was five inches tall 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.800
 ips display with a resolution of 1280 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 x 720 pixels 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 the front is a camera with 2 megapixels 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 in the back of an 8 megapixel camera 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.329
 a Korean manufacturer who does not 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.940
 wanted to be called or should one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.000
 beautiful glossy surface the very 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 nice the finger room sees if 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.090
 you like the market is always such a 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.820
 so blossey is natural 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.650
 a little bit of luxury but it does 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.000
 a few disadvantages namely just said 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.590
 smear spots a 1.3 ghz quad-core 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.130
 Processor is in here from mediatek 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 also built very interesting yes 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.689
 if you like the thing you can do that too 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.860
 So if you have it for now 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.060
 not such an extra lax as that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.150
 from other phone knows that means me 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 has to cheat a bit is a 2000 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.009
 milliampere battery installed and like here 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.450
 also directly and correctly sees a dual 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.780
 sim hello to leave a dual stack 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 So here are two sim cards as well 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.979
 then another slot for one 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.320
 SD card micro SD card are installed 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.640
 already 16 gb internal memory can 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.860
 but also be extended 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.259
 Anna has software here as well 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.179
 again put on the motion july the 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.220
 here is the version 2.3 meanwhile 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.880
 there is already a little more version 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.149
 namely the version 3 here but 2.3 in 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.039
 use is normal for people 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.390
 android say rheins android or 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.410
 also the other 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.420
 user interface of others 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.819
 make something unusual maybe 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.310
 because it reminds you more of the construction 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.959
 ios devices there is no app 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.549
 Drawer in here that means all apps 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.069
 which one has installed which can be 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.480
 open directly from left to right if 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.670
 it bothers you but it can be easy 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.640
 install a whimsy and then that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.560
 old feeling with about experience at first yes 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.390
 already mentioned that dollar resp 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.220
 he was always for a very good price 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.000
 performance ratio is that too 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.930
 here the case 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.459
 the device should cost 139 euros 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.260
 but you have to say that 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.120
 Anna walks away a bit 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.220
 this time it will be an action 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.859
 Only give fans and interested in the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.230
 facebook page of this device licon and 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.730
 can be interested in it all 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.410
 non-binding and all the more so 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.840
 make the further the price should fall 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.510
 how much exactly is not clear so how 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.519
 cheap the device in the end then will be 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.480
 a lot of people would like that now 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.100
 not yet mentioned there are certainly 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.540
 a lower limit to otherwise it will on 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.450
 any case will not be even if five 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.130
 Millions of people think that's great, but yes 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.079
 is definitely my brand new and 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.530
 interesting concept a device too 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.730
 to bring more favorable conditions 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.170
 We'll look at the device but again 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.000
 know more detailed then with us 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.170
 because at first impression one can 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.609
 Do not say so much 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.769
 hand is just a cheap 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.200
 entry-level device pretty interesting 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.489
 Price probably for some what that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.530
 thing else on box has 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.359
 we look at it out a review on up 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.359
 Goodbye to me money card
