don't<00:00:33.030> fold<00:00:33.239> along<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.780> thick<00:00:34.020> line<00:00:34.290> but

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
don't fold along this thick line but

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.560 
don't fold along this thick line but
turn<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> paper<00:00:35.309> over<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
turn the paper over and we're going to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.790 
turn the paper over and we're going to
fold<00:00:36.750> along<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.170> thin<00:00:37.469> line<00:00:39.170> be<00:00:40.170> careful<00:00:40.620> to

fingernails<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> firm

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.940 

then<00:00:49.920> unfold<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> paper<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.590> make<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> next

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
then unfold the paper and make the next

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:02.120 
then unfold the paper and make the next
crease<00:00:56.630> keep<00:00:57.630> working<00:00:58.020> away<00:00:58.110> along<00:01:00.260> then<00:01:01.260> when

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
crease keep working away along then when

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.310 
crease keep working away along then when
you're<00:01:02.280> about<00:01:02.460> halfway<00:01:02.790> along<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.870> easier

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
you're about halfway along it's easier

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.880 
you're about halfway along it's easier
if<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.620> turn<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> paper<00:01:05.250> round<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:07.500> start

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
if you turn the paper round and start

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:25.359 
if you turn the paper round and start
again<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.370> beginning

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.639 

now<00:01:25.939> turn<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.329> paper<00:01:26.509> over<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.320> we're<00:01:27.469> going

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
now turn the paper over and we're going

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.490 
now turn the paper over and we're going
to<00:01:27.679> fold<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.009> diagonal<00:01:28.460> creases<00:01:29.259> fold<00:01:30.259> along

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500

fold<00:01:34.340> along<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.819> creased<00:01:35.060> line<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.770> make

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
fold along the creased line and make

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.649 
fold along the creased line and make
sure<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.219> crease<00:01:37.429> doesn't<00:01:37.819> extend<00:01:38.240> into

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
sure that the crease doesn't extend into

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.139 
sure that the crease doesn't extend into
the<00:01:38.899> white<00:01:39.079> border<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.219> then<00:01:40.429> unfold<00:01:40.819> and

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
the white border and then unfold and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.810 
the white border and then unfold and
then<00:01:41.929> move<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.319> to<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.530> second<00:01:42.920> crease

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.570 

and<00:01:47.270> continue<00:01:47.780> until<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:49.040> get<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.370> about

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
and continue until you get to about

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.750 
and continue until you get to about
halfway<00:01:49.909> along<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.979> then<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:52.159> can<00:01:52.430> turn<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
halfway along and then you can turn the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.820 
halfway along and then you can turn the
paper<00:01:52.940> round<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:53.960> start<00:01:54.260> at<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.500> beginning

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
paper round and start at the beginning

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:07.010 
paper round and start at the beginning
again

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.109 

now<00:02:07.649> we're<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> fold<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> white<00:02:08.879> edge

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
now we're going to fold the white edge

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.390 
now we're going to fold the white edge
down<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:12.569> reveals<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.230> letters<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.040> DNA

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
down this reveals the letters of the DNA

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.520 
down this reveals the letters of the DNA
code

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.100 

this<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> long<00:02:18.520> crease<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.510> take<00:02:19.720> your<00:02:19.900> time

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
this is a long crease so take your time

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.130 
this is a long crease so take your time
to<00:02:20.260> make<00:02:20.290> sure<00:02:20.440> it's<00:02:20.740> accurate<00:02:22.020> turn<00:02:23.020> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
to make sure it's accurate turn the

to make sure it's accurate turn the
paper<00:02:23.319> over<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.370> we're<00:02:24.610> going<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.819> fold<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
paper over and we're going to fold the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:40.620 
paper over and we're going to fold the
white<00:02:25.300> edge<00:02:25.540> down<00:02:25.780> again

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630

to<00:02:57.739> twist<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.280> model<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.850> push<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.780> two<00:02:59.959> ends

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
to twist the model and push the two ends

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.470 
to twist the model and push the two ends
together<00:03:00.880> be<00:03:01.880> brave<00:03:02.150> now<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:08.030> have<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.360> do

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
together be brave now we just have to do

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.240 
together be brave now we just have to do
a<00:03:08.510> little<00:03:08.690> bit<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:08.959> tidying<00:03:09.530> up<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.950> some<00:03:10.130> of

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
a little bit of tidying up of some of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.400 
a little bit of tidying up of some of
the<00:03:10.340> creases<00:03:10.790> we'll<00:03:11.720> move<00:03:11.959> around<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.470> edge

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
the creases we'll move around the edge

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.990 
the creases we'll move around the edge
gently<00:03:15.410> making<00:03:15.620> sure<00:03:15.950> all<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.370> creases<00:03:16.610> are

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
gently making sure all the creases are

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000 
gently making sure all the creases are
nicely<00:03:17.180> formed<00:03:17.780> here's<00:03:18.290> one<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:18.739> not

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
nicely formed here's one that's not

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.840 
nicely formed here's one that's not
quite<00:03:19.220> right

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
quite right

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.979 
quite right
we'll<00:03:20.420> just<00:03:20.690> flatten<00:03:21.080> that<00:03:21.200> carefully<00:03:22.989> and

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
we'll just flatten that carefully and

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.680 
we'll just flatten that carefully and
continue<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.650> round<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.010> model<00:03:28.090> now<00:03:29.090> DNA<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.660> a

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
continue on round the model now DNA is a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.610 
continue on round the model now DNA is a
double<00:03:30.049> helix<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:31.069> when<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.370> finish<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:31.880> side

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
double helix so when we finish this side

double helix so when we finish this side
we<00:03:33.620> have<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.069> back<00:03:34.280> up<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.610> other<00:03:34.730> side

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
we have to go back up the other side

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.050 
we have to go back up the other side
again<00:03:35.720> gently<00:03:36.319> flattening<00:03:36.830> all<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.100> creases

you're<00:03:41.630> almost<00:03:41.810> done<00:03:42.080> now<00:03:42.730> all<00:03:43.730> that's<00:03:44.000> left

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
you're almost done now all that's left

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.650 
you're almost done now all that's left
to<00:03:44.360> do<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:45.410> let<00:03:45.709> go<00:03:45.740> of<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.130> model<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.510> let

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
to do is let go of the model and let

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:57.390 
to do is let go of the model and let
your<00:03:47.810> origami<00:03:48.200> DNA<00:03:48.709> form

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400
