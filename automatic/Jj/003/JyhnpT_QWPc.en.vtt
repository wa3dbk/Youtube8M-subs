actually um I have this vacuum here
that's<00:00:29.460> pulling<00:00:29.730> air<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.480> around<00:00:30.779> these

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that's pulling air out from around these

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.020 
that's pulling air out from around these
balloons<00:00:31.439> okay<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:32.700> gonna<00:00:32.790> do

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
balloons okay and what that's gonna do

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.520 
balloons okay and what that's gonna do
is<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.329> gonna<00:00:33.390> cause<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> difference<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.380> air

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
is it's gonna cause a difference in air

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
is it's gonna cause a difference in air
pressure<00:00:34.710> okay<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:36.690> these

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
pressure okay and you can see these

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
pressure okay and you can see these
balloons<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.440> expanding<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.340> expanding<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
balloons are expanding and expanding and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
balloons are expanding and expanding and
expanding<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.050> expanding<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.620> they'll

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
expanding and expanding and they'll

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.250 
expanding and expanding and they'll
probably<00:00:41.040> eventually<00:00:41.670> pop<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.899> let<00:00:43.050> them<00:00:43.110> go

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
probably eventually pop if I let them go

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
probably eventually pop if I let them go
too<00:00:43.320> long<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.160> did<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:45.120> I'll

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
too long like that one did so what I'll

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.760 
too long like that one did so what I'll
do<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.809> ahead<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.989> rush<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> air<00:00:46.590> back

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
do is go ahead and rush all the air back

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
do is go ahead and rush all the air back
in<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
in and you can see that we have got a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.270 
in and you can see that we have got a
very<00:00:51.930> cool<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:52.500> vacuum<00:00:52.890> experienced

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
very cool little vacuum experienced

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
very cool little vacuum experienced
actor<00:00:53.550> original<00:00:53.969> size<00:00:54.210> yeah<00:00:54.660> exactly<00:00:54.899> right

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
actor original size yeah exactly right

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
actor original size yeah exactly right
that's<00:00:55.920> cuz<00:00:56.160> those<00:00:56.250> pressure<00:00:56.579> differences

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that's cuz those pressure differences

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.549 
that's cuz those pressure differences
are<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> same<00:00:57.390> again<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.320> I'll<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
too all right so I've gotten a kind of a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.710 
too all right so I've gotten a kind of a
big<00:01:35.369> collection<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.970> different<00:01:36.119> candies<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
big collection of different candies and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.749 
big collection of different candies and
different<00:01:37.380> marshmallows<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.159> normally<00:01:38.670> I'd

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
different marshmallows and normally I'd

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.100 
different marshmallows and normally I'd
imagination<00:01:39.210> station<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.659> these<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
imagination station we do these one at a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.539 
imagination station we do these one at a
time<00:01:40.320> right<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.799> you're<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.220> good

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
time right because if you're a good

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.460 
time right because if you're a good
scientist<00:01:42.060> following<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> scientific

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
scientist following the scientific

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.719 
scientist following the scientific
method<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.369> testing<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
method you don't want to be testing a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.039 
method you don't want to be testing a
bunch<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> different<00:01:45.090> variables<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.869> once

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
bunch of different variables all at once

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
bunch of different variables all at once
but<00:01:46.350> i<00:01:46.710> figured<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.250> chris<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.850> go

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
but i figured for you chris we would go

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.460 
but i figured for you chris we would go
ahead<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> whole<00:01:49.049> bunch<00:01:49.079> of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
ahead and get a whole bunch of

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230 
ahead and get a whole bunch of
marshmallows<00:01:49.979> all<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.369> together<00:01:50.520> oh<00:01:50.880> not

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
marshmallows all in here together oh not

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.880 
marshmallows all in here together oh not
just<00:01:51.450> me<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.689> kids<00:01:52.170> alike<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:52.590> probably

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
just me but kids alike would probably

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.319 
just me but kids alike would probably
love<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> sweet<00:01:53.670> experiment

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
love this it's a sweet experiment

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.480 
love this it's a sweet experiment
talking<00:01:54.659> about<00:01:54.840> candy<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.250> good<00:01:56.369> way

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
talking about candy and it's a good way

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
talking about candy and it's a good way
to<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> roll<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> science<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.719> kids<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
to kind of roll a science to kids that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.749 
to kind of roll a science to kids that
come<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> imagination<00:01:58.619> station<00:01:58.979> exactly

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
come to the imagination station exactly

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.280 
come to the imagination station exactly
and<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.240> cool<00:02:00.390> thing<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.570> i<00:02:00.780> showed<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.140> all

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and the cool thing is i showed you all

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.510 
and the cool thing is i showed you all
these<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.560> balloons<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
these little balloons and at the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.190 
these little balloons and at the
beginning<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.049> marshmallows<00:02:04.049> they

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
beginning because marshmallows they

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.620 
beginning because marshmallows they
taste<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:05.009> they<00:02:05.430> don't<00:02:05.520> taste<00:02:05.729> lofi<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
taste what they don't taste lofi it

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
taste what they don't taste lofi it
tastes<00:02:06.869> may<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.380> pockets<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.950> air<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.160> them

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
tastes may have pockets of air in them

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
tastes may have pockets of air in them
yes<00:02:08.550> lots<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.330> pockets<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.780> air<00:02:09.929> that's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
yes lots of little pockets of air that's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.420 
yes lots of little pockets of air that's
why<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.259> brought<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.619> lots<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.220> tiny

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
why I brought in lots of little tiny

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.680 
why I brought in lots of little tiny
balloons<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.000> kind<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> show<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.599> would

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
balloons to kind of show you what would

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.240 
balloons to kind of show you what would
happen

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
happen

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.410 
happen
on<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.340> big<00:02:13.550> scale<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:14.000> we're<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.300> see

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
on a big scale now we're going to see

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.060 
on a big scale now we're going to see
what<00:02:14.510> happens<00:02:14.840> if<00:02:15.080> we<00:02:15.440> take<00:02:15.650> all<00:02:15.830> those<00:02:15.920> little

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
what happens if we take all those little

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.460 
what happens if we take all those little
pockets<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.550> air<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.080> pull<00:02:18.080> all<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.320> air<00:02:18.440> from

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
pockets of air and pull all the air from

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.230 
pockets of air and pull all the air from
around<00:02:18.860> them<00:02:19.100> again<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.550> think<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.150> where

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
around them again I think I see where

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.730 
around them again I think I see where
the<00:02:20.360> skull<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.780> think<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.110> think<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.620> can

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
the skull you think you think you can

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.960 
the skull you think you think you can
figure<00:02:21.860> out<00:02:21.950> where<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.250> we're<00:02:22.820> probably

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
figure out where the so we're probably

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.240 
figure out where the so we're probably
gonna<00:02:23.180> fill<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.510> vacuum<00:02:24.350> chamber<00:02:24.920> up<00:02:25.070> as

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
gonna fill this vacuum chamber up as

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.520 
gonna fill this vacuum chamber up as
those<00:02:25.490> marshmallows<00:02:26.120> expand<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.780> recently<00:02:27.170> at

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
those marshmallows expand I recently at

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.260 
those marshmallows expand I recently at
least<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.890> hope<00:02:28.160> that's<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.520> good<00:02:28.550> hypothesis

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
least I hope that's a good hypothesis

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.340 
least I hope that's a good hypothesis
that<00:02:29.300> Chris<00:02:29.600> let's<00:02:29.780> go<00:02:29.810> ahead<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.080> test<00:02:30.170> it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
that Chris let's go ahead and test it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.770 
that Chris let's go ahead and test it
out<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.610> I'm<00:02:31.730> pulling<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> air<00:02:32.270> from<00:02:32.510> around

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
out so I'm pulling the air from around

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.220 
out so I'm pulling the air from around
it<00:02:33.490> i'm<00:02:34.490> not<00:02:34.550> i'm<00:02:34.850> not<00:02:34.880> actually<00:02:35.209> changing<00:02:36.110> any

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
it i'm not i'm not actually changing any

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.990 
it i'm not i'm not actually changing any
of<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.410> air<00:02:36.560> inside<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:37.250> those<00:02:37.340> marshmallows

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
of the air inside of those marshmallows

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.820 
of the air inside of those marshmallows
right<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.810> I'm<00:02:39.020> just<00:02:39.230> pulling<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> air<00:02:39.590> front

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
right so I'm just pulling the air front

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.590 
right so I'm just pulling the air front
and<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.160> can<00:02:40.310> see<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.180> air<00:02:41.420> that's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
and as you can see that that air that's

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.060 
and as you can see that that air that's
trapped<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:42.140> those<00:02:42.260> tiny<00:02:42.500> little<00:02:42.709> balloons

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
trapped in those tiny little balloons

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.720 
trapped in those tiny little balloons
tiny<00:02:43.610> little<00:02:43.790> pores<00:02:44.090> are<00:02:44.810> actually<00:02:45.730> expanding

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
tiny little pores are actually expanding

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.010 
tiny little pores are actually expanding
and<00:02:46.880> expanding<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.450> expanding<00:02:47.570> because

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
and expanding and expanding because

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.420 
and expanding and expanding because
there's<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.350> difference<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.800> air<00:02:48.920> pressure<00:02:49.040> you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
there's a difference in air pressure you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.830 
there's a difference in air pressure you
know<00:02:49.520> all<00:02:49.700> about<00:02:49.820> air<00:02:50.060> pressure<00:02:50.180> right<00:02:50.600> yeah

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
know all about air pressure right yeah

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.390 
know all about air pressure right yeah
there's<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.080> little<00:02:51.200> meteorologist<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.190> it's

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
there's a little meteorologist and it's

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.590 
there's a little meteorologist and it's
actually<00:02:52.580> getting<00:02:52.880> pretty<00:02:53.000> squished<00:02:53.450> down

to amplify your ma knows we're getting
very<00:02:59.330> very<00:02:59.930> low<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.110> mean<00:03:00.230> look<00:03:00.320> at<00:03:00.410> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
very very low I mean look at the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.199 
very very low I mean look at the
difference<00:03:00.800> between<00:03:00.920> my<00:03:01.340> normal<00:03:01.670> my<00:03:01.880> normal

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
difference between my normal my normal

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.400 
difference between my normal my normal
marshmallow<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.780> then<00:03:02.900> but<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.170> see<00:03:03.290> what's

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
marshmallow and then but you see what's

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.229 
marshmallow and then but you see what's
happening<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.830> him<00:03:03.920> now<00:03:04.040> they're<00:03:04.850> starting<00:03:05.060> to

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
happening to him now they're starting to

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.400 
happening to him now they're starting to
deflate<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.690> little<00:03:05.959> they're<00:03:06.140> starting<00:03:06.380> to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
deflate a little they're starting to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.570 
deflate a little they're starting to
play<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.709> that's<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:07.010> saw<00:03:07.190> with<00:03:07.459> those

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
play and that's you saw with those

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.310 
play and that's you saw with those
balloons<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.030> couple<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.480> them<00:03:08.570> popped<00:03:08.780> right

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
balloons a couple of them popped right

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.300 
balloons a couple of them popped right
that's<00:03:09.680> what's<00:03:09.860> happening<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.220> these

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
that's what's happening to these

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.199 
that's what's happening to these
marshmallows<00:03:10.730> they're<00:03:10.850> actually<00:03:11.060> eating

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
marshmallows they're actually eating

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.940 
marshmallows they're actually eating
there<00:03:11.510> such<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> large<00:03:12.110> pressure<00:03:12.470> difference

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
there such a large pressure difference

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.010 
there such a large pressure difference
that<00:03:13.550> they're<00:03:13.730> actually<00:03:14.120> gonna<00:03:14.239> pop<00:03:14.570> all

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
that they're actually gonna pop all

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.710 
that they're actually gonna pop all
those<00:03:15.260> little<00:03:15.470> tiny<00:03:15.650> pores<00:03:16.180> there's<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.480> part

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
those little tiny pores there's the part

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.479 
those little tiny pores there's the part
of<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.900> signs<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.530> just<00:03:18.769> taught<00:03:19.310> me

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
of the signs that you just taught me

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.190 
of the signs that you just taught me
something<00:03:19.730> yeah<00:03:20.090> there<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.630> go<00:03:20.780> there<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.080> go

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
something yeah there you go there you go

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.539 
something yeah there you go there you go
and<00:03:21.350> once<00:03:21.739> again<00:03:21.860> what<00:03:22.100> do<00:03:22.160> think<00:03:22.280> some<00:03:22.370> happen

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
and once again what do think some happen

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.949 
and once again what do think some happen
if<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.700> rush<00:03:22.880> all<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.120> air<00:03:23.209> back<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.570> there

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
if I rush all the air back in there

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.120 
if I rush all the air back in there
probably<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> shrivel<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.799> probably<00:03:25.040> gonna

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
probably in a shrivel the probably gonna

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.860 
probably in a shrivel the probably gonna
shrivel<00:03:25.340> right<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.790> sort<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.480> original

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
shrivel right so the sort of original

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.140 
shrivel right so the sort of original
size<00:03:29.230> or<00:03:30.230> smaller<00:03:30.560> or<00:03:31.010> much<00:03:31.459> much<00:03:31.730> smaller<00:03:32.000> I

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
size or smaller or much much smaller I

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.670 
size or smaller or much much smaller I
go<00:03:32.390> ahead<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.630> pull<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> out<00:03:33.080> for<00:03:33.350> me<00:03:33.470> Chris

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
go ahead and pull that out for me Chris

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.080 
go ahead and pull that out for me Chris
would<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:35.530> yeah<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.830> can<00:03:36.980> see<00:03:37.220> I'll<00:03:37.970> go

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
ahead and set some of these down here

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.300 
ahead and set some of these down here
and<00:03:39.470> we<00:03:39.530> get<00:03:39.650> rid<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.799> all<00:03:39.860> these<00:03:40.040> other

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
and we get rid of all these other

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.560 
and we get rid of all these other
marshmallows<00:03:40.970> get<00:03:41.239> out<00:03:41.330> of<00:03:41.480> here

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
marshmallows get out of here

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.259 
marshmallows get out of here
marshmallows<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:43.220> can<00:03:43.400> see<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.880> these

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
marshmallows you can see that these

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.270 
marshmallows you can see that these
things<00:03:44.480> came<00:03:44.720> down<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.019> become<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.560> much<00:03:46.070> much

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
things came down to become a much much

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.860 
things came down to become a much much
smaller<00:03:46.519> size<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.060> once<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.299> pulled<00:03:47.540> all<00:03:47.690> that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
smaller size so once we pulled all that

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.060 
smaller size so once we pulled all that
once<00:03:48.049> those<00:03:48.230> all<00:03:48.530> those<00:03:48.680> little<00:03:48.829> tiny

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
once those all those little tiny

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.199 
once those all those little tiny
balloons<00:03:49.459> trapped<00:03:49.790> inside<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:50.120> our

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
balloons trapped inside of our

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.690 
balloons trapped inside of our
marshmallows<00:03:50.660> popped<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:52.130> deploying<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.579> air

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
marshmallows popped in deploying the air

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.280 
marshmallows popped in deploying the air
even<00:03:52.880> out<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.060> those<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:53.750> we've<00:03:53.870> completely

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
even out of those so we've completely

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.220 
even out of those so we've completely
deflated<00:03:54.739> them<00:03:55.180> not<00:03:56.180> as<00:03:56.299> appetizing<00:03:56.780> not<00:03:57.079> as

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
deflated them not as appetizing not as

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.630 
deflated them not as appetizing not as
after<00:03:57.500> all<00:03:57.620> if<00:03:57.860> we're<00:03:58.190> looking<00:03:58.280> for<00:03:58.459> someone
