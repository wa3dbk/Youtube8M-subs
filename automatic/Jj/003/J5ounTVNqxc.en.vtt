about 11 to 12 years old are sinning in

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.870 
about 11 to 12 years old are sinning in
the<00:02:00.439> actual<00:02:00.680> window<00:02:01.130> which<00:02:01.310> we<00:02:01.460> saw<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.790> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the actual window which we saw in the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.429 
the actual window which we saw in the
trailer<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.270> did<00:02:02.420> see<00:02:02.570> her<00:02:02.780> sitting<00:02:03.049> up<00:02:03.290> there

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
trailer we did see her sitting up there

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.200 
trailer we did see her sitting up there
so<00:02:03.890> I'm<00:02:03.979> not<00:02:04.159> sure<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.700> actually<00:02:05.060> going

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
so I'm not sure this is actually going

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.899 
so I'm not sure this is actually going
to<00:02:05.420> relate<00:02:05.930> maybe<00:02:06.530> they've<00:02:06.740> sort<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.130> combined

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
to relate maybe they've sort of combined

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.759 
to relate maybe they've sort of combined
the<00:02:08.149> theories<00:02:08.509> together<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.049> possibly<00:02:09.470> put

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
the theories together to possibly put

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.580 
the theories together to possibly put
Lucy<00:02:10.459> Lane<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.180> window<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:12.170> does<00:02:12.379> if

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.940 
she wasn't actually in the photo and
they<00:03:05.420> never<00:03:05.450> actually<00:03:05.840> said<00:03:06.290> she<00:03:06.320> was<00:03:06.620> part<00:03:06.890> of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
they never actually said she was part of

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.680 
they never actually said she was part of
the<00:03:07.040> staff<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.910> she<00:03:08.060> just<00:03:08.300> sort<00:03:08.600> of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the staff so she just sort of

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.570 
the staff so she just sort of
disappeared<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.500> pictures<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.340> we<00:03:10.430> know

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
disappeared in the pictures and we know

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.000 
disappeared in the pictures and we know
when<00:03:10.970> ghosts<00:03:11.630> usually<00:03:11.690> are<00:03:12.410> taken<00:03:12.890> in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
when ghosts usually are taken in

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.950 
when ghosts usually are taken in
pictures<00:03:13.400> they<00:03:13.850> don't<00:03:14.090> show<00:03:14.390> up<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.780> that

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
pictures they don't show up so that

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.020 
pictures they don't show up so that
could<00:03:15.320> be<00:03:15.350> her<00:03:15.650> as<00:03:15.830> well<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.280> sort<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:16.970> a

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
could be her as well it's sort of a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.390 
could be her as well it's sort of a
combination<00:03:17.300> between<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.560> two<00:03:18.770> theories<00:03:19.220> if

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
combination between the two theories if

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.370 
combination between the two theories if
they<00:03:19.940> could<00:03:20.150> combine<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.690> all<00:03:20.810> into<00:03:21.170> one<00:03:21.320> I

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
they could combine it all into one I

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.170 
they could combine it all into one I
could<00:03:21.710> guarantee<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.760> it<00:03:22.880> would<00:03:23.030> be

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
could guarantee you that it would be

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.330 
could guarantee you that it would be
this<00:03:23.360> exact<00:03:23.780> person<00:03:24.080> because<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.620> have<00:03:24.800> people

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
this exact person because we have people

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.830 
this exact person because we have people
up<00:03:25.640> in<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.880> window<00:03:26.090> which<00:03:26.360> we<00:03:26.480> saw<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
up in the window which we saw in the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.870 
up in the window which we saw in the
trailer<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:27.470> well<00:03:28.010> as<00:03:28.160> his<00:03:28.340> goal<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.760> is

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
trailer as well as his goal that is

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.240 
trailer as well as his goal that is
pretty<00:03:29.390> much<00:03:29.570> described<00:03:30.140> exactly<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:31.040> same

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
pretty much described exactly the same

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.800 
pretty much described exactly the same
as<00:03:31.460> the<00:03:31.550> other<00:03:31.670> one<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.030> trail<00:03:32.270> so<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.750> hope

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
as the other one in the trail so I hope

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.120

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
think of this theory video and if you

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.660 
think of this theory video and if you
think<00:03:56.810> one<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.290> these<00:03:57.410> maybe<00:03:57.800> could<00:03:58.100> relate<00:03:58.460> to

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
think one of these maybe could relate to

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.270 
think one of these maybe could relate to
actually<00:03:59.240> who<00:03:59.420> what<00:03:59.600> is<00:03:59.720> floating<00:04:00.230> around<00:04:00.410> or

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
actually who what is floating around or

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.950 
actually who what is floating around or
who<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.640> is<00:04:01.730> exactly<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.330> make<00:04:02.630> sure<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.810> guys
