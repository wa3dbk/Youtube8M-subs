been waiting for this is the taste test

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.759 
been waiting for this is the taste test
and<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:47.180> video<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.750> literally<00:03:48.349> my<00:03:48.530> first

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
and in this video is literally my first

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.319 
and in this video is literally my first
time<00:03:48.949> tasting<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.489> ice<00:03:49.579> cream<00:03:49.819> from<00:03:50.180> a

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
time tasting the ice cream from a

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.080 
time tasting the ice cream from a
homemade<00:03:50.750> machine<00:03:51.169> and<00:03:51.409> I<00:03:51.919> love<00:03:52.310> ice<00:03:52.609> cream

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
homemade machine and I love ice cream

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.420 
homemade machine and I love ice cream
and<00:03:53.269> I'll<00:03:53.449> tell<00:03:53.659> you<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.019> came<00:03:54.319> out<00:03:54.500> very<00:03:54.919> well

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
and I'll tell you it came out very well

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.610 
and I'll tell you it came out very well
indeed<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.540> consistency<00:03:57.169> was<00:03:57.409> like

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
indeed the consistency was like

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.469 
indeed the consistency was like
soft-serve<00:03:58.069> ice<00:03:58.310> cream<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.729> from<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.120> recipe

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479 
soft-serve ice cream and from the recipe

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.530 
soft-serve ice cream and from the recipe
very<00:03:59.810> surprisingly<00:04:00.530> tasted<00:04:01.459> very<00:04:01.849> good<00:04:02.060> for<00:04:02.510> a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
very surprisingly tasted very good for a

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.960 
very surprisingly tasted very good for a
homemade<00:04:02.900> product<00:04:03.379> and<00:04:03.859> I'll<00:04:04.040> admit<00:04:04.129> once<00:04:04.849> you

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
homemade product and I'll admit once you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.119 
homemade product and I'll admit once you
freeze<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.479> to<00:04:05.689> make<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.989> into<00:04:06.439> hard<00:04:06.799> ice<00:04:06.919> cream

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
freeze it to make it into hard ice cream

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.949 
freeze it to make it into hard ice cream
it<00:04:07.370> tasted<00:04:07.729> a<00:04:07.790> bit<00:04:07.970> better<00:04:08.120> in<00:04:08.299> my<00:04:08.419> opinion<00:04:08.540> and

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
it tasted a bit better in my opinion and

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.080 
it tasted a bit better in my opinion and
the<00:04:09.349> consistency<00:04:09.919> was<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.099> bit<00:04:10.310> more<00:04:10.489> creamy<00:04:10.909> as

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
the consistency was a bit more creamy as

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.000 
the consistency was a bit more creamy as
it<00:04:11.239> melted<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.659> your<00:04:11.689> mouth

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
it melted in your mouth

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.160 
it melted in your mouth
right<00:04:12.819> after<00:04:13.090> making<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.540> ice<00:04:13.629> cream<00:04:13.959> and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
right after making the ice cream and

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.050 
right after making the ice cream and
after<00:04:14.530> hardening<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.129> ice<00:04:15.220> cream<00:04:15.519> no<00:04:15.849> ice

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
after hardening the ice cream no ice

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.939 
after hardening the ice cream no ice
crystals<00:04:16.479> were<00:04:16.570> found<00:04:16.840> in<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.199> texture<00:04:17.680> was

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
crystals were found in a texture was

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.819 
crystals were found in a texture was
perfect<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.820> comparing<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.810> bigger<00:04:20.079> yet

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
perfect and comparing to the bigger yet

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.219 
perfect and comparing to the bigger yet
more<00:04:21.130> expensive<00:04:21.639> unit<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.330> consistency<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
more expensive unit the consistency and

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.310 
more expensive unit the consistency and
this<00:04:23.410> machine<00:04:23.590> was<00:04:24.070> basically<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.090> same<00:04:25.320> so

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
this machine was basically the same so

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.680 
this machine was basically the same so
after<00:04:26.620> making<00:04:26.770> several<00:04:27.430> batches<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.210> testing

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
after making several batches and testing

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.170 
after making several batches and testing
this<00:04:28.780> product<00:04:29.080> it's<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.620> great<00:04:30.010> machine<00:04:30.520> this

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
this product it's a great machine this

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.750 
this product it's a great machine this
machine<00:04:31.360> barely<00:04:31.960> had<00:04:32.080> any<00:04:32.229> flaws<00:04:32.530> but<00:04:33.520> just

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
machine barely had any flaws but just

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.060 
machine barely had any flaws but just
future<00:04:34.330> wants<00:04:34.840> from<00:04:34.990> my<00:04:35.139> personal<00:04:35.560> experience

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
future wants from my personal experience

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.650 
future wants from my personal experience
but<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.699> wouldn't<00:04:37.030> see<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.270> as<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.389> deal-killer

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
but I wouldn't see it as a deal-killer

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.719 
but I wouldn't see it as a deal-killer
though<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.770> after<00:04:39.130> pouring<00:04:39.520> in<00:04:39.639> the

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
though so after pouring in the

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.670 
though so after pouring in the
ingredients<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.900> only<00:04:41.050> takes<00:04:41.289> about<00:04:41.320> 20

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
ingredients it only takes about 20

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.990 
ingredients it only takes about 20
minutes<00:04:41.710> for<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.160> machine<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.490> do<00:04:42.639> its<00:04:42.789> work

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
minutes for the machine to do its work

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.060 
minutes for the machine to do its work
and<00:04:43.180> finish<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:44.110> during<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.440> time<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.860> motor

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
and finish so during that time the motor

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.430 
and finish so during that time the motor
itself<00:04:45.430> does<00:04:45.699> make<00:04:45.940> in<00:04:46.090> moderate<00:04:46.539> winding

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
itself does make in moderate winding

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.010 
itself does make in moderate winding
roads<00:04:47.860> when<00:04:48.610> powered<00:04:49.000> on<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.419> it's<00:04:49.600> just<00:04:49.870> a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
roads when powered on and it's just a

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.740 
roads when powered on and it's just a
little<00:04:50.320> loud<00:04:50.500> rhythm<00:04:50.860> it's<00:04:51.039> bigger<00:04:51.310> buddy<00:04:51.750> in

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
little loud rhythm it's bigger buddy in

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.480 
little loud rhythm it's bigger buddy in
addition<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.229> was<00:04:53.440> hoping<00:04:53.740> there<00:04:53.949> would<00:04:54.160> have

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
addition I was hoping there would have

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.820 
addition I was hoping there would have
been<00:04:54.550> some<00:04:54.910> sort<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.360> lid<00:04:55.600> on<00:04:55.810> top<00:04:56.139> to

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
been some sort of a lid on top to

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.200 
been some sort of a lid on top to
prevent<00:04:57.100> any<00:04:57.250> dust<00:04:57.460> from<00:04:57.639> falling<00:04:57.940> into<00:04:58.090> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
prevent any dust from falling into the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.529 
prevent any dust from falling into the
ice<00:04:58.419> cream<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.639> probably<00:05:00.639> lastly<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.270> would

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
ice cream and probably lastly it would

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.480 
ice cream and probably lastly it would
be<00:05:01.930> nice<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.139> have<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.410> built-in<00:05:02.770> timer<00:05:03.070> for<00:05:03.430> the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
be nice to have a built-in timer for the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.550 
be nice to have a built-in timer for the
machine<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:04.360> automatically<00:05:04.870> shut<00:05:05.169> off<00:05:05.199> just

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
machine to automatically shut off just

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.680 
machine to automatically shut off just
in<00:05:05.680> case<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:05.919> forgot<00:05:06.190> once<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.300> ice<00:05:07.419> cream

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
in case I forgot once the ice cream

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.969 
in case I forgot once the ice cream
thickened<00:05:08.169> you<00:05:08.380> can<00:05:08.500> hear<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.740> machine

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
thickened you can hear the machine

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.710 
thickened you can hear the machine
working<00:05:09.220> harder<00:05:09.639> to<00:05:09.729> churn<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.270> ice

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
working harder to churn and the ice

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.920 
working harder to churn and the ice
cream<00:05:10.960> itself<00:05:11.550> expanded<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.699> was<00:05:13.479> somewhat

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
cream itself expanded and was somewhat

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.710 
cream itself expanded and was somewhat
coming<00:05:14.320> out<00:05:14.470> of<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.160> opening<00:05:15.639> possibly<00:05:16.539> or

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
coming out of the opening possibly or

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.350 
coming out of the opening possibly or
would<00:05:17.349> have<00:05:17.620> resulted<00:05:17.860> in<00:05:18.070> an<00:05:18.190> overflow<00:05:18.430> so

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
would have resulted in an overflow so

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.960 
would have resulted in an overflow so
