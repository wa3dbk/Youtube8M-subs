00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
assault rifles to master this was the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.439

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
last one on the list and that's not to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.939 
last one on the list and that's not to
say<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.469> weapon<00:00:58.800> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
say that I don't like this weapon it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
say that I don't like this weapon it's
actually<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> lot<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> fun<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.390> just

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
actually a lot of fun to use it's just

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.840 
actually a lot of fun to use it's just
got<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:00.989> slow<00:01:01.379> rate<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> fire<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.699> not

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
got a very slow rate of fire so it's not

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.820 
got a very slow rate of fire so it's not
necessarily<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> most<00:01:03.750> competitive<00:01:04.199> rifle

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
necessarily the most competitive rifle

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.329 
necessarily the most competitive rifle
in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> game

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
in the game

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
in the game
that<00:01:05.670> being<00:01:05.850> said<00:01:06.030> running<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.479> weapon<00:01:06.840> with

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that being said running this weapon with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
that being said running this weapon with
an<00:01:07.140> underbarrel<00:01:07.650> grenade<00:01:07.799> launcher<00:01:08.369> gives<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
an underbarrel grenade launcher gives it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
an underbarrel grenade launcher gives it
a<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:09.180> cool<00:01:09.479> look<00:01:09.810> aesthetically

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
a very cool look aesthetically

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
a very cool look aesthetically
unfortunately<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.490> doesn't<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:11.880> give<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
unfortunately it doesn't really give you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
unfortunately it doesn't really give you
much<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:13.110> benefit<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.650> running<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.040> under

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
much of a benefit of running this under

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.770 
much of a benefit of running this under
barrel<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.030> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.270> better<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> just

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
barrel it would be better if you just

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
barrel it would be better if you just
had<00:01:16.110> some<00:01:16.320> sort<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> four<00:01:16.890> grip<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.490> so

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
had some sort of four grip on there so

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
had some sort of four grip on there so
you<00:01:17.790> could<00:01:18.119> better<00:01:18.630> compensate<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.530> recoil

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you could better compensate your recoil

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.649 
you could better compensate your recoil
and<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.280> improve<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> gun<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.970> some<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.390> in

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and we improve the gun in some way in

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
and we improve the gun in some way in
fact<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> would<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.259> interesting<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
fact it would be interesting if the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.100 
fact it would be interesting if the
grenade<00:01:23.610> launcher<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.090> an<00:01:24.180> equipment<00:01:24.509> option

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
grenade launcher was an equipment option

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.499 
grenade launcher was an equipment option
in<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> underbarrel<00:01:26.130> slot<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.150> case<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
in the underbarrel slot in which case it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.120 
in the underbarrel slot in which case it
would<00:01:27.630> free<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.049> both<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.409> gadget<00:01:28.860> slots

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
would free up both your gadget slots

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.929 
would free up both your gadget slots
once<00:01:29.490> again

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
once again

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.280 
once again
that<00:01:30.060> would<00:01:30.150> actually<00:01:30.450> give<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> reason<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that would actually give you a reason to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.749 
that would actually give you a reason to
run<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> grenade<00:01:31.829> launcher<00:01:31.860> under<00:01:32.340> barrel

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
run the grenade launcher under barrel

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
run the grenade launcher under barrel
instead<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> using<00:01:33.329> some<00:01:33.659> sort<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.200> grip

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
instead of using some sort of for grip

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
instead of using some sort of for grip
then<00:01:34.740> again<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> assault<00:01:35.400> class<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.820> already

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
then again the assault class is already

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
then again the assault class is already
pretty<00:01:36.450> overpowered<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.170> giving<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> more

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
pretty overpowered so giving it more

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
pretty overpowered so giving it more
benefits<00:01:39.000> probably<00:01:39.450> isn't<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.720> best<00:01:39.780> idea

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

balance wise now I believe you can

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.700 
balance wise now I believe you can
switch<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.140> underbarrel<00:01:43.560> grenade

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
switch to the underbarrel grenade

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.469 
switch to the underbarrel grenade
launcher<00:01:44.250> faster<00:01:44.790> than<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.270> by

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
launcher faster than you can by
switching<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.649> separate

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
switching to it if it's a separate

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.039 
switching to it if it's a separate

weapon entirely and that's supposed to

be<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> main<00:01:49.470> benefit<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.130> having<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.610> mounted

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
be the main benefit of having it mounted

under<00:01:51.299> barrel<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.259> it's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
under barrel I just don't think it's

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that good of a benefit to actually give

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.539 
that good of a benefit to actually give

kind of optic on here and under barrel

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.660 
kind of optic on here and under barrel
can<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:55.989> pretty<00:02:56.260> decent<00:02:56.500> long-range<00:02:57.250> weapon

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
can be a pretty decent long-range weapon

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.670 
can be a pretty decent long-range weapon
but<00:02:57.879> again<00:02:58.269> it's<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.599> gonna<00:02:58.690> win<00:02:58.930> any<00:02:59.200> awards

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
but again it's not gonna win any awards

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.110

and<00:02:59.829> there's<00:02:59.950> always<00:03:00.190> gonna<00:03:00.459> be<00:03:00.549> something

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
and there's always gonna be something

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.630 
and there's always gonna be something
then<00:03:01.510> outclasses<00:03:02.349> this<00:03:02.560> gun<00:03:02.799> pretty<00:03:03.220> much<00:03:03.400> any

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
and then the fifth guy would kill me

nobody<00:05:08.560> else<00:05:08.590> would<00:05:08.830> be<00:05:08.860> around<00:05:09.190> so<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.580> fifth

sidearm or reload and that's really why

reload<00:05:55.060> times<00:05:55.330> are<00:05:55.510> so<00:05:55.660> important<00:05:56.080> in

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
reload times are so important in

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.630 
reload times are so important in
battlefield<00:05:56.650> 4<00:05:56.740> cause<00:05:57.190> you're<00:05:57.460> often

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
battlefield 4 cause you're often

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.580 
battlefield 4 cause you're often
engaging<00:05:58.210> a<00:05:58.510> lot<00:05:58.540> of<00:05:58.960> enemies<00:05:59.320> at<00:05:59.560> once

engaging a lot of enemies at once

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.170 
engaging a lot of enemies at once
sometimes<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.430> have<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.610> only<00:06:00.820> person<00:06:01.150> you

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
sometimes you have the only person you

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.420 
sometimes you have the only person you
can<00:06:01.390> rely<00:06:01.690> on<00:06:01.720> who's<00:06:02.320> around<00:06:02.590> you<00:06:02.770> so<00:06:03.160> you<00:06:03.220> got

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
can rely on who's around you so you got

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.100 
can rely on who's around you so you got
to<00:06:03.520> get<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:03.729> reload<00:06:04.210> off<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.540> re-engage

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
to get that reload off and re-engage

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.530 
to get that reload off and re-engage
multiple<00:06:06.010> hostile<00:06:06.430> threats<00:06:06.729> sometimes<00:06:07.210> many

multiple hostile threats sometimes many
many<00:06:07.840> times<00:06:08.200> so<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.950> fact<00:06:09.190> that<00:06:09.280> you<00:06:09.430> have<00:06:09.580> a

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
many times so the fact that you have a

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.730 
many times so the fact that you have a
fast<00:06:09.940> reload<00:06:10.270> on<00:06:10.450> some<00:06:10.660> weapons<00:06:11.020> is<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.380> very

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
fast reload on some weapons is a very

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.219 
fast reload on some weapons is a very
very<00:06:12.070> big<00:06:12.310> deal<00:06:12.580> and<00:06:12.790> the<00:06:12.910> ak-12<00:06:13.270> has<00:06:13.630> a<00:06:13.660> 2.0

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
very big deal and the ak-12 has a 2.0

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.320 
very big deal and the ak-12 has a 2.0
five<00:06:14.650> second<00:06:15.100> reload<00:06:15.430> which<00:06:15.820> certainly<00:06:16.210> isn't

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
five second reload which certainly isn't

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.150 
five second reload which certainly isn't
bad<00:06:16.600> it's<00:06:16.780> definitely<00:06:17.260> on<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.470> faster<00:06:17.890> side

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
bad it's definitely on the faster side

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.340 
bad it's definitely on the faster side
of<00:06:18.310> things<00:06:18.550> so<00:06:18.669> it's<00:06:19.090> at<00:06:19.240> least<00:06:19.270> useful<00:06:19.990> for

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
of things so it's at least useful for

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.320 
of things so it's at least useful for
engaging<00:06:20.680> multiple<00:06:21.130> hostiles<00:06:21.640> aiming<00:06:22.180> for

engaging multiple hostiles aiming for
the<00:06:22.419> head<00:06:22.450> is<00:06:22.720> incredibly<00:06:23.229> important<00:06:23.680> when

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
the head is incredibly important when

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.529 
the head is incredibly important when
you<00:06:23.860> have<00:06:23.890> a<00:06:24.039> slow<00:06:24.460> rate<00:06:24.760> of<00:06:24.789> fire<00:06:24.940> weapon

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
you have a slow rate of fire weapon

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.300 
you have a slow rate of fire weapon
especially<00:06:26.020> if<00:06:26.110> the<00:06:26.200> recoil<00:06:26.590> is<00:06:26.740> low<00:06:26.770> and<00:06:27.190> you

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
especially if the recoil is low and you

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.260 
especially if the recoil is low and you
can<00:06:27.460> be<00:06:27.580> a<00:06:27.610> little<00:06:27.820> bit<00:06:28.000> more

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
can be a little bit more

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.730 
can be a little bit more
precise<00:06:28.540> with<00:06:28.780> it<00:06:28.930> you're<00:06:29.110> gonna<00:06:29.200> need<00:06:29.290> to<00:06:29.620> aim

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
precise with it you're gonna need to aim

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.440 
precise with it you're gonna need to aim
for<00:06:29.770> the<00:06:29.950> head<00:06:30.070> to<00:06:30.280> get<00:06:30.610> those<00:06:30.790> higher<00:06:31.060> damage

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
for the head to get those higher damage

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.420 
for the head to get those higher damage
hits<00:06:31.960> allowing<00:06:32.530> you<00:06:32.620> to<00:06:32.740> drop<00:06:32.920> your<00:06:33.100> opponent

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
hits allowing you to drop your opponent

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.010 
hits allowing you to drop your opponent
before<00:06:33.490> they<00:06:33.850> drop<00:06:34.150> you<00:06:34.450> because<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.840> lower

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
before they drop you because the lower

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.690 
before they drop you because the lower
rate<00:06:35.230> of<00:06:35.260> fire<00:06:35.350> is<00:06:35.620> not<00:06:35.770> gonna<00:06:35.890> do<00:06:36.100> any<00:06:36.430> other

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
rate of fire is not gonna do any other

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.180 
rate of fire is not gonna do any other
benefits<00:06:37.210> beyond<00:06:37.630> perhaps<00:06:38.140> accuracy

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190

benefits beyond perhaps accuracy
sadly<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:39.760> iron<00:06:39.970> sights<00:06:40.180> on<00:06:40.330> this<00:06:40.450> let<00:06:40.660> out

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
sadly the iron sights on this let out

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.940 
sadly the iron sights on this let out
make<00:06:40.960> it<00:06:41.140> very<00:06:41.350> difficult<00:06:41.620> to<00:06:41.860> aim

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
make it very difficult to aim

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.160 
make it very difficult to aim
specifically<00:06:42.820> for<00:06:43.120> headshots<00:06:43.390> because<00:06:43.870> once

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
specifically for headshots because once

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.270 
specifically for headshots because once
I<00:06:44.290> line<00:06:44.530> up<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:44.770> iron<00:06:44.890> sights<00:06:45.130> with

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
I line up the iron sights with

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.680 
I line up the iron sights with
somebody's<00:06:45.640> head<00:06:45.670> the<00:06:46.270> iron<00:06:46.420> sights

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
somebody's head the iron sights

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.480 
somebody's head the iron sights
themselves<00:06:47.230> actually<00:06:47.590> pretty<00:06:47.860> much<00:06:47.920> cover<00:06:48.340> up

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
themselves actually pretty much cover up

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.070 
themselves actually pretty much cover up
the<00:06:48.640> enemy's<00:06:48.970> entire<00:06:49.300> body<00:06:49.570> and<00:06:49.750> it<00:06:49.840> becomes

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
the enemy's entire body and it becomes

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.320 
the enemy's entire body and it becomes
very<00:06:50.560> hard<00:06:50.830> to<00:06:51.040> track<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:51.790> target<00:06:52.180> I'm

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
very hard to track the target I'm

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.270 
very hard to track the target I'm
shooting<00:06:52.810> it<00:06:52.930> so<00:06:53.200> I<00:06:53.230> pretty<00:06:53.710> much<00:06:53.800> had<00:06:54.070> to<00:06:54.100> aim

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
shooting it so I pretty much had to aim

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.250 
shooting it so I pretty much had to aim
center<00:06:54.760> mass<00:06:54.940> most<00:06:55.300> of<00:06:55.480> the<00:06:55.570> time<00:06:55.780> so<00:06:56.050> at<00:06:56.140> the

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
center mass most of the time so at the
