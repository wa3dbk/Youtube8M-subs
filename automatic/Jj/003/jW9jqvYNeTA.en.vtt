calm<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:28.060> may<00:02:28.209> know<00:02:28.420> roll-top<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.260> very

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
calm as you may know roll-top is very

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.890 
calm as you may know roll-top is very
fragile<00:02:30.120> therefore<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.209> have<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.540> be<00:02:31.690> very

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
fragile therefore you have to be very

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.250 
fragile therefore you have to be very
careful<00:02:32.560> whilst<00:02:32.860> using<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.480> also<00:02:34.690> too

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
careful whilst using it it is also too

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.680 
careful whilst using it it is also too
thin<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.709> most<00:02:36.220> plugs<00:02:36.580> are<00:02:36.850> three<00:02:37.090> pins<00:02:37.390> so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
thin and most plugs are three pins so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.190 
thin and most plugs are three pins so
you<00:02:37.750> will<00:02:38.020> always<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.620> carry<00:02:38.860> an<00:02:39.070> adapter

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
you will always have to carry an adapter

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.940 
you will always have to carry an adapter
and<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.390> roll-top
