you go to seven on the a second on the D

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.300 
you go to seven on the a second on the D
first<00:01:24.530> on<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.950> G<00:01:25.360> I'm<00:01:26.360> open<00:01:26.870> be<00:01:27.050> an<00:01:27.200> open<00:01:27.560> IE<00:01:27.890> e

major<00:01:29.270> check

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
major check

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.610 
major check
was<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.570> precursor<00:01:32.310> consistent<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.460> make<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
was a precursor consistent that make the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.010 
was a precursor consistent that make the
first<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.950> course<00:01:36.280> happening

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:58.840 

you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.300 

then<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> first<00:02:00.409> that's<00:02:01.409> only<00:02:01.740> two<00:02:02.039> course

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
then the first that's only two course

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.859 
then the first that's only two course
actually<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.880> pretty<00:02:03.030> easy<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.509> suppose

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
actually so it's pretty easy I suppose

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.289 
actually so it's pretty easy I suppose
you<00:02:04.500> bar<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> second<00:02:05.250> fret<00:02:05.369> again<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.149> do

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you bar on the second fret again you do

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.249 
you bar on the second fret again you do
an<00:02:06.390> f-sharp<00:02:06.539> minor<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.390> here's<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> bar<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
an f-sharp minor so here's the bar and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.170 
an f-sharp minor so here's the bar and
then<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:12.650> second<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.920> low<00:02:14.069> E<00:02:14.180> 4th

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
then it's the second on the low E 4th

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.880 
then it's the second on the low E 4th
fret<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:16.530> string<00:02:17.690> for<00:02:18.690> fun<00:02:18.989> d<00:02:19.590> string

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
fret on the a string for fun d string

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.560 
fret on the a string for fun d string
and<00:02:20.160> then<00:02:21.500> 2222<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.890> g2<00:02:23.370> hi

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.990 

so<00:02:30.230> listen<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.320> shall<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.650> mine<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.850> can

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
so listen I shall be mine then you can

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.650 
so listen I shall be mine then you can
switch<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.450> major<00:02:33.720> again<00:02:35.240> third<00:02:36.240> court<00:02:36.540> in

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
switch to a major again third court in

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.190 
switch to a major again third court in
the<00:02:36.720> first<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.650> i<00:02:37.680> won't<00:02:37.920> show<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.160> again<00:02:39.200> go

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the first so i won't show it again go

00:02:40.200 --> 00:03:00.670 
the first so i won't show it again go
something<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.590> this

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.630 

hey

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.930 

this<00:03:07.640> final<00:03:08.120> part<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.510> part<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.989> bridge

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
this final part is part of the bridge

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.640 
this final part is part of the bridge
which<00:03:10.940> comes<00:03:11.150> just<00:03:11.270> out<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.540> three<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
which comes just out of three of the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.680 
which comes just out of three of the
same<00:03:12.800> course<00:03:13.130> we<00:03:13.310> already<00:03:13.580> we<00:03:14.420> already

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
same course we already we already

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.170 
same course we already we already
covered<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.590> then<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:16.130> sharp<00:03:16.550> minor<00:03:16.819> again

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
covered so and then a sharp minor again

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.470 
covered so and then a sharp minor again
so<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:17.780> saw<00:03:17.989> with<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.640> then<00:03:19.640> goes<00:03:19.790> d<00:03:20.030> make<00:03:20.270> this

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
so I saw with that then goes d make this

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.720 
so I saw with that then goes d make this
a<00:03:20.540> new<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.520> there<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:22.580> go<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> major<00:03:24.849> major

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
a new one there you go to a major major

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.240 
a new one there you go to a major major
so<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.849> only<00:03:28.970> new<00:03:29.150> cord<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.569> d<00:03:29.840> major

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
so the only new cord is the d major

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.449 
so the only new cord is the d major
