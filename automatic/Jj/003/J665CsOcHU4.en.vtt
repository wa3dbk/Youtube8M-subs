00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.720 

so<00:00:01.370> step<00:00:01.760> 5<00:00:02.060> we<00:00:02.929> want<00:00:03.290> to<00:00:03.560> remove<00:00:04.279> any<00:00:04.430> birds

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
so step 5 we want to remove any birds

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.849 
so step 5 we want to remove any birds
that<00:00:05.029> are<00:00:05.089> on<00:00:05.299> the<00:00:05.390> ski<00:00:05.660> so<00:00:06.290> yeah<00:00:06.440> sort<00:00:06.830> of

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
that are on the ski so yeah sort of

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.470 
that are on the ski so yeah sort of
three<00:00:07.129> choices<00:00:07.370> you<00:00:07.759> can<00:00:07.879> use<00:00:08.029> a<00:00:08.059> two<00:00:08.299> hundred

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
three choices you can use a two hundred

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.660 
three choices you can use a two hundred
grit<00:00:08.809> which<00:00:09.019> is<00:00:09.170> quite<00:00:09.470> course<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.460> if<00:00:10.550> you've

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
grit which is quite course so if you've

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.390 
grit which is quite course so if you've
hit<00:00:10.880> rocks<00:00:11.179> or<00:00:11.570> whatever<00:00:11.900> best<00:00:12.889> thing<00:00:13.070> to<00:00:13.280> do

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
hit rocks or whatever best thing to do

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.030 
hit rocks or whatever best thing to do
is<00:00:13.519> use<00:00:13.700> it<00:00:13.849> 200<00:00:14.330> in<00:00:14.450> this<00:00:14.960> case<00:00:15.230> some<00:00:15.620> these

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
is use it 200 in this case some these

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.730 
is use it 200 in this case some these
are<00:00:16.250> fairly<00:00:16.460> smooth<00:00:16.820> so<00:00:17.029> I'm<00:00:17.119> going<00:00:17.270> to<00:00:17.330> use<00:00:17.449> a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
are fairly smooth so I'm going to use a

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.880 
are fairly smooth so I'm going to use a
400<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:18.949> then<00:00:19.609> I'll<00:00:19.730> finish<00:00:20.060> at<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.750> end<00:00:20.900> with

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
400 and then I'll finish at the end with

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.290 
400 and then I'll finish at the end with
the<00:00:22.449> 600<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.140> super<00:00:24.560> is<00:00:24.710> on<00:00:24.859> here<00:00:25.300> let's

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
the 600 so the super is on here let's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.519 
the 600 so the super is on here let's
just<00:00:26.330> take<00:00:26.539> a<00:00:26.570> little<00:00:26.779> bit<00:00:26.930> of<00:00:26.990> water<00:00:27.230> on<00:00:27.320> the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
just take a little bit of water on the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.640 
just take a little bit of water on the
biofilm<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:28.460> just<00:00:28.880> do<00:00:29.000> this<00:00:29.150> by<00:00:29.359> hand<00:00:29.650> because

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
biofilm I just do this by hand because

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.400 
biofilm I just do this by hand because
i'm<00:00:30.920> going<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.130> correct<00:00:31.400> the<00:00:31.640> angle<00:00:32.140> on<00:00:33.140> the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
i'm going to correct the angle on the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.819 
i'm going to correct the angle on the
next<00:00:33.710> step<00:00:35.320> in<00:00:36.320> your<00:00:36.469> edge<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:37.460> river<00:00:37.640> water

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
next step in your edge the river water

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.340 
next step in your edge the river water
so<00:00:39.829> as<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.520> did<00:00:40.700> on<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.000> base<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:42.020> can<00:00:42.200> also

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
so as we did on the base you can also

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.220 
so as we did on the base you can also
use<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.680> permanent<00:00:43.070> marker<00:00:43.719> so<00:00:44.719> if<00:00:44.899> you're<00:00:45.020> new

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
use a permanent marker so if you're new

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.670 
use a permanent marker so if you're new
to<00:00:45.260> tuning<00:00:45.770> this<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.010> good<00:00:46.309> thing<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:47.210> do<00:00:47.680> let

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
to tuning this is a good thing to do let

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.850 
to tuning this is a good thing to do let
that<00:00:48.860> dry<00:00:51.190> he<00:00:52.190> thinks<00:00:52.579> make<00:00:52.789> sure<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.300> go

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
that dry he thinks make sure that you go

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.150 
that dry he thinks make sure that you go
right<00:00:54.860> around<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.250> tip<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:57.530> around<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
right around the tip and around the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.250 
right around the tip and around the
tails<00:00:59.469> as<00:01:00.469> you<00:01:00.649> can<00:01:00.770> see<00:01:01.539> this<00:01:02.539> ski<00:01:02.840> wasn't

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
tails as you can see this ski wasn't

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.140 
tails as you can see this ski wasn't
quite<00:01:03.530> on<00:01:03.680> three<00:01:03.980> degrees<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:04.610> must<00:01:04.790> file

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
quite on three degrees so I must file

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.350 
quite on three degrees so I must file
and<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:05.659> all<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.229> black<00:01:06.700> permanent<00:01:07.700> marker<00:01:07.970> is

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
and so all the black permanent marker is

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.830 
and so all the black permanent marker is
gone<00:01:08.979> small<00:01:09.979> even<00:01:10.340> stroke<00:01:10.640> okay<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.510> stop

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
gone small even stroke okay and stop

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.490 
gone small even stroke okay and stop
frequently<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.740> clean<00:01:13.580> your<00:01:13.729> file<00:01:14.500> one

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
frequently and clean your file one

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.109 
frequently and clean your file one
because<00:01:15.770> there<00:01:15.920> is<00:01:16.009> no<00:01:16.070> last<00:01:16.340> longer<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:16.820> way

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
because there is no last longer that way

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.600 
because there is no last longer that way
until<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:18.680> won't<00:01:19.090> get<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.119> load<00:01:20.450> up<00:01:21.460> which<00:01:22.460> will

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
until you won't get a load up which will

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.429 
until you won't get a load up which will
score<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.000> end<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.450> pre-wet<00:01:23.990> this<00:01:24.200> edge

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
score the end and I pre-wet this edge

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.740 
score the end and I pre-wet this edge
with<00:01:24.710> water<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.729> just<00:01:28.939> work<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.479> stone

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
with water and I just work the stone

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.560 
with water and I just work the stone
back<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.259> forth<00:01:30.530> until<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.850> creates<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.240> sort

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
back and forth until it creates a sort

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.240 
back and forth until it creates a sort
of<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.720> gray<00:01:32.930> paste<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.390> you'll<00:01:35.750> notice<00:01:36.250> after

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
of a gray paste and you'll notice after

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.190 
of a gray paste and you'll notice after
a<00:01:37.280> few<00:01:37.460> seconds<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.030> sound<00:01:38.360> will<00:01:38.659> become<00:01:38.930> less

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
a few seconds the sound will become less

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.670 
a few seconds the sound will become less
and<00:01:39.409> less<00:01:43.840> which<00:01:44.840> tells<00:01:45.140> us<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.439> edge<00:01:45.560> is

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
and less which tells us the edge is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.609 
and less which tells us the edge is
getting<00:01:45.920> smoother<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.460> smoother<00:01:50.439> dry<00:01:51.439> your

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
getting smoother and smoother dry your

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.870 
getting smoother and smoother dry your
edge<00:01:51.710> off<00:01:51.950> grab<00:01:52.939> your<00:01:53.060> gummy<00:01:53.329> stone<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.880> you

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
edge off grab your gummy stone and you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.910 
edge off grab your gummy stone and you
can<00:01:56.060> just<00:01:56.360> remove<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.719> birth<00:01:57.049> just<00:01:57.619> remove

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
can just remove the birth just remove

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.330 
can just remove the birth just remove
the<00:01:57.950> sharpness<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.820> tip<00:01:59.030> right<00:01:59.869> here

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
the sharpness on the tip right here

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.789 
the sharpness on the tip right here
notice<00:02:01.340> I'm<00:02:01.490> only<00:02:01.670> going<00:02:01.939> on<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.659> curve<00:02:02.899> we

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
notice I'm only going on the curve we

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.910 
notice I'm only going on the curve we
don't<00:02:03.920> want<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.219> detune<00:02:04.579> down<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.479> ski<00:02:05.799> but<00:02:06.799> we

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
don't want to detune down the ski but we

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.540 
don't want to detune down the ski but we
do<00:02:07.130> want<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.399> just<00:02:07.579> do<00:02:07.729> one<00:02:08.030> pass<00:02:08.269> very<00:02:08.989> lightly

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
do want to just do one pass very lightly

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.250 
do want to just do one pass very lightly
down<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.700> length<00:02:10.879> of<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.150> ski<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.020> just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
down the length of the ski and that just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
down the length of the ski and that just
removes<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.739> microscopic

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
removes the microscopic

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
removes the microscopic
it's<00:02:13.860> created<00:02:14.250> from<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.520> base<00:02:14.790> bubbling<00:02:15.300> and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it's created from the base bubbling and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.770 
it's created from the base bubbling and
the<00:02:16.170> Cybermen
