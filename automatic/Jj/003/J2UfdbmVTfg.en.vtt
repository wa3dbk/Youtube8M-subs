think<00:03:12.019> Tommy<00:03:12.200> will<00:03:12.380> be<00:03:12.470> more<00:03:12.620> concerned<00:03:13.010> with

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
think Tommy will be more concerned with

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.220 
think Tommy will be more concerned with
with<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.459> front<00:03:13.700> players<00:03:13.940> because<00:03:14.269> Fe<00:03:14.959> was<00:03:15.079> to

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
with the front players because Fe was to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.490 
with the front players because Fe was to
lose<00:03:15.410> van<00:03:16.220> Hooijdonk<00:03:16.700> or<00:03:17.180> Tom<00:03:17.510> or<00:03:17.750> indeed<00:03:18.319> both

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
lose van Hooijdonk or Tom or indeed both

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.170 
lose van Hooijdonk or Tom or indeed both
of<00:03:18.709> them<00:03:18.859> I<00:03:19.040> think<00:03:19.459> it's<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> bit<00:03:19.910> short<00:03:20.120> of

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.430 
of them I think it's a bit short of
covered<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.600> over<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:20.900> that's<00:03:20.989> why<00:03:21.230> he's
