00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
agree to be two things one the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.029 
agree to be two things one the
long-awaited<00:00:50.450> office<00:00:51.450> for<00:00:51.660> iOS<00:00:52.050> yeah<00:00:52.469> but

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
long-awaited office for iOS yeah but

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.760 
long-awaited office for iOS yeah but
also<00:00:53.270> they<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.899> conjunction<00:00:55.289> with

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
also they think that in conjunction with

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.840 
also they think that in conjunction with
this<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.340> i<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:56.670> probably

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this and i think they're probably

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
this and i think they're probably
they're<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.480> microsoft<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.649> show<00:00:58.829> off

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
they're right microsoft will show off

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
they're right microsoft will show off
gemini<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> code<00:01:00.210> name<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.449> their

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
gemini that's the code name for their

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.290 
gemini that's the code name for their
touch<00:01:01.680> first<00:01:02.190> version<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.760> office<00:01:03.090> for

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
touch first version of office for

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.900 
touch first version of office for
windows<00:01:03.860> specifically<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> new<00:01:05.489> windows

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
windows specifically for the new windows

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.350 
windows specifically for the new windows
modern<00:01:06.360> UI<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.070> will<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
modern UI so will you and I think the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.580 
modern UI so will you and I think the
reason<00:01:09.479> Microsoft<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> they

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
reason Microsoft will do that is they

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.020 
reason Microsoft will do that is they
want<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:10.920> sure<00:01:10.950> windows<00:01:11.310> folks<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:11.970> go

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
want to make sure windows folks don't go

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.270 
want to make sure windows folks don't go
what<00:01:12.299> him<00:01:12.420> wait<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> minute<00:01:13.170> how<00:01:13.920> could<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> do

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
what him wait a minute how could you do

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
what him wait a minute how could you do
this<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.460> iOS<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.390> give<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> us<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this for iOS and not give it to us so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
this for iOS and not give it to us so
and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.310> also<00:01:17.490> believe<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> joint

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and I also believe it's kind of joint

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.590 
and I also believe it's kind of joint
development<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.799> both<00:01:19.979> both<00:01:20.729> versions<00:01:21.060> come

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
development so both both versions come

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
development so both both versions come
from<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> same<00:01:21.990> code<00:01:22.350> base<00:01:22.380> yeah<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.909> I'm

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
from the same code base yeah so get I'm

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.010 
from the same code base yeah so get I'm
pretty<00:01:24.330> sure<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:24.810> happen

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pretty sure this is gonna happen

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.420 
pretty sure this is gonna happen
Thursday<00:01:25.530> whether<00:01:25.799> they'll<00:01:26.009> offer<00:01:26.250> it
