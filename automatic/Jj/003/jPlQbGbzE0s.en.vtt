00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 he 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.620
 and 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.720
 is honest yeah it is true that 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.110
 steps like that and stones that's 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.110
 true that it changes 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.020
 thank you so much 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.600
 alas much more today so the 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.220
 terrain was quite difficult but good 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.470
 we thought we would train those who did not 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 not played or played little and the others have 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.410
 do a six- hour scrub with 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.050
 some supporters that's nice 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.070
 despite the weather and we try to 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.900
 give a little show 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.530
 I hope we win against the countries 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.530
 down to make them happy 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.780
 of course we look at the performances 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.110
 who do and we all hope that they will 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.390
 to win 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.489
 so even if it's a friendly match it's 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.230
 against Brazil and more is always 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.129
 good games to play 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.810
 as always always has a very good 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.069
 atmosphere in France team hopes this 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.349
 is going well the first match we have 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.180
 won so that's for sure 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.190
 it's a good omen to continue like this 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.030
 we forget a little of what happened 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.940
 in Sweden 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.370
 and precisely to forget about samuel and 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.420
 invite to forget his good it will pass 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.420
 by parts of the results 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.490
 all over 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.980
 it's a lot 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.739
 you leave interview with 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.959
 channel 30 of the regional chain of three 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.409
 I know very well and then France 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.060
 3 champagne ardenne it's a small 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.780
 moment shared with the media is 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.400
 super nice and I have a little bit 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.799
 the habit so did well after too 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.660
 it's not good either I like it 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.400
 a little in the shade but that of time 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.400
 from time to time it's great fun 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.360
 so we have a session mostly based on 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.060
 games of great games but the essentials of 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.980
 the session will be to review one or two 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.770
 points found on the match of 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:56.300
 Latvia out of 50 with guards 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.060
 in other words, we reduce a little bit 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.520
 the space to focus a little bit 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.670
 plus the area we want 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.670
 to work 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.180
 it was intense we had 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.590
 worked first defensively and 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.840
 then offensively it will have to be 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.790
 ready we are getting ready for definitely 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.830
 take already taking the ground 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.900
 the basic because it may be at 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.520
 prepare and then it will have to be 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.260
 concentrated it makes it possible to see things 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.620
 is to take his automatisms wholesale 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.620
 matches that arrive
