power<00:00:48.660> bundle<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> Vitamix<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.039> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
power bundle like a Vitamix but this is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
power bundle like a Vitamix but this is
still<00:00:50.399> Jews<00:00:50.760> job<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:52.230> might<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> put

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
still Jews job and we might have to put

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
still Jews job and we might have to put
more<00:00:52.890> liquid<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.510> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
more liquid in it but that's what we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.750 
more liquid in it but that's what we
want<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.890> doesn't<00:00:56.280> sound<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
want to do now it doesn't sound like the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.160 
want to do now it doesn't sound like the
best<00:00:56.789> combination<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.629> sounds<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
best combination that sounds kind of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.569 
best combination that sounds kind of
weird<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.530> why<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> combination

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
weird and why would we do a combination

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
weird and why would we do a combination
like<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:01.140> people<00:01:01.559> don't<00:01:01.590> like

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
like this because most people don't like

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.390 
like this because most people don't like
to<00:01:01.859> wait<00:01:02.100> salad<00:01:02.940> greens<00:01:03.210> taste<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:03.750> themselves

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
to wait salad greens taste by themselves

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.580 
to wait salad greens taste by themselves
so<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.640> people<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.810> we're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so for people that don't like that we're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 
so for people that don't like that we're
going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> add<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.340> sweet<00:01:09.270> things<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.869> make

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

we're going to see how it goes so I'm
going<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.280> do<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.580> right<00:02:20.760> now<00:02:20.820> so

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
going to do that right now so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
going to do that right now so
essentially<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> blend<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
essentially have a blend of like this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.380 
essentially have a blend of like this
first<00:02:23.370> I'm<00:02:23.550> going<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.060> we're<00:02:24.210> going<00:02:24.300> to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
actually cut the Apple in really small

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
actually cut the Apple in really small
pieces<00:02:27.480> because<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> most<00:02:28.380> liquefied

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
pieces because it's the most liquefied

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.200 
pieces because it's the most liquefied
thing<00:02:29.100> we're<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.700> our<00:02:29.790> salad

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
today and it's best to have the liquid

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.770 
today and it's best to have the liquid
Fighting's<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.730> bottom<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.270> we<00:02:33.630> could

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
Fighting's on the bottom and we could

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.690 
Fighting's on the bottom and we could
always<00:02:33.960> add<00:02:34.080> more<00:02:34.110> liquid<00:02:34.470> later<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.580> we're

always add more liquid later so we're

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.580 
always add more liquid later so we're
going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.120> right<00:02:36.150> now<00:02:36.360> okay<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.350> the

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
food combining is this a good

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.000 
food combining is this a good
combination<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.830> best

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
combination it's not the best

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.250 
combination it's not the best
combination<00:03:35.600> everything<00:03:36.600> goes<00:03:36.780> well<00:03:37.019> with

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
combination everything goes well with

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.680 
combination everything goes well with
leafy<00:03:37.680> green<00:03:37.890> vegetables<00:03:38.540> bananas<00:03:39.540> and

leafy green vegetables bananas and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.300 
leafy green vegetables bananas and
apples<00:03:40.019> aren't<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.440> worst<00:03:40.590> combination<00:03:40.920> but

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
apples aren't the worst combination but

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.699 
apples aren't the worst combination but
when<00:03:41.459> you're<00:03:41.580> liquefying<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:43.230> combining

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
when you're liquefying it the combining

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.770 
when you're liquefying it the combining
doesn't<00:03:44.220> matter<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.700> much<00:03:44.730> as<00:03:45.239> when<00:03:45.660> you're

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
doesn't matter as much as when you're

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.630 
doesn't matter as much as when you're
eating<00:03:45.900> them<00:03:46.140> whole<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> good

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
eating them whole so this is a good

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.310 
eating them whole so this is a good
