on this side what if this house was

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.820 
on this side what if this house was
permanently<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.750> foundation<00:01:15.259> it's<00:01:15.710> going

to<00:01:15.890> be<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.979> foundation<00:01:16.250> eventually<00:01:16.789> but<00:01:16.909> what

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
to be a foundation eventually but what

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.359 
to be a foundation eventually but what
you<00:01:17.780> see<00:01:17.960> here<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.289> a<00:01:18.320> manifold<00:01:18.830> where<00:01:19.130> there's

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
you see here is a manifold where there's

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.910 
you see here is a manifold where there's
going<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.520> be<00:01:19.690> about<00:01:20.690> 60<00:01:21.229> hot<00:01:21.440> water<00:01:21.649> tubes

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
going to be about 60 hot water tubes

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.380 
going to be about 60 hot water tubes
these<00:01:22.069> going<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.250> generate<00:01:22.550> all<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:22.970> our<00:01:23.119> hot

these going to generate all of our hot
water<00:01:23.420> strictly<00:01:24.140> from<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.440> Sun<00:01:24.619> no<00:01:24.920> other

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
electricity involved okay and if you

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.320 
electricity involved okay and if you
look<00:01:29.840> up<00:01:29.960> top<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.950> see<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.550> under<00:01:31.819> under

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
look up top you see the under under

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.999 
look up top you see the under under
workings<00:01:33.050> of<00:01:33.140> some<00:01:33.289> of<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.440> solar<00:01:33.649> panels<00:01:33.920> are

there we have 51 DP solar panels each
putting<00:01:36.259> out<00:01:36.880> 175<00:01:37.880> watts<00:01:38.149> so<00:01:38.300> we're<00:01:38.659> talking

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
putting out 175 watts so we're talking
