00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
but it looks like it'll go back into

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.300

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
can see I'm repurposing it back into

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.970 
can see I'm repurposing it back into
that<00:01:50.660> look<00:01:51.660> at<00:01:51.840> how<00:01:51.900> pretty<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.440> colors<00:01:52.770> are

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
yes I might seem overly excited but it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.140 
yes I might seem overly excited but it's
always<00:02:00.390> cool<00:02:00.690> too<00:02:01.190> it's<00:02:02.190> just<00:02:02.370> very<00:02:02.610> strange

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
always cool too it's just very strange

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.430

when<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> play<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.050> so<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.290> got<00:02:04.410> a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
when you play with it so it's got a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.370 
when you play with it so it's got a
different<00:02:05.370> property<00:02:06.090> than<00:02:06.240> any<00:02:06.390> other<00:02:06.630> putty

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
different property than any other putty

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.800 
different property than any other putty
or<00:02:07.500> playdough<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.160> I've<00:02:08.280> ever<00:02:08.460> used<00:02:11.810> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
or playdough that I've ever used that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:22.630 
or playdough that I've ever used that
was<00:02:13.020> really<00:02:13.580> almost<00:02:14.580> grotesque<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.600> that

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.470 

Mars<00:02:23.640> mud<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.970> was<00:02:27.150> some<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> stuff

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
Mars mud so this was some of the stuff

that<00:02:27.720> was<00:02:27.959> stuck<00:02:28.200> around<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.590> edge<00:02:28.739> now<00:02:28.950> it's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that was stuck around the edge now it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.340 
that was stuck around the edge now it's
it's<00:02:29.970> almost<00:02:30.150> completely<00:02:30.720> back<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:30.989> being

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
it's almost completely back to being

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.990 
it's almost completely back to being
incorporated<00:02:37.310> look<00:02:38.310> at<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.670> rip

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
incorporated look at that you just rip
