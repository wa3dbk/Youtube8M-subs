00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.480
 Talk to me, folks, beauty today. I'm coming back. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.250
 here with another video of diablo 3 in that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 I would like to spend some time 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.519
 farm routes of gold and xp and to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.800
 people can do is this file 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.199
 I'm using here April 37 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.199
 rush that is well known by a monk 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.300
 but I had never brought her to the channel I 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.810
 I'll show her before you talk about 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 importance of it then opened 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 you're in a church is nothing more than you 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 you can use the storm foot 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.840
 infinitely then you can look 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.640
 here in my lower right corner that the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 my spirit and Linense low when 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.309
 use this skill then you can 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.320
 always use it in the game to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.500
 kill the enemies and to run too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.289
 for and faster on the farm beauty 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.180
 So we want to make this a bild of people. 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.879
 You'll need a two-handed weapon. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.640
 which has a low attack speed 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.530
 to reduce the consumption of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.189
 I recommend you use a 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.890
 score that gives you a pretty cool damage is 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.260
 one with regeneration of spirit that does not 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.299
 must necessarily be the radiance 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.390
 ina may be any one that has 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.850
 regeneration of spirit and also the ring 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.580
 I recommend using the stone 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.150
 jordan for the regeneration of spirit 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.850
 also build is to use 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.640
 passive of the path of the guardian who 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 will increase regeneration by 35%. 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.030
 exalted soul spirit to increase the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.110
 spirit and increase the generation and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.840
 one 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.270
 spirit per second and the song of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 resonance to increase to two 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.079
 of spirit per second 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.170
 these are the passive ones that you are going to 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.200
 to use is a mantra 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.270
 the mantra of healing with the street breathing of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.850
 circular that will increase the region are 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.740
 spirit by three per second and then 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.939
 you will see here in the inventory 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.060
 yours 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.399
 the regeneration of spirit becomes very 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.390
 high here in my case I'm almost 14 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.190
 14 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.459
 so you can use the feet of 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.639
 torment so exhaust the spirit never 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.590
 The build that I use for you is to go 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.739
 killing the fastest monsters and 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.620
 use you I recommend you to 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:27.670
 use here is changed but we will see 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.010
 Here aa deadly ability to reach 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.170
 street in anticipation the third blow and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.780
 increase all the damage you cause 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.180
 at 18% for 30 seconds 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.659
 so what will you do you will 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.849
 hit once on the welding bug will give 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.540
 a good fairy and you can use the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.760
 Storm pad is with giving higher then 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.799
 you will repeat this business of giving a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.049
 attack on monsters every 30 seconds 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.510
 for your damage it gets well good fado well 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.230
 interesting this strategy is another 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.030
 thing 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.609
 use the divine breath to give a 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.669
 buffet on all its damage and increases by 15% 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.370
 your damage so you can see that the 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:09.639
 booth you are giving is 15 more 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.159
 18 then of the 33% more damage to 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.750
 you use it on a storm foot as well 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.359
 It's going to be interesting to kill the beast. 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.509
 very easy 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.970
 I recommend using sharp winds 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.620
 which will give a constant damage there together 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.620
 with you with the cyclone student who 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.840
 My opinion is that it gives more damage and 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.239
 I also recommend that you use the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.489
 belt favoring dino not really 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.209
 just the belt plus a full set of ina 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.680
 for you to reduce the cost of the wind 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.750
 this being so you can 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.479
 use your spirit several times 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.790
 It will never end as you can see. 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.979
 even using the feet of torment 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.349
 using here together directir thing that 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.509
 you will not make your spirit will 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.400
 I fell very slowly I never missed 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:59.139
 spirit for you right 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.840
 and here it is is a defensive skill 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.169
 use serenity to get home in trouble 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.319
 remembering that this is a skill that the 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:11.590
 Staff Usually Uses MP Low On My 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.979
 case that I'm playing on mt 11 is me 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.199
 I think they emit a mp 0 at most mp2 is 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.269
 interesting to use you know why your 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.510
 character he becomes weak both in 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.830
 resistance in armature and in 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.150
 dana generally down a little of the year 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.389
 you know where you are so I recommend 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.050
 young mp bass not to die too much 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.000
 sure and basically is to know where then 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.389
 I will recommend that the places to 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.509
 You use this bild for 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.250
 both gold and xp at one step 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.169
 interesting that also if you 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.360
 intend to form xp nÃ© 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.729
 Of course you are a red rock 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.189
 it's one but if you're after a goal and 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.949
 put a green stone on your helmet 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:01.000
 that will increase so is the chance of 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.590
 Drop monsters in gold will help 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.400
 so the places that I recommend you 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.550
 depths of the strong 3rd level and 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.030
 followed by level 2 there is quite low 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.500
 density of monsters there is very high 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.719
 bridge hacks I also think it's a 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.389
 place that has enough monster for you 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.819
 kill and rescue crater both 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.509
 level 1 how level 2 also goes theme 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:28.789
 enough monsters for you to kill there 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:32.000
 then these places I think are the 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.069
 places that have more monsters and I think 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.129
 which are the places that are worth 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:39.050
 right then basically this is personal 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.060
 I left a little screen and showed a 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.800
 bit of my firm for you I hope 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.750

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.449
 video help to those who are looking for 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.180

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.550
