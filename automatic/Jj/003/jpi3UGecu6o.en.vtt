hello<00:00:04.270> today<00:00:04.720> we<00:00:04.840> are<00:00:04.930> gonna<00:00:05.050> do<00:00:05.260> a<00:00:05.290> tutorial

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
hello today we are gonna do a tutorial

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.019 
hello today we are gonna do a tutorial
on<00:00:06.010> summer<00:00:06.340> waters

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
on summer waters

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.470 
on summer waters
so<00:00:07.900> there<00:00:08.200> are<00:00:08.290> two<00:00:08.440> colors<00:00:08.680> on<00:00:09.010> Moodle<00:00:09.370> one<00:00:10.180> is

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
so there are two colors on Moodle one is

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.340 
so there are two colors on Moodle one is
a<00:00:11.380> full<00:00:12.309> rotation<00:00:12.520> which<00:00:13.000> can<00:00:13.240> go<00:00:13.420> all<00:00:13.690> 360

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
a full rotation which can go all 360

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.010 
a full rotation which can go all 360
degrees<00:00:14.379> and<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.940> other<00:00:16.209> one<00:00:16.480> goal-oriented

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
degrees and the other one goal-oriented

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.260 
degrees and the other one goal-oriented
is<00:00:17.470> like<00:00:17.710> this

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.290 

yeah<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:22.199> gonna<00:00:22.440> show<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.970> I'm<00:00:23.970> gonna<00:00:24.210> show

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
yeah I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.130 
yeah I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show
you<00:00:24.510> how<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.250> cell<00:00:26.250> model<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.390> both<00:00:27.930> are

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you how the cell model here and both are

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.909 
you how the cell model here and both are
done<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.529> much<00:00:28.680> move<00:00:29.610> they<00:00:30.270> work<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.080> pulses

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
done to do much move they work on pulses

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.210 
done to do much move they work on pulses
when<00:00:32.430> they're<00:00:33.059> below<00:00:33.720> 1.5<00:00:34.440> Nico

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
when they're below 1.5 Nico

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.460 
when they're below 1.5 Nico
anti-clockwise<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.970> now<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> above<00:00:36.870> 125

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
anti-clockwise and now and above 125

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.229 
anti-clockwise and now and above 125
they<00:00:37.680> go<00:00:37.860> clockwise<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.650> only<00:00:40.830> use

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
they go clockwise so we have only use

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
they go clockwise so we have only use
this<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.900> make<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:45.710> cross<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:47.430> clockwise<00:00:47.820> in

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
this to make the cross go clockwise in

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
this to make the cross go clockwise in
the<00:00:48.239> beginning<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.140> stop<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.400> go

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the beginning then stop and then go

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.979 
the beginning then stop and then go
anti-clockwise<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.980> one<00:00:52.980> part<00:00:53.339> now<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
anti-clockwise so one part now in the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.719 
anti-clockwise so one part now in the
range<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:56.030> 1<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.269> 1<00:00:57.420> point<00:00:57.720> 5<00:00:59.690> 1.4<00:01:01.430> 1.5<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
range of 1 and 1 point 5 1.4 1.5 and

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.299 
range of 1 and 1 point 5 1.4 1.5 and
suppose<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.360> below<00:01:03.720> 1.5<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.799> moves<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.190> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
suppose it's below 1.5 it moves in the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.910 
suppose it's below 1.5 it moves in the
anti-clockwise<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:06.450> 1.5<00:01:07.170> goes<00:01:07.409> clockwise

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
anti-clockwise about 1.5 goes clockwise

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.740 
anti-clockwise about 1.5 goes clockwise
at<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.820> point<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> slip<00:01:09.920> stationary<00:01:11.750> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
at one point I go to slip stationary so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
at one point I go to slip stationary so
the<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.500> servomotor<00:01:13.860> also<00:01:14.490> had<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> little

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the the servomotor also had a little

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.539 
the the servomotor also had a little
speed<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.900> change<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> speed<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.100> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
speed you can change the speed but it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.940 
speed you can change the speed but it
doesn't<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.180> very<00:01:18.479> flexible<00:01:18.720> fit<00:01:19.229> now

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
doesn't it's not very flexible fit now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.880 
doesn't it's not very flexible fit now
below<00:01:20.400> 1.5<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:22.650> 11.5<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> 1.6<00:01:24.679> there<00:01:25.679> is<00:01:25.859> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
below 1.5 to 11.5 to 1.6 there is a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.740 
below 1.5 to 11.5 to 1.6 there is a
change<00:01:26.219> in<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.909> change<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> speed<00:01:27.479> by

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
change in you can change the speed by

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
change in you can change the speed by
1.6<00:01:28.619> 1.7<00:01:29.270> 1/100<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.420> 1.9<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.950> tell<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
1.6 1.7 1/100 at 1.9 we can tell you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.380 
1.6 1.7 1/100 at 1.9 we can tell you
this<00:01:33.179> speed<00:01:33.539> remains<00:01:33.840> same<00:01:34.289> and<00:01:34.979> same<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
this speed remains same and same with a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.840 
this speed remains same and same with a
whisper<00:01:36.899> yeah<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> first

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
whisper yeah it will be in the first

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.529 
whisper yeah it will be in the first
place<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.630> then<00:01:40.499> in<00:01:40.859> the<00:01:40.979> same<00:01:41.189> way<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.359> know

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
place and then in the same way you know

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.840 
place and then in the same way you know
one<00:01:42.719> can<00:01:42.990> fight<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.789> wonderful

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
one can fight a wonderful

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.400 
one can fight a wonderful
and<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:48.370> slowly<00:01:49.900> creases<00:01:50.900> feet<00:01:51.170> and

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
and so on it slowly creases feet and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.910 
and so on it slowly creases feet and
then<00:01:51.650> once<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.280> is<00:01:52.310> at<00:01:53.260> 1.4<00:01:54.760> 1.3<00:01:55.760> 1.2<00:01:56.660> 1.1<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.380> 1

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
then once it is at 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 and 1

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.550 
then once it is at 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 and 1
are<00:01:58.610> pretty<00:01:59.300> much<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.690> same<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.800> first<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.280> so

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
are pretty much the same and first it so

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.060 
are pretty much the same and first it so
here<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.860> water<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.150> going<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.450> go<00:02:05.540> clockwise

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
here this water is going to go clockwise

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.609 
here this water is going to go clockwise
and<00:02:07.070> remain<00:02:07.820> stationary<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.660> then<00:02:09.380> go

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
and remain stationary and then go

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:31.610 
and remain stationary and then go
anti-clockwise<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.410 

and<00:02:32.620> developers<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.970> customer<00:02:37.390> is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
and developers so so the customer is

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.450 
and developers so so the customer is
Evan<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.930> will<00:02:38.080> be<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.320> left<00:02:38.500> my<00:02:38.830> left<00:02:39.160> mods

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
Evan it will be in the left my left mods

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.340 
Evan it will be in the left my left mods
program<00:02:40.180> while<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.690> right<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:41.020> are<00:02:41.050> going

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
program while in the right we are going

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.520 
program while in the right we are going
to<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.770> right<00:02:41.950> position<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:44.320> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
to be in the right position so in the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.100 
to be in the right position so in the
1.5<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.610> will<00:02:46.120> be<00:02:46.210> really<00:02:46.480> second<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.900> will<00:02:46.960> be

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
1.5 you will be really second it will be

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.410 
1.5 you will be really second it will be
right<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> middle<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.430> then<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:49.240> see

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
right in the middle and then you can see

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.770 
right in the middle and then you can see
there<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
there you can see that so the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.640 
there you can see that so the
millisecond<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:58.960> between<00:02:59.440> 125<00:03:00.010> 2<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.910> 1<00:03:01.650> will

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
millisecond in between 125 2 and 1 will

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.240 
millisecond in between 125 2 and 1 will
be<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.090> right<00:03:04.090> well<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.410> different<00:03:05.650> angle

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
be like right well in different angle

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.720 
be like right well in different angle
little<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.680> many<00:03:08.680> seconds<00:03:09.010> from<00:03:09.160> 1<00:03:09.280> /<00:03:09.430> 5<00:03:09.610> to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
little and many seconds from 1 / 5 to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.210 
little and many seconds from 1 / 5 to
toe<00:03:09.910> will<00:03:10.090> be<00:03:10.240> that<00:03:10.800> hangry

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
toe will be that hangry

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.540 
toe will be that hangry
so<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:15.100> basically<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.970> server<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:17.260> kind<00:03:17.620> is

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
so so basically the server this kind is

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.840 
so so basically the server this kind is
usually<00:03:19.030> used<00:03:19.300> for<00:03:19.450> some<00:03:20.380> robot<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.460> see<00:03:21.730> you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
usually used for some robot you see you

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.060 
usually used for some robot you see you
for<00:03:22.060> turning<00:03:22.300> red<00:03:22.720> usually<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:23.830> these

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
for turning red usually with these

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.420 
for turning red usually with these
motors

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.930 

Antoine<00:03:31.430> slowly<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.400> change<00:03:34.610> this<00:03:34.880> to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
Antoine slowly so you can change this to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.220 
Antoine slowly so you can change this to
prosper

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.350 

but<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:56.199 

I<00:03:46.420> know

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:05:05.910 

what

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.980
