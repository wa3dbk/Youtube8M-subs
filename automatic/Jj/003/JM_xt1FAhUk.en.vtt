 I'm doing another video tutorial on 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 bombing 2 in a very good game 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 had already done a tutorial where 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.740
 I used the game rangers program for you. 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.140
 play net and used crack 3 dm but 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.960
 is not being more so although many 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 still use only that you have a problem 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 3 gm crack is not I do not get it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.030
 I did not find anyone who has succeeded 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.530
 play with the pga player and angels i know 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.610
 new character is certain that he is already 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 on here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 although a lot of people are still young but 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.350
 we are now using the Tango is a 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.340
 another program you play on the network is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.340
 very good too 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 so I'll leave the links then you 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:15.540
 download the game ageles and nene and the links 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.439

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.790
 link of the torrent for you a good 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.860
 program for you to download files 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.290
 torrent right I'll leave a link in the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.520
 video description 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.820
 after you download the ring tone 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.979
 install you will download will enter nor 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.049
 quit here will download the game if you do not 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.990
 have a game you already have a game 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.579
 There is a problem 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 then you will also download using the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.119
 torrent problem 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.490
 the dlc edge in 2007 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.490
 already 1.2 point 2 and alice 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.330
 and then you're going to download the right tango 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.270
 I'm going to leave two links of tango 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.620
 may be to give only problem after that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.840
 tango, you also have to make a 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.450
 account just as well in creating an account 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.310
 but he did not resist think about it too 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
 7 there is no need to put a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 tutorial plus any questions can you 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.470
 ask then the torrent is this 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.330
 O program here 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.930
 You're seeing here. I do not think so. 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.930
 Nothing at the moment 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.920
 after you download and install the game 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.100
 follows the case is not reading if they install 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.050
 on disk to avoid when formatting has 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.810
 to install new exhibitors 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.440
 so I'll be here 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.600
 After you install the game you will 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:47.560
 will also install the dlc that is 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.910
 the ticket is only you run direct 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.170
 to the part where the game was installed 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.150
 When the game is over, 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.150
 Calm down for you to use 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.960
 It is very simple and practical then after 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.420
 if you create an account on tumblr it will go 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.630
 open the program right there will have installed 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:17.010
 the program will have created an account there 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.250
 counting open because you want to play here 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.250
 you go 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.900
 If you log on you're fine if you just 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.310
 sought by the game right has several games 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.340
 and far haas 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.800
 sometimes it is an agreement with the category but 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.390
 you can just type eg border 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.810
 of the aquino tram appears by the line of 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.730
 2 and several rooms in mode minus 21 c in 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.020
 Some are not fully full. 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.720
 enter here addressed in 2 that 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.500
 here you can complement 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.080
 add friends is also the advantage 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.580
 of this program over the river that 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.239
 You do not have to be adding networks. 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.610
 huh 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.220
 you enter a room and you are already in 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.870
 network with these people here 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.569
 I think I have no friends online no 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.110
 It also has a little bit after you 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.290
 enter the room, you're not ready for 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.959
 or create a room in a game or enter 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.850
 some I will not even minimize here I'll open the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.040
 game 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.620
 besides the two you will see that here in 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.620
 up will appear us right tim 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.449
 I hope a game I'm going to make an advance 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.190
 here guys come after you do not 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.150
 you have created you do not have any 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.699
 character is not 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.240
 if not create a character out in 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.620
 the whole story of the game was created 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.050
 the character 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.240
 then you could conceivably be internet or 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.120
 politicians but there's offline here you go 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.340
 fail to remember that much to you 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.270
 children room and the staff come in when 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.729
 you find only end of clips 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.789
 after changing the option here will have 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.860
 the rooms created by the clippers 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.360
 who are giving us the right 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.610
 people who were walking 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.610
 some took together they created know here 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.009
 then you have to work out you will only 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.889
 enter if you have the one in the 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:23.540

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.760
