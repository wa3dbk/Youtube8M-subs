you that you can reverse heart disease
on<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.929> your<00:00:16.020> experience<00:00:16.650> with

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
on this what is your experience with

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.490 
on this what is your experience with
with<00:00:17.670> working<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> studies<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
with working with the studies and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.370 
with working with the studies and
studying<00:00:19.949> heart<00:00:20.310> disease<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:22.050> know<00:00:22.170> what

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
studying heart disease is you know what

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.170 
studying heart disease is you know what
do<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.859> say<00:00:23.070> about<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.150> called

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
do you have to say about the so called

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.410 
do you have to say about the so called
cholesterol<00:00:25.109> myth<00:00:25.410> well<00:00:26.070> yeah<00:00:26.400> yeah<00:00:26.849> paleo

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
cholesterol myth well yeah yeah paleo

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.410 
cholesterol myth well yeah yeah paleo
again<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> another<00:00:28.670> another<00:00:29.670> myth<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:32.420> you've

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
again is another another myth and you've

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.840 
again is another another myth and you've
got<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.809> always<00:00:34.500> go<00:00:34.680> back<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.130> outcomes<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
got to always go back to outcomes and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 
got to always go back to outcomes and
research<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> no<00:00:37.739> outcomes<00:00:38.160> in

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
research and there is no outcomes in

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.690 
research and there is no outcomes in
research<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.540> prove<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.160> man<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
research when that to prove that man and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.650 
research when that to prove that man and
evolution<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.320> millions<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.040> years<00:00:44.250> ago

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
evolution you know millions of years ago

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.240 
evolution you know millions of years ago
might<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.809> tried<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> sustain<00:00:47.039> themselves

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
might have tried to sustain themselves

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.860 
might have tried to sustain themselves
with<00:00:47.969> some<00:00:48.300> meat<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> addition<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> their

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
with some meat in addition to their

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.369 
with some meat in addition to their
vegetation<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.770> were<00:00:52.829> eating<00:00:54.379> hardly

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
vegetation that they were eating hardly

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.310 
vegetation that they were eating hardly
proves<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.860> point<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.690> I'm<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:58.109> sure

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
proves the point because I'm not sure

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.689 
proves the point because I'm not sure
many<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.680> us<00:00:58.770> would<00:00:58.949> wanna<00:00:59.129> lives<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
many of us would wanna lives of a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
many of us would wanna lives of a
maximum<00:01:00.180> age<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.570> 28<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.050> 29<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.309> we

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
maximum age of 28 or 29 which is what we

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.690 
maximum age of 28 or 29 which is what we
had<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.820> then<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> other<00:01:06.840> problem

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
had back then and the other problem

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.160 
had back then and the other problem
besides<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.119> fact<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.450> paleo<00:01:09.900> has

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
besides the fact that paleo has

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
besides the fact that paleo has
absolutely<00:01:10.650> no<00:01:10.740> research<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.760> us

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
absolutely no research if they want us

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.539 
absolutely no research if they want us
to<00:01:12.030> eat<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.420> mean<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> imagine<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.950> idea<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
to eat I mean just imagine the idea of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789 
to eat I mean just imagine the idea of
putting<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.210> dead<00:01:15.509> flesh<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.170> your

putting all this dead flesh and your

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
assistance it's no wonder with almost

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.560 
assistance it's no wonder with almost
all<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> diseases<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.210> they're

common chronic killing diseases are made

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.480 
common chronic killing diseases are made
worse<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.409> put<00:01:25.710> dead<00:01:25.950> flesh<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.460> your

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
against cancer but they were looking

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420 
against cancer but they were looking
particularly<00:02:08.640> at<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.830> heart<00:02:10.830> disease<00:02:11.160> and

particularly at the heart disease and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.760 
particularly at the heart disease and
they<00:02:12.270> found<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.989> patients<00:02:13.230> who<00:02:13.560> are

was<00:03:11.700> interesting<00:03:11.970> when<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.810> research<00:03:13.170> came

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
was interesting when this research came

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.890 
was interesting when this research came
out<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:14.700> was<00:03:14.910> interesting<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.450> read<00:03:15.720> an

vice president of the paleo association

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.420 
vice president of the paleo association
was<00:03:21.090> informed<00:03:21.720> with<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.020> research<00:03:22.440> her

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
was informed with this research her

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.820 
was informed with this research her
response<00:03:23.880> was<00:03:24.290> yes<00:03:26.660> yeah<00:03:27.660> wow<00:03:28.050> that's

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
response was yes yeah wow that's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.330 
response was yes yeah wow that's
interesting<00:03:29.690> it's<00:03:30.690> such<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> validation<00:03:31.470> yeah

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
interesting it's such a validation yeah

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.840 
interesting it's such a validation yeah
but<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> plant-based<00:03:33.390> approach
