00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.690 
fantastic I hope these films get
eyeballs<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:06.560> know<00:02:06.679> we<00:02:06.859> make<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.069> lot<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.280> films

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
eyeballs you know we make a lot of films

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.020 
eyeballs you know we make a lot of films
for<00:02:07.880> women<00:02:08.319> we<00:02:09.319> do<00:02:09.560> get<00:02:09.799> in<00:02:10.039> interesting<00:02:10.819> meaty

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
for women we do get in interesting meaty

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.809 
for women we do get in interesting meaty
roles<00:02:11.330> at<00:02:11.510> times<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.260> eyeballs<00:02:12.769> are<00:02:13.099> few

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
roles at times but the eyeballs are few

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.270 
roles at times but the eyeballs are few
so<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:14.690> something<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.620> think<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
so that's something that I think the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.420 
so that's something that I think the
audience<00:02:16.790> needs<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.330> open<00:02:17.510> up<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.440> if

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
audience needs to open up to that and if

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
audience needs to open up to that and if
these<00:02:19.670> films<00:02:20.000> are<00:02:20.120> not<00:02:20.299> encouraged<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.200> not

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
these films are not encouraged and not

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.770 
these films are not encouraged and not
watched<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:22.549> will<00:02:22.819> get<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.180> see<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> women

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
watched so you will get to see the women

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.600 
watched so you will get to see the women
doing<00:02:23.900> lesser<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.470> lesser<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.220> happens

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
doing lesser and lesser that happens

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.430 
doing lesser and lesser that happens
most<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> time<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.540> that's<00:02:26.959> all<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.200> have<00:02:27.349> to
