of<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:00.750> size<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.349> would<00:04:01.500> be<00:04:01.650> forever

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
of this size and I would be forever

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.420

banging<00:04:02.790> my<00:04:02.940> head<00:04:02.970> on<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.720> ceiling<00:04:04.250> but<00:04:05.250> it's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
banging my head on the ceiling but it's

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.830 
banging my head on the ceiling but it's
actually<00:04:05.760> incredibly<00:04:06.120> comfortable<00:04:06.599> all<00:04:06.810> the
