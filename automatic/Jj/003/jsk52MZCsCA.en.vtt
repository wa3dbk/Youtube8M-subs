the better decklist in foreign sectors
the<00:00:18.270> guy<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:19.100> everyone<00:00:20.100> thought<00:00:20.369> was<00:00:20.520> crazy

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the guy that everyone thought was crazy

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000 
the guy that everyone thought was crazy
at<00:00:21.210> first<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.810> running<00:00:22.109> three<00:00:22.500> hopper<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
at first for running three hopper and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
at first for running three hopper and
three<00:00:23.340> zette<00:00:23.970> caliber<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:25.199> Jack<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
three zette caliber that Jack is

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
three zette caliber that Jack is
actually<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.340> consistent<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.119> you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
actually really consistent if you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.330 
actually really consistent if you
haven't<00:00:27.420> tested<00:00:27.570> against<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.170> test<00:00:29.070> against

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
haven't tested against it test against

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
haven't tested against it test against
is<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:29.939> powerful<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.869> reason<00:00:31.170> why<00:00:31.289> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
is really powerful the reason why is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.500 
is really powerful the reason why is
I've<00:00:31.740> actually<00:00:31.949> looked<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:32.880> hopper<00:00:33.149> before

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I've actually looked at hopper before

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.450 
I've actually looked at hopper before
and<00:00:33.719> said<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> good<00:00:34.230> card<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:35.070> caliber<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and said it's a good card that caliber I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
and said it's a good card that caliber I
can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.790> why<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.940> run<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> good<00:00:37.770> card

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
can see why you run it it is a good card

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.490 
can see why you run it it is a good card
and<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.550> plus<00:00:38.790> still<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.290> don't

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and it's a plus still so on but I don't

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
and it's a plus still so on but I don't
exactly<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> card<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.760> i<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.940> like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
exactly like the card but i do like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.560 
exactly like the card but i do like
hopper<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.110> reason<00:00:43.410> why<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> being<00:00:43.920> hopper

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
hopper the reason why is being hopper

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
hopper the reason why is being hopper
when<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.719> equipped<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.500> first<00:00:46.710> turn<00:00:47.010> um

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
when it's equipped it's a first turn um

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.389 
when it's equipped it's a first turn um
searcher<00:00:48.500> what<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> does<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.070> when<00:00:50.250> it's

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
searcher what it does is when it's

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
searcher what it does is when it's
equipped<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.899> send<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
equipped it you can send it to the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.319 
equipped it you can send it to the
graveyard<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.399> sent<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.090> in

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
graveyard and your that sent it that in

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.229 
graveyard and your that sent it that in
Sector<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> attack<00:00:55.079> directly<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.039> turn<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Sector can attack directly that turn the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.029 
Sector can attack directly that turn the
reason<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.829> sort

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
reason it's good is because it can sort

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
reason it's good is because it can sort
out<00:00:59.160> horn<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.520> from<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.789> deck<00:01:00.020> how<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.199> does

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
out horn it from your deck how it does

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.390 
out horn it from your deck how it does
this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.739> unless<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.699> start<00:01:03.180> off<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.480> turn

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
this is unless you start off first turn

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
this is unless you start off first turn
and<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.760> go<00:01:05.880> first<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.659> even<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> have

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and you go first so even if you have

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.600 
and you go first so even if you have
horn<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.040> hand<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.490> have

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
horn in your hand you know you have

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910 
horn in your hand you know you have
nothing<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.970> pop<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.960> let's<00:01:10.260> say<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.409> normal

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
nothing to pop so let's say you normal

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.980 
nothing to pop so let's say you normal
summon<00:01:11.130> dragonfly<00:01:11.549> activate<00:01:12.030> effect<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
summon dragonfly activate effect and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.380 
summon dragonfly activate effect and
your<00:01:13.110> opponents<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.119> don't<00:01:15.119> think

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
your opponents to me like I don't think

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.700 
your opponents to me like I don't think
I'm<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.509> Baylor<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.049> no<00:01:16.439> I'm<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
I'm gonna Baylor that no I'm not a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399 
I'm gonna Baylor that no I'm not a
bailar<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.479> doesn't<00:01:19.259> matter

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
bailar and then because doesn't matter

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.590 
bailar and then because doesn't matter
to<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.860> horny<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.790> okay<00:01:21.060> well<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.450> can

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
to get horny it's like okay well I can

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.010 
to get horny it's like okay well I can
get<00:01:21.780> rid<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.340> equip<00:01:24.020> hopper

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
get rid of it so then you equip hopper

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.800 
get rid of it so then you equip hopper
and<00:01:25.170> they're<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.500> huh<00:01:26.070> look<00:01:26.759> crap<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.390> then

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and they're like huh look crap and then

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.999 
and they're like huh look crap and then
they<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.020> hopper<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.430> send<00:01:29.670> hopper<00:01:30.000> which

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
they go hopper so they send hopper which

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.050 
they go hopper so they send hopper which
dragonfly<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.159> attack<00:01:32.400> directly<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.880> term

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
dragonfly can attack directly that term

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.429 
dragonfly can attack directly that term
but<00:01:33.270> since<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.570> can't<00:01:33.720> attack<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.170> part

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
but since it can't attack that part

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289 
but since it can't attack that part
doesn't<00:01:34.619> matter<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.369> part<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.670> matters<00:01:35.880> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
doesn't matter the part that matters is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
doesn't matter the part that matters is
dragonflies<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.229> special<00:01:37.710> centipede

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
dragonflies and then special centipede

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.990 
dragonflies and then special centipede
then<00:01:38.820> centipede<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:40.259> equip<00:01:40.950> hopper<00:01:41.280> send<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
then centipede can equip hopper send and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.170 
then centipede can equip hopper send and
then<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.659> search<00:01:43.229> Hornet<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.950> your<00:01:44.070> hand<00:01:44.340> or

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
then you search Hornet to your hand or

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
then you search Hornet to your hand or

Baylor effect veiler is run actually
this<00:02:44.340> run<00:02:44.580> less<00:02:44.910> now<00:02:45.150> than<00:02:47.690> usual<00:02:48.690> which<00:02:49.110> is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
this run less now than usual which is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.530 
this run less now than usual which is
hard<00:02:49.740> because<00:02:49.830> that's<00:02:50.490> how<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.940> sectors<00:02:51.240> sneak

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
hard because that's how in sectors sneak

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.180 
hard because that's how in sectors sneak
under<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.870> radar<00:02:52.050> because<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> people<00:02:52.860> less

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
under the radar because the people less

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.730 
under the radar because the people less
people<00:02:53.460> remaining<00:02:54.320> Baylor's<00:02:55.320> their

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
remaining max three max easy because

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.460 
remaining max three max easy because
they're<00:02:57.630> afraid<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:58.520> dinos<00:02:59.520> and<00:03:00.080> wind<00:03:01.080> ups<00:03:01.320> and

they're afraid of dinos and wind ups and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.900 
they're afraid of dinos and wind ups and
that's<00:03:01.800> how<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.040> sectors<00:03:02.370> sneak<00:03:02.610> under<00:03:02.730> the

that's how in sectors sneak under the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.850 
that's how in sectors sneak under the
radar<00:03:03.090> because<00:03:03.540> less<00:03:04.350> people<00:03:04.380> our<00:03:04.680> main

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.560 
decking veiler or just making one copy
and<00:03:07.290> it's<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.950> hard<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.550> decide<00:03:08.880> how<00:03:09.510> many

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
and it's really hard to decide how many

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.930 
and it's really hard to decide how many
two<00:03:09.930> main<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:10.530> baylor<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.520> not<00:03:11.730> good

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
two main that because baylor is not good

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.820 
two main that because baylor is not good
against<00:03:12.180> dino<00:03:12.540> rabbit<00:03:12.960> it's<00:03:13.290> okay<00:03:13.590> against

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
against dino rabbit it's okay against

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.440 
against dino rabbit it's okay against
wind<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.520> great<00:03:14.730> against<00:03:15.000> detectors

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
wind up and it's great against detectors

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.110 
wind up and it's great against detectors
but<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.560> plan<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.280> more<00:03:17.430> dino<00:03:17.670> rabbit

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
but if you plan to see more dino rabbit

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.150 
but if you plan to see more dino rabbit
then<00:03:18.840> you're<00:03:19.050> going<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.290> put<00:03:19.500> more<00:03:19.620> mac<00:03:19.800> season

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
then you're going to put more mac season

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.790 
then you're going to put more mac season
because<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.460> better<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.150> that's<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.800> dilemma

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800

another thing that i like is smashing

another thing that i like is smashing
ground<00:05:05.030> reason<00:05:05.660> being<00:05:05.690> is<00:05:06.020> sometimes<00:05:06.500> you

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
ground reason being is sometimes you

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.740 
ground reason being is sometimes you
just<00:05:07.190> can't<00:05:07.310> get<00:05:07.669> over<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.970> centipede<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.600> a

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
just can't get over a centipede and a

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.180 
just can't get over a centipede and a
dragonfly<00:05:09.169> like<00:05:09.380> you'd<00:05:09.560> only<00:05:09.710> summon<00:05:10.040> one

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
dragonfly like you'd only summon one

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.950 
dragonfly like you'd only summon one
monster<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.760> that's<00:05:11.180> really<00:05:11.419> bad<00:05:11.600> for<00:05:11.840> you

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
monster and that's really bad for you

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.960 
monster and that's really bad for you
but<00:05:12.860> if<00:05:12.980> you<00:05:13.070> can<00:05:13.220> get<00:05:13.400> past<00:05:13.430> both<00:05:13.820> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
but if you can get past both the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.300 
but if you can get past both the
monsters<00:05:14.330> then<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.380> know<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:15.830> stand<00:05:16.220> a

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
monsters then you know you stand a

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.460 
monsters then you know you stand a
better<00:05:16.340> chance<00:05:16.520> also<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.510> side<00:05:17.780> cyber<00:05:18.050> dragon

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
better chance also a side cyber dragon

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.130 
better chance also a side cyber dragon
for<00:05:18.950> one<00:05:19.610> cyber<00:05:19.880> dragon<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.540> somewhat<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
for one cyber dragon this somewhat the

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.740 
for one cyber dragon this somewhat the
same<00:05:21.169> reason<00:05:21.740> but<00:05:22.280> also<00:05:22.460> because<00:05:22.790> some<00:05:23.540> time

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
same reason but also because some time

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.840 
same reason but also because some time
they're<00:05:24.710> allowed<00:05:24.740> let's<00:05:25.460> say<00:05:25.550> they<00:05:25.700> go

two<00:05:28.910> cards<00:05:29.060> attack<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:29.660> then<00:05:29.930> they

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
two cards attack and then they

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.680 
two cards attack and then they
exceedances<00:05:31.520> endings<00:05:31.910> just<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:34.690> protect

exceedances endings just to protect

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.850 
exceedances endings just to protect
themselves<00:05:35.900> because<00:05:36.380> they<00:05:36.470> have<00:05:36.560> no<00:05:36.680> back
