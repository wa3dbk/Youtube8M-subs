00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 you have to be waved through but 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.970
 jefferson farfan in his own sixteenth 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.139
 after a standard situation how many times 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.139
 did you experience that at the moment ? 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.800
 not often 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.570
 as attacks than ever 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.929
 but they bravado I wanted 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.929
 you can tell that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.619
 to have 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.800
 first corner and then just under 20 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.800
 minutes 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.630
 and from the world the heating oil by bastian 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.760
 schweinsteiger 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.760
 stand under the ball 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.970
 corners and aqua dollar boni corners 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.140
 shot barcelona but you look 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.530
 That's great when I do that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.530
 see correctly 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.890
 that's the way it is 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.640
 if middleman in his own bar 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.979
 amount 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.840
 black makes it great that he has the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.000
 ball still takes seriously as 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 before at the origin this is the high 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 art 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.300
 but also there was a lot of blocked 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.740
 for that is simply the disadvantage if 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.290
 man against man plays 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.340
 standard situations 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.340
 It is always the risk that you enter 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.390
 gladbach has guardiola break but short 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 eck played 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.000
 if painting 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.000
 how was I so great 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.000
 Russia on the way 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.750
 or diary has schweinsteiger 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.619
 so bastian schweinsteiger for many 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.429
 surprisingly today in addition to raab also with 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.289
 lamb so midler on the place tells 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.000
 his first Bundesliga goal of the 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.000
 even and injured 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.530
 alaba ribéry 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.530
 no offside 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.470
 mandzukic 22 that is 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.260
 Not 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.230
 from Schalke 04 and not just two 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.709
 minutes to the office 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.709
 machu picchu 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.170
 that was terribly easy 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.319
 Schalke complained off alaba kicks 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.330
 The ball is great there is not martin 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.330
 on the man and I moved inwards 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.830
 98 seconds what exactly can you do there 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.730
 do not end in the meantime 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.390
 defender and fullback 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.390
 I have to move back 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.260
 Dennis aogo may also have the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.129
 possibility of closing the gap 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.030
 a depressing and as you can see it is 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.030
 own storm peak 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.720
 schweinsteiger now thomas miller so 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.840
 the warm up all the time 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.470
 must therefore who the eyes 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.470
 knows a little 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.600
 He knows what could come next 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.210
 but 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.210
 this is the bank of the bavaria 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.690
 ulrich 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.720
 so far has not torn so much 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.580
 but the pass from schweinsteiger panama 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.910
 march and not to ribery 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.910
 home 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.420
 which of course you are important 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.769
 Westbahn struggles but that is there 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.629
 Rear is not his core business 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.590
 We are now on the fight 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:08.099
 with heart continued until well with everything was 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.099
 or something over 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.389
 just given up 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.519
 and alaba has the quality and 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.400
 but soon it will not be right anymore 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.940
 again 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.940
 the beautiful game is not aloof müller 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.940
 miller 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.310
 müller future future albeit at 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.620
 knife itself there is no one like that 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.720
 Strange football plays like me 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.150
 also he has all good the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.060
 claim the ball down there and then 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.070
 he waited for 40 expected 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.160
 there is no ball lost that either 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.840
 is a property is a quality 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.910
 via twitter 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.000
 the device is already in the pass 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.500
 Of course, he was great, but he was good too 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.240
 rather be nice because the Schalke of course 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.240
 in the forward movement are all 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.760
 and now it will be clear 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.760
 a gate the bayern the table guide 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.960
 and you predicted the 2 the 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.450
 now comes in from the outside 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.790
 the whole table has to be watched 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.790
 own team and now that
