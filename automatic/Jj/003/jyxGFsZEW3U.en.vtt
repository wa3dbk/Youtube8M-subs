00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.299
 mio sbh can prepare an espresso 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.799
 here above the lock lever is the 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.140
 must be opened 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.570
 then take the hamburger mio capsule 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.900
 that looks like it fits up here too 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.080
 encapsulate we linger in the bay the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.650
 closed lever close something goes 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.859
 heavy 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.360
 then you have the drain down here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.969
 that's pretty much a distance 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 there you can turn that around and then 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.649
 your speaker cup is a little higher 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.620
 then to start the test completely 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.670
 just here 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.379

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.340

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.490

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.880
 you can see that in this machine 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.880
 relatively slow 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.650
 that lasts until we touch them 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.650
 is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.140
 The machine does not stop either 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.869
 automatically this means you have to stay here 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.750
 press this button once 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 stop letter process 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 then the espresso is basically ready 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.390
 That's how it looks then 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.340
