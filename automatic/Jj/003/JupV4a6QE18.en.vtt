something to keep in mind and where you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.069 
something to keep in mind and where you
place<00:03:50.150> those<00:03:50.480> doors<00:03:51.069> like<00:03:52.569> when<00:03:53.569> you<00:03:53.659> build<00:03:53.900> a

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.830 
place those doors like when you build a
house<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:55.250> can<00:03:55.519> build<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.329> rooms<00:03:56.599> as

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
house so you can build the rooms as

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.539 
house so you can build the rooms as
tight<00:03:57.079> together<00:03:57.290> as<00:03:57.680> possible<00:03:58.340> so

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
tight together as possible so

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.449 
tight together as possible so
everything's<00:03:58.940> close<00:03:59.299> together<00:03:59.659> as<00:03:59.780> possible
