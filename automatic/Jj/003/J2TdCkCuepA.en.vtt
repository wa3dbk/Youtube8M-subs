scrub<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.869> I<00:01:59.929> keep<00:02:00.139> this<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:00.439> my<00:02:00.529> shower

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
scrub and I keep this in my shower

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.419 
scrub and I keep this in my shower
because<00:02:01.130> i<00:02:01.279> only<00:02:01.429> use<00:02:01.670> my<00:02:01.909> scrub<00:02:02.270> at<00:02:02.450> night<00:02:02.749> and

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
because i only use my scrub at night and

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.099 
because i only use my scrub at night and
the<00:02:04.429> reason<00:02:04.579> for<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.969> is<00:02:05.209> because<00:02:05.240> i'll<00:02:05.929> use

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
the reason for that is because i'll use

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.870

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
so it looks like but the reason why I

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.990 
so it looks like but the reason why I
haven't<00:02:51.920> been<00:02:52.070> using<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.489> lately<00:02:52.850> is

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
haven't been using this lately is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.570 
haven't been using this lately is
because<00:02:53.170> since<00:02:54.170> I'm<00:02:54.320> pregnant<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:54.980> can't<00:02:55.310> use

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
because since I'm pregnant I can't use

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.180 
because since I'm pregnant I can't use
salicylic<00:02:56.239> acid<00:02:56.810> because<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.739> form<00:02:58.040> of

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
salicylic acid because it's a form of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.800 
salicylic acid because it's a form of
aspirin<00:02:58.760> that's<00:02:58.970> what<00:02:59.090> oh<00:02:59.269> that's<00:02:59.510> what<00:02:59.660> cell

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
aspirin that's what oh that's what cell

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.100 
aspirin that's what oh that's what cell
is<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.050> like<00:03:00.200> acid<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.800> it's<00:03:01.069> actually<00:03:01.190> aspirin

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
is so like acid is it's actually aspirin

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.840 
is so like acid is it's actually aspirin
so<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.440> use<00:03:03.620> aspirin<00:03:04.069> you<00:03:04.519> can't<00:03:04.730> take

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
so you can use aspirin you can't take

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.880 
so you can use aspirin you can't take
aspirin<00:03:05.300> or<00:03:05.480> use<00:03:05.930> anything<00:03:06.380> with<00:03:06.620> salicylic

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890

with<00:04:55.250> this<00:04:55.400> theorem<00:04:55.730> is<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.420> kind<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.990> leaves<00:04:57.170> a

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
with this theorem is it kind of leaves a

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.400 
with this theorem is it kind of leaves a
little<00:04:57.590> bit<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:57.980> tacky<00:04:58.280> finish<00:04:58.910> so<00:04:59.690> you<00:05:00.170> have

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
little bit of a tacky finish so you have

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.770 
little bit of a tacky finish so you have
to<00:05:00.590> give<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:01.010> about<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.640> minute<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.090> actually

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
to give it about a minute to actually

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.460

soak in and absorb into your skin um

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.020 
soak in and absorb into your skin um
