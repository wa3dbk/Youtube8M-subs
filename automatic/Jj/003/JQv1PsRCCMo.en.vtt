00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 but in the sense if I have that with a 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.319
 descent all schuss to you can on 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.720
 the other side of the Coupe de France de 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.160
 mountain bike at super besse disturbed also by 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.670
 weather conditions at home 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.769
 the ovaries link to the beautiful victory brier 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 of laurentian laurentian laurea laura 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.690
 charles saturday in cross-country podium 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 also for christophe may guard 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 it was the place to the descenders with the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.250
 very spectacular test of the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.260
 descent 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 report of sÃ©bastien who admits Eric 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 touch go to the top for 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.650
 Jerome and Arthur the sporting destiny of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.450
 these Auvergnats is played today are 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 as much of sancy they will not be entitled 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.110
 only at one attempt of the coup 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.190
 a few hours before the big descent 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.579
 it's time to do some 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.579
 trails 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.370
 but while the competition is on the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.710
 to begin the Super Besse salt 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.980
 darkened weather that changes the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.410
 gives to cover them with the adet bear of 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.630
 adapt the track has evolved with the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.059
 rain and especially the departure was 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.500
 down to about midway so the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.070
 conditions were too bad on the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.620
 top of the track 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.600
 so we'll see that with curves over 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.410
 minutes less than this morning and that 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.210
 yesterday so will adapt and to wildlife 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.619
 without taking too much risk 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.810
 on their floor floors the passage of 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.130
 more technical and how not too much 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.170
 take risks while being 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.640
 effective both of us Auvergnats are 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.940
 Pros know the answer he make 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.600
 hands trajectory take rest 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.340
 Is it enough 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.490
 that's what will make the difference and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.500
 not its members and actually the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.360
 300 m of altitude difference were difficult to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.920
 negotiate for some of the 320 pilots 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.090
 in the running then watch out for the fall 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.429
 the big problem for them is that they 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.450
 are trained on a dry track this 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.740
 weekend 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.600
 and there they will leave in a track that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.819
 do not know about them 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.550
 fall they are are everywhere so 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.410
 it'll be interesting to watch and 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.060
 could be very hard for both of us 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 auvergnats finalists the change of the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.450
 course and wet land had 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.750
 because of them he owed the first 15 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.520
 seats 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.730
 eventually they will have to settle for 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.130
 to rank in the top 30 and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.990
 minus one in pay dust problem 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.000
 in this is not the case for endurists 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.290
 in the cantal a lot of heat and 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 then poor dust
