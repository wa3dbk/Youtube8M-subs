00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
I was sick as a little kid I would read

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
I was sick as a little kid I would read
the<00:00:19.800> series<00:00:20.189> until<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.670> got<00:00:20.820> better<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.449> I've

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the series until I got better so I've

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.720 
the series until I got better so I've
read<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> first<00:00:22.800> couple<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.189> books<00:00:23.340> more

read the first couple of books more
times<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.359> should<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.630> allowed<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.260> think

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
times that should be allowed I think

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.189

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
are lower amounts of course because they

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.560 
are lower amounts of course because they
were<00:00:32.160> released<00:00:32.520> later<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.510> know

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
what it is about my generation is just

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
what it is about my generation is just
special<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.850> us<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.570> grew<00:00:36.870> up

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
special for us because we grew up

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.860 
special for us because we grew up
alongside<00:00:37.440> Harry<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.430> started<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> series<00:00:39.629> at

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
alongside Harry I started the series at

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.110 
alongside Harry I started the series at
the<00:00:39.899> same<00:00:40.320> exact<00:00:40.710> age<00:00:40.920> Harry<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.430> 10<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:41.940> 11

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the same exact age Harry was 10 or 11

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.529 
the same exact age Harry was 10 or 11
and<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.620> read<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> books<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and then I read the books and I just

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
and then I read the books and I just
grew<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.110> him<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> every<00:00:47.010> year<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.489> was

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
grew with him and every year there was

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.479 
grew with him and every year there was
another<00:00:47.820> book<00:00:48.090> released<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.890> it<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.309> think

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
another book released and it was I think

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.060 
another book released and it was I think
that's<00:00:51.030> why<00:00:51.270> my<00:00:51.690> generation<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.949> was

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that's why my generation and I was

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.619

the order of the Phoenix but I really

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.729 
the order of the Phoenix but I really
like<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> students<00:02:10.379> finally

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
like it because the students finally

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.820 
like it because the students finally
take<00:02:10.920> their<00:02:11.039> education<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830

their<00:02:11.950> own<00:02:12.070> hands<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.640> they<00:02:13.450> realized<00:02:13.900> that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
their own hands and they realized that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.740 
their own hands and they realized that
if<00:02:14.350> they<00:02:14.650> are<00:02:15.040> going<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.660> education
