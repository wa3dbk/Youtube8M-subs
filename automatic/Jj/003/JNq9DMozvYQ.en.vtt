00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 we are from the painting and would like 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.960
 Today imagine the big trampoline 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 we find that very convenient and we can 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.110
 to make many points in 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.540
 different sizes 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.210
 if you get the rings out of this pack 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.490
 All the very good ones go out very well 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.330
 put together here is colored and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.970
 to distinguish 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 I bring the different sizes 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.660
 Start with the blue ring and take 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 them apart 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 as you can see party ring no pattern 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 This one has these three wells 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.980
 bring 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 we take these two rings together 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 with the pattern inside and legs 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.309
 should look outward 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.379
 I prepared the role and stuff 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.379
 fine as now to move 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.000
 too long is this half right 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.640
 is full 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.560
 I already have one prepared and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.710
 show yourselves to my now finished hall 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.909
 bring it look like we are very happy 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 here is the thread 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.500
 you can not and the thread with the not 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.649
 slips me through 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.869
 so had attached so now comes 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.869
 the next step we put this 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.390
 two parts together and that's how you 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.630
 have this here and there comes this fusion 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630
 on 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.020
 even here it is still good 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.530
 through the relationship here 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.420
 once these threads do not bother us 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 directly we suffer with a good scissors 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.369
 here along our beloved clouds 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.920
 in the meantime I have one 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.320
 Wool thread prepared I would say 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.130
 which can be 30 to 40 centimeters long 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.270
 or longer with those I fix 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.280
 now our pompom 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.280
 I prefer this wolf have around here 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.930
 and knot tight 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.290
 best secure the knot again 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.870
 Now I put the pump on where they are 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:10.480
 they are put together 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.480
 just pulled apart another side 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.370
 one always looks up and so ready 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.170
 the fail thee here long standing 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.170
 they could just pull out and 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.430
 just moderately fast in me 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.750
 a good afternoon 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.700
 maybe you would like to join the profession 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.820
 bit the cock when to rub 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.590
 distribute the woolen threads already and then 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.590
 we can start cutting 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.630
 yes that was for the we have here 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.630
 not worth our pompous
