okay welcome to the Crowe show I have a
real<00:00:23.950> interesting<00:00:24.220> clip<00:00:24.610> here<00:00:24.850> I<00:00:24.880> was<00:00:25.600> driving

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
real interesting clip here I was driving

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.630 
real interesting clip here I was driving
out<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.350> get<00:00:26.590> some<00:00:26.770> grub<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.130> other<00:00:27.250> day<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.580> I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
out to get some grub the other day and I

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.279 
out to get some grub the other day and I
looked<00:00:27.850> up<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.150> I<00:00:28.240> thought<00:00:28.270> oh<00:00:28.630> they've<00:00:28.960> been

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
looked up and I thought oh they've been

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.859 
looked up and I thought oh they've been
chem<00:00:29.590> trailing<00:00:30.070> but<00:00:30.760> lo<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.119> behold<00:00:31.390> it<00:00:31.840> was

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
chem trailing but lo and behold it was

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.590 
chem trailing but lo and behold it was
not<00:00:32.289> chem<00:00:32.619> Plains<00:00:32.949> that<00:00:33.340> left<00:00:33.820> what<00:00:34.359> I<00:00:34.390> was

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
not chem Plains that left what I was

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.120 
not chem Plains that left what I was
seeing<00:00:34.840> in<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.170> sky<00:00:35.380> which<00:00:35.649> I<00:00:35.800> will<00:00:35.920> show<00:00:36.070> you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
seeing in the sky which I will show you

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.850 
seeing in the sky which I will show you
footage<00:00:36.399> of<00:00:36.700> here<00:00:36.850> shortly<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.380> stay<00:00:38.620> tuned

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
footage of here shortly so stay tuned

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.430 
footage of here shortly so stay tuned
and<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.160> will<00:00:39.340> see<00:00:39.579> what<00:00:39.910> left<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.510> chem

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
and you will see what left the chem

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.389 
and you will see what left the chem
trail<00:00:41.770> like<00:00:42.010> residue<00:00:42.550> for<00:00:42.850> hours<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.570> also<00:00:44.410> to

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
trail like residue for hours and also to

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.810 
trail like residue for hours and also to
show<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.739> related<00:00:48.460> to<00:00:48.489> chem

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
show that this is very related to chem

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.450 
show that this is very related to chem
trailing<00:00:49.300> as<00:00:49.450> I'm<00:00:50.140> filming<00:00:50.559> lo<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:50.890> behold<00:00:50.980> an

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
trailing as I'm filming lo and behold an

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.819 
trailing as I'm filming lo and behold an
orb<00:00:51.820> shows<00:00:52.239> up<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.690> as<00:00:52.780> we<00:00:52.809> all<00:00:53.050> know<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.469> orbs

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
orb shows up and as we all know the orbs

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.470 
orb shows up and as we all know the orbs
hang<00:00:54.040> out<00:00:54.190> where<00:00:54.399> their<00:00:54.520> chem<00:00:54.730> trailing<00:00:55.210> so

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
hang out where their chem trailing so

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.150 
hang out where their chem trailing so
here<00:00:56.140> we<00:00:56.260> go<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:59.050> there<00:00:59.559> is<00:00:59.590> the<00:01:00.040> after

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
here we go and there is the after

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.700 
here we go and there is the after
effects<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.300> can<00:01:01.480> see<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:02.020> smudgy<00:01:02.469> clouds

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
effects so you can see the smudgy clouds

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.469 
effects so you can see the smudgy clouds
come<00:01:03.100> in<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:05.229> similar<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.799> chemtrails<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
come in very similar to chemtrails the

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:15.060 
come in very similar to chemtrails the
look<00:01:07.720> that<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:08.049> leaves<00:01:08.260> I<00:01:11.490> saw<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.540> then<00:01:14.350> on

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
look that it leaves I saw and then on

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.000 
look that it leaves I saw and then on
the<00:01:15.280> other<00:01:15.310> side<00:01:15.760> of<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:15.970> sky<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.490> have<00:01:18.760> a<00:01:20.010> chem

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
the other side of the sky we have a chem

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.399 
the other side of the sky we have a chem
trail<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.210> that's<00:01:26.140> not<00:01:26.500> from<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.979> air<00:01:27.159> show

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
trail and that's not from the air show

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.020 
trail and that's not from the air show
air<00:01:29.409> shows<00:01:29.710> much<00:01:30.100> north<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.700> I'm<00:01:30.790> pointing

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
air shows much north and I'm pointing

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.200 
air shows much north and I'm pointing
now<00:01:31.560> Southwest<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:34.030> yeah<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.700> we're<00:01:36.939> gonna<00:01:37.000> go

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
now Southwest so yeah so we're gonna go

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.780 
now Southwest so yeah so we're gonna go
backward<00:01:37.659> in<00:01:37.720> time<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.710> at<00:01:39.220> least<00:01:39.430> two

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
backward in time this is at least two

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.469 
backward in time this is at least two
hours<00:01:40.000> old<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.380> probably<00:01:45.030> maybe<00:01:46.030> half<00:01:46.360> an

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
hours old this is probably maybe half an

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.240 
hours old this is probably maybe half an
hour<00:01:46.600> old<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.320> one<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.710> just<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:48.040> few

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
hour old and this one is just a few

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.310 
hour old and this one is just a few
minutes<00:01:48.430> old<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.299> what<00:01:49.540> is<00:01:49.720> leaving<00:01:50.140> these

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
minutes old so what is leaving these

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.560 
minutes old so what is leaving these
trails<00:01:51.130> behind<00:01:51.400> these<00:01:51.759> persistent<00:01:52.150> trails

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
trails behind these persistent trails

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.899 
trails behind these persistent trails
here's<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.140> culprits<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:56.759> well<00:01:57.759> actually

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
here's the culprits just well actually

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.999 
here's the culprits just well actually
quite<00:01:58.329> a<00:01:58.360> ways<00:01:58.570> north<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.170> us<00:01:59.320> they're<00:01:59.590> having

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
quite a ways north of us they're having

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.450 
quite a ways north of us they're having
an<00:02:00.159> air<00:02:00.310> show<00:02:00.579> and<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:02.259> going<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.530> show<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.310> a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
an air show and I'm going to show you a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.700 
an air show and I'm going to show you a
couple<00:02:03.850> things<00:02:03.880> here<00:02:04.540> if<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.259> remember<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
couple things here if you remember the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.729 
couple things here if you remember the
clip<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.009> did<00:02:06.250> back<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.579> while<00:02:06.909> ago

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
clip I did back a while ago

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.429 
clip I did back a while ago
proof<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:08.769> chemtrails<00:02:09.489> are<00:02:09.670> real<00:02:10.200> I'll<00:02:11.200> show

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 
proof that chemtrails are real I'll show

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.769 
proof that chemtrails are real I'll show
you<00:02:11.499> some<00:02:11.829> of<00:02:11.859> the<00:02:12.040> same<00:02:12.309> characteristics<00:02:13.090> and

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:13.779 
you some of the same characteristics and

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.470 
you some of the same characteristics and
this<00:02:14.650> skywriting<00:02:15.249> that<00:02:15.790> we<00:02:15.969> see<00:02:16.180> in

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
this skywriting that we see in

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.040 
this skywriting that we see in
trails<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.760> here<00:02:19.180> they<00:02:19.330> are<00:02:19.450> laying<00:02:19.780> their

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
trails so here they are laying their

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.710 
trails so here they are laying their
trails<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.580> I'll<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.879> let<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.180> watch<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.690> a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
trails and I'll just let you watch for a

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.039 
trails and I'll just let you watch for a
second<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.620> actually<00:02:23.950> very<00:02:23.980> precision

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
second and it's actually very precision

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.660 
second and it's actually very precision
it's<00:02:26.049> crazy<00:02:26.379> how<00:02:26.620> accurate<00:02:27.129> they<00:02:27.280> are<00:02:27.310> they're

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
it's crazy how accurate they are they're

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.250 
it's crazy how accurate they are they're
perfectly<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.239> line<00:02:28.269> on<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.590> x<00:02:30.569> y&amp;z<00:02:31.569> axis<00:02:32.049> is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
perfectly in line on the x y&amp;z axis is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.280 
perfectly in line on the x y&amp;z axis is
to<00:02:32.500> do<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:33.540> must<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.660> computer-controlled

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
to do this must be computer-controlled

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.390 
to do this must be computer-controlled
too<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.549> be<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.910> accurate<00:02:37.420> at<00:02:37.989> any<00:02:38.500> rate<00:02:38.739> here

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
too to be this accurate at any rate here

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.920 
too to be this accurate at any rate here
in<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.580> second<00:02:39.970> I'll<00:02:40.120> load<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> new<00:02:40.450> clip<00:02:40.780> I'll

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
in a second I'll load a new clip I'll

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.449 
in a second I'll load a new clip I'll
let<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.170> watch<00:02:41.319> it<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.739> second<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.400> so

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
let you watch it for a second just so

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.080 
let you watch it for a second just so
you<00:02:42.549> can<00:02:42.700> see<00:02:43.260> what<00:02:44.260> they're<00:02:44.470> doing<00:02:48.090> now

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
you can see what they're doing now

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.150 
you can see what they're doing now
you'll<00:02:49.269> notice<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:50.110> when<00:02:50.410> they<00:02:50.620> cut<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
you'll notice that when they cut the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.670 
you'll notice that when they cut the
sprayer<00:02:51.519> there<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.269> residual<00:02:52.810> spray<00:02:53.200> which<00:02:53.530> is

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
sprayer there is residual spray which is

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.559 
sprayer there is residual spray which is
what<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.890> demonstrated<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.910> my<00:02:55.060> other<00:02:55.239> clip

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
what I demonstrated in my other clip

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.720 
what I demonstrated in my other clip
when<00:02:56.109> I<00:02:56.140> was<00:02:56.410> showing<00:02:56.709> actual<00:02:56.920> chemtrails

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
when I was showing actual chemtrails

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.059 
when I was showing actual chemtrails
spraying<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.540> when<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.349> saw<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.859> these

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
spraying and when I saw that these

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.949 
spraying and when I saw that these
trails<00:03:00.430> were<00:03:00.700> persistent<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.569> I'm<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:01.900> to

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
trails were persistent and I'm going to

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.259 
trails were persistent and I'm going to
zoom<00:03:02.019> in<00:03:02.349> here<00:03:02.590> watch<00:03:02.829> when<00:03:03.099> they<00:03:03.220> cut<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.519> guy

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
zoom in here watch when they cut the guy

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.479 
zoom in here watch when they cut the guy
on<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> tops<00:03:04.750> thing<00:03:05.709> isn't<00:03:06.010> working<00:03:06.340> as<00:03:06.459> well

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
on the tops thing isn't working as well

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.490 
on the tops thing isn't working as well
as<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.819> other<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.120> takes<00:03:07.510> takes<00:03:08.079> him<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.319> bit

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
as the other one takes takes him a bit

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.860 
as the other one takes takes him a bit
longer<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.920> cut<00:03:09.099> off<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.450> see<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
longer to cut off but you see the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.259 
longer to cut off but you see the
residual<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.739> these<00:03:11.980> guys<00:03:12.250> are<00:03:12.579> being<00:03:12.819> very

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
residual and these guys are being very

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.180 
residual and these guys are being very
accurate<00:03:13.989> with<00:03:14.379> their<00:03:14.590> spraying<00:03:14.950> because

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
accurate with their spraying because

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.580 
accurate with their spraying because
they're<00:03:15.489> are<00:03:15.609> forming<00:03:16.090> letters<00:03:16.269> with<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.870> but

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
they're are forming letters with it but

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.199 
they're are forming letters with it but
if<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.829> go<00:03:17.980> back<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.400> look<00:03:18.519> at<00:03:18.640> my<00:03:18.760> proof<00:03:19.000> for

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
if you go back and look at my proof for

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.240 
if you go back and look at my proof for
chemtrails<00:03:19.959> clip<00:03:20.260> you'll<00:03:20.470> see<00:03:20.530> when<00:03:20.859> they<00:03:21.010> cut

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
chemtrails clip you'll see when they cut

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.460 
chemtrails clip you'll see when they cut
their<00:03:21.459> sprayer<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:22.090> same<00:03:22.389> thing<00:03:22.720> happens<00:03:23.200> and

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
their sprayer the same thing happens and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.490 
their sprayer the same thing happens and
again<00:03:24.280> these<00:03:24.459> trails<00:03:24.849> lasted<00:03:25.419> many<00:03:25.599> hours<00:03:26.109> no

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
again these trails lasted many hours no

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.680 
again these trails lasted many hours no
no<00:03:26.739> three<00:03:27.069> four<00:03:27.370> they<00:03:27.700> were<00:03:27.730> still<00:03:28.150> as<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.480> Sun

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
no three four they were still as the Sun

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.050 
no three four they were still as the Sun
was<00:03:28.840> going<00:03:28.930> down<00:03:29.169> I<00:03:29.349> could<00:03:29.680> still<00:03:29.919> see<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:30.849> lo

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
was going down I could still see but lo

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.210 
was going down I could still see but lo
and<00:03:31.090> behold<00:03:31.299> look<00:03:31.720> up<00:03:31.930> there<00:03:32.260> there<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.769> an<00:03:32.919> orb

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
and behold look up there there is an orb

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.809 
and behold look up there there is an orb
and<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:34.359> have<00:03:34.599> never<00:03:34.959> filmed<00:03:35.560> an<00:03:35.769> orb<00:03:36.130> when

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
and I have never filmed an orb when

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.370 
and I have never filmed an orb when
there<00:03:37.000> wasn't<00:03:37.209> chem<00:03:37.569> drilling<00:03:38.019> I've<00:03:38.139> never

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
there wasn't chem drilling I've never

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.440 
there wasn't chem drilling I've never
seen<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.829> orem<00:03:39.130> or<00:03:39.220> filmed<00:03:39.819> in<00:03:39.970> orb<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.329> I've

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
seen in orem or filmed in orb and I've

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.440 
seen in orem or filmed in orb and I've
filmed<00:03:40.750> quite<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.049> few<00:03:41.519> always<00:03:42.519> when<00:03:43.180> chem

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
filmed quite a few always when chem

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.940 
filmed quite a few always when chem
drilling<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.049> occurring<00:03:44.079> so<00:03:45.989> there<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.109> is

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
drilling is occurring so there it is

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.370 
drilling is occurring so there it is
here's<00:03:48.849> chemtrail<00:03:49.359> technology<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.049> don't<00:03:50.200> know

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
here's chemtrail technology I don't know

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.750 
here's chemtrail technology I don't know
what<00:03:50.530> they're<00:03:50.680> actually<00:03:50.799> spraying<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:51.609> it's

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
what they're actually spraying but it's

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.479 
what they're actually spraying but it's
clearly<00:03:52.060> persistent<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.950> shares<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
clearly persistent and it shares the

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.729 
clearly persistent and it shares the
characteristics<00:03:55.299> it's<00:03:56.049> being<00:03:56.380> used<00:03:56.620> to

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
characteristics it's being used to

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.180 
characteristics it's being used to
entertain<00:03:57.400> people<00:03:57.819> here<00:03:58.690> today<00:03:59.049> but<00:03:59.769> there's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
entertain people here today but there's

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.539 
entertain people here today but there's
the<00:04:00.370> orb<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.290> while<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.739> was<00:04:03.010> shooting<00:04:03.220> this

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
the orb and while I was shooting this

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.259 
the orb and while I was shooting this
day<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:05.310> filmed<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.370> couple<00:04:06.489> other<00:04:06.730> things<00:04:06.819> and

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
day I filmed a couple other things and

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.640 
day I filmed a couple other things and
these<00:04:07.329> little<00:04:07.629> things<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.900> filmed<00:04:08.230> them<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.440> few

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
these little things I filmed them a few

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.979 
these little things I filmed them a few
times<00:04:08.799> I'm<00:04:09.069> using<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.400> telephoto<00:04:09.849> lens<00:04:10.000> for<00:04:10.419> so

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
times I'm using a telephoto lens for so

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.750 
times I'm using a telephoto lens for so
for<00:04:11.169> anything<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.709> be<00:04:11.859> even<00:04:12.190> reasonably

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
for anything to be even reasonably

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.089 
for anything to be even reasonably
InFocus<00:04:13.419> it<00:04:13.959> has<00:04:14.139> to<00:04:14.290> be<00:04:14.410> near<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.739> focal

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
InFocus it has to be near the focal

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.830 
InFocus it has to be near the focal
plane<00:04:15.220> you'll<00:04:15.579> notice<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:15.970> chemtrails<00:04:16.539> or

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
plane you'll notice the chemtrails or

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.289 
plane you'll notice the chemtrails or
the<00:04:17.349> skywriting<00:04:17.949> is<00:04:18.310> slightly<00:04:18.669> out<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:18.970> focus

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
the skywriting is slightly out of focus

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.629 
the skywriting is slightly out of focus
and<00:04:19.720> watch<00:04:20.169> you<00:04:20.650> didn't<00:04:20.919> see<00:04:21.039> anything<00:04:21.489> now

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
and watch you didn't see anything now

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.860 
and watch you didn't see anything now
I'm<00:04:21.729> going<00:04:21.849> to<00:04:21.910> take<00:04:22.060> both<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.300> these<00:04:22.539> clips

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
I'm going to take both of these clips

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.230 
I'm going to take both of these clips
and<00:04:23.199> slow<00:04:23.979> them<00:04:24.099> down<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.760> color<00:04:25.000> and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
and slow them down and color and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.209 
and slow them down and color and
contrast<00:04:25.630> them<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.320> I'll<00:04:26.800> highlight<00:04:27.039> the

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:27.219 
contrast them and I'll highlight the

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.830 
contrast them and I'll highlight the
object<00:04:27.400> going<00:04:28.000> through<00:04:28.300> which<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.630> couldn't

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
object going through which you couldn't

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.650 
object going through which you couldn't
see<00:04:29.050> in<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.260> first

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
see in the first

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.310 
see in the first
footage<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:31.330> think<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.480> one<00:04:32.660> comes<00:04:32.900> from<00:04:33.080> the

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
footage I think this one comes from the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.880 
footage I think this one comes from the
lower<00:04:33.680> left<00:04:34.040> if<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.730> remember<00:04:35.060> correctly<00:04:36.940> and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
lower left if I remember correctly and

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.230 
lower left if I remember correctly and
here<00:04:39.890> he<00:04:39.980> comes<00:04:40.400> now<00:04:42.760> I'm<00:04:43.760> gonna<00:04:43.910> stop<00:04:44.210> that

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
here he comes now I'm gonna stop that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.480 
here he comes now I'm gonna stop that
and<00:04:44.720> blow<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.020> up<00:04:45.140> so<00:04:45.170> you<00:04:45.410> can<00:04:45.470> see<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.160> it's

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
and blow it up so you can see and it's

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.200 
and blow it up so you can see and it's
not<00:04:46.700> quite<00:04:47.030> in<00:04:47.150> perfect<00:04:47.810> focus<00:04:48.050> but<00:04:48.470> it's<00:04:48.620> near

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
not quite in perfect focus but it's near

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.090 
not quite in perfect focus but it's near
focus<00:04:50.210> which<00:04:51.020> means<00:04:51.290> with<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.530> telephoto<00:04:51.980> lens

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
focus which means with a telephoto lens

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.550 
focus which means with a telephoto lens
this<00:04:52.850> thing<00:04:53.090> has<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.570> be<00:04:53.600> near<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.200> focal

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
this thing has to be near the focal

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.650 
this thing has to be near the focal
plane<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.580> was<00:04:55.790> aiming<00:04:56.090> at<00:04:56.150> those<00:04:56.330> trails

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
plane and I was aiming at those trails

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.960 
plane and I was aiming at those trails
really<00:04:57.050> high<00:04:57.500> in<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.740> sky<00:04:57.980> and<00:04:58.310> they<00:04:58.610> were<00:04:58.670> not

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
really high in the sky and they were not

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.120 
really high in the sky and they were not
quite<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.390> focus<00:04:59.780> I<00:04:59.960> was<00:05:00.350> a<00:05:00.380> little<00:05:00.590> shallow<00:05:00.800> on

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
quite in focus I was a little shallow on

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.100 
quite in focus I was a little shallow on
the<00:05:01.280> focus<00:05:01.700> here's<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.360> second<00:05:02.720> clip<00:05:02.900> you'll

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
the focus here's the second clip you'll

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.990 
the focus here's the second clip you'll
see<00:05:03.170> nothing<00:05:03.680> go<00:05:03.800> through<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.160> up<00:05:04.370> there<00:05:04.700> is<00:05:04.880> a

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
see nothing go through it up there is a

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.730 
see nothing go through it up there is a
highlighter<00:05:05.330> I'm<00:05:05.480> sorry<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:06.230> see<00:05:06.410> that<00:05:06.560> go

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
highlighter I'm sorry you see that go

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.800 
highlighter I'm sorry you see that go
through<00:05:07.040> it<00:05:07.070> kind<00:05:07.400> of<00:05:07.460> arcs<00:05:07.760> there<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:08.690> I'm

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
through it kind of arcs there so I'm

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.840 
through it kind of arcs there so I'm
thinking<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.200> this<00:05:09.290> a<00:05:09.350> bug<00:05:09.620> or<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.860> bird<00:05:10.100> but

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
thinking is this a bug or a bird but

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.530 
thinking is this a bug or a bird but
when<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.240> look<00:05:11.450> at<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:12.850> it's<00:05:13.850> a<00:05:14.120> little<00:05:14.390> bit

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
when you look at it it's a little bit

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.570 
when you look at it it's a little bit
out<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.810> focus<00:05:15.080> but<00:05:15.500> not<00:05:15.740> completely<00:05:16.310> blurred

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
out of focus but not completely blurred

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.490 
out of focus but not completely blurred
so<00:05:17.000> those<00:05:17.450> are<00:05:17.600> interesting<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.200> filmed
