hello<00:00:00.870> again<00:00:00.960> guys<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.680> think<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.159> a

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hello again guys I think this is a

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.770 
hello again guys I think this is a
record<00:00:02.429> more<00:00:02.879> than<00:00:02.909> one<00:00:03.149> video<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.629> week

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
record more than one video in a week

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.960 
record more than one video in a week
yeah<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.440> had<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> president<00:00:05.549> show<00:00:05.640> up<00:00:05.759> at<00:00:05.879> my

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
yeah I had a president show up at my

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.120 
yeah I had a president show up at my
doorstep<00:00:06.180> not<00:00:06.690> too<00:00:06.899> long<00:00:07.080> ago<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.859> thought

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
doorstep not too long ago and I thought

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.589 
doorstep not too long ago and I thought
I<00:00:08.309> would<00:00:08.490> show<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.000> guys<00:00:09.179> first

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
I would show it to you guys first

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.680 
I would show it to you guys first
because<00:00:10.139> it's<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:10.860> Linux<00:00:11.429> related<00:00:11.880> this

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
because it's actually Linux related this

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.160 
because it's actually Linux related this
is<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.860> parrot<00:00:14.429> ar.drone<00:00:14.960> it<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
is the parrot ar.drone it is a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.140 
is the parrot ar.drone it is a
quadcopter<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.460> has<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.940> tiny

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
quadcopter and it has a little tiny

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.849 
quadcopter and it has a little tiny
board<00:00:18.420> inside<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.380> running<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
board inside of it and it's running a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.769 
board inside of it and it's running a
version<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> Linux<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.270> don't<00:00:21.660> really

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
version of Linux on it I don't really

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.200 
version of Linux on it I don't really
know<00:00:21.900> much<00:00:22.020> about<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.350> specifics<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.100> but

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
know much about the specifics of it but

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.540 
know much about the specifics of it but
this<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.420> sent<00:00:24.600> along<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.890> test<00:00:26.340> out

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
this was sent along to me to test out

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
this was sent along to me to test out
some<00:00:26.910> potentials<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.199> other<00:00:28.380> device

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
some potentials of this other device

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.009 
some potentials of this other device
that<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:29.010> been<00:00:29.160> working<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.420> Nvidia

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that I've been working with the Nvidia

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.470 
that I've been working with the Nvidia
shield<00:00:31.610> not<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:32.880> into<00:00:33.059> much<00:00:33.239> about

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
shield not going to go into much about

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.569 
shield not going to go into much about
it<00:00:33.630> today<00:00:33.780> I'll<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.260> more<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.590> later<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it today I'll do more on that later and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.889 
it today I'll do more on that later and
most<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.969> probably<00:00:36.120> over<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> XDA

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
most of it probably over on the XDA

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.130 
most of it probably over on the XDA
channel<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.879> an<00:00:39.180> app<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.809> control

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
channel but there is an app to control

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.990 
channel but there is an app to control
the<00:00:40.260> parrot<00:00:40.500> ar.drone<00:00:40.640> that<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:41.790> some

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the parrot ar.drone that has some

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.490 
the parrot ar.drone that has some
exclusive<00:00:42.540> features<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.020> work<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
exclusive features that work on the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.020 
exclusive features that work on the
shield<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.550> thought<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.789> would<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
shield and so I thought I would do a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.549 
shield and so I thought I would do a
quick<00:00:45.270> demonstration<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.020> hands-on<00:00:46.350> with

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
quick demonstration and hands-on with

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
quick demonstration and hands-on with
that<00:00:46.710> today<00:00:47.250> now<00:00:47.670> essentially<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.390> do

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that today now essentially what you do

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
that today now essentially what you do
you<00:00:48.809> load<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> application<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you load up the application on the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
you load up the application on the
shield<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.090> whatever<00:00:51.390> Android<00:00:52.079> base

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
shield or on whatever Android base

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
shield or on whatever Android base
device<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.680> want<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.280> also<00:00:53.399> works<00:00:53.699> on

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
device you want I think it also works on

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
device you want I think it also works on
iOS<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.440> connect<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> wireless

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
iOS and then you connect to the wireless

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
iOS and then you connect to the wireless
access<00:00:56.760> point<00:00:57.149> built<00:00:57.480> into<00:00:57.989> again<00:00:58.739> hey<00:00:59.550> our

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
access point built into again hey our

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
access point built into again hey our
drone<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> wireless<00:01:01.230> chip<00:01:01.559> inside<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
drone it has a wireless chip inside of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.039 
drone it has a wireless chip inside of
it<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> sets<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.789> its<00:01:02.879> own<00:01:03.000> access<00:01:03.390> point<00:01:03.660> very

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it it sets up its own access point very

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.000 
it it sets up its own access point very
very<00:01:04.110> cool<00:01:04.409> stuff<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.920> from<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.960> just

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
very cool stuff and from there you just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
very cool stuff and from there you just
control<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> tell<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> take<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
control it you tell it to take off you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
control it you tell it to take off you
tell<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> land<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.750> use<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> camera<00:01:10.290> built

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
tell it to land you use the camera built

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
tell it to land you use the camera built
into<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.159> want<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:12.720> use

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
into it if you want to do that you use

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
into it if you want to do that you use
the<00:01:13.200> on-screen<00:01:14.010> controls<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.580> you're<00:01:14.700> using<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the on-screen controls if you're using a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580 
the on-screen controls if you're using a
device<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.450> doesn't<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.810> any<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.290> with

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
device that doesn't have any or with

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.499 
device that doesn't have any or with
something<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.490> use<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.180> built-in

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
something like this you use the built-in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
something like this you use the built-in
sticks<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.799> cool<00:01:19.920> stuff<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
sticks very very cool stuff there and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.920 
sticks very very cool stuff there and
also<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> sort<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> mention

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
also just one thing to sort of mention

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.149 
also just one thing to sort of mention
you<00:01:22.200> may<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.409> noticed<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> has<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.070> these

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you may have noticed it has all these

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.499 
you may have noticed it has all these
propellers<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:24.000> sort<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> flopping

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
propellers that are sort of flopping

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.899 
propellers that are sort of flopping
around<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:25.500> terribly<00:01:25.950> safe<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.340> indoor<00:01:26.640> use

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
around not terribly safe for indoor use

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
around not terribly safe for indoor use
but<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.600> why<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> also<00:01:28.290> came<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.890> this

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
but that's why it also came with this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
but that's why it also came with this
little<00:01:29.490> guy<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.479> fits<00:01:30.780> over<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> top<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
little guy this fits over the top of it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.770 
little guy this fits over the top of it
in<00:01:32.159> place<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.700> initial<00:01:33.119> styrofoam

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
in place of that initial styrofoam

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
in place of that initial styrofoam
shield<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.680> goes<00:01:34.860> around<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> blades<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
shield it goes around all the blades and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.640 
shield it goes around all the blades and
makes<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.420> much<00:01:36.540> safer<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.990> fly<00:01:37.020> indoors

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
makes it much safer to fly indoors

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
makes it much safer to fly indoors
although<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.340> still<00:01:38.579> kind<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> loud<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
although it is still kind of loud and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.170 
although it is still kind of loud and
not<00:01:39.840> exactly<00:01:40.229> recommended<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.939> fly

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
not exactly recommended but you can fly

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.429 
not exactly recommended but you can fly
it<00:01:42.240> indoors<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> way<00:01:42.899> I've<00:01:43.049> done<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it indoors that way I've done it a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
it indoors that way I've done it a
little<00:01:43.530> bit<00:01:43.740> myself<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.460> testing<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
little bit myself here in testing but I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.819 
little bit myself here in testing but I
think<00:01:45.659> without<00:01:45.750> further<00:01:45.899> ado<00:01:46.350> let's<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.710> ahead

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
think without further ado let's go ahead

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
think without further ado let's go ahead
and<00:01:47.220> take<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.520> outside<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.600> we'll<00:01:48.750> give<00:01:49.110> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and take it outside and we'll give you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780 
and take it outside and we'll give you
the<00:01:49.320> initial<00:01:49.439> run-through<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.700> show

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the initial run-through and just show

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.069 
the initial run-through and just show
you<00:01:50.850> how<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.180> works<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.450> everything<00:01:51.810> all

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you how it works and everything all

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.510 
you how it works and everything all
right<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> once<00:01:52.710> I've<00:01:52.860> paired<00:01:53.070> everything<00:01:53.399> up

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
right and once I've paired everything up

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
right and once I've paired everything up
to<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> wireless<00:01:54.329> built<00:01:54.840> into<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> device

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
to the wireless built into the device

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
to the wireless built into the device
all<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> hit<00:01:56.460> piloting<00:01:56.939> inside

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
all I have to do is hit piloting inside

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
all I have to do is hit piloting inside
the<00:01:57.360> application<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.290> shows<00:01:58.590> video<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the application it shows video from the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
the application it shows video from the
device<00:01:59.700> live<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> hit<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> take-off<00:02:01.229> button

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
device live so I hit the take-off button

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.569 
device live so I hit the take-off button
and<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> second<00:02:04.340> we're<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and here in just a second we're off the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.059 
and here in just a second we're off the
ground<00:02:05.729> we're<00:02:06.119> ready<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
ground we're ready to go and then it's a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.800 
ground we're ready to go and then it's a
simple<00:02:08.340> matter<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.610> using<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> sticks<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
simple matter of using the sticks on the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.449 
simple matter of using the sticks on the
shield<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.679> control<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> movement

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
shield to actually control the movement

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.059 
shield to actually control the movement
back<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.610> forth<00:02:11.900> left<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.050> right

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
back and forth left and right

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.539 
back and forth left and right
and<00:02:14.219> then<00:02:14.969> up<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.209> down<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:16.489> can<00:02:17.489> even<00:02:17.579> spin<00:02:18.420> 360

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
and then up and down I can even spin 360

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.830 
and then up and down I can even spin 360
just<00:02:20.549> by<00:02:20.640> holding<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.030> right<00:02:21.180> stick<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.719> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
just by holding the right stick in a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
just by holding the right stick in a
circle<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.849> if<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:23.939> hadn't<00:02:24.150> mentioned<00:02:24.269> it

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
circle and if I hadn't mentioned it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.390 
circle and if I hadn't mentioned it
before<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.140> quadcopter<00:02:25.500> actually<00:02:26.189> comes

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
before the quadcopter actually comes

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.270 
before the quadcopter actually comes
with<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.780> built-in<00:02:27.780> 720p<00:02:28.469> video<00:02:28.680> camera<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.250> I

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
with a built-in 720p video camera that I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.339 
with a built-in 720p video camera that I
can<00:02:29.489> control<00:02:29.819> using<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.540> screen<00:02:31.049> on<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.319> I

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
can control using the screen on here I

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.229 
can control using the screen on here I
can<00:02:31.530> actually<00:02:31.650> see<00:02:31.920> full<00:02:32.220> time<00:02:32.489> what's<00:02:33.000> going

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
can actually see full time what's going

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.030 
can actually see full time what's going
on<00:02:33.359> and<00:02:33.569> record<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:33.989> directly<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.500> stream<00:02:34.920> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
on and record it directly and stream it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.069 
on and record it directly and stream it
directly<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.609> shield<00:02:35.819> from<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.720> as

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
directly to the shield from here so as

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.179 
directly to the shield from here so as
long<00:02:37.260> as<00:02:37.349> you're<00:02:37.439> not<00:02:37.470> doing<00:02:37.620> silly<00:02:37.920> silly

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
long as you're not doing silly silly

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.550 
long as you're not doing silly silly
things<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.959> could<00:02:40.079> be<00:02:40.200> somewhat

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
things like this it could be somewhat

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.319 
things like this it could be somewhat
usable<00:02:40.889> footage<00:02:41.099> although<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.879> does<00:02:42.000> get<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
usable footage although it does get a

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.959 
usable footage although it does get a
little<00:02:42.629> bit<00:02:42.780> loud<00:02:42.959> from<00:02:43.200> time<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.530> time<00:02:43.969> it's

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
little bit loud from time to time it's

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.069 
little bit loud from time to time it's
not<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.209> doesn't<00:02:45.389> have<00:02:45.480> any<00:02:45.599> built-in<00:02:45.750> audio

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
not it doesn't have any built-in audio

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.300 
not it doesn't have any built-in audio
so<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.290> having<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.560> use<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.829> microphone

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so I'm having to use the microphone

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.129 
so I'm having to use the microphone
audio<00:02:47.549> from<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.939> but<00:02:48.480> still<00:02:48.659> like<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.959> said

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
audio from this but still like I said

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.159 
audio from this but still like I said
could<00:02:49.650> be<00:02:49.680> usable<00:02:50.189> and<00:02:50.340> actually<00:02:51.299> I've<00:02:51.540> done

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
could be usable and actually I've done

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.659 
could be usable and actually I've done
lots<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.709> lots<00:02:52.829> of<00:02:52.950> testing<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.430> at<00:02:53.579> this

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
lots and lots of testing with it at this

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.789 
lots and lots of testing with it at this
point<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.480> very<00:02:54.840> very<00:02:55.019> easy<00:02:55.139> to<00:02:55.379> control

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
point and it's very very easy to control

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.800 
point and it's very very easy to control
it<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.579> be<00:02:56.669> a<00:02:56.700> little<00:02:56.849> wibbly-wobbly<00:02:57.510> with

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it can be a little wibbly-wobbly with

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.479 
it can be a little wibbly-wobbly with
the<00:02:57.959> wind<00:02:58.169> but<00:02:58.470> when<00:02:58.680> you're<00:02:58.799> indoors<00:02:59.129> again

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
the wind but when you're indoors again

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.220 
the wind but when you're indoors again
it's<00:02:59.669> not<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.849> problem<00:03:00.389> you<00:03:00.599> just<00:03:00.629> have<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.019> kind

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
it's not a problem you just have to kind

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.270 
it's not a problem you just have to kind
of<00:03:01.260> watch<00:03:01.379> out<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.769> things<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.159> you're

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
of watch out for things that you're

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.250 
of watch out for things that you're
flying<00:03:02.519> around<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.750> when<00:03:03.989> you're<00:03:04.109> outdoors

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
flying around but when you're outdoors

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.869 
flying around but when you're outdoors
you've<00:03:04.739> got<00:03:04.859> lots<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.220> lots<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.430> room<00:03:05.609> to<00:03:05.730> go

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
you've got lots and lots of room to go

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.909 
you've got lots and lots of room to go
it's<00:03:06.150> supposed<00:03:06.419> to<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.840> range<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.709> about<00:03:07.829> a

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
it's supposed to have a range of about a

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.369 
it's supposed to have a range of about a
hundred<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.340> fifty<00:03:08.760> feet<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.239> think<00:03:09.689> 50<00:03:10.079> meters

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
hundred and fifty feet I think 50 meters

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.159 
hundred and fifty feet I think 50 meters
something<00:03:10.739> like<00:03:10.889> that<00:03:11.389> the<00:03:12.389> biggest<00:03:12.780> problem

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
something like that the biggest problem

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.809 
something like that the biggest problem
I<00:03:13.260> found<00:03:13.379> with<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:13.859> far<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.280> battery<00:03:14.730> life

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
I found with it so far is battery life

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.059 
I found with it so far is battery life
but<00:03:15.810> when<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.019> give<00:03:16.139> this<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.439> brand<00:03:17.010> new

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
but when you give this to a brand new

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.680 
but when you give this to a brand new
user<00:03:17.370> someone<00:03:17.760> who's<00:03:17.879> not<00:03:18.060> familiar<00:03:18.209> with<00:03:18.540> it

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
user someone who's not familiar with it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.909 
user someone who's not familiar with it
at<00:03:18.780> all<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.139> someone<00:03:19.349> who's<00:03:19.470> never<00:03:19.620> flown<00:03:19.889> a

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
at all and someone who's never flown a

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.210 
at all and someone who's never flown a
helicopter<00:03:20.489> before<00:03:20.609> you<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.829> just<00:03:22.949> hand<00:03:23.099> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
helicopter before you you just hand it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.770 
helicopter before you you just hand it
to<00:03:23.250> them<00:03:23.459> specifically<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> shield<00:03:24.510> and

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
to them specifically with the shield and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.210 
to them specifically with the shield and
because<00:03:25.109> it's<00:03:25.260> controlled<00:03:25.620> entirely<00:03:25.919> through

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
because it's controlled entirely through

because it's controlled entirely through
the<00:03:26.250> sticks<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:27.269> such<00:03:27.540> an<00:03:27.690> intuitive

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
the sticks it's such an intuitive

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.199 
the sticks it's such an intuitive
interface<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:29.129> they<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.459> immediately

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
interface that they just immediately

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.479 
interface that they just immediately
latch<00:03:30.479> on<00:03:30.780> as<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.739> see<00:03:32.010> from<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.250> video

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
latch on as you can see from this video

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.449 
latch on as you can see from this video
I<00:03:32.569> gave<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.659> to<00:03:33.690> my<00:03:33.810> friend<00:03:33.900> John<00:03:34.199> for<00:03:34.979> five

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
I gave it to my friend John for five

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.369 
I gave it to my friend John for five
minutes<00:03:35.729> and<00:03:36.000> said<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:36.449> go<00:03:36.690> for<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.049> he<00:03:37.199> said

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
minutes and said here go for it he said

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.719 
minutes and said here go for it he said
well<00:03:37.440> how<00:03:37.560> do<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.709> fly<00:03:37.919> it<00:03:37.979> I<00:03:38.099> said<00:03:38.250> just<00:03:38.400> use<00:03:38.549> the

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
well how do I fly it I said just use the

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.699 
well how do I fly it I said just use the
sticks<00:03:39.000> hit<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.690> button<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.019> take<00:03:40.169> off<00:03:40.379> and

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
sticks hit that button to take off and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.979 
sticks hit that button to take off and
he<00:03:41.489> was<00:03:41.639> ready<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.090> go<00:03:42.209> he<00:03:42.419> was<00:03:42.449> flying<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.900> all

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
he was ready to go he was flying it all

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.960 
he was ready to go he was flying it all
around<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.319> yard<00:03:43.500> had<00:03:43.829> no<00:03:44.099> problems<00:03:44.549> with<00:03:44.669> it

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
around the yard had no problems with it

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.819 
around the yard had no problems with it
short<00:03:45.479> of<00:03:45.629> just<00:03:45.810> some<00:03:45.989> depth<00:03:46.229> perception

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
short of just some depth perception

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.409 
short of just some depth perception
issues<00:03:47.159> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.340> he<00:03:47.729> almost<00:03:47.849> took<00:03:48.120> out<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
issues I think he almost took out the

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.059 
issues I think he almost took out the
tree<00:03:48.599> at<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:48.870> point<00:03:49.049> or<00:03:49.290> took<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.650> out<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:49.949> the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
tree at one point or took it out on the

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.860 
tree at one point or took it out on the
tree<00:03:50.280> now<00:03:50.699> realistically<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.599> biggest

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
tree now realistically the biggest

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.300 
tree now realistically the biggest
problem<00:03:52.139> I've<00:03:52.229> had<00:03:52.260> with<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.709> thing<00:03:52.949> so<00:03:53.129> far

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
problem I've had with this thing so far

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.860 
problem I've had with this thing so far
is<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.669> battery<00:03:53.970> life<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.479> doing<00:03:54.629> some

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
is the battery life and doing some

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.479 
is the battery life and doing some
reading<00:03:55.139> around<00:03:55.199> online<00:03:55.500> there<00:03:56.099> are<00:03:56.129> some

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
reading around online there are some

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.460 
reading around online there are some
modifications<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.299> can<00:03:57.329> make<00:03:57.479> to<00:03:57.659> it<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.349> can

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
modifications you can make to it you can

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.349 
modifications you can make to it you can
replace<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.040> bearings<00:03:59.519> inside<00:03:59.939> of<00:04:00.209> the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
replace the bearings inside of the

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.420 
replace the bearings inside of the
spinning<00:04:00.750> blades<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.409> that<00:04:01.470> will<00:04:02.099> allow<00:04:02.370> you

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
spinning blades and that will allow you

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.969 
spinning blades and that will allow you
to<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:03.120> get<00:04:03.269> some<00:04:03.510> slightly<00:04:04.199> less<00:04:04.319> friction

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
to to get some slightly less friction

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.439 
to to get some slightly less friction
which<00:04:05.310> will<00:04:05.489> let<00:04:05.669> make<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.939> battery<00:04:06.180> last<00:04:06.209> a

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
which will let make the battery last a

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:07.849 
which will let make the battery last a
little<00:04:06.569> longer<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:07.379> battery<00:04:07.680> life<00:04:07.829> is

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
little longer the battery life is

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.890 
little longer the battery life is
actually<00:04:08.310> only<00:04:08.459> about<00:04:08.549> 10<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.209> 15<00:04:09.540> minutes

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
actually only about 10 to 15 minutes

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.059 
actually only about 10 to 15 minutes
maybe<00:04:10.259> 10<00:04:10.739> ish<00:04:11.609> is<00:04:11.939> on<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.509> low<00:04:12.629> side<00:04:13.069> when

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
maybe 10 ish is on the low side when

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.379 
maybe 10 ish is on the low side when
you're<00:04:14.220> using<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.549> camera<00:04:14.699> built<00:04:15.030> into<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.299> of

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
you're using the camera built into it of

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.490 
you're using the camera built into it of
course<00:04:15.509> the<00:04:15.689> time<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:15.959> going<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.139> be<00:04:16.199> even<00:04:16.289> less

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
course the time is going to be even less

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.140 
course the time is going to be even less
than<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:17.489> you're<00:04:17.639> wanting<00:04:17.849> it<00:04:18.060> to

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
than that so if you're wanting it to

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.610 
than that so if you're wanting it to
last<00:04:18.329> for<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.509> really<00:04:18.539> long<00:04:18.870> time<00:04:19.019> either<00:04:19.380> try

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
last for a really long time either try

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.199 
last for a really long time either try
to<00:04:19.650> find<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:19.979> third<00:04:20.099> party<00:04:20.430> battery<00:04:20.699> which<00:04:20.940> I'm

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
to find a third party battery which I'm

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.940 
to find a third party battery which I'm
I<00:04:21.509> don't<00:04:21.959> know<00:04:22.049> anything<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.500> recommend<00:04:22.860> at

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
I don't know anything to recommend at

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.629 
I don't know anything to recommend at
that<00:04:23.070> point<00:04:23.279> or<00:04:23.810> just<00:04:24.810> don't<00:04:24.960> record<00:04:25.639> that's

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
that point or just don't record that's

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.800 
that point or just don't record that's
that's<00:04:26.909> going<00:04:27.029> to<00:04:27.090> be<00:04:27.180> one<00:04:27.300> way<00:04:27.450> to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
that's going to be one way to

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
controlling it with the shield makes it

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.200
