jump I haven't really explored other

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.340 
jump I haven't really explored other
races<00:00:30.779> or<00:00:31.730> Alliance<00:00:32.730> side<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
races or Alliance side but this is how I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.100 
races or Alliance side but this is how I
do<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.149> now<00:00:36.149> you're<00:00:36.450> gonna<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.750> top<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
do it so now you're gonna get on top of

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.310 
do it so now you're gonna get on top of
these<00:00:37.170> firework<00:00:37.739> type<00:00:38.399> things<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> want

these firework type things and you want

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.010 
these firework type things and you want
to<00:00:40.379> get<00:00:40.500> right<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:43.219> run<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.250> jump<00:00:45.020> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to get right there so run and jump and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.680 
to get right there so run and jump and
then<00:00:46.280> do<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:47.430> maneuvering<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
then do a little maneuvering and you

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
then do a little maneuvering and you
should<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:50.039> takes<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
should get here it takes a little bit of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
should get here it takes a little bit of
practice<00:00:50.850> I've<00:00:51.390> done<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.710> too<00:00:52.770> many

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
practice I've done this way too many

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.470 
practice I've done this way too many
times<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.840> yeah<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:57.059> gonna<00:00:57.120> try

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
times and yeah so now you're gonna try

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.229 
times and yeah so now you're gonna try
and<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.780> top<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.260> statue<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> I'll

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and get on top of this statue and I'll

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.990 
and get on top of this statue and I'll
show<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.920> why<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.930> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.110> difficult

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
show you why this is kind of difficult

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.200 
show you why this is kind of difficult
so<00:01:06.000> run<00:01:06.510> jump<00:01:06.810> BAM<00:01:07.740> you're<00:01:08.580> floating<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.150> in

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so run jump BAM you're floating them in

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
so run jump BAM you're floating them in
there<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.659> don't<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.770> happened<00:01:11.130> there

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
there I don't know what happened there

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.240 
there I don't know what happened there
there's<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.240> blizzard<00:01:12.750> got<00:01:13.049> lazy<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.979> some

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
there's a blizzard got lazy for some

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
there's a blizzard got lazy for some
reason<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> now<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.970> close<00:01:18.299> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
reason on them so now because close is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.670 
reason on them so now because close is
that<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.580> ledge<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.299> possible<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that to this ledge here as possible this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
that to this ledge here as possible this
guy<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:22.979> trying<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> same<00:01:24.060> thing<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
guy is trying to do the same thing I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.710 
guy is trying to do the same thing I
guess<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.500> done<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.890> druids<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.400> well

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
guess it can be done with druids as well

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
guess it can be done with druids as well
so<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.040> gonna<00:01:29.130> use

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so now what you can do you're gonna use

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
so now what you can do you're gonna use
your<00:01:29.520> rocket<00:01:29.670> jump

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
your rocket jump

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.550 
your rocket jump
be<00:01:31.920> sure<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> add<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.700> walk<00:01:32.820> walk<00:01:33.240> mode

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
be sure you add a for walk walk mode

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.160 
be sure you add a for walk walk mode
you're<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.710> run<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> jump<00:01:35.700> BAM

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you're gonna run a jump BAM

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.630 
you're gonna run a jump BAM
it<00:01:37.790> definitely<00:01:38.790> takes<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.420> practice<00:01:39.600> but

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.180 

and<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:45.300> it's<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:46.140> difficult<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
and it it's really difficult if you I

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.340 
and it it's really difficult if you I
don't<00:01:47.910> know<00:01:48.150> if<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.690> get<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.050> part

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
don't know if you can get to this part

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.990 
don't know if you can get to this part
you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.619> usually<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you can usually get there with the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
you can usually get there with the
rocket<00:01:51.300> jump<00:01:51.650> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
rocket jump I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.160 
rocket jump I
I<00:01:53.360> probably<00:01:54.360> practiced<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:56.479> over<00:01:57.479> 50<00:01:57.930> times

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I probably practiced it over 50 times

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.580 
I probably practiced it over 50 times
and<00:01:58.850> 2<00:01:59.850> minute<00:02:00.090> cooldown<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and 2 minute cooldown you can do the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.940 
and 2 minute cooldown you can do the
math<00:02:01.910> so<00:02:02.910> yeah<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> how<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.500> top

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
math so yeah that is how to get on top

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.280 
math so yeah that is how to get on top
of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.340> shrine<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:06.119> moons<00:02:06.360> thanks<00:02:07.170> for

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
of the shrine of two moons thanks for

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.649 
of the shrine of two moons thanks for
watching
