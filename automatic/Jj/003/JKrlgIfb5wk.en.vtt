00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
just troll more insulation on top your

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.560 
just troll more insulation on top your
attic<00:00:53.340> floor<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.670> gotta<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.090> something<00:00:54.300> else

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
attic floor you gotta do something else

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
attic floor you gotta do something else
because<00:00:54.750> people<00:00:55.410> need<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.980> attic

innovative<00:00:59.609> ways<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.379> insulating<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.500> this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
innovative ways of insulating and this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
innovative ways of insulating and this
is<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.760> dis<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:02.940> used

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
is one of them like this is dis is used

that's<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.280> really

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that's it's kind of it's going really

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.950 
that's it's kind of it's going really
well<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> know<00:01:14.939> well<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.630> take<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
well like you know well if you take it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719 
well like you know well if you take it
you<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> purpose<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> insulation<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you know the purpose of insulation and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.130 
you know the purpose of insulation and
the<00:01:17.790> insulation<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> conserve<00:01:18.720> figs<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the insulation is to conserve figs and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
the insulation is to conserve figs and
to<00:01:19.229> retain<00:01:19.470> heat<00:01:19.740> okay<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> look

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to retain heat okay and if you look

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.510 
to retain heat okay and if you look
firstly<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.350> cold<00:01:22.590> climates<00:01:23.369> are

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
firstly at really cold climates are

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.310 
firstly at really cold climates are
explorers<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> Arctic<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.170> into

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
explorers going to the Arctic and into

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920 
explorers going to the Arctic and into
that<00:01:25.409> they're<00:01:26.280> told<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.759> wear<00:01:27.000> multiple

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that they're told to wear multiple

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
that they're told to wear multiple

bulky layer saw multiple layers of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
bulky layer saw multiple layers of
clothing<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.939> our<00:01:32.970> eco<00:01:33.540> quilt

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
