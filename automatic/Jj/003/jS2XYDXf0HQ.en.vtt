to retrofit the skylight to open to 90
degrees<00:00:09.750> or<00:00:09.929> higher<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.590> way<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.340> can<00:00:12.000> get

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
degrees or higher that way you can get

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.780 
degrees or higher that way you can get
it<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> green<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:14.040> modification

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
it and I get a green the modification

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.120 
it and I get a green the modification
works<00:00:15.000> as<00:00:15.210> such

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
works as such

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.159 
works as such
you<00:00:17.640> will<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:17.939> to<00:00:18.470> relocate<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:20.810> gas<00:00:21.810> spring

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
you will have to relocate the gas spring

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.359 
you will have to relocate the gas spring
and<00:00:22.470> by<00:00:23.460> doing<00:00:23.759> that<00:00:23.939> what<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:25.079> is<00:00:25.410> remove

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and by doing that what you do is remove

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.120 
and by doing that what you do is remove
the<00:00:26.609> gas<00:00:26.789> spring<00:00:27.439> zoom<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.739> here<00:00:28.919> by<00:00:29.070> just

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the gas spring zoom on in here by just

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.569 
the gas spring zoom on in here by just
popping<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.059> this<00:00:30.329> little<00:00:31.369> clip<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:33.079> helps

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.569 

helps<00:00:37.579> release<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.269> gas<00:00:38.989> spring<00:00:39.199> from<00:00:39.829> this

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
helps release the gas spring from this

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.229 
helps release the gas spring from this
the<00:00:40.910> ball<00:00:41.090> stud<00:00:42.460> now<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.670> wedge<00:00:43.850> didn't<00:00:44.180> a

the ball stud now if the wedge didn't a

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.270 
the ball stud now if the wedge didn't a
little<00:00:44.480> tight<00:00:44.690> there<00:00:44.899> you<00:00:44.960> see<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:46.100> and

completely and then to reinstall it's
quite<00:00:54.680> simple<00:00:55.159> you<00:00:55.460> would<00:00:55.940> just<00:00:56.149> snap<00:00:56.930> it

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
quite simple you would just snap it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.670 
quite simple you would just snap it
right<00:00:57.440> into<00:00:58.040> place<00:00:58.159> and<00:00:59.030> insert<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.170> pins<00:01:00.440> by

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
right into place and insert the pins by

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.029 
right into place and insert the pins by
pressing<00:01:01.159> it<00:01:01.280> back<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:02.530> just<00:01:03.530> make<00:01:03.710> sure<00:01:03.890> it's

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
pressing it back in just make sure it's

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.410 
inches from the back of the frame again
you'll<00:02:48.989> see<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.519> this<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.610> what<00:02:50.760> it'll<00:02:51.000> sort<00:02:51.269> of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
you'll see it this is what it'll sort of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.920 
you'll see it this is what it'll sort of
look<00:02:51.599> like<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:53.640> profile<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.329> profile<00:02:54.720> the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
just hook up there and measure up to six

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.680 
just hook up there and measure up to six
and<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.810> half<00:03:06.870> inches<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.769> center<00:03:08.690> and

and a half inches to the center and

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.059 
and a half inches to the center and
that's<00:03:10.170> where<00:03:10.379> you'll<00:03:10.560> locate<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.250> plate<00:03:11.519> and

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
that's where you'll locate the plate and

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.680 
that's where you'll locate the plate and
what<00:03:14.069> we<00:03:14.220> recommend<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.090> get<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.390> plate

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
what we recommend is to get this plate

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.390 
what we recommend is to get this plate
to<00:03:15.870> sit<00:03:16.109> flush<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:18.090> back<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:19.109> plate<00:03:19.950> where

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
to sit flush the back of the plate where

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.379 
to sit flush the back of the plate where
the<00:03:20.549> ball<00:03:20.760> stud<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.269> riveted<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.230> plate

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
the ball stud is riveted to the plate

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.270 
the ball stud is riveted to the plate
the<00:03:24.389> there's<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.870> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:29.160> head

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
the there's a little bit of a the head

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.759 
the there's a little bit of a the head
of<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.519> rivet<00:03:29.700> actually<00:03:30.269> protrudes<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.530> what

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
of the rivet actually protrudes so what

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.960 
of the rivet actually protrudes so what
we<00:03:31.859> do<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.130> drill<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:33.650> 5/16<00:03:34.650> hole<00:03:35.870> or<00:03:36.950> even<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.069> 3/8

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
we do is drill a 5/16 hole or even a 3/8

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.559 
we do is drill a 5/16 hole or even a 3/8
whatever<00:03:39.419> drill<00:03:39.750> bit<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.019> may<00:03:40.200> have<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:41.569> prior

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
whatever drill bit you may have to prior

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.659 
whatever drill bit you may have to prior
to<00:03:42.900> setting<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.440> plate<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.859> so<00:03:44.099> this<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
to setting the plate down so this is the

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.990 
to setting the plate down so this is the
head<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.389> rivet<00:03:45.590> will<00:03:46.590> not<00:03:46.799> push<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
head of the rivet will not push the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000 
head of the rivet will not push the
plate<00:03:48.209> forward<00:03:48.630> it'll<00:03:48.810> sit<00:03:49.169> flush<00:03:49.530> on<00:03:49.829> you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
plate forward it'll sit flush on you

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.210 
plate forward it'll sit flush on you
it'll<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.280> allow<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:52.079> allows<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.950> head<00:03:53.099> of

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
it'll just allow it allows the head of

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.390 
it'll just allow it allows the head of
the<00:03:53.310> rivet<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.880> kind<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.660> sit<00:03:54.930> into<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.470> into

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
the rivet to kind of sit into the into

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.839 
the rivet to kind of sit into the into
the<00:03:56.609> thickness<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.599> profile<00:03:58.549> if<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.609> can

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
the thickness of the profile if you can

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.110 
the thickness of the profile if you can
see<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.209> little<00:04:00.389> hole<00:04:01.639> that's<00:04:02.639> just<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
see that little hole that's just a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.210 
see that little hole that's just a
recommendation<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:04.200> mean<00:04:04.349> just<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.099> it

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
recommendation I mean just to get it

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.350 
recommendation I mean just to get it
nice<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.370> flat

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.440
