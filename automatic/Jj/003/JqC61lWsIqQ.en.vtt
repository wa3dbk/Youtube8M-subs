00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.920
 i 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.280
 the world 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.860
 we are here in a new video and good 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.970
 because as the introduction of video 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.070
 let's teach how to make a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.890
 generator covers with automatic with 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.180
 the network mode or plugin this and 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.560
 when they include also resist 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.870
 minecraft book edition is also going to 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.760
 work and I'll put the version and the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.220
 minecraft but that does not matter with the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.990
 so that it has come out in steel point 10.5 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.530
 It will also lower so it works for 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.150
 all versions here in the future 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.070
 to be able to make this generator 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.160
 automatic koleston we're going to need what 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.479
 that would be blocks and well let's do 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.979
 this structure as you are seeing 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.310
 now let's do three or also 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.770
 well we're going to do two we're going 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.360
 to remove this and we're going to do it two 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.119
 blocks as well as a cross 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.979
 leaving a space in the middle and the other one 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.400
 let's do pegadito as you can see 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.980
 here 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.520
 doing it this way like that 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.260
 we are in this way leave so that 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.820
 work properly let's remove 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.190
 this block down here and in the background 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.920
 let's put a normal piston do not have 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.110
 to be sticky but with normal and we're going 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.670
 to do it as they saw is almost 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.380
 already finished the general with this 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.610
 let's do what would be like the room 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.520
 of control where you are going to handle the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.990
 generator and let's do here what can 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.850
 do in you where you want 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.340
 but I will do it here so that 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.530
 let's not turn around so much when turning it off 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.880
 turn it on and we're going to do it too 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.560
 this structure if you do not do that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.830
 structure will not work let's 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.570
 put a back reservation here and here 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.890
 let's put a repeater that does not 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.170
 we have 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.080
 and we put ourselves here and in this way what 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.480
 let's put here and we'll give it to 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.640
 four tics as you can see there you can see 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.300
 observe well how it works if there is no 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.220
 well in the it will work 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.930
 correctly good and the other thing that we 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.510
 would be to put a torch of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.510
 redstone in this part but 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.720
 as you can see there if they have to 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.610
 work if it does not work like that is 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.700
 because it is wrong repeater have put 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.440
 ok the network dust but first let's go 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.780
 to put what would be the network are that 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.120
 takes or will energize what would be 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.710
 the piston we are going to put like this as well 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.570
 I'm putting I should put it already 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.640
 that if they do not put it together it's not going to 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.900
 work as I say and let's put 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.350
 so in this way the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.880
 dust the rest and now let's put what 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.060
 that would be buckets of water and lava in 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.620
 those two holes it does not matter what 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.110
 space let's put it let's put here the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.120
 lava cube and let's put here and 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.680
 we are going to put the water here when coming together 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840
 down is going to generate what would be the 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.210
 conversion but a lot is very tedious 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.940
 be there and itching so do the 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.490
 soil that generates enough with this nor is 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.560
 is going to stop at a certain certain 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.300
 time as you see begins to generate what 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.070
 would be the cobista and there is the 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.440
 animation of the smoke that is where it goes 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.970
 joining the water with the gala goes and goes 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.000
 generating the conversion and the piston what 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.920
 what it does is push what would be the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.360
 cobista until it reaches a point where 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.210
 can no longer 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.570
 you have very, very small passes or what 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.120
 it would be we would need more pistons to 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.580
 that will generate much more as you see here what 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.260
 we remove and we are going to break, I think that 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.810
 it's much faster than a general where 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.340
 with this so without network this so I do not know 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.950
 what do you think and we are going to take it away 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.390
 around here and when we have this one we are going to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.740
 remove this is one benidorm or that 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.390
 it will always be generated and when 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.580
 we want to re-ignite let's put 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.800
 the torch again and it's going to start 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.769
 generate enough copper is good I think 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.560
 which are 15 blocks of the structure 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.440
 forward what generates bone would be 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.330
 altogether 17 or 18 I'm not very sure not 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.500
 I found it and well, they can 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.390
 do two of these if it's going to work 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.700
 correctly and they will generate much more 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.840
 Young people are much faster so 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.910
 Well, this was the little tutorial 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.460
 how to make a conversion generator 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.020
 automatic with redstone and good at 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.210
 description and do not forget to subscribe 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.980
 give him the comment in favorites and we 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.980
 we see in an upcoming friends bye bye
