00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.639
 this topic is about safety 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.500
 young family relaxed around 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 no wonder one is also painless 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.020
 as we humans our offspring am 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 best protect 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.350
 the adac tests this every year 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.170
 his child seat test this year with 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.779
 even higher requirements were 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.300
 Frontal impact revised a new one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.669
 Side impact method developed and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.940
 on a new dam for use 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.710
 the so-called q 10 it is a 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.989
 ten-year-old child 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 this new dummy offers more 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 measuring means that means that one 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.899
 the injury risks can be better 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.480
 rate because you just read more 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.090
 gets and also from the movement process ago 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.250
 this is then closer to the people than 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.530
 the predecessor 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 In total, 23 children were models 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.870
 from all weight classes in the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.149
 Criteria Safety Operation Ergonomics 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.369
 and pollutant tested that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.920
 test result is pleasing there are good 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 child seats for children of all ages 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 In total we were able to do that 14 times 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.790
 good judgment 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.250
 However, three models fail at the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.200
 pollutant test and one is in the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.840
 safety check failed so 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 failed the hauck vario guard on 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.750
 frontal crash test and received the adac 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.520
 judgment inadequate 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.670
 as well as polluted 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.890
 models giro place without fixe as well as the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.640
 simple breaking dawn with and without 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.710
 Isofixbasis should buy this now 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 necessarily in your own car and with the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.570
 own child to be tried 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.060
 but fitting and good 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 ratings are not everything for the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.150
 Unfortunately it is not enough for parents 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.090
 that you have a good child seat 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.229
 buys and with that the matter is settled 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.030
 It is also important that you have this good 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.220
 Child seat really neat 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 it integrates the child well 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.030
 cuts that means that it is close to 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.770
 body just so can also one 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.940
 good child seat the child at one 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.690
 well protect accident 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.030
 Well, it's much better 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.030
 even if you are painless
