beyond today today there is a strong

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.670 
beyond today today there is a strong

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
enough supply or a back-end Network

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
opportunity is pretty large so there

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.190 
opportunity is pretty large so there

in growing the category even further and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.160 
in growing the category even further and
