 You can plant all the trees 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 to make a browser 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.880
 it's just about a form 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.490
 it will be particularly harmonious 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.740
 a miniaturization of the plant it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.820
 is about a hook-like reach 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.850

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.640
 Sprouts will be on it from the beginning 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.420
 detained her usual size 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.330
 to reach 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:22.670
 a process that, above all, requires one 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:25.730
 Time, therefore, this tree was in Europe 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.890
 first brought these years and he is 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.040
 on the good way such a beautiful 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:42.860
 to get branched 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:44.840
 there are some years of work with louis 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.670
 Trees are meanwhile on exhibition 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.380
 to be seen in different countries 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.330
 but not only the contemplation of 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.730
 bonsai it has become global 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.530
 also the design of the tree dwarf has 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.260
 changed through digitization 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.420
 especially with internet knows something new 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.810
 phase of globalization by 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.250
 easy real-time experience exchange 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.940
 can change 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.400
 This morning I have seen the trees 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.019
 was launched yesterday in indonesia 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.930
 which were designed in japan partially 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.840
 von opel is always this one 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.730
 he him with the information the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.730
 real-time also a new development 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 allowed 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.420
 The charm of the little giant is about the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.239
 centuries, however, seemingly one 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.879
 stayed the same that patience is one 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.980

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.830
 also the developments of the country in progress 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.709
 the years and decades a role 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.069
 plays what I find fascinating 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.440
 Not only is the word life wise 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.140
 that this sense of time in the modern day 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.420
 since I used it I'm glad that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.690
 the years are over 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.970
 that the tree just looks ripe 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.620
 And this is just the new time in the 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.310
 mission the tub texts I find a lot 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.310
