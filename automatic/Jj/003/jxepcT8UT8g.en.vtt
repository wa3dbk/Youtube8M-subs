00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.030
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.380
 hello and welcome if you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 maybe now and then to my presentation 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.440
 cards somewhere in when it's in the small 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.690
 circle are family circle the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
 want to show vacation pictures and stuff 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.859
 there you can find somewhere flowing 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.289
 a new tv or on one 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.869
 projectors and then it is natural 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.310
 not in the way the spectators should tell you 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.040
 what can you see how do you do that then 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.559
 There is a great story I have here 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.870
 Find something found by yourself 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.110
 Looks like a little keyboard and is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.510
 a small keyboard but general keys 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 also has a laser pointer here 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.039
 installed and here in front 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 which ones on this press there you can 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.530
 because the laser beam does not always see 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.239
 dazzle at home no fear can be nothing 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 It's all about television 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.809
 they can not do anything with it 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.670
 show on the canvas on the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.879
 TV somewhere on the wall and 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 you have the possibility of the device too 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.290
 still to use 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.060
 as I show 'because touchpad she 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.009
 see there on the display wand around 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:21.600
 if I put a little stone so 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.040
 there wandered around and i can now 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.990
 also write on it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.540
 So I'm just going to do something 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.150
 hurt where is the shift key are 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.240
 Of course, the keyboard is small 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.619
 but individual keys This dates so 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.400
 who can really spell it 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.689
 the beneficial I do not belong to 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.640
 Function keys are the cursor on it 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.799
 that means also the mouse 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.040
 I also have control buttons here 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.799
 button, the cursor rocker from our cross 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.350
 of course they could say that now 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.090
 rightly say my calculator did 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.909
 no bluetooth because that works 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.310
 about bluetooth and there has general gravel 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.880
 another little hideaway here 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.460
 That's what she says to me here 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 put this bluetooth dongle out there 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.330
 into my computer in usb 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.120
 I have to look now 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.830
 there it is so now he installs 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.260
 He picks up the drivers from the internet 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.240
 as well as windows usually does and there 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.190
 you have to run a few more mating 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.140
 So do here this bluetooth button 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.180
 then press the things and flashes 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.100
 a few seconds he knows with calculations 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 This bluetooth dongle is free 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.690
 still here is this keyboard 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.480
 this present with it is one 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.940
 family evening door and gate open 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.750
 I think that's partly fun again 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.750
 makes and goodbye
