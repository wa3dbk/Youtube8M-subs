00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.460
 as cheers 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.350
 and that nobody is itching and good 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.450
 welcome here a video over the 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.220
 Optical and well I bring you with the 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.610
 tips and recommendations to go up 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.710
 rank more quickly and good then the 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.509
 first advice I want is power and that already 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.090
 I've tried although the type of game does not 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.280
 calls a lot of attention is to play search 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.899
 and rescue this is a hockey smoke it 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.030
 implemented in call of duty ghost and good 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.739
 because this comes to replace until certain 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.640
 part since it was confirmed that it comes from 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.020
 he came back 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.120
 what is being search and destroy 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.489
 ok this good game mode consists 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.410
 exactly the same way is 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.449
 simply 3 the combination of that the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.140
 according to which you have or can 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.519
 confirm the death of the enemy and say 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.190
 let's say that causing that no longer 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.960
 reappear or saving your ally 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.960
 let's say that of denying death ok 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.370
 causing him to relive the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.140
 search and destroy comparison where 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.600
 simply everyone has a life and already 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 ok then this is the first guy plays 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.320
 in this type of game since they give us 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.900
 enough points for death more than 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.520
 normal and also give us 500 points for 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.290
 plant or by melting a pump 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.960
 then that is the first recommendation 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.970
 to rank up quickly this one 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.170
 of game and the next one is this that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.900
 they are watching here on screen 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.369
 it's the frantic game mode I do not know how 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.400
 it is called sincerely in English ryan 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.770
 I think something like this and this good model 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.479
 it consists in constantly killing 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.210
 since every time you kill someone you have 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.340
 a time of 30 seconds to kill the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.250
 type of game according to this anti-camperos 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.350
 that if you have enough but less than 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.330
 those who have the game itself ok then 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.520
 is that second recommendation that touches 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.020
 in frantic game mode and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.420
 obviously being doing deaths 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.890
 constants not wanting to kill one and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.600
 wait to explode if you're not doing 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.369
 constant losses since they give them 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.229
 it can reach double points or 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.649
 bonus points for doing these 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.940
 deaths with this continuous deaths ok 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.280
 then be in the recommendations of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.050
 the game modes is not recommended 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.570
 make games how to play games 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.040
 community as it has been the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.130
 game in which you are changing weapons 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.270
 that you find in boxes one in the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.670
 what is he being 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.890
 the map that is hunter I think married something 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 well that model does not because it does not give many 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.750
 points in any case the other kind of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.210
 game could be the blitz game 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.950
 open up in something like that is the model that 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.600
 is going to be implemented in competitive and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.730
 probably for caloric tokay 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.050
 then that is in the aspect of the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.270
 game modes but honestly 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.000
 I recommend the first two ok it's a 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.090
 little more special and good the second 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.430
 recommendation is operations ok what 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.380
 Now, it is true that the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.690
 extra missions so to speak the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.330
 challenges that mark us that the last 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.100
 which they are constantly updated as 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.090
 those challenges give us apart from the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.410
 points of the basic points 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.870
 specials for this squad game 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.450
 points give us experience ok then 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.060
 that would be the second way to take advantage 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.220
 obviously to climb level fast and 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.740
 finally we have the contracts ok 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.350
 these serve us in smaller quantities to the 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.300
 mentioned above but they are still 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.850
 a good option obviously always 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.680
 they are equally always an option or 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.819
 It never hurts to contemplate the fact 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.010
 have a good game ok 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.079
 to have a good game are simple 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.790
 and easy steps ok here you can not go 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.249
 so to the top empire you can not go 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.230
 both want to kill all the 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:37.540
 reason is simple and the amount of life 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.489
 for my taste like I'm sorry it 's very 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.540
 nules obviously is not pulling the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.790
 hardcore 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.870
 but if it's quite less than 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.120
 comparison of those who uses them 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.189
 you die in a faster way then 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.629
 you can not be moving and moving 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.659
 one side to the other wanting to kill 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.859
 all because obviously it is no longer possible 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.620
 besides , well , well , so the 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.650
 weapons have a lot of influence and bring them 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.939
 later a guide of the best class 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.790
 that you can find for some types 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.620
 of game and for some game modes 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.049
 of the people here not a few ways of 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.669
 game of the title but of how it 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.469
 they usually play ok then 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.349
 exceeding and recommendations about 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:15.939
 how to climb rank more easily 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.209
 obviously it is always or never is of 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.009
 plus 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.530
 contemplate what you have to be a good 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.030
 player to a certain extent I say and you must 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.310
 of trying to stay positive do 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.530
 several assists obviously if you're not 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.320
 of those that link many gusts 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.300
 let's say that followed but that you like 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.250
 support the good team is always good 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.259
 use what comes from sat 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.030
 ok the streak that good comes to replace 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.639
 to liu and well here the ticos 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.310
 it's a good incentive to put it on because 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.530
 generates points, generates points, points 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.810
 in a very simple way very fast and 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.520
 let's say it's a little more efficient 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.440
 support the team you support yourself 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.150
 because so it is getting low 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.310
 constant since it locates your are not the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.720
 enemies and well it is a way of 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.780
 be balancing here what comes 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.430
 being the job you already are a 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.409
 little bit more hardcore are they put you 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.210
 streaks a little bit higher or try 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.490
 with what has been doing the gusts of 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.199
 specialist since good they give you a 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.509
 extra support to be able to kill others 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.340
 but good and will be depending on your 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.659
 game mode however the first 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.370
 options that I gave them here what comes 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.349
 being the game modes the 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.240
 operations and contracts are options 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.280
 general for people who can play 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.379
 of one or another way that is good or 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.750
 bad because it's just those options 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.550
 they come quite well to him since they are 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.289
 dynamic options are options that do not 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.759
 they require so much effort key and good 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.759
 well this has been all see you
