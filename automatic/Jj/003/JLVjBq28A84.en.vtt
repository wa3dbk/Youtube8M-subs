just<00:00:41.040> verify<00:00:41.190> quickly<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.120> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
just verify quickly that this is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.500 
just verify quickly that this is
unloaded<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:43.489> depending<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.940> style<00:00:45.239> of

further out than that tip and again

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
further out than that tip and again
it'll<00:01:01.140> depend<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> type<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> pistol<00:01:02.850> that

back towards the rear of the gun towards
my<00:01:43.710> shoulder<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.880> minimize<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
my shoulder so that I minimize the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.830 
my shoulder so that I minimize the
movement<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.860> gun<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> control<00:01:48.630> the

movement in the gun when I control the
trigger<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> minimize

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
trigger like that I'm going to minimize

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.700 
trigger like that I'm going to minimize
the<00:01:51.119> disruption<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.990> sight<00:01:52.439> alignment

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the disruption of that sight alignment

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.410 
the disruption of that sight alignment
that<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.040> were<00:01:53.189> talking<00:01:53.369> about<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:53.939> okay

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that we were talking about right okay

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.630 
that we were talking about right okay
now<00:01:54.649> let's<00:01:55.649> talk<00:01:55.799> about<00:01:55.860> trigger<00:01:56.369> control

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
now let's talk about trigger control

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
now let's talk about trigger control
trigger<00:01:57.479> control<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.439> most

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
trigger control is one of the most

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.039 
trigger control is one of the most
important<00:01:59.399> elements<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.000> shooting<00:02:00.450> trigger

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
important elements of shooting trigger

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.289 
important elements of shooting trigger
control<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.680> what's<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> allow<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
control is what's going to allow you to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.990 
control is what's going to allow you to
hit<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:04.259> you're<00:02:04.439> aiming<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.880> order

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hit what you're aiming at now in order

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.789 
hit what you're aiming at now in order
to<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.540> particular<00:02:06.780> exercise<00:02:07.380> we're

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
to do this particular exercise we're

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.309 
to do this particular exercise we're
going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> insert<00:02:08.489> an<00:02:08.670> empty<00:02:09.149> magazine<00:02:09.420> into

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
going to insert an empty magazine into

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.120 
going to insert an empty magazine into
this<00:02:10.500> unloaded<00:02:11.310> pistol<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.959> I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
this unloaded pistol so that I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.580 
this unloaded pistol so that I
and<00:02:13.220> show<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.460> something<00:02:14.290> trigger<00:02:15.290> control

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
and show you something trigger control

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.340 
and show you something trigger control
is<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.520> action<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.320> manipulating<00:02:18.320> the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
is the action of manipulating the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.370 
is the action of manipulating the
trigger<00:02:18.770> such<00:02:19.550> that<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:19.970> are<00:02:20.120> minimizing<00:02:20.840> the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
trigger such that you are minimizing the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.160 
trigger such that you are minimizing the
motion<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.280> bring<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.180> gun<00:02:23.390> by

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
motion that you bring to the gun by

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.990 
motion that you bring to the gun by
doing<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.770> are<00:02:24.980> minimizing<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
doing so you are minimizing the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.120 
doing so you are minimizing the
disruption<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.870> sign<00:02:27.500> alignment<00:02:28.040> and
