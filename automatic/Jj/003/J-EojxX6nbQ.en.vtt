00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.820
 hello, I'm Cesar Ruiz, the group's chef 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.789
 jose luis and we are in the 'josé luis' of 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.549
 doctor fleming number 23 and today we are going to 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.130
 prepare a dish a little more modern 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.230
 let's leave the tradition that to me 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.360
 I love tradition we can not 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.550
 lose tradition in the kitchen but 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.690
 also from time to time you have to do 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.690
 some different thing 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.899
 the ingredients for tuna is 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.519
 obviously a piece of clean tuna from 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.519
 a few hundred 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.710
 20 grams because the tuna is already fat 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.760
 in which filled much needless 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.400
 a lot of 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 obviously clean 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.740
 then we also have the mashed potatoes 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.590
 you can make a mashed potato 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.390
 traditional like the one of all the life 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.460
 no problem but there are some potatoes 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.740
 specials called the potato viole 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.610
 who comes from Peru 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.500
 the purple potato I read violet that says 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.229
 the word potato viole and the truth that 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.960
 it's a purée of potato then purple and 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.090
 dish is much more colorful if 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.070
 we have guests at home they are going to say ay 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.380
 what more interesting thing is not a puree 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.200
 of potato with a very nice purple color 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 but it 's very easy that mashed potatoes and 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.210
 then the teriyaki sauces the sauce 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.009
 teriyaki I then explain how it is done 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.110
 while we are doing but already 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.350
 can buy made now the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.740
 supermarkets and even in stores 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.090
 oriental foods that are now 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 is seeing the market opening up a lot 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 the markets and you get it in all 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.390
 parts and then we also have a sauce 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.420
 of the tag isla a toquecito that I am going to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.630
 explain that it carries the oil 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.310
 a little lemon grass lemon grass 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.979
 it's like a kind of chive among 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.700
 the onion in that chive and a half 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.410
 citrus then it has a touch of 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.069
 portion is called lemon lemon grass that 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.120
 It's like chives, but then the lemon 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.130
 then the oil is put in with a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.240
 little bit of shake chopped a bit of lemon 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.140
 grass a little bit of ginger 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.830
 and a little bit of soy and it's a salsita 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.260
 extraordinary he gets a little 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.330
 as it is strong it is shaken everything is put 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.670
 a little bit above the tuna and now 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.010
 you are going to see how it is fantastic here 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.910
 we have the tuna and has cut this can 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.980
 be about 120 grams or so and 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.530
 There is another ingredient that I have not commented 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 before the sesame seeds 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.670
 I have not said it because it can be done 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.580
 the iron with nothing this is to give 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.440
 a little touch to the plate to me 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.900
 like for people if you do not like what 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.370
 can do without nothing and then there's also 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.920
 people who put poppies that is the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.319
 black the little black dots are reserved 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.659
 reboza 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.629
 with poppies and with sesame in this case 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.139
 I'm going to use just right sesame salt 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.209
 sesame and grilled tuna 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.379
 normally the tuna becomes little done 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.200
 that is juicy 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.609
 because if not the tuna is very dry and 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.099
 has to be done a little bit 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.260
 Orientals take it raw and it's a 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.579
 wonder is a rich dish obviously is 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.129
 question of tastes there are people who do not 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.769
 like then let's put a little bit 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:35.280
 of salt and leaves on the plate what 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.480
 we reinforce here in the sesame that take a 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.480
 little on both sides 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.579
 and directly some oil 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.260
 I personally like very little 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.590
 done what you want to say that I'm going to 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.390
 turn around and back because then even 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.150
 before we take it out we give it a little touch 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.370
 also in the salamander so that it is 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.439
 hot inside now he already has a 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.780
 It looks or is golden and does not look like 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.480
 It is very raw but inside it is 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.870
 raw again I repeat each one what 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.879
 make 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
 in your own way now what you have to do 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.019
 is emplatar to place it today 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.549
 also and all life has been eaten with 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.220
 the eyes but every time we worry 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.320
 more to decorate the pretty and such so that 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.570
 have a better pint, and especially if 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.550
 We are at home making a little dish 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.889
 if this is a dish for a day of seven 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.300
 at a dinner with friends with friends with 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.530
 family is lidio because I'm going to have a 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.669
 little the roll of the surprise 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.229
 then the very nice decoration by 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.300
 that's what he talked about the potato 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:41.720
 viole this is a potato viole are 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:45.950
 dark purple potatoes and then it stays 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.950
 a purple color the puree the mash gets 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.250
 basic background for example we do well 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.270
 we put a goop and then a tear 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.730
 we extend it so the tuna is put on 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.000
 of tuna can be put like this or rolled 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.640
 finite little bit of teriyaki sauce 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.310
 lemon grass is this you see there 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.260
 It looks like brown because it is the 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.830
 oil the oil with chopped garlic and this 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.810
 chopped this what I explained before 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.710
 Ginger that itches a lot but this is very 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.990
 healthy 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.480
 this cleans up everything you use a lot in 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.730
 Eastern Oriental ginger 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.320
 they take ginger juices infusions and the 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.780
 ginger the most holy thing 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.400
 and the lemon grass that is like a leather 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.200
 between a village and a chive 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.490
 what I said before but that knows 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.530
 lemon what you smell like lemon seems 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.140
 difficult but it 's easy to very stuff 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.230
 simple this is peeled everything is well itchy 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.270
 a little bit with the agito and with the oil 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.980
 and a little bit of soy and there 's the sauce 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.500
 to decorate the dish a bit 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.630
 nice these are rice noodles that 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.090

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.400

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.220
 sauces in very hot oil and soufflé 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.690
 it swells up and stays that way and then it 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.870
 put a little bit and the truth that remains 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.520
 very decorative very decorative and this 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.620
