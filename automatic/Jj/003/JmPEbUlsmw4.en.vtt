00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.909
 Ed today we will understand it 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.730
 survived must be noted in order 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.459
 to 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.269
 remove the top panel fat percentage 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 weaker we will need a knife 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.240
 waiting for the legs and expose it 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 yes passed between the back panel 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 cincinnati in communication 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.689
 and such movements 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.689
 like that 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.580
 start slowly became the glass with this 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.990
 sides from this side remember here 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.460
 she button down 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 starting from this side 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.649
 in the third period 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.900
 masimov bag 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.340
 so here 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.340
 but further action 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.370
 around the volume control button 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.970
 be careful 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 break nothing 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.630
 in the clinic 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.630
 planet mount 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.870
 so i continue further 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.360
 stay means here from the bottom it is due 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.010
 gas 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.770
 if i go 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.610
 here about points 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.990
 bottom is still possible 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.700
 p hard on the street 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.140
 and the more small effort 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 can give 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.480
 but not much 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.060
 when I first time 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 evraz group was pretty scary but 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.520
 security 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 she popped us with a big click 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.639
 so if you what remains of incense 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.530
 clicked 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.920
 so it is also quite difficult to get it but not 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.920
 as hard as the bottom 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.309
 Total 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.009
 now hit means top 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.589
 as dictation of inclusion 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.989
 here it is pretty simple here 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.569
 goes to 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.019
 how are we going to be attentive friend 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.709
 inclusion friend 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.340
 you need to work on it instead 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 do not break anything 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.129
 we have crises from this region 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.469
 from below to 4 crises from below to the singer break 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.309
 I don't know how to open them differently 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.029
 we will not close it will break 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:56.909
 this 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.839
 incorrect disclosures though 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.459
 the states are people too 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.639
 still not figured out how it is 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.349
 make hide 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.789
 so I'm just here it 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.309
 effort 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.479
 I hide 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.369
 show case breaks here odessa she herself 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:15.849
 pops up 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.189
 but bottom up but about boy faces 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.120
 without fear unfortunately nothing 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.389
 to do 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.869
 and here this edge after was mother not 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.869
 need on the canvas itself pops up 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.799
 we can hope for him a little 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:31.469
 can 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.509
 see at the same time the pace of discovery 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.289
 olympiad 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.599
 and see the crisis can 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.599
 a knife 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.749
 someone will get 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.749
 and then it won't break 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.409
 that's all 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.709
 the screen was raised 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.549
 but no, we donâ€™t remove them because 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.549
 need to connect before 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.559
 luge about a year ago 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.559
 we turn it like that 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.059
 I look inside the reactor 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:15.460
 like this 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.640
 so we need to include this 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.640
 black wire 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:24.900
 him 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.009
 just take a plastic talking about 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.509
 black moment black tournament i don't know 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.520
 why so of course 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.520
 any plastic tools 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.370
 get up close is not very 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:43.740
 so here 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.740
 take this tool 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.539
 weather on record go 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.539
 then you can just a little bit roofs 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.860
 it became necessary to disconnect this cable 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.080
 we can be glued here still in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.080
 it was not stuck here 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.360
 I think that just need to 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.999
 here by the way due to pull 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.999
 this evening why 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.279
 laptop for example take advantage 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:23.819
 generally 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:32.309
 concept latch 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.400
 and foundry square 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.339
 we need to turn off 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.849
 light sensor connectors 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.919
 this canada 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.789
 under the word again as a search tool 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.789
 epic rushkin rumor join 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.759
 Kostas disable 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.409
 in Canada, the odds on glass 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.569
 what it looks like 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.569
 to such a matter 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.569
 ferrer plastic thing 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:42.379
 so much 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.919
 So 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.919
 does not focus 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.279
 just 

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:16.369
 it is remarkable that their 

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:19.769
 it's all over video thanks 

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:19.969
 for your attention
