there and cause Ivan let's talk about
those<00:01:13.959> waves<00:01:14.319> because<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.709> were<00:01:14.829> you<00:01:15.069> were

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
those waves because you were you were

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.489 
those waves because you were you were
saying<00:01:15.189> like<00:01:15.490> 500<00:01:16.090> miles<00:01:16.299> for<00:01:16.899> our<00:01:16.929> US

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
saying like 500 miles for our US

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.019

audience 800 kilometers per hour for
global<00:01:22.029> audience<00:01:22.509> I<00:01:22.659> mean<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.289> just

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
global audience I mean it just

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.219 
global audience I mean it just
extraordinary<00:01:24.429> strength<00:01:25.270> involved<00:01:25.959> in<00:01:26.079> that

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
extraordinary strength involved in that

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.649 
extraordinary strength involved in that
and<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.770> say<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:27.219> comes<00:01:27.490> presumably<00:01:28.479> that

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
and you say it comes presumably that

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.599 
and you say it comes presumably that
first<00:01:28.959> one<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.499> strongest<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.189> then<00:01:30.369> the

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
first one is the strongest and then the

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.309 
first one is the strongest and then the
ones<00:01:30.819> that<00:01:31.060> follow<00:01:31.359> a<00:01:31.509> weaker<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.170> that

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
ones that follow a weaker is that

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.679 
ones that follow a weaker is that
correct<00:01:32.590> or<00:01:32.770> not<00:01:32.829> not<00:01:33.279> necessarily<00:01:33.909> if<00:01:34.539> you

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
correct or not not necessarily if you

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.169 
correct or not not necessarily if you
remember<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.170> abandoned<00:01:35.679> arch<00:01:35.829> a<00:01:36.179> tsunami

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
remember in the abandoned arch a tsunami

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.870 
remember in the abandoned arch a tsunami
the<00:01:37.599> initial<00:01:38.590> one<00:01:38.770> was<00:01:38.979> bad<00:01:39.219> enough<00:01:39.549> but<00:01:39.729> then

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
the initial one was bad enough but then

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.349 
the initial one was bad enough but then
we<00:01:40.029> had<00:01:40.529> essentially<00:01:41.529> wave<00:01:42.219> 3<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.819> wave<00:01:42.999> 4

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
we had essentially wave 3 and wave 4

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.109 
we had essentially wave 3 and wave 4
which<00:01:43.630> were<00:01:43.779> actually<00:01:44.170> higher<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.099> were<00:01:45.729> so

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
which were actually higher and were so

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.769 
which were actually higher and were so
the<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.109> damage<00:01:47.349> is<00:01:47.950> ongoing<00:01:48.340> right<00:01:49.029> now<00:01:49.060> but

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:49.779 
the the damage is ongoing right now but

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:51.779 
the the damage is ongoing right now but
may<00:01:49.899> continue<00:01:50.439> over<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.770> next<00:01:50.859> several<00:01:51.490> hours

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
may continue over the next several hours

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.749 
may continue over the next several hours
because<00:01:52.419> we<00:01:53.349> talked<00:01:53.799> about<00:01:53.919> these<00:01:54.159> waves<00:01:54.490> that

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
because we talked about these waves that

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.510 
because we talked about these waves that
come<00:01:55.029> in<00:01:55.240> each<00:01:55.560> successively<00:01:56.560> producing<00:01:57.369> a

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
come in each successively producing a

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.370 
come in each successively producing a
damage<00:01:58.149> here<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.659> we'll<00:01:58.899> have<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.169> watch<00:01:59.319> that

along the seashore because they are 150

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.570 
along the seashore because they are 150
kilometers<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.319> west<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> epicenter

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
kilometers to the west of the epicenter

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.880 
kilometers to the west of the epicenter
and<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.090> thing<00:02:27.299> is<00:02:27.450> moving<00:02:27.599> at<00:02:27.900> 800

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and this thing is moving at 800

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.309 
and this thing is moving at 800
kilometers<00:02:29.459> per<00:02:29.489> hour<00:02:29.700> do<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.599> math<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.170> has

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
kilometers per hour do the math it has

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.130 
kilometers per hour do the math it has
certainly<00:02:31.650> arrived<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.640> arrived<00:02:32.940> with<00:02:33.629> quite
