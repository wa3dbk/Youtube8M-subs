00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.480 
so as I said we're not going to do an
entire<00:01:40.409> shooting<00:01:40.799> demo<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.220> we're<00:01:41.400> not

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
entire shooting demo because we're not

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.380 
entire shooting demo because we're not
really<00:01:41.610> shooting<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.000> we're<00:01:42.090> supposed<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
really shooting what we're supposed to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.030 
really shooting what we're supposed to
but<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:43.079> wanted<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> show<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.619> couple<00:01:43.740> shots

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
but we wanted to show you a couple shots

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
but we wanted to show you a couple shots
as<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.939> installed

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
as you can see we have a installed

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
as you can see we have a installed
trigger<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.470> catches<00:01:46.799> inside<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:48.030> put

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
trigger and the catches inside we put

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
trigger and the catches inside we put
PVC<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> barrel<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.110> could<00:01:49.229> shoot

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
PVC in the barrel so we could shoot

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.980 
PVC in the barrel so we could shoot
normal<00:01:49.860> normal<00:01:50.729> normal<00:01:51.149> darts<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.899> not

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
normal normal normal darts but it's not

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
normal normal normal darts but it's not
actually<00:01:52.229> modified<00:01:52.619> inside<00:01:53.100> anywhere<00:01:53.490> so

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
actually modified inside anywhere so

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
actually modified inside anywhere so
this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.850> still<00:01:54.149> basically<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.930> stock<00:01:55.170> crossbow

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
this is still basically a stock crossbow

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.790 
this is still basically a stock crossbow
so<00:01:55.860> go<00:01:56.070> ahead<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> lovely<00:02:01.770> shot

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.370 

a<00:02:05.330> good<00:02:06.330> thing<00:02:06.480> you<00:02:06.600> hit<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> garage<00:02:06.930> door<00:02:07.350> I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
a good thing you hit the garage door I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.480 
a good thing you hit the garage door I
was<00:02:07.620> afraid<00:02:07.800> you'd<00:02:08.010> miss<00:02:10.040> okay<00:02:11.040> good<00:02:11.280> because

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
was afraid you'd miss okay good because

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.230 
was afraid you'd miss okay good because
I<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:11.760> about<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.970> say<00:02:12.120> you're<00:02:12.300> two<00:02:12.480> feet<00:02:12.630> away

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.760 

okay<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.300> our<00:02:18.480> final<00:02:18.810> review<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.530> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
okay so our final review on that is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
okay so our final review on that is
basically<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:21.000> would<00:02:21.630> recommend<00:02:21.900> these<00:02:22.170> for

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
basically I would recommend these for

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.790 
basically I would recommend these for
$25<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> bad<00:02:24.180> deal<00:02:24.330> for<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:25.020> nicely<00:02:25.620> cut

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
$25 not a bad deal for the nicely cut

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.890 
$25 not a bad deal for the nicely cut
aluminum<00:02:26.010> parts<00:02:26.490> then<00:02:27.060> basically<00:02:27.480> they<00:02:27.870> just

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
aluminum parts then basically they just

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.450 
aluminum parts then basically they just
improve<00:02:28.290> your<00:02:28.440> crossbow<00:02:28.830> overall<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
improve your crossbow overall and the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.000 
improve your crossbow overall and the
cost<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.820> already<00:02:30.120> work<00:02:30.330> Oh<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:31.140> worth<00:02:31.740> is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
cost was already work Oh a worth is

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.120 
cost was already work Oh a worth is
worth<00:02:32.670> money<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.660> I'm<00:02:33.750> trying<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.960> say<00:02:34.130> so

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
worth money is what I'm trying to say so

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.220 
worth money is what I'm trying to say so
this<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.520> makes<00:02:35.640> me<00:02:35.820> even<00:02:35.880> nicer<00:02:36.210> we<00:02:36.870> did<00:02:37.050> buy
