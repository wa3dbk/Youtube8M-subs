00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
GTX 760 you can see right at the top we

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.310 
GTX 760 you can see right at the top we
have<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:28.100> two<00:02:28.700> 6-pin<00:02:29.390> connectors<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.170> need

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
have the two 6-pin connectors you need

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.350 
have the two 6-pin connectors you need
at<00:02:30.440> least<00:02:30.680> 500<00:02:31.160> walk<00:02:31.310> for<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.910> then<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
at least 500 walk for this and then the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.510 
at least 500 walk for this and then the
sli<00:02:32.900> bridge<00:02:32.930> connection<00:02:33.740> right<00:02:34.010> there<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.460> if

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
sli bridge connection right there so if

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.720 
sli bridge connection right there so if
you<00:02:34.640> want<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.940> put<00:02:35.420> these<00:02:35.600> two<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.500> SLI<00:02:37.340> if<00:02:37.610> you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
you want to put these two in SLI if you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.360 
you want to put these two in SLI if you
have<00:02:37.850> another<00:02:38.060> graphics<00:02:38.540> card<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.250> then<00:02:40.250> you

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
have another graphics card and then you

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.340 
have another graphics card and then you
have<00:02:40.550> all<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.910> connections<00:02:41.690> there<00:02:42.050> nicely

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
have all the connections there nicely

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.070 
have all the connections there nicely
covered<00:02:42.830> up<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.060> obviously<00:02:44.750> have<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
covered up so you obviously have the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.450 
covered up so you obviously have the
DisplayPort<00:02:45.800> connection<00:02:46.280> which<00:02:46.430> is

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
DisplayPort connection which is

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.360 
DisplayPort connection which is
important<00:02:47.030> for<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.270> third<00:02:47.450> monitor<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.370> also

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
important for the third monitor and also

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.820 
important for the third monitor and also
a<00:02:49.550> standard<00:02:50.060> HDMI<00:02:50.270> if<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.320> want<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.590> connect

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
a standard HDMI if you want to connect

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.900 
a standard HDMI if you want to connect
this<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> TV<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.740> also<00:02:54.740> you<00:02:54.800> do<00:02:55.160> have<00:02:55.460> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
this to a TV and also you do have the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.880 
this to a TV and also you do have the
two<00:02:56.570> dual<00:02:56.990> link<00:02:57.020> DVI<00:02:57.620> connections<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.560> we

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
two dual link DVI connections and so we

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.100 
two dual link DVI connections and so we
should<00:03:01.070> have<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.340> tutorial<00:03:01.880> on<00:03:02.240> how<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.750> set

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
should have a tutorial on how to set

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.530 
should have a tutorial on how to set
this<00:03:03.470> thing<00:03:03.530> up<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:04.130> three<00:03:04.400> monitors<00:03:04.760> but

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
this thing up with three monitors but

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.170 
this thing up with three monitors but
all<00:03:05.720> those<00:03:05.900> connections<00:03:06.410> are<00:03:06.590> great<00:03:06.890> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
all those connections are great and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.290 
all those connections are great and
it'll<00:03:08.180> help<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.450> do<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:09.640> then<00:03:10.640> looking

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
it'll help you do that then looking

that's<00:04:49.480> on<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:49.690> kind<00:04:50.170> of<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.410> budget<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.800> mean<00:04:50.950> it's

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
that's on a kind of a budget I mean it's

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.360 
that's on a kind of a budget I mean it's
still<00:04:51.250> pretty<00:04:51.960> expensive<00:04:52.960> up<00:04:53.260> there<00:04:53.440> for<00:04:53.650> $300

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
still pretty expensive up there for $300

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.240 
still pretty expensive up there for $300
but<00:04:54.580> if<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.060> want<00:04:55.270> performance<00:04:55.890> EVGA<00:04:56.890> and

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
but if you want performance EVGA and

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.720 
but if you want performance EVGA and
this<00:04:57.850> gtx<00:04:58.600> 760<00:04:58.960> is<00:04:59.200> definitely<00:04:59.980> a<00:05:00.190> great

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
this gtx 760 is definitely a great

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.460 
this gtx 760 is definitely a great
middle<00:05:01.060> road<00:05:01.390> especially<00:05:01.630> if<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.110> don't<00:05:02.320> want

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
middle road especially if you don't want

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.010 
middle road especially if you don't want
to<00:05:02.560> spend<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.430> know<00:05:03.460> $1,000<00:05:04.300> for<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.630> titan

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
to spend you know $1,000 for the titan

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.890 
to spend you know $1,000 for the titan
or<00:05:05.230> seven<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:06.040> six<00:05:06.280> hundred<00:05:06.370> for<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.940> seven

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900

or seven to six hundred for a seven
eighty<00:05:08.170> or<00:05:08.590> about<00:05:09.250> 400<00:05:09.910> for<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.980> 770<00:05:11.980> so<00:05:12.550> this

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
eighty or about 400 for the 770 so this

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.350 
eighty or about 400 for the 770 so this
is<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:12.880> great<00:05:13.120> middle<00:05:13.360> of<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.540> road<00:05:13.780> around<00:05:15.360> 260

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
is a great middle of the road around 260
