off<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.410> Wow<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.910> pull<00:00:30.119> them<00:00:30.210> out

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
off of that Wow you can pull them out

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.200 
off of that Wow you can pull them out
and<00:00:31.040> refinish<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.309> put<00:00:32.579> them<00:00:32.700> back<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and refinish and put them back in so

and refinish and put them back in so
it's<00:00:33.570> very<00:00:33.780> easy<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.590> four<00:00:34.860> or<00:00:34.890> five

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it's very easy just about four or five

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.000 
it's very easy just about four or five
inches<00:00:35.250> that's<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:36.000> okay<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.010> swallows

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
inches that's right okay and swallows

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.340 
inches that's right okay and swallows
barn<00:00:38.489> swallows<00:00:38.969> I've<00:00:39.239> seen<00:00:39.450> swallows<00:00:39.899> that'll

barn swallows I've seen swallows that'll

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.490 
barn swallows I've seen swallows that'll
messed<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> areas<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.960> barn

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
messed up in areas like this the barn

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.790 
messed up in areas like this the barn
swallows<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.280> mud<00:00:44.760> nesting<00:00:45.300> swallows<00:00:45.989> yes

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
swallows the mud nesting swallows yes

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.770 
swallows the mud nesting swallows yes
they<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.340> high<00:00:47.579> areas<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
they like high areas and they like it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.959 
they like high areas and they like it
near<00:00:48.989> water<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.160> could<00:00:50.340> use<00:00:50.489> those<00:00:50.730> same

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
near water and you could use those same

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.010 
near water and you could use those same
techniques<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:52.489> wires<00:00:53.809> stainless<00:00:54.809> steel

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
techniques with wires stainless steel

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
techniques with wires stainless steel
wires<00:00:55.289> that's<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:56.039> okay<00:00:56.370> another

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
wires that's right okay another

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.930 
wires that's right okay another
technique<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.930> use<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.350> mesh<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.550> garden

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
technique is to use a mesh this garden

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
technique is to use a mesh this garden
mesh<00:01:00.149> yeah<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> put<00:01:01.530> some<00:01:01.710> screw

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
mesh yeah and you can put some screw

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.270 
mesh yeah and you can put some screw
eyes<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.270> hang<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> mesh<00:01:04.350> down<00:01:04.680> it's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
eyes in and then hang the mesh down it's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
eyes in and then hang the mesh down it's
a<00:01:05.519> good<00:01:05.729> deterrent<00:01:06.119> because<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> interferes

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
a good deterrent because it interferes

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.820 
a good deterrent because it interferes
the<00:01:08.130> bird's<00:01:08.520> flight<00:01:09.090> patterns<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.380> will

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the bird's flight patterns so they will

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.830 
the bird's flight patterns so they will
go<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.340> another<00:01:11.520> spot<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.570> put<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
go look for another spot you just put it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140 
go look for another spot you just put it
in<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.590> fairly<00:01:13.920> close<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
in you know fairly close to the to the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.690 
in you know fairly close to the to the
side<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> building<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> yeah<00:01:17.460> that's

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
side of the building and yeah that's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.450 
side of the building and yeah that's
about<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.450> tourism<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.159> clear

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
about to tourism and if it's the clear

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.780 
about to tourism and if it's the clear
type<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.750> less<00:01:21.990> noticeable<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.580> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
type then it's less noticeable but that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.820 
type then it's less noticeable but that
will<00:01:24.060> help<00:01:24.360> quite<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> bit<00:01:24.810> well<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.590> easy

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
will help quite a bit well that's easy

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
will help quite a bit well that's easy
cuz<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.280> put<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.549> take<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:27.000> big

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
cuz you can put it up take it down big

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.050 
cuz you can put it up take it down big
whoop<00:01:27.840> dee<00:01:27.960> doo<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.770> okay<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> what
