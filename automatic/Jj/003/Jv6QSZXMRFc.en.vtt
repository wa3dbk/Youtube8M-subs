this<00:00:29.580> glitch<00:00:29.970> has<00:00:30.150> came<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.930> but<00:00:31.230> they

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
this glitch has came out here but they

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.990 
this glitch has came out here but they
have<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.740> patched<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> running

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
have just patched it you do a running

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.209 
have just patched it you do a running
jump<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.719> try<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.739> land<00:00:34.949> on<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
jump and you try to you can land on the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.279 
jump and you try to you can land on the
ledge<00:00:35.399> there<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.819> they<00:00:36.030> put<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> barrier<00:00:36.600> so

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
ledge there but they put a barrier so

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.169 
ledge there but they put a barrier so
you<00:00:37.379> can<00:00:37.559> no<00:00:37.739> longer<00:00:38.039> get<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.519> the<00:00:38.640> side<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
you can no longer get on the side of the

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.880 
you can no longer get on the side of the
building<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.429> now<00:00:42.019> using<00:00:43.019> my<00:00:43.170> Albert

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
building there so now using my Albert

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.450 
building there so now using my Albert
Einstein<00:00:44.429> mind<00:00:45.329> my<00:00:46.199> genius<00:00:46.679> here<00:00:46.949> I<00:00:46.979> was<00:00:47.280> like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
Einstein mind my genius here I was like

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.779 
Einstein mind my genius here I was like
well<00:00:47.699> if<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> side<00:00:48.659> works<00:00:49.309> take<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.339> look<00:00:50.609> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
well if that side works take a look on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.689 
well if that side works take a look on
this<00:00:50.969> side<00:00:51.269> so<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:52.469> hopped<00:00:52.769> my<00:00:52.949> ass<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.549> this

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
this side so I hopped my ass up on this

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.200 
this side so I hopped my ass up on this
ledge<00:00:53.909> here<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.589> I<00:00:55.589> tried<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.309> simple<00:00:56.940> double

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
ledge here and I tried a simple double

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.259 
ledge here and I tried a simple double
jump<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.679> glitch<00:00:58.949> has<00:00:59.219> now<00:00:59.489> been<00:00:59.819> made

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
jump and the glitch has now been made

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.280 
jump and the glitch has now been made
even<00:01:00.569> easier<00:01:01.249> so<00:01:02.249> that's<00:01:02.639> pretty<00:01:02.940> cool<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
even easier so that's pretty cool so you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.709 
even easier so that's pretty cool so you
guys<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.739> still<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.190> this<00:01:05.370> glitch<00:01:05.670> after<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
guys can still do this glitch after the

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.959 
guys can still do this glitch after the
patch<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:08.820> have

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
patch but that is not it they have

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.510 
patch but that is not it they have
actually<00:01:09.509> made<00:01:10.259> this<00:01:10.439> glitch<00:01:10.680> even<00:01:11.009> better<00:01:11.250> by

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually made this glitch even better by

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
actually made this glitch even better by
putting<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:12.119> F<00:01:12.360> by<00:01:12.780> putting<00:01:13.079> a<00:01:13.170> patch<00:01:13.350> on

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
putting the F by putting a patch on

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
putting the F by putting a patch on
there<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.920> added<00:01:14.219> a<00:01:14.280> barrier<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
there they added a barrier so now you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
there they added a barrier so now you
can<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> an<00:01:15.869> even<00:01:16.110> higher<00:01:16.140> spot<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
can get to an even higher spot on the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.389 
can get to an even higher spot on the
top<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.430> roof<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.079> but<00:01:19.079> yeah<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.979> that's

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
top of this roof here but yeah so that's

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.160 
top of this roof here but yeah so that's
a<00:01:20.549> pretty<00:01:20.759> sick<00:01:21.060> glitch<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.659> once<00:01:21.930> you're<00:01:22.049> up

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a pretty sick glitch and once you're up

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
a pretty sick glitch and once you're up
here<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:23.640> hover<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.420> do

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
here you if you put hover on you can do

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.649 
here you if you put hover on you can do
a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.930> jump<00:01:25.289> over<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.210> barrier

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
a little jump over to to this barrier

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.639 
a little jump over to to this barrier
now<00:01:27.899> so<00:01:28.820> there's<00:01:29.820> even<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.390> new<00:01:30.899> extension<00:01:31.469> to
