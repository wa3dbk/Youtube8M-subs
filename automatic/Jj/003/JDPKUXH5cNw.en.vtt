hello YouTube Tim here I've got a little

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.259 
hello YouTube Tim here I've got a little
rod<00:00:09.050> of<00:00:09.290> PVC<00:00:09.980> that's<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:10.639> year<00:00:10.940> I'll<00:00:11.059> show

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
rod of PVC that's this year I'll show

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.669 
rod of PVC that's this year I'll show
you<00:00:11.330> I<00:00:14.019> purchased<00:00:15.019> it<00:00:15.169> from<00:00:15.289> a<00:00:15.440> plastic

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
you I purchased it from a plastic

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.980 
you I purchased it from a plastic
company<00:00:16.430> here<00:00:16.640> in<00:00:16.700> Kansas<00:00:17.120> City<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:17.600> it's

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
company here in Kansas City and it's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.320 
company here in Kansas City and it's
pretty<00:00:18.410> cool<00:00:18.650> I<00:00:19.010> got<00:00:19.190> a<00:00:19.520> whole<00:00:20.000> bunch<00:00:20.210> of

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
pretty cool I got a whole bunch of

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.120 
pretty cool I got a whole bunch of
different<00:00:20.450> plastics<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:21.170> I<00:00:21.260> was<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:21.950> was

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
different plastics and I was this was

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.480 
different plastics and I was this was
over<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.580> year<00:00:22.670> ago<00:00:23.000> I<00:00:23.330> was<00:00:24.020> seeking<00:00:24.470> to<00:00:24.680> find<00:00:25.070> a

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
over a year ago I was seeking to find a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.440 
over a year ago I was seeking to find a
good<00:00:25.760> replacement<00:00:26.150> for<00:00:27.100> wood<00:00:28.100> for<00:00:29.000> using<00:00:29.270> for

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
good replacement for wood for using for

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.750 
good replacement for wood for using for
aero<00:00:29.600> shafting<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.230> said<00:00:30.410> well<00:00:30.590> I<00:00:30.830> don't<00:00:31.490> think

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
aero shafting I said well I don't think

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.580 
aero shafting I said well I don't think
anything<00:00:32.059> will<00:00:32.149> be<00:00:32.270> perfect<00:00:32.719> but<00:00:32.989> if<00:00:33.260> it's

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
anything will be perfect but if it's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.869 
anything will be perfect but if it's
much<00:00:33.829> much<00:00:34.040> much<00:00:34.280> quicker

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
much much much quicker

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.939 
much much much quicker
it<00:00:35.300> could<00:00:35.420> be<00:00:35.539> just<00:00:35.570> right<00:00:35.929> so<00:00:36.469> I<00:00:36.530> tried<00:00:36.769> this

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
it could be just right so I tried this

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.569 
it could be just right so I tried this
this<00:00:37.789> one<00:00:38.030> is<00:00:38.269> 28<00:00:38.719> inches<00:00:38.929> long<00:00:39.410> let<00:00:40.070> me<00:00:40.219> start

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
this one is 28 inches long let me start

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.610 
this one is 28 inches long let me start
to<00:00:40.760> show<00:00:41.089> you<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.539> problems<00:00:42.050> rather<00:00:42.350> than

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
to show you the problems rather than

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:53.459 
to show you the problems rather than
describe<00:00:43.159> the<00:00:43.429> problems<00:00:48.609> grams<00:00:49.609> okay

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:01.809 

28<00:00:54.469> inches<00:00:54.769> remember<00:00:57.190> 75<00:00:58.190> grams<00:00:59.149> just<00:01:00.729> as<00:01:01.729> a

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
28 inches remember 75 grams just as a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.740 
28 inches remember 75 grams just as a
reminder<00:01:02.739> 20<00:01:03.739> grams<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.430> approximately<00:01:05.150> 300

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
reminder 20 grams is approximately 300

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.770 
reminder 20 grams is approximately 300
grains<00:01:06.490> so<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:07.759> like<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.000> thousand<00:01:08.479> grain

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
grains so this is like a thousand grain

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.639 
grains so this is like a thousand grain
arrow<00:01:09.290> right<00:01:09.890> now<00:01:10.189> as<00:01:10.549> it<00:01:11.329> is<00:01:11.360> that<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.320> pretty

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
arrow right now as it is that is pretty

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.480 
arrow right now as it is that is pretty
darn<00:01:12.979> heavy<00:01:13.310> add<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:15.500> at<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:15.860> hundred<00:01:16.100> grain

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
darn heavy add the at a hundred grain

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.109 
darn heavy add the at a hundred grain
tip<00:01:16.909> or<00:01:17.210> more<00:01:17.479> at<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.560> fletching<00:01:18.860> etc<00:01:19.850> and

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
tip or more at the fletching etc and

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.029 
tip or more at the fletching etc and
you're<00:01:20.539> looking<00:01:20.840> at<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.960> really<00:01:21.380> amazingly

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
you're looking at a really amazingly

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.389 
you're looking at a really amazingly
heavy<00:01:22.369> arrow<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:22.939> here's<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.930> other<00:01:24.020> problem

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.590 

it's<00:01:28.509> incredibly<00:01:29.509> low<00:01:30.110> spine<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:31.759> for<00:01:32.329> that

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
it's incredibly low spine so for that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.069 
it's incredibly low spine so for that
weight<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:34.520> only<00:01:34.729> gonna<00:01:34.939> be<00:01:35.030> spine<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:36.049> a

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
weight it's only gonna be spine for a

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.959 
weight it's only gonna be spine for a
bow<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.619> about<00:01:37.570> 15<00:01:38.590> maybe<00:01:39.590> 20<00:01:39.770> pounds<00:01:40.520> maximum

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
bow of about 15 maybe 20 pounds maximum

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.569 
bow of about 15 maybe 20 pounds maximum
I<00:01:41.359> think<00:01:42.320> that's<00:01:42.469> pretty<00:01:42.710> appalling<00:01:43.100> but

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
I think that's pretty appalling but

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.060 
I think that's pretty appalling but
that's<00:01:44.149> about<00:01:44.420> par<00:01:44.689> for<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.960> course<00:01:45.170> PVC<00:01:45.859> is

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
that's about par for the course PVC is

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.639 
that's about par for the course PVC is
very<00:01:46.460> very<00:01:46.759> flexible<00:01:47.289> that's<00:01:48.289> what<00:01:48.500> you

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
very very flexible that's what you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.190 
very very flexible that's what you
expect<00:01:49.070> with<00:01:49.310> materials<00:01:50.000> like<00:01:50.060> PVC<00:01:50.600> horn

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
expect with materials like PVC horn

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.340 
expect with materials like PVC horn
sinew<00:01:51.909> they're<00:01:52.909> all<00:01:53.060> very<00:01:53.509> very<00:01:53.840> similar<00:01:54.170> in

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
sinew they're all very very similar in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.440 
sinew they're all very very similar in
terms<00:01:54.469> of<00:01:54.859> their<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.759> know<00:01:55.880> stiffness

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
terms of their you know stiffness

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.620 
terms of their you know stiffness
they're<00:01:56.659> moduli<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.259> elasticity<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.630> it

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
they're moduli of elasticity so it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.169 
they're moduli of elasticity so it
turned<00:02:00.170> out<00:02:00.289> this<00:02:00.499> didn't<00:02:01.100> work<00:02:01.579> out<00:02:01.820> this

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
turned out this didn't work out this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.700 
turned out this didn't work out this
wasn't<00:02:02.479> going<00:02:02.749> to<00:02:02.840> be<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:03.049> very<00:02:03.289> good<00:02:03.469> arrow

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
wasn't going to be a very good arrow

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.489 
wasn't going to be a very good arrow
material<00:02:04.219> since<00:02:04.460> 15<00:02:05.299> pound<00:02:05.600> bow<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.350> gonna

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
material since 15 pound bow is gonna

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.499 
material since 15 pound bow is gonna
shoot<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.039> thousand<00:02:07.490> grain<00:02:07.700> air<00:02:07.909> oh<00:02:07.939> my<00:02:08.270> gosh

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
shoot a thousand grain air oh my gosh

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.470 
shoot a thousand grain air oh my gosh
that's<00:02:08.840> ridiculous<00:02:09.679> like<00:02:10.670> eight<00:02:10.940> feet<00:02:11.000> per

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
that's ridiculous like eight feet per

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.979 
that's ridiculous like eight feet per
second<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.080> might<00:02:12.800> as<00:02:12.890> well<00:02:12.920> just<00:02:13.159> throw<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.400> rock

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
second I might as well just throw a rock

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.339 
second I might as well just throw a rock
so<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.019> gave<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.590> that

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
so I gave up on that

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.160 
so I gave up on that
for<00:02:17.219> the<00:02:17.310> moment<00:02:17.700> anyway<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.959> know<00:02:19.049> it's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
for the moment anyway you know it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.789 
for the moment anyway you know it's
possible<00:02:19.379> some<00:02:19.859> fiber<00:02:20.129> reinforced<00:02:21.799> plastics

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
possible some fiber reinforced plastics

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.729 
possible some fiber reinforced plastics
FRP<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.609> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.969> get<00:02:24.260> phenolic<00:02:25.260> sand<00:02:25.560> things

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
FRP is you can get phenolic sand things

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.190 
FRP is you can get phenolic sand things
like<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.219> might<00:02:26.639> be<00:02:26.969> serviceable<00:02:27.749> and<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.019> can

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
like that might be serviceable and I can

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440 
like that might be serviceable and I can
get<00:02:28.349> rods<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.799> those<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.159> well<00:02:29.340> if<00:02:29.760> you're

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
get rods of those as well if you're
