00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.350 

so<00:00:00.659> pretty<00:00:01.050> much<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.620> had<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:02.159> remove<00:00:02.490> all<00:00:02.879> the

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so pretty much I had to remove all the

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.619 
so pretty much I had to remove all the
small<00:00:04.200> little<00:00:04.529> grassy<00:00:05.009> plants<00:00:05.670> out<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
small little grassy plants out of the

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.540 
small little grassy plants out of the
corner<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.170> tank<00:00:07.350> because<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.370> hair

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
corner of the tank because the hair

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.680 
corner of the tank because the hair
algae<00:00:08.910> was<00:00:09.120> just<00:00:09.540> growing<00:00:10.110> way<00:00:10.349> too<00:00:10.639> enormous

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
algae was just growing way too enormous

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.010 
algae was just growing way too enormous
and<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:14.580> proved<00:00:15.120> almost<00:00:15.330> impossible

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
and it was it proved almost impossible

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.439 
and it was it proved almost impossible
to<00:00:16.230> kind<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> take<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.789> off<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.210> those

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to kind of take all that off with those

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.640 
to kind of take all that off with those
little<00:00:18.660> tweezers<00:00:19.020> or<00:00:19.850> to<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.600> use<00:00:22.470> some

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
little tweezers or to just use some

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.679 
little tweezers or to just use some
chemical<00:00:22.890> stuff<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.359> off<00:00:24.449> there

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
chemical stuff to get it off there

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.599 
chemical stuff to get it off there
basically<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> didn't<00:00:25.920> want<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> try<00:00:26.340> any<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
basically I didn't want to try any of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.650 
basically I didn't want to try any of
that<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.119> knew<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.359> wouldn't<00:00:27.510> work

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that because I knew it wouldn't work

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
that because I knew it wouldn't work
anyways<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.619> chemical<00:00:28.980> stuff<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> just

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
anyways and the chemical stuff is just

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
anyways and the chemical stuff is just
really<00:00:30.240> bad<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.720> fish<00:00:30.929> anyway<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.500> just

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
really bad for the fish anyway so I just

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.770 
really bad for the fish anyway so I just
took<00:00:31.920> them<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> I'm<00:00:32.969> gonna<00:00:33.180> replace<00:00:33.480> them

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
took them out and I'm gonna replace them

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.100 
took them out and I'm gonna replace them
with<00:00:33.989> new<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:35.219> know<00:00:35.340> healthy<00:00:35.760> plants<00:00:36.149> I've

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
with new you know healthy plants I've

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
with new you know healthy plants I've
noticed<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> hair<00:00:38.070> algae<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
noticed so that the hair algae and the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
noticed so that the hair algae and the
algae<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.570> general<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.230> not<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.860> growing

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
algae in general is not really growing

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
algae in general is not really growing
as<00:00:41.460> much<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.000> has<00:00:42.629> been<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.140> tank<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.620> in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
as much as it has been in my tank in in

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
as much as it has been in my tank in in
the<00:00:44.070> beginning<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:45.210> thinking<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the beginning so I'm thinking that it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.110 
the beginning so I'm thinking that it's
starting<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> die<00:00:47.070> off<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
starting to die off because of the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.869 
starting to die off because of the
chemical<00:00:49.010> media<00:00:50.010> reactor<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.610> I've<00:00:50.760> been

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
chemical media reactor that I've been

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600 
chemical media reactor that I've been
using<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.329> been<00:00:51.449> using<00:00:52.309> carbon<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
using I've been using carbon in that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.939 
using I've been using carbon in that
reactor<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> carbon<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.680> it's

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
reactor and it's a lot of carbon so it's

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
reactor and it's a lot of carbon so it's
not<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> normal<00:00:56.899> amount<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> carbon<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
not like the normal amount of carbon you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
not like the normal amount of carbon you
would<00:00:58.620> find<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.059> filter

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
would find in a little you know filter

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
would find in a little you know filter
bag<00:01:00.660> inside<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> power<00:01:01.379> filter<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
bag inside of a power filter it's it's a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.420 
bag inside of a power filter it's it's a
whole<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:04.199> cylinder<00:01:05.040> filled<00:01:05.280> with

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
whole you know can cylinder filled with

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.420 
whole you know can cylinder filled with
carbon<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.340> what<00:01:08.340> I'm

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
carbon so it's a lot more and what I'm

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.100 
carbon so it's a lot more and what I'm
thinking<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.909> using<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.689> chemical

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
thinking is using that chemical

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.010 
thinking is using that chemical
filtration<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.549> only<00:01:11.810> removes<00:01:12.810> odors

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
filtration in it not only removes odors

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.770 
filtration in it not only removes odors
and<00:01:13.439> stuff<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> water<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> makes<00:01:14.460> water

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
and stuff from the water and makes water

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
and stuff from the water and makes water
considerably<00:01:15.780> clearer<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> also<00:01:16.850> helps

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
considerably clearer but it also helps

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
considerably clearer but it also helps
in<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> fact<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.630> removing<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.290> those<00:01:19.439> these

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
in the fact of removing all those these

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.460 
in the fact of removing all those these
little<00:01:20.100> proteins<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> things<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
little proteins and things like that

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
little proteins and things like that
that<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.799> cause<00:01:23.400> hair<00:01:23.850> algae<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> regular

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that will cause hair algae and regular

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
that will cause hair algae and regular
algae<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.229> grow<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.790> pretty<00:01:27.060> much

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
algae to grow so I'm pretty much

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.480 
algae to grow so I'm pretty much
thinking<00:01:27.299> that's<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> main<00:01:28.229> reason<00:01:28.439> why<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
thinking that's the main reason why the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.910 
thinking that's the main reason why the
hair<00:01:29.670> algae<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.119> starting<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> die<00:01:30.750> off<00:01:30.920> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
hair algae is starting to die off and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
hair algae is starting to die off and
also<00:01:32.070> could<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.820> some<00:01:33.000> other<00:01:33.090> thing

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
also could be because some other thing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.210 
also could be because some other thing
that<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.840> don't<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.740> pretty

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that I just don't know about but pretty

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.280 
that I just don't know about but pretty
much<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.759> my<00:01:36.119> guess<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:37.079> guess

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
much it's just my guess and my guess

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.660 
much it's just my guess and my guess
could<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.619> right<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.950> could<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.250> wrong<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
could be right it could be wrong like I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.460 
could be right it could be wrong like I
said<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> Harold<00:01:40.530> she's<00:01:40.740> dying<00:01:41.009> off<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
said so Harold she's dying off and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.050 
said so Harold she's dying off and
that's<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:43.920> well<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.430> algae<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that's going really well and algae is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
that's going really well and algae is
not<00:01:45.210> growing<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.899> glass<00:01:46.259> walls<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.920> much

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
not growing on the glass walls as much

you<00:05:10.240> know<00:05:10.360> pretty<00:05:10.750> quickly<00:05:11.490> somebody<00:05:12.490> asked

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
you know pretty quickly somebody asked

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.580 
you know pretty quickly somebody asked
me<00:05:12.910> in<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.210> comment<00:05:13.570> section<00:05:13.870> how<00:05:13.900> often<00:05:14.350> I

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
me in the comment section how often I

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.100 
me in the comment section how often I
used<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.220> liquid<00:05:15.490> fertilizer<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:16.960> just

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
used the liquid fertilizer and I just

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.540 
used the liquid fertilizer and I just
wanted<00:05:17.290> to<00:05:17.380> answer<00:05:17.500> that<00:05:17.710> question<00:05:17.860> really

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
wanted to answer that question really

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.430 
wanted to answer that question really
quickly<00:05:18.850> in<00:05:19.030> this<00:05:19.150> video<00:05:19.419> I<00:05:19.660> use<00:05:20.230> liquid

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
quickly in this video I use liquid

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.770 
quickly in this video I use liquid
fertilizer<00:05:21.010> about<00:05:21.400> once<00:05:21.790> every<00:05:22.210> two<00:05:22.510> weeks

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
fertilizer about once every two weeks

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.570 
fertilizer about once every two weeks
you<00:05:22.990> can<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.650> know<00:05:23.770> spread<00:05:24.040> it<00:05:24.160> out<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.310> little

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
you can you know spread it out a little

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.330 
you can you know spread it out a little
more<00:05:24.990> but<00:05:25.990> pretty<00:05:26.500> much<00:05:26.680> I've<00:05:26.860> noticed<00:05:27.190> that

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
more but pretty much I've noticed that

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.010 
more but pretty much I've noticed that
you<00:05:27.729> know<00:05:27.850> once<00:05:28.060> every<00:05:28.300> two<00:05:28.450> weeks<00:05:28.479> is<00:05:28.870> pretty

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
you know once every two weeks is pretty

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.020 
you know once every two weeks is pretty
sufficient<00:05:29.710> but<00:05:30.250> there<00:05:30.400> will<00:05:30.520> be<00:05:30.580> times<00:05:30.880> I

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
sufficient but there will be times I

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.670 
sufficient but there will be times I
forget<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.600> I<00:05:31.690> only<00:05:31.840> do<00:05:32.080> it<00:05:32.200> like<00:05:32.229> once<00:05:32.350> a

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
forget and I only do it like once a

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.920 
forget and I only do it like once a
month<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:33.130> still<00:05:33.700> my<00:05:33.940> plants<00:05:34.300> grow<00:05:34.570> you<00:05:34.810> know

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
month and still my plants grow you know

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.100 
month and still my plants grow you know
quite<00:05:35.470> frequently<00:05:36.510> pretty<00:05:37.510> much<00:05:37.780> just

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
quite frequently pretty much just

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.140 
quite frequently pretty much just
depends<00:05:38.590> on<00:05:38.770> what<00:05:39.250> type<00:05:39.460> of<00:05:39.490> plants<00:05:39.970> you<00:05:40.000> have

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
depends on what type of plants you have

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.300 
depends on what type of plants you have
you<00:05:40.660> have<00:05:40.780> plants<00:05:41.140> that<00:05:41.169> were<00:05:41.320> that<00:05:41.770> are<00:05:41.919> kind

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
you have plants that were that are kind

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.820 
you have plants that were that are kind
of<00:05:42.370> require<00:05:43.270> more<00:05:43.600> fertilizer<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.380> also<00:05:44.530> want

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
of require more fertilizer you also want

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.370 
of require more fertilizer you also want
to<00:05:44.890> do<00:05:45.040> it<00:05:45.190> more<00:05:46.090> often<00:05:46.300> than<00:05:46.750> you<00:05:46.960> know<00:05:47.110> once

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
to do it more often than you know once

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.580 
to do it more often than you know once
every<00:05:47.800> two<00:05:48.010> weeks<00:05:48.040> but<00:05:48.520> for<00:05:49.240> plants<00:05:49.990> for<00:05:50.500> the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
every two weeks but for plants for the

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.350 
every two weeks but for plants for the
plant<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:50.919> I<00:05:50.950> have<00:05:51.160> they<00:05:51.340> grow<00:05:51.550> pretty<00:05:51.580> rapidly

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
plant so I have they grow pretty rapidly

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.420 
plant so I have they grow pretty rapidly
even<00:05:52.570> without<00:05:52.960> fertilizer<00:05:53.470> so<00:05:53.890> the

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
even without fertilizer so the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.950 
even without fertilizer so the
fertilizer<00:05:54.880> just<00:05:55.000> adds<00:05:55.360> an<00:05:55.510> extra<00:05:55.810> little

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
fertilizer just adds an extra little

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.050 
fertilizer just adds an extra little
kick<00:05:56.290> so<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.800> just<00:05:57.280> depends<00:05:57.610> on<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:57.820> type<00:05:58.030> of

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
kick so it just depends on the type of

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.440 
kick so it just depends on the type of
plants<00:05:58.450> you<00:05:58.479> have<00:05:58.570> but<00:05:59.790> mostly<00:06:00.790> I<00:06:00.940> just<00:06:01.030> do<00:06:01.330> it

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
plants you have but mostly I just do it

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.510 
plants you have but mostly I just do it
once<00:06:01.690> every<00:06:01.930> two<00:06:02.200> weeks<00:06:02.470> so<00:06:02.740> things<00:06:03.340> from

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520
