00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.799 
cameras that we use are very small and
the<00:00:32.219> problem<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.640> small<00:00:32.759> cameras<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.540> if

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you're holding them in your hand they

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
you're holding them in your hand they
get<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.480> shaky<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.230> don't<00:00:37.350> wanna<00:00:37.469> have

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
get really shaky and we don't wanna have

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.830 
get really shaky and we don't wanna have
shaky<00:00:37.920> footage<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> show<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.270> use<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
shaky footage on the show so we use a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.920 
shaky footage on the show so we use a
shoulder<00:00:40.440> rig<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.219> stabilization<00:00:41.910> purposes

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
because we can use these cameras and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.670 
because we can use these cameras and
protect<00:02:26.180> them<00:02:26.269> at<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> same<00:02:26.600> time<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.200> get
