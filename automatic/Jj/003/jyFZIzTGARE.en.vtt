00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.620
 today i want to talk about my 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.160
 favorite effects in minecraft 1.5.2 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 Well, let's go as we see in front of me 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.289
 but there is still one regular button when 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.890
 pressing which we will get incredible 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 force 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.150
 behind this and the design is command 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.650
 blocks 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.399
 8 command blocks let's click on 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.210
 button and what you get and us 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.960
 given the effects of watching it was given 8 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 effects is speed with and jumping 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.559
 at 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.899
 only I sent them to the top three was because 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.050
 that if you put on sotochku all 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.590
 choose the air all then night vision 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 a hundred well and everything else is infinite 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.059
 acceleration force with determining damage they 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.000
 bravely if breathing is under water well let's 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.000
 check it all turn it off coo 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.520
 repair turned off I recently checked 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.170
 checked let's check the force first 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:20.850
 check the force look force works 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.880
 let's check the damage resistance so 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.979
 let's check first rather on 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.650
 look acceleration work as we see 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.650
 we break very quickly let's check 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.870
 here we see beat 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.050
 but how do we say life is not surprised 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.830
 well now let's kill all the zombies 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.810
 check night vision 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.160
 close the power of this dark room 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.060
 the room and how to see the night business works 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:01.470
 we check breath under water of the sea and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.080
 watch breath forever 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:10.600
 so check and they are resistant spriggan 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:14.110
 head anesthesia will trigger jumping 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.370
 turning working speed speed 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.570
 also works afterwards damage resistance 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.570
 we checked and that we are not yet verified 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.209
