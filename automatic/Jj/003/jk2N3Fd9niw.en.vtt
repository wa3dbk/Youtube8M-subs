to just stay alive so let's start with

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.620 
to just stay alive so let's start with
the<00:00:35.160> zergling<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.300> those<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the zergling one and for those of you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
the zergling one and for those of you
that<00:00:36.719> don't<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:37.219> whenever<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> base

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
that don't know whenever there's a base

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.100 
that don't know whenever there's a base
unit<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> for

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
unit like this and you see that for

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
unit like this and you see that for
example<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.620> case<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> Zerg<00:00:41.489> lean

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
example in this case it's the Zerg lean

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.180 
example in this case it's the Zerg lean
and<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.270> lost<00:00:42.450> 12<00:00:42.989> base<00:00:43.170> damage<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.950> they

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and they lost 12 base damage so they

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.819 
and they lost 12 base damage so they
went<00:00:44.340> from<00:00:44.489> eight<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.030> seven<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.989> nerf<00:00:46.350> also

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
went from eight to seven that nerf also

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
went from eight to seven that nerf also
carries<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> crackling<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.480> says

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
carries over to crackling so it says

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
carries over to crackling so it says
that<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> zergling<00:00:49.320> lost<00:00:49.500> 12<00:00:49.739> base<00:00:49.860> damage

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that the zergling lost 12 base damage

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.979 
that the zergling lost 12 base damage
but<00:00:50.340> also<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.879> crackling<00:00:51.360> lost<00:00:51.570> 12<00:00:51.840> base

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
but also the crackling lost 12 base

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
last week was not only because the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.050 
last week was not only because the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
crackling was so strong but because

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.940

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
there was no counter to them also they

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.160

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

hopefully after these nurse we actually
stopped<00:01:25.439> seeing<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.860> many<00:01:26.009> crackling<00:01:26.549> players

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
stopped seeing as many crackling players

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.670 
stopped seeing as many crackling players
because<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.299> last<00:01:27.509> week<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.619> was

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
because this last week was just it was

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.050 
because this last week was just it was
insane<00:01:29.070> how<00:01:29.280> many<00:01:29.340> people<00:01:29.640> were<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.880> going

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
insane how many people were just going

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
insane how many people were just going
cracklings<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.780> doing<00:01:31.290> well<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.500> mean<00:01:31.860> some

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
cracklings and doing well I mean some

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.289 
cracklings and doing well I mean some
people<00:01:32.280> were<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> movie<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.090> weren't

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
people were just a movie they weren't

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.580 
people were just a movie they weren't
even<00:01:33.479> micro<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> Marines<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.439> weren't

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
even micro in the Marines they weren't

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.230 
even micro in the Marines they weren't
even<00:01:34.770> using<00:01:34.799> Marines<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:36.000> were<00:01:36.060> doing

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
even using Marines and they were doing

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
even using Marines and they were doing
really<00:01:36.479> well<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.020> obviously<00:01:37.350> not

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
really well and that's obviously not

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.580 
really well and that's obviously not
intended<00:01:38.659> another<00:01:39.659> big<00:01:39.900> nerf<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
intended another big nerf is to the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
intended another big nerf is to the
maury<00:01:40.829> der<00:01:40.890> numerator<00:01:41.549> has<00:01:41.670> been<00:01:41.790> seen<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> lot

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
maury der numerator has been seen a lot

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
maury der numerator has been seen a lot
of<00:01:42.360> nerves<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.409> because<00:01:43.610> about

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
of nerves I think this is because about

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.090 
of nerves I think this is because about
a<00:01:44.670> month<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.180> ago<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.920> in

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
a month or two ago they got that just in

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
a month or two ago they got that just in
general<00:01:47.250> all<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.030> mercenaries<00:01:48.570> health

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
general all the mercenaries health

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
general all the mercenaries health
upgrades<00:01:49.200> were<00:01:49.320> increased<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.009> instead<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
upgrades were increased so instead of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
upgrades were increased so instead of
doing<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.850> meaningless<00:01:51.329> amount<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> help

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
doing like a meaningless amount of help

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260 
doing like a meaningless amount of help
they<00:01:52.380> were<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.799> doing<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.250> good<00:01:53.850> amount

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
they were actually doing a good amount

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.520 
they were actually doing a good amount
for<00:01:54.570> how<00:01:54.630> much<00:01:54.780> money<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> spend<00:01:55.470> for

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
for how much money you had to spend for

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.469 
for how much money you had to spend for
the<00:01:55.680> upgrade<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.189> problem<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.299> maury

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the upgrade the problem was with maury

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.940 
the upgrade the problem was with maury
der<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.380> unit<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:58.740> not

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
der is that it's a unit that's not

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.130 
der is that it's a unit that's not
intended<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> lot<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> health<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.930> once

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
intended to have a lot of health so once

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.569 
intended to have a lot of health so once
you<00:02:01.229> start<00:02:01.439> stacking<00:02:01.920> health<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you start stacking health on it and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.429 
you start stacking health on it and
combine<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.329> its<00:02:03.600> damage<00:02:03.960> output<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
combine that with its damage output it

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.770 
combine that with its damage output it
was<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.740> over<00:02:05.070> performing<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:06.360> kind<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
was just over performing and we kind of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359 
was just over performing and we kind of
struggled<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.259> find<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.619> good<00:02:07.770> good<00:02:08.190> way<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
struggled to find a good good way to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.100 
struggled to find a good good way to
curb<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.729> without<00:02:09.149> weakening<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.720> unit<00:02:09.959> too

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
curb that without weakening the unit too

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.559 
curb that without weakening the unit too
much<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.860> might<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.459> actually<00:02:11.879> gone<00:02:12.209> too

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
much this might have actually gone too

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.110 
much this might have actually gone too
far

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
far

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.149 
far
if<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:13.450> we<00:02:13.629> can<00:02:13.780> undo<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> basically<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.129> it

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
if so we can undo it basically what it

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.000 
if so we can undo it basically what it
happened<00:02:15.549> is<00:02:15.959> every<00:02:16.959> time<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.230> stim<00:02:17.500> now<00:02:17.709> it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
happened is every time you stim now it's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.580 
happened is every time you stim now it's
going<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.519> cost<00:02:18.700> 25<00:02:19.659> health<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
going to cost 25 health and the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.930 
going to cost 25 health and the
concussive<00:02:20.890> shells<00:02:21.159> is<00:02:21.370> not<00:02:21.549> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.760> reduce

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
concussive shells is not going to reduce

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.970 
concussive shells is not going to reduce
this<00:02:22.090> any<00:02:22.299> longer<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:23.080> going<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.290> cost<00:02:23.470> 25

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
this any longer it's going to cost 25

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.220 
this any longer it's going to cost 25
every<00:02:24.459> single<00:02:24.790> time<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.629> might<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.930> too<00:02:26.080> much

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
every single time this might be too much

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.899 
every single time this might be too much
like<00:02:26.409> I<00:02:26.500> said<00:02:26.739> we<00:02:27.010> might<00:02:27.190> end<00:02:27.340> up<00:02:27.489> going<00:02:27.760> back

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
like I said we might end up going back

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.330 
like I said we might end up going back
down<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.120> 20<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.680> either<00:02:29.860> way<00:02:30.099> this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
down to 20 if it is but either way this

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.710 
down to 20 if it is but either way this
is<00:02:30.459> actually<00:02:30.790> feels<00:02:31.120> like<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.329> pretty<00:02:31.540> good

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
is actually feels like a pretty good

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.270 
is actually feels like a pretty good
nerve<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.409> issue<00:02:32.530> was<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:32.799> people<00:02:33.129> were

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
nerve the issue was that people were

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.460 
nerve the issue was that people were
just<00:02:33.569> stimming<00:02:34.569> there<00:02:34.690> were<00:02:34.780> Raiders<00:02:35.049> all<00:02:35.230> day

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
just stimming there were Raiders all day

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.869 
just stimming there were Raiders all day
they<00:02:35.709> didn't<00:02:36.010> really<00:02:36.250> care<00:02:36.459> at<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:36.700> they

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
they didn't really care at all they

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.190 
they didn't really care at all they
would<00:02:37.000> even<00:02:37.480> they<00:02:37.720> weren't<00:02:37.900> even<00:02:37.959> like

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
would even they weren't even like

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.050 
would even they weren't even like
selecting<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.099> small<00:02:39.370> amount<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.790> my<00:02:39.909> writers

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
selecting a small amount of my writers

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.390 
selecting a small amount of my writers
out<00:02:40.329> trying<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.019> box<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.769> just<00:02:41.950> stim<00:02:42.190> those

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
out trying to box it and just stim those

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.000 
out trying to box it and just stim those
they<00:02:42.549> were<00:02:42.610> just<00:02:42.790> stimming<00:02:43.500> crazy<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.769> so

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
they were just stimming crazy like so

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.199 
they were just stimming crazy like so
this<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.310> going<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.519> make<00:02:45.609> them<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:45.970> think

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
this is going to make them have to think

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.210 
this is going to make them have to think
a<00:02:46.299> little<00:02:46.390> bit<00:02:46.569> more<00:02:46.780> about<00:02:47.560> every<00:02:47.920> time<00:02:48.099> that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
a little bit more about every time that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.910 
a little bit more about every time that
they<00:02:48.280> stem<00:02:48.609> and<00:02:49.140> see<00:02:50.140> another<00:02:50.470> few<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
they stem and see another few of the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.059 
they stem and see another few of the
nerves<00:02:51.099> were<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:52.450> basic<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:53.440> armor

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
nerves were just basic like armor

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.559 
nerves were just basic like armor
reductions<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.790> beetle<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.269> devil

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
reductions on the beetle and the devil

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.509 
reductions on the beetle and the devil
dog<00:02:55.720> they<00:02:55.870> both<00:02:56.049> lost<00:02:56.230> 12<00:02:56.620> armor<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.129> these

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
dog they both lost 12 armor and these

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.220 
dog they both lost 12 armor and these
might<00:02:57.730> look<00:02:57.760> like<00:02:58.060> nervous<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:58.750> really<00:02:59.049> what

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
might look like nervous but really what

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.229 
might look like nervous but really what
happened<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.769> that<00:03:00.220> armor<00:03:00.579> instead<00:03:00.879> of<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
happened is that armor instead of it

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.270 
happened is that armor instead of it
being<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.690> their<00:03:01.870> base<00:03:02.109> unit<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.829> got<00:03:03.040> moved

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
being in their base unit it's got moved

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.490 
being in their base unit it's got moved
to<00:03:03.430> their<00:03:03.519> training<00:03:03.970> upgrades<00:03:04.319> so<00:03:05.319> now<00:03:05.440> you

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
to their training upgrades so now you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.930 
to their training upgrades so now you
have<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.709> buy<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:05.890> training<00:03:06.400> upgrades<00:03:06.700> to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
have to buy the training upgrades to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.569 
have to buy the training upgrades to
regain<00:03:07.359> that<00:03:07.390> armor<00:03:07.870> again<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:09.220> reason<00:03:09.489> why

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
regain that armor again the reason why

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.800 
regain that armor again the reason why
we<00:03:09.700> had<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.879> bring<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.150> down<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.329> their<00:03:10.450> base<00:03:10.599> is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
we had to bring it down on their base is

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.059 
we had to bring it down on their base is
because<00:03:11.049> they<00:03:11.200> were<00:03:11.260> kind<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.500> effortlessly

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
because they were kind of effortlessly

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.399 
because they were kind of effortlessly
capping<00:03:12.670> marine<00:03:13.030> damage<00:03:13.450> which<00:03:13.959> was<00:03:14.140> helping

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
capping marine damage which was helping

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.520 
capping marine damage which was helping
them<00:03:14.530> too<00:03:14.709> much<00:03:14.829> early<00:03:15.190> game<00:03:15.370> feed<00:03:16.090> wise<00:03:16.530> not

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
them too much early game feed wise not

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.039 
them too much early game feed wise not
so<00:03:17.709> much<00:03:17.829> as<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.040> crackling<00:03:18.579> but<00:03:19.209> definitely

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
so much as the crackling but definitely

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.050 
so much as the crackling but definitely
significant<00:03:20.739> nonetheless<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.489> then<00:03:21.910> also

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
significant nonetheless and then also

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.690 
significant nonetheless and then also
one<00:03:22.510> final<00:03:22.900> nerf<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> beetle<00:03:24.579> and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
one final nerf this is the beetle and

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.970 
one final nerf this is the beetle and
they<00:03:24.760> lost<00:03:25.000> some<00:03:25.180> structure<00:03:25.720> damage<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.680> the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
they lost some structure damage the the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.349 
they lost some structure damage the the
reason<00:03:27.250> kind<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.700> because<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.180> few

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
reason kind that is because a few

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.720 
reason kind that is because a few
patches<00:03:28.569> ago<00:03:28.959> they<00:03:29.169> got<00:03:29.379> a<00:03:29.650> damaged<00:03:30.280> /<00:03:30.430> upgrade

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
patches ago they got a damaged / upgrade

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.550 
patches ago they got a damaged / upgrade
increase<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.269> they<00:03:31.359> went<00:03:31.480> from<00:03:31.720> one<00:03:32.169> damaged

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
increase so they went from one damaged

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.099 
increase so they went from one damaged
pro<00:03:32.739> upgrade<00:03:32.859> to<00:03:33.190> 2.5<00:03:33.819> which<00:03:34.480> helps<00:03:34.750> him<00:03:34.810> scale

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
pro upgrade to 2.5 which helps him scale

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.800 
pro upgrade to 2.5 which helps him scale
a<00:03:35.139> lot<00:03:35.440> better<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.829> terms<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.190> late<00:03:36.370> game<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
a lot better in terms of late game the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.199 
a lot better in terms of late game the
issue<00:03:37.959> was<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.950> now<00:03:39.250> we<00:03:39.310> had<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.730> unit<00:03:40.060> that

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
issue was is that now we had a unit that

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.150 
issue was is that now we had a unit that
was<00:03:40.359> getting<00:03:40.690> good<00:03:40.840> damage<00:03:41.169> for<00:03:41.319> upgrade<00:03:41.650> that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
was getting good damage for upgrade that

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.770 
was getting good damage for upgrade that
could<00:03:42.340> burrow<00:03:42.579> into<00:03:42.790> your<00:03:42.910> base<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.449> just<00:03:43.569> pop

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
could burrow into your base and just pop

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.509 
could burrow into your base and just pop
up<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.139> kill<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.440> whatever<00:03:45.040> building<00:03:45.400> they

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
up and kill you whatever building they

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.849 
up and kill you whatever building they
wanted<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:46.030> even<00:03:46.959> command<00:03:47.349> centers<00:03:47.620> pretty

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
wanted to even command centers pretty

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.349 
wanted to even command centers pretty
quickly<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.280> hopefully<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:48.940> will<00:03:49.060> curb<00:03:49.329> that

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
quickly so hopefully this will curb that

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.180 
quickly so hopefully this will curb that
a<00:03:49.569> little<00:03:49.870> bit<00:03:49.989> combine<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.470> with<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.799> armor

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
a little bit combine that with the armor

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.789 
a little bit combine that with the armor
nerve<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.639> they'll<00:03:52.239> die<00:03:52.480> hopefully<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:53.260> was

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
nerve and they'll die hopefully I was

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.229 
nerve and they'll die hopefully I was
able<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:54.069> sometimes<00:03:54.519> just<00:03:54.730> being<00:03:54.879> someone's

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
able to sometimes just being someone's

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.879 
able to sometimes just being someone's
base<00:03:55.419> for<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:55.840> long<00:03:56.079> just<00:03:56.440> tearing<00:03:56.739> through

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
base for so long just tearing through

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.099 
base for so long just tearing through
everything<00:03:57.540> let's<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.660> other<00:03:58.810> than<00:03:58.959> that

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
everything let's the other than that

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.920 
everything let's the other than that
there's<00:03:59.620> not<00:03:59.829> much<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.400> marine<00:04:01.000> radius

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
there's not much the marine radius

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.610 
there's not much the marine radius
increase<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.859> few<00:04:03.370> updates<00:04:03.699> ago<00:04:04.090> we<00:04:05.049> limited

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
increase so a few updates ago we limited

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.599 
increase so a few updates ago we limited
the<00:04:05.680> amount<00:04:05.859> of<00:04:06.010> Marines<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.430> could

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
the amount of Marines that could

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.759 
the amount of Marines that could
actually<00:04:06.699> spawn<00:04:07.150> your<00:04:07.389> base<00:04:07.599> unless<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.530> move

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
actually spawn your base unless you move

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.710 
actually spawn your base unless you move
them<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.519> if<00:04:09.879> you<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:10.269> weren't<00:04:10.569> paying

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
them so if you just weren't paying

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.000 
them so if you just weren't paying
attention<00:04:10.870> your<00:04:11.230> Marines<00:04:11.470> they<00:04:11.620> would<00:04:11.769> spawn

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
attention your Marines they would spawn

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.500 
attention your Marines they would spawn
to<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.280> certain<00:04:12.579> radius<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.120> then<00:04:13.209> they<00:04:13.359> would

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
to a certain radius and then they would

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.509 
to a certain radius and then they would
stop<00:04:13.810> which<00:04:14.349> really<00:04:14.379> really<00:04:15.129> helped<00:04:15.370> reduce

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
stop which really really helped reduce

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.770 
stop which really really helped reduce
game<00:04:15.879> lag<00:04:16.090> because<00:04:16.299> there<00:04:16.539> aren't<00:04:16.630> as<00:04:16.750> many

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
game lag because there aren't as many

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.750 
game lag because there aren't as many
units<00:04:17.199> on<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.410> field<00:04:17.680> anymore<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:18.430> people

units on the field anymore of people

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.830 
units on the field anymore of people
that<00:04:18.880> just<00:04:18.910> aren't<00:04:19.209> paying<00:04:19.389> attention<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.810> the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
that just aren't paying attention to the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.130 
that just aren't paying attention to the
Marines<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:22.030> what<00:04:22.180> was<00:04:22.300> happening<00:04:22.719> was<00:04:22.900> once

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
Marines but what was happening was once

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.719 
Marines but what was happening was once
you<00:04:23.260> got<00:04:23.380> your<00:04:23.500> double<00:04:23.710> spawn<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.400> you're

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
you got your double spawn and you're

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.700 
you got your double spawn and you're
responding<00:04:25.030> marines<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.510> lot<00:04:25.719> faster

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
responding marines a lot faster

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.439 
responding marines a lot faster
that<00:04:26.830> little<00:04:27.220> tiny<00:04:27.460> radius<00:04:27.910> was<00:04:28.060> filling<00:04:28.330> up

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
that little tiny radius was filling up

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.900 
that little tiny radius was filling up
too<00:04:28.660> quickly<00:04:28.930> which<00:04:29.259> really<00:04:29.530> led<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:30.039> issues

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
too quickly which really led to issues

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.040 
too quickly which really led to issues
where<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.270> would<00:04:31.389> just<00:04:31.509> stop<00:04:31.780> spawning

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
where you would just stop spawning

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.499 
where you would just stop spawning
Marines<00:04:32.470> if<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:33.250> weren't<00:04:33.430> paying<00:04:33.850> constant

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
Marines if you weren't paying constant

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.210 
Marines if you weren't paying constant
attention<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.199> which<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.069> too

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
attention to it which was just too

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.790 
attention to it which was just too
tedious<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.660> increase<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.110> range<00:04:38.319> by<00:04:38.560> one

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
tedious so increase that range by one

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.040 
tedious so increase that range by one
and<00:04:39.069> you'll<00:04:39.610> notice<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.449> Marines<00:04:40.960> that

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
and you'll notice that the Marines that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.450 
and you'll notice that the Marines that
are<00:04:41.199> spawning<00:04:41.440> in<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.710> little<00:04:41.919> circle<00:04:42.069> have

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
are spawning in that little circle have

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.400 
are spawning in that little circle have
gotten<00:04:42.729> a<00:04:42.789> little<00:04:42.940> bit<00:04:43.120> bigger<00:04:43.330> other<00:04:44.259> than

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
gotten a little bit bigger other than

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.719 
gotten a little bit bigger other than
that<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.800> last<00:04:45.039> one<00:04:45.190> right<00:04:45.400> here<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.699> says

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
that this last one right here it says

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.379 
that this last one right here it says
anti<00:04:46.300> unit<00:04:46.599> tower<00:04:46.750> consumption<00:04:47.500> range<00:04:47.910> 25<00:04:48.910> but

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
anti unit tower consumption range 25 but

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.850 
anti unit tower consumption range 25 but
I<00:04:49.419> think<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:49.900> is<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.080> mistype<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.620> think<00:04:50.800> this

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
I think this is a mistype I think this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.540 
I think this is a mistype I think this
is<00:04:50.919> actually<00:04:51.130> increased<00:04:52.000> support<00:04:52.960> tower

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
is actually increased support tower

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.629 
is actually increased support tower
transfusion<00:04:54.550> range<00:04:54.819> 25<00:04:56.099> the<00:04:57.099> problem<00:04:57.460> was

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
transfusion range 25 the problem was

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.240 
transfusion range 25 the problem was
that<00:04:57.669> some<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.710> mercenaries<00:04:59.710> bases<00:05:00.070> were

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
that some of the mercenaries bases were

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.969 
that some of the mercenaries bases were
not<00:05:00.550> within<00:05:00.970> range<00:05:01.389> of<00:05:01.690> transfusion<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:02.530> you

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
not within range of transfusion and you

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.350 
not within range of transfusion and you
couldn't<00:05:03.250> like<00:05:03.400> for<00:05:03.550> example<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:03.970> was<00:05:04.090> muta

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
couldn't like for example it was muta

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.029 
couldn't like for example it was muta
list<00:05:04.539> that<00:05:04.660> was<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.110> main<00:05:05.289> issue<00:05:05.470> you

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
list that was the main issue you

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.860 
list that was the main issue you
couldn't<00:05:06.370> transfuse<00:05:07.030> your<00:05:07.210> muta<00:05:07.479> list<00:05:07.660> base

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
couldn't transfuse your muta list base

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.990 
couldn't transfuse your muta list base
from<00:05:08.590> your<00:05:08.620> support<00:05:09.039> our<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:09.550> we<00:05:09.669> increase

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
from your support our so we increase

from your support our so we increase
that<00:05:10.180> by<00:05:10.240> one<00:05:10.660> now<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.020> can<00:05:11.259> reach<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.860> mute

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
that by one now you can reach the mute

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.159 
that by one now you can reach the mute
Allah<00:05:12.340> space<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.849> you<00:05:13.360> still<00:05:13.630> cannot<00:05:13.930> reach

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
Allah space and you still cannot reach

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.800 
Allah space and you still cannot reach
your<00:05:14.380> allies<00:05:14.770> command<00:05:15.310> center<00:05:15.639> which<00:05:16.270> I<00:05:16.630> don't

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
your allies command center which I don't

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.990 
your allies command center which I don't
know<00:05:16.870> if<00:05:16.930> that<00:05:17.050> be<00:05:17.139> an<00:05:17.229> issue<00:05:17.349> or<00:05:17.470> not<00:05:17.680> but

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
know if that be an issue or not but

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.689 
know if that be an issue or not but
you're<00:05:19.000> not<00:05:19.150> able<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:19.479> do<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.690> nonetheless<00:05:19.900> and

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
you're not able to do it nonetheless and

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.649 
you're not able to do it nonetheless and
that's<00:05:21.699> basically<00:05:21.970> about<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.389> for<00:05:22.539> this

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
that's basically about it for this

the<00:05:28.659> game<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:28.870> played<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.500> I<00:05:29.650> don't<00:05:29.830> really

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
the game is played and I don't really

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.560 
the game is played and I don't really
cover<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.370> bug<00:05:30.520> fixes<00:05:30.909> either<00:05:31.060> because<00:05:31.419> that

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
cover the bug fixes either because that

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.520 
cover the bug fixes either because that
stuff<00:05:31.720> that<00:05:31.960> really<00:05:32.050> should<00:05:32.320> have<00:05:32.409> been

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
stuff that really should have been

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.100 
stuff that really should have been
working<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:33.220> begin<00:05:33.460> with<00:05:33.639> so<00:05:33.880> basically<00:05:34.449> to

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
working to begin with so basically to

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.050 
working to begin with so basically to
sum<00:05:35.139> up<00:05:35.289> this<00:05:35.500> patch<00:05:35.740> i<00:05:35.919> would<00:05:36.039> say<00:05:36.250> crackling

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
sum up this patch i would say crackling

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.279 
sum up this patch i would say crackling
is<00:05:37.150> not<00:05:37.240> as<00:05:37.360> strong<00:05:37.659> anymore<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:38.169> don't

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
is not as strong anymore you don't

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.540 
is not as strong anymore you don't
really<00:05:38.470> have<00:05:38.620> to<00:05:38.680> worry<00:05:38.800> about<00:05:39.130> it<00:05:39.400> they're

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
really have to worry about it they're

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.159 
really have to worry about it they're
not<00:05:39.580> able<00:05:39.909> to<00:05:40.090> get<00:05:40.240> there<00:05:40.479> early<00:05:40.659> feed<00:05:41.050> that

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
not able to get there early feed that

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.350 
not able to get there early feed that
they<00:05:41.259> were<00:05:41.320> before<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:42.130> I<00:05:42.340> mean<00:05:43.000> of<00:05:43.180> course

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
they were before so I mean of course

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.640 
they were before so I mean of course
still<00:05:43.659> pay<00:05:43.810> attention<00:05:44.199> to<00:05:44.259> it<00:05:44.349> if<00:05:44.409> you<00:05:44.469> see

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
still pay attention to it if you see

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.659 
still pay attention to it if you see
someone<00:05:44.860> that's<00:05:45.039> going<00:05:45.159> crackling<00:05:45.580> and

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
someone that's going crackling and

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:46.649 
someone that's going crackling and
they're<00:05:45.820> doing<00:05:45.969> really<00:05:46.180> well<00:05:46.389> you're<00:05:46.570> going

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
they're doing really well you're going

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.089 
they're doing really well you're going
to<00:05:46.750> want<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:46.990> counter<00:05:47.259> them<00:05:47.409> but<00:05:47.830> you<00:05:47.919> don't

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
to want to counter them but you don't

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:49.499 
to want to counter them but you don't
have<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.280> just<00:05:48.550> blind<00:05:48.849> counter<00:05:49.210> crackling

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
have to just blind counter crackling

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.330 
have to just blind counter crackling
every<00:05:49.870> game<00:05:50.020> hopefully<00:05:50.320> once<00:05:51.009> the<00:05:51.159> game

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
every game hopefully once the game

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.040 
every game hopefully once the game
changes<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.030> people<00:05:52.240> stop<00:05:52.419> going<00:05:52.780> as<00:05:52.870> much

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
changes and people stop going as much

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.279 
changes and people stop going as much
crackling<00:05:53.759> that'll<00:05:54.759> be<00:05:54.849> a<00:05:54.880> really<00:05:55.120> good<00:05:55.210> thing

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
crackling that'll be a really good thing

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.240 
crackling that'll be a really good thing
other<00:05:56.289> than<00:05:56.409> that<00:05:56.500> if<00:05:56.740> you<00:05:56.830> guys<00:05:56.979> actually

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
other than that if you guys actually

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.490
