natural

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
natural

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.910 
natural
is<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.429> more<00:00:08.670> regular<00:00:09.059> or<00:00:09.540> goofy<00:00:09.650> if<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.889> a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
is it more regular or goofy if you are a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.799 
is it more regular or goofy if you are a
go<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.700> know<00:00:11.820> mean<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.330> don't<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
go you know mean so I don't have a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.060 
go you know mean so I don't have a
filmer<00:00:13.080> today<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.380> I'm<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.740> try<00:00:13.920> out

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
filmer today so I'm going to try out

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.609 
filmer today so I'm going to try out
just<00:00:14.610> filming<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.240> my<00:00:15.299> tripod<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> first

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
just filming on my tripod so the first

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.900 
just filming on my tripod so the first
thing<00:00:16.740> I'll<00:00:16.859> talk<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.250> foot<00:00:17.490> placement

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
thing I'll talk about is foot placement

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.480 
thing I'll talk about is foot placement
if<00:00:18.260> you're<00:00:19.260> skating<00:00:19.529> goofy<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.369> flip

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
if you're skating goofy and you can flip

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
if you're skating goofy and you can flip
position<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.210> then<00:00:21.449> obviously

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
position is like this then obviously

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.359 
position is like this then obviously
your<00:00:21.900> switch<00:00:22.080> flip<00:00:22.289> position<00:00:22.380> should<00:00:23.189> be<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
your switch flip position should be the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.830 
your switch flip position should be the
exact<00:00:23.580> same<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.150> switch<00:00:24.330> people<00:00:24.600> always

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
exact same but switch people always

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.880 
exact same but switch people always
think<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.170> if<00:00:25.320> you're<00:00:25.470> doing<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.710> trick

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
think that if you're doing a trick

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.560 
think that if you're doing a trick
switch<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.609> should<00:00:26.939> be<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> different<00:00:27.449> foot

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
switch it should be a different foot

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
switch it should be a different foot
position<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.109> more<00:00:28.289> off<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> side<00:00:28.769> or

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
position or like more off to the side or

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.200 
position or like more off to the side or
it's<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.460> better<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.849> into<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> habit

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it's really better to get into the habit

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
it's really better to get into the habit
of<00:00:30.510> having<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.810> feet<00:00:30.990> placement<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.949> exactly

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
of having your feet placement be exactly

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.860 
of having your feet placement be exactly
the<00:00:32.460> same<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.940> tre<00:00:33.750> flip<00:00:34.610> switch<00:00:35.610> tre<00:00:35.820> flip<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the same so tre flip switch tre flip and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.869 
the same so tre flip switch tre flip and
same<00:00:37.110> goes<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.290> nollie<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:38.280> try<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> keep<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
same goes for nollie but try to keep the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
same goes for nollie but try to keep the
foot<00:00:39.030> placement<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> same<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.020> it'll

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
foot placement the same and then it'll

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
foot placement the same and then it'll
feel<00:00:40.829> more<00:00:41.010> natural<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.969> when<00:00:42.450> you're

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
feel more natural to so when you're

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.959 
feel more natural to so when you're
doing<00:00:42.660> tricks<00:00:42.960> which<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.340> most<00:00:44.670> people

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
doing tricks which I and most people

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.540 
doing tricks which I and most people
usually<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.559> tail<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> board

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
usually have the tail of the board

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.160 
usually have the tail of the board
actually<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> nose<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> board<00:00:48.899> only

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
actually be the nose of the board only

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690 
actually be the nose of the board only
when<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.530> adding<00:00:49.620> switch<00:00:49.890> I'll<00:00:50.460> kind<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
when you're adding switch I'll kind of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
when you're adding switch I'll kind of
show<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.000> mean<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> tail

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
show you what I mean so this is the tail

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
show you what I mean so this is the tail
of<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.800> board<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> nose<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.420> board

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
of my board this is the nose of my board

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.869 
of my board this is the nose of my board
if<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:55.079> skating<00:00:55.410> goofy<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> way

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
if I'm skating goofy which is the way

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
if I'm skating goofy which is the way
normally<00:00:57.239> skate<00:00:57.930> I'll<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.010> way

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
normally skate I'll be going this way

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
normally skate I'll be going this way
the<00:00:59.940> tail<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> board<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> back<00:01:00.780> obviously

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the tail of the board and back obviously

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.770 
the tail of the board and back obviously
thumbs<00:01:01.920> getting<00:01:02.219> switched<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.660> going

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
thumbs getting switched I will be going

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
thumbs getting switched I will be going
this<00:01:03.930> way<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.040> nose<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.369> won't<00:01:05.610> flip<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
this way and the nose I won't flip the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149 
this way and the nose I won't flip the
board<00:01:06.119> around<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.659> will<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.530> nose<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> my

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
board around I will have a nose of my

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
board around I will have a nose of my
board<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> tail<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.390> board<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
board be the tail of my board when it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.160 
board be the tail of my board when it's
games<00:01:10.080> when<00:01:10.530> I'm<00:01:10.619> skating<00:01:10.860> switch<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
games when I'm skating switch like that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.539 
games when I'm skating switch like that
so<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> reason<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.070> then<00:01:14.310> people

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so the reason I do that and then people

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.070 
so the reason I do that and then people
to<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.900> you're

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
to do that is because when you're

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.730 
to do that is because when you're
skating<00:01:16.259> nollie<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:18.140> put<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
skating nollie that put that put the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
skating nollie that put that put the
foot<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.009> popping<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:21.600> front

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
foot this popping which is your front

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.570 
foot this popping which is your front
foot<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.049> you're<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.259> knowledge<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.740> going

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
foot if you're going knowledge is going

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
foot if you're going knowledge is going
to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:24.270> back<00:01:24.570> foot<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.140> you're<00:01:25.290> going

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to be your back foot if you're going

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
to be your back foot if you're going
switch<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.369> used<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> popping<00:01:26.970> like

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
switch so if you used to popping like

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.640 
switch so if you used to popping like
this<00:01:27.600> nollie<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
this nollie then it's going to be the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
this nollie then it's going to be the
same<00:01:28.890> popping<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> tail<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:30.299> you're

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
same popping on the tail when you're

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.039 
same popping on the tail when you're
going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> switch

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
going to switch

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.730 
going to switch
that's<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:31.920> reasoning<00:01:32.220> behind<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
that's just my reasoning behind it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.800 
that's just my reasoning behind it
so<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.460> I'm<00:01:35.850> skating<00:01:36.390> goofy

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
so here as you can see I'm skating goofy

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.900 
so here as you can see I'm skating goofy
the<00:01:37.020> way<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> normally<00:01:37.320> skate<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:38.490> board<00:01:38.760> is

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
the way I normally skate my board is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.400 
the way I normally skate my board is
facing<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:39.510> way<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.050> tail<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
facing the right way with the tail and

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.500 
facing the right way with the tail and
back<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.800> nose<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.160> front<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.610> my

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
back of the nose on the front and my

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
back of the nose on the front and my
feet<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.900> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> position<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.160> I<00:01:44.310> kickflip

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.990 

so<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.830> see<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.370> skating<00:01:50.610> switch

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so here you see that I'm skating switch

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.450 
so here you see that I'm skating switch
my<00:01:51.660> feet<00:01:51.900> are<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.440> same<00:01:52.650> capable<00:01:53.010> position

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
my feet are in the same capable position

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.890 
my feet are in the same capable position
but<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.850> other<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.150> because<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.660> going<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
but the other way because I'm going to

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.400 
but the other way because I'm going to
switch<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:56.240> my<00:01:57.240> board<00:01:57.510> is<00:01:57.720> backward<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
switch and my board is backward with the

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.040 
switch and my board is backward with the
tail<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:58.920> front<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> nose<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> back<00:02:03.050> so

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
tail and front and the nose and back so

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.520 
tail and front and the nose and back so
I<00:02:04.080> really<00:02:04.650> think<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.010> skating<00:02:05.790> switch<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
I really think that skating switch is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.690 
I really think that skating switch is
fifty<00:02:07.530> percent<00:02:07.740> mental<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.280> fifty<00:02:08.490> percent

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
fifty percent mental and fifty percent

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.390 
fifty percent mental and fifty percent
physical<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.780> mental<00:02:09.929> part<00:02:10.170> being<00:02:10.470> it's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
physical and the mental part being it's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.770 
physical and the mental part being it's
the<00:02:11.610> exact<00:02:11.850> same<00:02:11.880> thing<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.420> already<00:02:12.540> do

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the exact same thing you can already do

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.510 
the exact same thing you can already do
but<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.530> facing<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.950> other<00:02:14.010> way<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.220> why

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
but just facing the other way so why

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.340 
but just facing the other way so why
can't<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.030> way<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.390> set<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.290> your

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
can't you do it that way so set up your

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
can't you do it that way so set up your
feet<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> same<00:02:16.860> set<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:17.340> your<00:02:17.550> mindset<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
feet the same set up your mindset the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.120 
feet the same set up your mindset the
same<00:02:18.209> pretty<00:02:19.200> much<00:02:19.440> set<00:02:19.620> up<00:02:19.680> everything

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
same pretty much set up everything

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.280 
same pretty much set up everything
exactly<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.580> same<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.780> you'll<00:02:22.020> be<00:02:22.110> able<00:02:22.170> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
exactly the same and you'll be able to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.020 
exactly the same and you'll be able to
do<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> 50<00:02:23.220> percent<00:02:23.340> physical<00:02:23.850> part

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
do it and the 50 percent physical part

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.690 
do it and the 50 percent physical part
of<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> fact<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.410> your<00:02:26.340> muscles

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
of it is just the fact that your muscles

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.550 
of it is just the fact that your muscles
haven't<00:02:27.030> actually<00:02:27.720> grown<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.260> able<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.410> do

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
haven't actually grown to be able to do

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.110 
haven't actually grown to be able to do
what<00:02:28.709> they<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.950> do<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.190> other<00:02:29.310> way<00:02:29.459> which<00:02:30.000> is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
what they can do the other way which is

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.490 
what they can do the other way which is
why<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.959> that's<00:02:31.110> why<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
why you like that's why you have to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140 
why you like that's why you have to
practice<00:02:31.920> because<00:02:32.100> obviously<00:02:32.340> you're<00:02:33.090> not

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
practice because obviously you're not

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.280 
practice because obviously you're not
going<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.420> good<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.630> skating<00:02:33.840> switch<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
going to be good at skating switch the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.330 
going to be good at skating switch the
first<00:02:34.470> time<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.680> skate<00:02:34.800> switch<00:02:35.040> because<00:02:35.220> your

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
first time you skate switch because your

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.030 
first time you skate switch because your
muscles<00:02:35.610> haven't<00:02:35.850> grown<00:02:35.940> into<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.330> yet<00:02:36.510> so

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
muscles haven't grown into that yet so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.110 
muscles haven't grown into that yet so
getting<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.160> mindset<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.850> start

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
getting in the mindset of it and start

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.250 
getting in the mindset of it and start
practicing<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.780> next<00:02:39.959> thing<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.140> know

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
practicing the next thing you know

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.090 
practicing the next thing you know
you'll<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.709> as<00:02:40.830> good<00:02:40.890> as<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.070> are

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
you'll be just as good as you are

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.340 
you'll be just as good as you are
regular<00:02:41.750> rubbing<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.870> you'll<00:02:43.080> be<00:02:43.110> getting

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
regular rubbing up you'll be getting

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.680 
regular rubbing up you'll be getting
better<00:02:43.519> so<00:02:44.519> another<00:02:44.730> big<00:02:45.150> part<00:02:45.300> skating

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
better so another big part skating

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.000 
better so another big part skating
switches<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> way<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.290> push<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.830> you're

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
switches the way you push if you're

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.470 
switches the way you push if you're
goofy<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.610> know<00:02:47.730> mat<00:02:47.880> push<00:02:48.060> with<00:02:48.209> your<00:02:48.330> left

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
goofy you know mat push with your left

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.720 
goofy you know mat push with your left
foot<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.350> when<00:02:50.100> you're<00:02:50.220> switched<00:02:50.489> your

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
foot like that when you're switched your

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.900 
foot like that when you're switched your
main<00:02:50.880> your<00:02:51.360> first<00:02:51.660> guess<00:02:52.560> idea<00:02:53.040> thing<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.519> to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
main your first guess idea thing is to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.310 
main your first guess idea thing is to
push<00:02:54.150> with<00:02:54.300> your<00:02:54.330> left<00:02:54.570> foot<00:02:54.630> again<00:02:54.840> don't

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
push with your left foot again don't

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.860 
push with your left foot again don't
really<00:02:55.470> used<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.160> push<00:02:56.340> manga<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.060> that's

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
really used it and push manga and that's

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.850 
really used it and push manga and that's
what<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.050> lot<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.200> people<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:58.530> that's<00:02:58.620> what<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.800> do

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
what a lot of people do that's what I do

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.070 
what a lot of people do that's what I do

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
in some of my videos but it's a way

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.110 
in some of my videos but it's a way
better<00:03:01.260> habit<00:03:01.650> which<00:03:02.370> are<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:02.880> awkward

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
better habit which are just as awkward

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.580 
better habit which are just as awkward
as<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.360> feel<00:03:03.540> put<00:03:03.780> your<00:03:03.930> other<00:03:04.080> foot<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.410> front

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and push what would be regular

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.750 
and push what would be regular
if<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.350> skated<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.890> way<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:08.400> because<00:03:08.550> it's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
if you skated that way but because it's

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.820

thing<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:25.980> noticed<00:03:26.040> helps<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.610> lot<00:03:26.790> which

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
thing that I noticed helps a lot which

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.610 
thing that I noticed helps a lot which
seems<00:03:27.570> weird<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.080> write<00:03:28.230> with<00:03:28.380> your<00:03:28.470> less

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

seems weird is to write with your less
dominant<00:03:28.830> hand

dominant hand

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.959 
dominant hand

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:30.969 
and I don't know what that does but does

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.849 
and I don't know what that does but does
