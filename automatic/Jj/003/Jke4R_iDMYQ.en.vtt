00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.150
 this new test way today i am here for 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.699
 to introduce you let's say the machinery for 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.429
 the automatic ration of the IFA in automatic 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.830
 the mixed ration and you put the yarn 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:33.010
 whether it is fermented or not 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.700
 insert the straw and grass and before 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.700
 he who have 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.829
 action 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.550
 then 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.550
 no one who loves me 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.820
 and that he certainly sees already seen 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000
 debt 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.030
 the eight 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.630
 the balance 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630
 to say 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.200
 and a little more on the plane 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140
 I was fine 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.500
 near by 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130
 Table 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.310
 via green therefore 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.340
 and what 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.860
 works with wagons inserted as a way 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.570
 because dear original as there is 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.570
 put it down and whatever else 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.280
 not loaded before me 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.280
 and even now though 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.680
 as you can see they are 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.680
 today of animations 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.020
 four of the five copies 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.020
 we see that today 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.629
 get out 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.209
 the Florentines need laughter 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.370
 you have seen that the two presentations 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.370
 they work great and have a symbol 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.860
 the decline 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.489
 bullish pessotto 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.489
 corrado 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.390
 immoral loaded 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.390
 carlos valdez 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.720
 but I refuse 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.240
 from here single framework 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.240
 I speak 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.920
 Street 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.920
 in that color 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:53.700
 the fault the various ones and so on however 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:55.730
 we hope we have 3.164 reload 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.730
 is 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.720
 4 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:06.520
 4 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.520
 here they are at 4600 so it works dida 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.970
 General 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.650
 it should be helped 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.870
 I have to give some gas time to see 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.150
 if the light changed if for example that 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.990
 it turned red and flashed yellow 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.990
 to say if 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.340
 if it ends up in yarn finish a 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.199
 product 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.930
 from a report as soon as 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.520
 bought the flashed in red 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.910
 through a void 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.240
 I wanted to see exactly what he was doing 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.240
 clear 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.389
 seas 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.900
 I will explain to you his advised 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.900
 cabbage 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.940
 I would say that this is also the way text 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:41.700
 that's all 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.700
 simple thing effective 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.980
 because you have chosen this even more for 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.940
 the 15 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.030
 so I leave the link descriptions 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.650
 we were well commented 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.340
 sign up for a nice lay 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.340
