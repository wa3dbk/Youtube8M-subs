00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.840
 Hello pilots! 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.520
 Talk about team play. 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.680
 What is the advantage given ligament? 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.680
 How to find them and create? 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.640
 How to communicate with other players? 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.960
 From what aircraft to create the most effective schemes? 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.720
 All in turn. 

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.650
 "Flight School" 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.040
 The game «World of Warplanes» to load the table can be seen combat aircraft with icons and numbers. 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.360
 This icon indicates that the player is part of a bundle. 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.520
 A number indicates the number of bundles in the team - when one team gets a few ligaments. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.000
 Bundle - a combat unit, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.560
 which consists of a commander, leading the ligaments, and manage it. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 In different countries there are different schools of creating bundles. 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
 The German school planes flew a pair and four, 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.440
 because this scheme makes better use of the speed advantage. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.160
 In other schools, including the Soviet, ligament was in the form of the Latin letter «V»: 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.360
 front middle - vyadovets, behind and on both sides - controlled. 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.120
 Number of aircraft itself - is not a decisive factor. 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.840
 More important are the habits and skills of players, 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.080
 and a bunch of allowing not just put them, but also to multiply on the effectiveness of joint action. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.880
 Timely risk assessment and joint actions to neutralize it - the basis of the survival and success of the game in the bundle. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.800
 Harmonious bunch of good players increase their effectiveness several times ... 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.280
 until he met up with another strong ligament. 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.000
 Players in tandem can more effectively focus on the goals, 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.600
 attacking simultaneously from different directions and bring them down faster 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.560
 as well as to cover each other, destroying the individual planes attacking. 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.440
 This bundle allows all to be very effective in random battles. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.440
 The result - significantly multiplied experience, loans and, of course, improved statistics. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 The game «World of Warplanes» commune in the bundle can be found in several ways: 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.640
 Offline, in the corresponding channel of the game, or battle. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.440
 The most convenient - to use a special channel for the game "Search ligament or clan." 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.200
 In order to create a bundle, simply press a special button 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.320
 and choose who to invite from friends. 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.720
 Or through a search to find the pilot with whom you are going to fly in tandem. 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.240
 Team play is important to be able to communicate with other players in the bunch, keeping hands on driving. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.960
 The game allows you to talk on the microphone cords inside. 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.240
 Voice communication is included in the settings menu. 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.520
 Quality communication in tandem - is: 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.000
 short, informative value and effectiveness. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.880
 Use voice communication: 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.520
 it allows for more interaction in the bundle. 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.960
 Try to specify the purposes for which you attack (predetermined button - Latin «T»), - 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120
 this is a very good habit. 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.240
 Bundles can consist of aircraft of the same level or different. 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.760
 With a single-level, everything is clear - to play the same type of aircraft easier. 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.160
 Especially - if it is fast planes. 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.480
 Multilevel scheme only logical to take in order to improve the consistency of the game on a particular technique. 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.080
 If you selected the opposing team, balancing mechanism takes into account the highest level of ligament aircraft. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 Aircraft different levels have different correlation parameters maneuverability, speed, and firepower: 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.960
 higher levels - faster and less maneuverable. 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.200
 Also the cards differ in size so that at high levels of aircraft 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.280
 of these performance characteristics to play comfortably. 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.440
 In addition, stronger and anti-aircraft guns. 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.200
 Each level match their cards. 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.320
 If your bundle is not ranked in the top of the list, do not despair: 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.280
 can bring a lot to the team, if you do not die, 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.720
 but, for example, monitor the database and protect it from enemy attack aircraft. 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.840
 The game «World of Warplanes» planes are divided into technical specifications - 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.560
 and, respectively, for the role in combat. 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.360
 At higher levels, where one engagement encountered with jet airplanes and piston engines, 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.520
 heavy fighter and ground attack aircraft, 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.600
 There is staging - optimum height of the battle. 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.280
 The jet, piston and attack aircraft - their stage. 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.960
 Therefore ligament can be divided into those that act in one step and those that operate in different. 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.160
 As binder one step are the following scheme: 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.960
 Three heavy fighters; 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.760
 one fighter and two heavy - or two fighters and one heavy, where fighters - high-rise; 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.200
 three fighters - 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.360
 wherein the high rise, according to its specifications, 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.120
 climb slightly smaller height than the heavy fighters. 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.520
 aircraft bundles with different stages are as follows: 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.680
 attack and two fighters 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.960
 Two attack aircraft and fighter, 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.480
 Two attack aircraft and heavy fighter, 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.000
 attack aircraft and two heavy fighters, 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.280
 attack, fighter and a heavy fighter, 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.320
 couple - a fighter and a hard fighter. 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.360
 Bunch of one stage better interact in a fight, 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.280
 have better mutual support, response time, the ability to change the construction, 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.240
 he reveals the great skill in such maneuvers as "Falcon attack" and close air combat. 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.040
 A bunch of different stages - more interesting in the strategic plan and is useful at high levels, 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.080
 which increases the value of teamwork, the ability to pilot does not fly away on the map. 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.480
 Pilots must also fly on one side: 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.880
 while vysotniki cover those flying below. 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.200
 If one is found the plane, 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.880
 two fighters bundles "work through" it, and attack goes undercover. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.600
 When two aircraft, a bunch of fighters operate paznachnikah and cover each other. 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.360
 If the enemy has great power, it is desirable to avoid the fire contact. 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.560
 In the next issue of "Summer School", you will learn about the main tactics of the bunch. 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.560
 On this - everything. Success in battle!
