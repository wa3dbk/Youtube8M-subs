00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
is to sort of steady your aim so you

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
is to sort of steady your aim so you
don't<00:02:38.630> talk<00:02:39.640> maybe<00:02:40.640> feel<00:02:40.880> your<00:02:41.450> arms<00:02:41.500> things

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500

don't talk maybe feel your arms things
aren't<00:02:42.709> steady<00:02:43.010> enough<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.519> may<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:44.079> move

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
aren't steady enough you may be move

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.839 
aren't steady enough you may be move
over<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.560> target<00:02:45.769> when<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.129> hit<00:02:46.280> fine<00:02:46.489> and

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
over the target when you hit fine and

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.759 
over the target when you hit fine and
you<00:02:47.120> want<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.329> move<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.079> slower<00:02:48.379> aiming

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769

that's<00:02:52.180> fine<00:02:53.180> fair<00:02:53.690> enough<00:02:53.900> but

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
that's fine fair enough but

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.770 
that's fine fair enough but
you're<00:02:55.760> gonna<00:02:55.909> look<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.269> move<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.659> a<00:02:56.719> girl
