because jugs the hallways the perk that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060 
because jugs the hallways the perk that
you<00:00:51.629> should<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.559> my<00:00:52.710> opinion

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you should get first in my opinion

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.380

especially<00:00:53.399> though<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.090> don't<00:00:54.239> have

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

to<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:10.409> down<00:01:10.619> without<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.490> comes<00:01:11.729> in

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to go down without and that comes in

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.270 
to go down without and that comes in
handy<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.140> jug<00:01:13.500> then

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
handy because if you don't have jug then

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.249 
handy because if you don't have jug then
it<00:01:14.460> will<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.939> two<00:01:15.210> hits<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.750> down<00:01:15.990> and

it will take you two hits to go down and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.830 
it will take you two hits to go down and
that's<00:01:16.320> very<00:01:16.830> easy<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.490> zombies<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.659> very

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that's very easy to get zombies are very

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.609 
that's very easy to get zombies are very
powerful<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.189> opinion<00:01:21.200> but<00:01:22.200> yeah<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
powerful in my opinion but yeah you can

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
powerful in my opinion but yeah you can
train<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.460> area<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.850> wouldn't

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
train this little area I wouldn't

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
train this little area I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> higher<00:01:25.350> rounds

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
recommend it in the higher rounds

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
recommend it in the higher rounds
because<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.270> probably<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.900> ass<00:01:28.049> handed

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
because you probably get your ass handed

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
because you probably get your ass handed
to<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.710> because<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.430> come<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.700> too<00:01:30.090> many

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to you because I just come from too many

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.660 
to you because I just come from too many
directions<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.979> too<00:01:32.189> many<00:01:32.400> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
directions and it's just too many of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.310 
directions and it's just too many of
them<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.479> even<00:01:33.600> trained<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.170> these

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
them you can even trained in these

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.120 
them you can even trained in these
corridors<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.280> area<00:01:36.020> because<00:01:37.040> it's<00:01:38.040> just

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
corridors in this area because it's just

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.249 
corridors in this area because it's just
being<00:01:38.460> prepared<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> shoot<00:01:39.509> some<00:01:39.750> zombies<00:01:39.780> in

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
out very soon I did the transit strategy

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.080 
out very soon I did the transit strategy
which<00:02:11.700> was

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
which was

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360

i'll<00:03:56.099> show<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.459> little<00:03:56.609> sliquifier

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
i'll show you a little sliquifier

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.720 
i'll show you a little sliquifier
gameplay<00:03:57.840> training<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.410> here<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.919> when

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
gameplay training in here and when

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.159 
gameplay training in here and when
you're<00:03:59.880> using<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.209> sliquifier<00:04:00.630> it's<00:04:01.019> like<00:04:01.139> a

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
you're using a sliquifier it's like a

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.979 
you're using a sliquifier it's like a
chain<00:04:01.470> reaction<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:02.609> if<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.940> train<00:04:03.750> some

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
chain reaction so if you train some

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.930 
chain reaction so if you train some
zombies<00:04:04.410> get<00:04:04.620> them<00:04:04.739> all<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.340> know<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.730> line

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
zombies get them all you know in a line

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.330 
zombies get them all you know in a line
or<00:04:06.269> hump<00:04:06.510> huddled<00:04:07.139> up<00:04:07.260> together<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:08.160> can

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
or hump huddled up together you can

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.920 
or hump huddled up together you can
shoot<00:04:08.579> one's<00:04:08.819> on<00:04:09.090> me<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.450> then<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.660> will<00:04:09.780> be<00:04:09.900> a

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
shoot one's on me and then it will be a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.460 
shoot one's on me and then it will be a
train<00:04:10.260> trip<00:04:10.739> chain<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.730> train<00:04:12.269> trains<00:04:13.200> and

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
train trip chain a train trains and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.099 
train trip chain a train trains and
chains<00:04:13.769> it'll<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.849> chain<00:04:15.209> reaction<00:04:15.450> and

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
chains it'll be a chain reaction and

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.069 
chains it'll be a chain reaction and
then<00:04:16.560> they<00:04:16.739> will<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.729> know<00:04:17.849> all<00:04:18.090> just<00:04:18.450> explode
