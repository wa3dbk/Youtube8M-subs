00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:14.410
 I will explain about what is called a profit and loss team 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:19.600
 I will hold down keywords until it comes out in the problem of profit and loss calculation 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:24.860
 Nu This alias purchases to first say quarrel 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.420
 Is this shop Kedomo it also got a case to be referred to as 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:34.140
 How much price did you buy? 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.790
 For example, let's use 70 yen as c data for a plastic bottle, for example 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.970
 Then 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.520
 We will put a price higher than 70 yen and sell it 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:51.390
 Such as store price 140 yen 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:55.220
 In this way, the list price as being displayed at the storefront price 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.240
 I use the word 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.620
 However 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.129
 For example 140 yen plastic bottle at the fixed price 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.850
 Well , it's a bit subtle when it comes to buying 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.710
 If it is cheap, such as 100 yen 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.520
 Well there are also things to check out the car 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.450
 So to 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:23.220
 It is a little more expensive than the list price from now people d day 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.560
 Display that price on storefront 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 There are three main sources of writing like this 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.310
 There is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.620
 Problem statement about where you are saying 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.840
 Yeah yeah while watching 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.250
 Let's see what corresponds 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 This issue is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.370
 There is a thing called 2,093 yen 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.490
 Selling price is 2,093 yen 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.680
 I'm asking what the cost is yen, so let's say here x 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.950
 Because it is written in anticipation of a 30% profit for the game conversion 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.950
 From here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:33.940
 It is 30% snow, so 13 times enough 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.940
 It will be here that was 1.3 times that you Toli 1.3 times 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:45.040
 If it is a profit of 40% , it will be 120 for 100 minutes after writing 14/1025% of profit 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:52.439
 To please 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.439
 gekko well 13/10 x will be the decline of the school 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.850
 by discipline 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:11.680
 Because I did not sell at 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:17.820
 I wrote that I had 3 discounts, so I wrote that I had 3 discounts on the list price, so 3 discounts. 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.820
 That should be done 7/10 by here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.819
 If it was discount to 8/10 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.020
 100 % if it is 23% 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:36.290
 It is to say 77 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.610
 Then if you like 13/10 x 7/10 th floor 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.330
 Here is 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.330
 Part of 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.590
 u 11 or 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:54.580
 And will be Te Yi-click Zu' That's Tteyuu selling price is 90 / 1001x met 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:02.310
 2,093 yen 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:05.180
 90 / 1001x = 2093 because it says 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:12.640
 Therefore, you're not asked for this x 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.640
 I answer is saying 2300 by multiplying the 90100/1 to the government
