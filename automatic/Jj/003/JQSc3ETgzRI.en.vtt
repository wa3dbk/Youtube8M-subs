00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:43.200
 Once the lock screen and home screen have not changed significantly

 If you recognize the face, it sounds easy. 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:13.090
 But the security level is bad and the recognition rate is bad . 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.100

 It 's funny how you can take snapshots during movie recording. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.459
 In addition, the photo editor is free. 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.459
 It's possible. 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.140

 Ability to save the skill offline 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.739
 Everyone who searched the records and did not leave the internet activities such as big boiling 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.739
 It's impressive. 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.980
 But there is a point that scrolling is not natural 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.100
 It's true. 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.100
 I'll wait two weeks for a firmware update to fix it. 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.760

 However, LG Galaxy s2, which does not support nfc , 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.930

 You know that Galaxy sku Galaxy 5 pin etc do not support rcs. 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:29.870
