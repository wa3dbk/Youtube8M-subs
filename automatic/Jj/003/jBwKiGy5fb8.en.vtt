00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.389
 napoli 7995 ok staff before 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 I just wanted to say that I did not 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 I work at napoli 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 I do not see this device as well. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.310
 common user sounds like many others 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.199
 there 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.510
 This is what I'm going to show you. 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.699
 is information that I did not seek 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 I found nobody there to sky. 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.289
 buy in the dark there like i bought 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.850
 I'll show you what I've seen too. 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.050
 this device here that I just 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 swap my 77 80 for this 7995 here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 like digital tv that with a gps one 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.440
 little improved 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.230
 The first tip I'm gonna give you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.079
 the unit is switched on as follows 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.079
 its the yellow yarn the red that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.020
 there you have to turn the key in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 panel to light the panel there. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.949
 league machine 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.359
 otherwise you may have a problem with 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.439
 your car battery that can 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.570
 the appliance is the first 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.540
 thing you can see up here that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.420
 it is written here 150 watts for one 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.119
 channel I do not know how to approach that is lost 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.880
 the resolution this device here it goes 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.580
 up to a maximum of 20 watts 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.580
 per channel is not 150 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.280
 this is the power that the manufacturer 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.009
 place it is hit on a bench of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.259
 test with 14 15 votes at the entrance of this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.689
 here for a few thousandths 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.520
 From a second to that the guy already puts that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.680
 So do not beat the money, not if you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.560
 want a loud sound out things 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 science has to use the same way I go 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.399
 show you the difference of this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.180
 from here to 77 80 that was the other device 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.979
 previous that only had analog TV for 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.549
 begin the first difference of this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.890
 device here is that in the rear connection 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.469
 we do not have that pile of yarn 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.990
 Loose only the connectors the list is 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.810
 very cool because to put it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.259
 in there panel is much easier 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.050
 Why is this key here? 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.040
 she leaves here she slides forward is 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.840
 Seeing she comes a little bit to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.380
 front of them and back 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.380
 It's tightening it back there back then 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.830
 people have sd card dvd input 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.050
 normal and gps sd card holding and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.700
 up to 4GB compared to the other 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.250
 I was only 2 gb 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.310
 He has a young boy with several 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.799
 functions and if for example is the TV 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.200
 digital is a cool clipboard tv is 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.019
 legal movement also surprised 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.420
 this feature on the device 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:54.540
 he has a menu this boy is well 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.690
 different from the previous tha is much more 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.840
 beautiful to one of the main differences 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.620
 of him is that his resolution is 800 per 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.610
 480 is a resolution already hd the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:12.359
 previous 77 80 had resolution of 480 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.489
 234 by pressing the mold we come 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.190
 here is your bluetooth 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:24.350
 He has a microphone here at this match. 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.350
 here also from the radio 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.030
 eighteen memory from situations to 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.030
 play the device here 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.540
 This is the part of SD that we have already 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.840
 I have sd you can browse the folders 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.430
 here is totally toshack legal heitor 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.650
 here the former has already 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.720
 showed everything together and if not you 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.170
 has from the songs here from 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.180
 here on your side and if you have 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.940
 some photo is on the here then 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.890
 even having a sd with several folders to 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.590
 it locates and separates files 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:08.180
 Alone for us, this is very cool. 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:12.200
 here in the glove compartment and I put here or 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.630
 USB port to connect pen drive 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.209
 other cool thing that the control of this 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.709
 model here is black tatÃ¡ unlike the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:25.910
 previous which was gray and apart from gps 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:29.270
 which was what made me happier there 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.150
 He has every boy here for gps. 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.940
 Is he a picture in picture? 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.350
 you can not keep here if you have 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.910
 take it out here too 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.320
 you can choose the song while 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.850
 navigate on gps 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.289
 I'll show the gps it comes with a 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.800
 rage software 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:54.139
 The cool thing about this device here is that GPS 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.750
 it is already with an ARM11 processor're 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.020
 I still have not checked how many megahertz 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.220
 has but I believe it's 500 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.000
 megahertz 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.400
 the previous one was an arm of 266 mega 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.750
 hertz ie is almost double 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.770
 velocity 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.530
 it has 128 megabytes of ram the 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.110
 Previous only had means 64 which 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.500
 can run a software as a cousin 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.080
 with all the resources he has without 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.060
 The system is very cool. 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:33.680
 operating system is windows if 6.0 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.940
 previous had 5.0 there as the system 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.390
 operational 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:42.110
 Here he shows us here. 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.900
 This down here he's already trying. 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.960
 locate where we are there his gps 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.600
 It's very cool, very fast. It's also a 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.990
 important information on this device is 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.700
 that the memory card of the previous name 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.930
 It was SD MMC and hence the name bursts 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.940
 card 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.640
 so when you set up your 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.100
 browser there the ego 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.460
 You'll have to change the name to 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.550
 restaurant cards and mainly not 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.960
 I forgot about fair resolution of 800 per 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:21.050
 480 and if you use some schin it's cool 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.260
 you check if the skinny she has the 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.050
 resolution of 800 by 480 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.930
 If it is not legal, you pay for it. 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.770
 folder save configure or avaÃ­ godino that 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.140
 The first day is spent 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.390
 already in the camera dr this device is 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.830
 Very cool, I'm surprised by him. 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.350
 for the price 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:47.650
 so this is it for those who accompanied 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.650
 Thank you so much, it's more there. 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.599
 the boston team 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.139
 nobody 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.830
 now who knows 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.430
 meet 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.430
 setting
