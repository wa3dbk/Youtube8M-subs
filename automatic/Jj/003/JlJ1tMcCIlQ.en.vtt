that<00:00:13.620> Louisville<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.429> odd<00:00:14.670> because<00:00:14.700> it

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
that Louisville which is odd because it

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.730 
that Louisville which is odd because it
has<00:00:15.120> square<00:00:15.360> headlights<00:00:15.660> usually<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.379> model

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
has square headlights usually this model

has square headlights usually this model
with<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.039> girl<00:00:17.279> has<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.490> round<00:00:17.850> headlights

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
with this girl has the round headlights

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510 
with this girl has the round headlights
that's<00:00:18.480> very<00:00:18.720> unusual<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.130> really<00:00:20.310> got

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
that's very unusual but what really got

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.810 
that's very unusual but what really got
my<00:00:20.699> attention<00:00:20.730> though<00:00:21.560> was<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.830> old<00:00:23.130> ford

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
my attention though was this old ford

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.339 
my attention though was this old ford
cab<00:00:24.390> /<00:00:24.779> co<00:00:25.619> e<00:00:26.240> c<00:00:27.240> 800<00:00:27.720> series<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.199> looks

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
cab / co e c 800 series and it looks

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.630 
cab / co e c 800 series and it looks
like<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.880> trolley<00:00:32.880> line<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.079> truck

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
like it was a trolley line that truck

repair<00:00:35.640> truck<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.190> probably

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
repair truck and I think it probably

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.819 
repair truck and I think it probably
