 carefully technology which 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.549
 trust guns provided by the network 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.250
 computer stores shelves 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.259
 getting a nice service 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.859
 Hello, I do not know this technique 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.929
 if you want to keep our will 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.730
 after that not only not at the height it is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.520
 then explain it what you need on 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.520
 attempts to separate drives for a long time but 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 how much information you will not save but part 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.220
 bottom of why kampala have models 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.529
 one and a half gigabyte and 1 terabyte of ours 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.999
 case 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.159
 representatives of this series differ from

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.659
 cover on the one hand the power you 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.079
 Abakan looking at these subject rates 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.350
 luxury does not mean though the price is terabytes 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.729
 models are only two and a half thousand 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:44.580
 rubles 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.850

 second fine start high 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.030
 data density on the hard drive 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.640
 and if the 3 0 interface works wonders 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 speaker 184 megabytes per second when such 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.410
 It was

 but an average of 147 megabytes per second 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.180
 mini maxtor 30 megabytes per second and also 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.200
 impressive

 307 2 seconds from reading and writing 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.790
 will show real projects we will try 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.520

 seconds 70 100 megabytes per second which 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.020
 real speeds basically speeds 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 same as in modern large 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.320
