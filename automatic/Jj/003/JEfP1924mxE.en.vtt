00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so this is one of the more difficult

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.260 
so this is one of the more difficult
examples<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:41.129> let<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.940> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
examples just to let you know so you can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.150 
examples just to let you know so you can
take<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.780> good<00:00:43.260> amount<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.649> time<00:00:43.860> here

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
take really good amount of time here

take really good amount of time here
there's<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> calculate<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
there's a lot of calculate in this

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.080 
there's a lot of calculate in this
position<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.980> white<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> move<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:50.090> please

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
position it's white to move and please

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.900 
position it's white to move and please
stop<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> video<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.760> figure<00:00:53.760> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
stop the video right now and figure it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020 
stop the video right now and figure it
out<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.890> good<00:00:56.309> good

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
out as can really really good good

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.090 
out as can really really good good
practice<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:59.730> figure<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:01.100> okay

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
practice for you to figure this one okay

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.759 
practice for you to figure this one okay
so<00:01:02.820> whenever<00:01:03.539> you're<00:01:03.750> ready<00:01:03.870> i'm<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> go

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so whenever you're ready i'm going to go

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.990 
so whenever you're ready i'm going to go
ahead<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.220> show<00:01:05.810> dissolution<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> Bishop

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
takes g5 is the first muth just opening

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.109 
takes g5 is the first muth just opening
up<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.640> entire<00:01:14.939> position<00:01:16.700> backlight<00:01:17.700> Bishop

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
up the entire position backlight Bishop

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.929 
up the entire position backlight Bishop

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
takes 35 but also night x g5 has to be

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.929 
takes 35 but also night x g5 has to be
checked<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.280> crashing

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
checked but what is just crashing

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
checked but what is just crashing
through<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.560> rotates<00:01:25.560> h6<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:27.470> exchanging

to g8 now actually your question what

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.550 
to g8 now actually your question what
now<00:02:26.500> us<00:02:27.100> maybe<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:28.000> bit<00:02:28.180> too<00:02:28.810> fast<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
now us maybe a little bit too fast to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.259 
now us maybe a little bit too fast to
say<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:32.069> maybe<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.520> just<00:02:33.700> play<00:02:34.060> look

CH is so awkwardly placed and not doing
anything<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.799> here<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.739> think<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.010> over<00:03:07.140> okay

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
anything so here I think it's over okay

anything so here I think it's over okay
so<00:03:09.010> skooma<00:03:09.430> took<00:03:09.780> 90<00:03:10.780> x<00:03:10.900> g5<00:03:11.140> double<00:03:12.100> check<00:03:12.340> so

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
so skooma took 90 x g5 double check so

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.949 
so skooma took 90 x g5 double check so
the<00:03:12.700> King<00:03:12.910> has<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.390> move<00:03:13.590> king<00:03:14.590> age<00:03:14.739> 6<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.959> here

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
i have another exercise for you how to

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.770 
i have another exercise for you how to
continue<00:03:22.060> from<00:03:22.480> here<00:03:24.150> White<00:03:25.150> has<00:03:25.299> succeeded

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
continue from here White has succeeded

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.180 
continue from here White has succeeded
to<00:03:26.280> change<00:03:27.280> some<00:03:27.549> defending<00:03:28.090> pieces<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:29.739> how

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
to change some defending pieces but how

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.430 
to change some defending pieces but how
to<00:03:30.250> continue<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.030> attack<00:03:31.090> now<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.840> there's

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
to continue the attack now and there's

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.990 
to continue the attack now and there's
still<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.980> lot<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.519> calculation<00:03:34.269> involved<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
still a lot of calculation involved and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.550 
still a lot of calculation involved and
try<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.060> go<00:03:37.329> from<00:03:37.510> here<00:03:37.720> stopping<00:03:38.049> video<00:03:38.260> once

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
try to go from here stopping video once

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.259 
try to go from here stopping video once
again<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:39.070> can<00:03:39.220> take<00:03:39.489> good<00:03:39.820> amount<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.090> time

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
again you can take good amount of time

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.819 
again you can take good amount of time
to<00:03:40.329> figure<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.230> out<00:03:42.390> ok<00:03:43.390> Aang<00:03:44.109> but<00:03:44.440> didn't<00:03:44.769> find

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
to figure it out ok Aang but didn't find

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.949 
to figure it out ok Aang but didn't find
the<00:03:45.280> best<00:03:45.700> move<00:03:45.970> here<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.329> still<00:03:46.630> got<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
the best move here you still got a

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.729 
the best move here you still got a
really<00:03:47.440> good<00:03:47.560> position<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:48.900> he<00:03:49.900> didn't<00:03:50.200> find

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739
