going into this level I think it's

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.800 
going into this level I think it's
called<00:00:04.650> luck<00:00:04.799> hang<00:00:05.490> glider<00:00:05.910> or<00:00:06.240> or<00:00:06.509> something

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
called luck hang glider or or something

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.110 
called luck hang glider or or something
like<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:06.990> anyway<00:00:07.350> apparently<00:00:08.280> God<00:00:08.940> Rosa

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
like that anyway apparently God Rosa

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.589

chopped<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.540> cliff<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.280> croc<00:00:11.280> must<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:12.420> able

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
chopped and cliff and croc must be able

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.039 
chopped and cliff and croc must be able
to<00:00:12.690> get<00:00:12.809> up<00:00:12.929> there<00:00:13.219> somehow<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.509> somehow

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
to get up there somehow and the somehow

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.779 
to get up there somehow and the somehow
is<00:00:16.379> by<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> use<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.949> hang<00:00:17.100> glider<00:00:17.340> which<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
is by the use of a hang glider which is

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.279 
is by the use of a hang glider which is
really<00:00:18.000> obvious<00:00:18.330> signal<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.930> title

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289

obviously<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.660> gobos<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.560> once<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.099> fly

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
obviously get the gobos you once you fly

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.880 
obviously get the gobos you once you fly
down<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:30.150> can't<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.720> back<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:30.929> unless<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.619> go

into<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> whirlwind<00:00:32.899> things<00:00:33.899> I'm

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
into one of the whirlwind things I'm

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.690

just gonna call whirlwind the thing with

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
just gonna call whirlwind the thing with
that<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:37.020> can't<00:00:37.380> explain<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that you know I I can't explain it the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.350 
that you know I I can't explain it the
the<00:00:38.190> thing<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.460> looks<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> big

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the thing that looks like it's a big

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
the thing that looks like it's a big
updraft<00:00:39.930> thing<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:41.129> whatever<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.489> can't

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
yeah so this is like favorite level time

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.859 
yeah so this is like favorite level time
basically<00:01:54.250> all<00:01:55.000> right<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:55.210> what<00:01:55.479> we<00:01:55.600> have<00:01:55.780> to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
that being it supposed to be really

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.270 
that being it supposed to be really
yellow<00:02:06.850> but<00:02:07.150> freckles<00:02:07.659> over<00:02:07.899> for<00:02:08.110> some<00:02:08.229> reason

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
yellow but freckles over for some reason

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.170 
yellow but freckles over for some reason
anyway<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.539> managed<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.929> get<00:02:11.020> 95<00:02:11.350> out<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.680> 100

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
anyway so I managed to get 95 out of 100

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.970 
anyway so I managed to get 95 out of 100
there<00:02:13.180> i'm<00:02:13.360> not<00:02:13.989> sure<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.500> get<00:02:14.650> 100

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
there i'm not sure if you can get 100

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.440 
there i'm not sure if you can get 100
over<00:02:15.100> 100<00:02:15.220> maybe<00:02:15.520> i<00:02:15.640> missed<00:02:15.850> some<00:02:16.000> crystals<00:02:16.360> i

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
over 100 maybe i missed some crystals i

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.949 
over 100 maybe i missed some crystals i
don't<00:02:17.350> know<00:02:17.470> anyway<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.850> that's<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.780> that's

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
don't know anyway so that's that that's

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.170 
don't know anyway so that's that that's
that<00:02:20.110> level<00:02:20.500> very<00:02:21.010> quick<00:02:21.310> very<00:02:21.550> short<00:02:21.910> very

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
that level very quick very short very

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.110 
that level very quick very short very
easy<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.370> overall<00:02:24.370> really<00:02:24.610> like<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.880> level

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
easy and overall really like that level

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.759 
easy and overall really like that level
and<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.510> that's<00:02:25.690> actually<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:26.260> easy

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
and now if that's actually a really easy

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.229 
and now if that's actually a really easy
way<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.100> get<00:02:27.340> crystals<00:02:27.760> with<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.000> level

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
way to get crystals with that level

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.880 
way to get crystals with that level
because<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.019> short<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.769> keep

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
because it's so short you can just keep

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.860 
because it's so short you can just keep
on<00:02:30.070> going<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.519> there<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.540> crystals

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
on going in there and get crystals

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.910 
on going in there and get crystals
actually<00:02:32.080> that's<00:02:32.320> what<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.530> might<00:02:32.680> do

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
actually that's what we might do

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.860 
actually that's what we might do
actually<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.400> like<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:33.970> level<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:34.239> much<00:02:34.540> let's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
actually I like that level so much let's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.050 
actually I like that level so much let's
do<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.140> again<00:02:35.200> because<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.830> knew<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.400> want<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.970> get

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
do it again because I knew I want to get

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.640 
do it again because I knew I want to get
some<00:02:37.209> crystals<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.660> my<00:02:37.780> heart<00:02:38.050> pot<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:38.410> i<00:02:38.500> also

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
some crystals to my heart pot but i also

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.390 
some crystals to my heart pot but i also
want<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.069> buy<00:02:40.380> also<00:02:41.380> one<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.530> my<00:02:41.650> red<00:02:41.980> jelly<00:02:42.220> as

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
well so the other way we can afford both

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.160 
well so the other way we can afford both
things<00:02:45.459> as<00:02:45.730> if<00:02:45.850> we<00:02:46.000> do<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.269> level<00:02:46.600> again<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.140> i

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
things as if we do this level again so i

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.930 
things as if we do this level again so i
want<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.680> this<00:02:47.800> level<00:02:48.100> again<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.580> i'll

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
want to do this level again and i'll

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.640 
want to do this level again and i'll
talk<00:02:49.269> about<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.720> bit<00:02:49.750> more<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.319> is<00:02:50.470> like

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
talk about it a bit more this is like

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.740 
talk about it a bit more this is like
very<00:02:51.370> reminiscent<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.970> engine<00:02:52.420> back<00:02:52.600> and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
very reminiscent of engine back and

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.360 
very reminiscent of engine back and
crush<00:02:52.930> too<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:53.410> i<00:02:53.440> actually<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.950> point<00:02:54.250> to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
crush too but i actually have a point to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.530 
crush too but i actually have a point to
do<00:02:54.489> this<00:02:54.610> level<00:02:54.880> again<00:02:55.060> apart<00:02:55.299> from<00:02:55.420> just

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
do this level again apart from just

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.630 
do this level again apart from just
talking<00:02:55.720> about<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.260> level<00:02:56.410> anyway<00:02:57.310> yeah<00:02:57.459> some

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
talking about the level anyway yeah some

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.310 
talking about the level anyway yeah some
of<00:02:57.670> them<00:02:57.790> are<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:57.970> balloons<00:02:58.480> some<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.079> them<00:02:59.170> are

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
of them are on balloons some of them are

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.550 
of them are on balloons some of them are
hanging<00:02:59.799> off<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:01.150> wall<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:02.470> don't

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
hanging off the the wall and we don't

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.440 
hanging off the the wall and we don't
need<00:03:02.709> any<00:03:02.980> color<00:03:03.250> gems<00:03:03.549> anymore<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.180> i<00:03:04.209> can

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.100 
to get the gobos really cuz all in all I
want<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> crystals<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:13.959> like

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
want is the crystals and just like

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.199 
want is the crystals and just like
really<00:03:14.290> easy<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.709> get<00:03:14.829> crystals<00:03:15.310> because<00:03:16.060> like

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
really easy to get crystals because like

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.789 
really easy to get crystals because like
there's<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.450> ten<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:16.930> just<00:03:17.110> have<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.620> fly

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
there's just ten you just have to fly

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:18.840 
there's just ten you just have to fly
through<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.070> ring<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.370> there<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.519> buy<00:03:18.610> ten

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
through the ring in there you buy ten

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.210 
through the ring in there you buy ten
crystals<00:03:19.329> really<00:03:20.200> good<00:03:20.320> luck<00:03:20.470> like<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:21.070> not

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
crystals really good luck like it's not

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.819 
crystals really good luck like it's not
it's<00:03:21.370> not<00:03:21.459> even<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.090> races<00:03:22.450> where<00:03:22.829> you

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
it's not even like the races where you

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.990 
it's not even like the races where you
know<00:03:23.950> collecting<00:03:24.310> crystals<00:03:24.670> it's<00:03:24.820> just

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
know collecting crystals it's just

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.490 
know collecting crystals it's just
really<00:03:25.180> easy<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.570> collect<00:03:25.810> crystals<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.380> this

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
really easy to collect crystals in this

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.590 
really easy to collect crystals in this
level<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:26.920> probably<00:03:27.640> if<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.970> Kai<00:03:28.120> triad<00:03:28.180> I

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
level and probably if I Kai triad I

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.940 
level and probably if I Kai triad I
could<00:03:28.750> get<00:03:28.930> like<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.079> hundred<00:03:29.320> crystals<00:03:29.799> or

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
could get like a hundred crystals or

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.699 
could get like a hundred crystals or
like<00:03:30.370> 50<00:03:31.090> or<00:03:31.120> something<00:03:31.540> or<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:31.989> good<00:03:32.230> amount<00:03:32.470> on

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
like 50 or something or a good amount on

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.630 
like 50 or something or a good amount on
each<00:03:32.739> level<00:03:33.100> but<00:03:33.660> usually<00:03:34.660> i<00:03:34.690> don't<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.640> yeah

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
each level but usually i don't so yeah

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.580 
each level but usually i don't so yeah
but<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.000> like<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.600> little<00:03:37.750> hawk<00:03:38.079> flying<00:03:38.350> for

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
but I like this little hawk flying for

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.930 
but I like this little hawk flying for
like<00:03:38.829> this<00:03:39.070> lava<00:03:39.940> kind<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.660> Cavan<00:03:41.230> thing<00:03:41.500> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
like this lava kind of Cavan thing and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.360 
like this lava kind of Cavan thing and
yeah<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.720> think<00:03:44.079> this<00:03:44.140> music<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.590> also<00:03:44.950> uses

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
yeah so I think this music is also uses

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.740 
yeah so I think this music is also uses
the<00:03:45.489> credits<00:03:45.790> music<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.329> game<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.540> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the credits music for this game and I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.479 
the credits music for this game and I
really<00:03:46.989> like<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.260> credits<00:03:47.590> music<00:03:47.709> from<00:03:48.130> crop

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
really like the credits music from crop

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.720 
really like the credits music from crop
one<00:03:48.760> as<00:03:48.910> well<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.950> credits<00:03:50.950> music<00:03:51.010> are<00:03:51.310> awesome

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
yeah but anyway so apparently the helium

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.680 
yeah but anyway so apparently the helium
balloons<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.950> just<00:04:02.130> waiting<00:04:02.700> them<00:04:02.910> correctly

stuck<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.760> other<00:04:05.880> these<00:04:06.120> gobos<00:04:06.540> but<00:04:07.220> pretty

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
stuck in other these gobos but pretty

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.900 
stuck in other these gobos but pretty
dumb<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:08.730> pretty<00:04:08.910> useless<00:04:09.090> creatures<00:04:10.910> Thank

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
dumb and pretty useless creatures Thank

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.970 
dumb and pretty useless creatures Thank
You<00:04:11.970> doesn't<00:04:12.180> monkey<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.840> yes<00:04:13.740> that's

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
You doesn't monkey for yes that's

useless they're useless apparently

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.000 
useless they're useless apparently
according<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.960> monkey<00:04:16.260> yeah<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.799> don't<00:04:16.890> know

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
target what all right I'm just gonna go

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.650 
target what all right I'm just gonna go
down<00:04:23.090> because<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.240> don't<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.540> get<00:04:24.630> a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
down because I don't have to get a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.350 
down because I don't have to get a
trophy<00:04:24.810> anymore<00:04:25.760> kind<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.790> weird<00:04:26.970> how<00:04:27.060> he<00:04:27.120> just

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
trophy anymore kind of weird how he just

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.760 
trophy anymore kind of weird how he just
like<00:04:27.480> stays<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.900> they<00:04:28.020> can<00:04:28.170> see<00:04:28.290> his<00:04:28.380> backpack

like stays and they can see his backpack

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.710 
like stays and they can see his backpack
through<00:04:28.920> there<00:04:29.160> whatever<00:04:29.550> wasn't<00:04:30.300> texted

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
through there whatever wasn't texted

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.820 
through there whatever wasn't texted
very<00:04:30.900> well<00:04:31.140> but<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.410> know<00:04:31.470> I'm<00:04:31.560> not<00:04:31.650> going<00:04:31.770> to

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
very well but you know I'm not going to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.730 
very well but you know I'm not going to
criticize<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.360> so<00:04:33.360> there<00:04:33.510> we<00:04:33.600> are<00:04:33.630> another<00:04:33.960> I

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
criticize it so there we are another I

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.740 
criticize it so there we are another I
think<00:04:35.100> we've<00:04:35.190> got<00:04:35.310> another<00:04:35.520> 95<00:04:35.970> or<00:04:36.390> something

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
think we've got another 95 or something

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.750 
think we've got another 95 or something
but<00:04:37.200> that<00:04:37.320> will<00:04:37.440> do<00:04:37.590> anyway<00:04:37.980> because<00:04:38.310> then<00:04:38.610> we

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
but that will do anyway because then we

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.580 
but that will do anyway because then we
can<00:04:38.850> buy<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.030> hot<00:04:39.270> pot<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:39.750> can<00:04:39.870> get<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.050> red

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
can buy a hot pot and we can get a red

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.500 
can buy a hot pot and we can get a red
jelly<00:04:40.830> because<00:04:41.550> we<00:04:41.730> need<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.910> red<00:04:42.120> jelly<00:04:42.360> we

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
jelly because we need a red jelly we

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.090 
jelly because we need a red jelly we
need<00:04:42.630> our<00:04:42.660> first<00:04:42.960> red<00:04:43.230> jelly<00:04:43.440> for<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.830> next

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
need our first red jelly for the next

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.530 
need our first red jelly for the next
level<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:45.800> 250<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.340> then<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.670> yep<00:04:48.150> we'll<00:04:48.420> have

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
level so 250 and then a yep we'll have

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.840 
level so 250 and then a yep we'll have
like<00:04:48.690> 11<00:04:49.110> leftover<00:04:49.650> i<00:04:49.710> think<00:04:49.919> i<00:04:50.010> think<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:50.460> my

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
like 11 leftover i think i think if my

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.130 
like 11 leftover i think i think if my
math<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.090> correct<00:04:51.300> I'm<00:04:51.660> not<00:04:51.720> very<00:04:51.900> good<00:04:51.990> at

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
math is correct I'm not very good at

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.080 
math is correct I'm not very good at
math<00:04:52.440> but<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.919> think<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:53.790> then<00:04:53.910> we<00:04:53.970> have<00:04:54.060> a

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
math but I think and then we have a

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.260 
math but I think and then we have a
clockwork<00:04:54.480> go<00:04:54.600> by<00:04:54.660> leftover<00:04:55.880> because<00:04:56.880> I've<00:04:56.970> so

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
clockwork go by leftover because I've so

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.700 
clockwork go by leftover because I've so
I<00:04:57.300> think<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:57.840> will<00:04:57.990> need<00:04:58.200> that<00:04:58.380> as<00:04:58.500> well<00:04:58.650> i'm

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
I think that will need that as well i'm

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.159 
I think that will need that as well i'm
not<00:04:58.830> sure<00:04:59.300> i'm<00:05:00.300> not<00:05:00.480> completely<00:05:00.720> sure<00:05:00.900> if<00:05:01.080> we

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
not sure i'm not completely sure if we

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.330 
not sure i'm not completely sure if we
actually<00:05:01.410> need<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.620> clock<00:05:01.770> or<00:05:01.919> gob<00:05:02.100> or<00:05:02.190> not

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
actually need the clock or gob or not

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.650 
actually need the clock or gob or not
but<00:05:02.460> we'll<00:05:02.550> find<00:05:02.669> out<00:05:02.850> next<00:05:02.880> part<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.480> if<00:05:03.570> I'm

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
but we'll find out next part so if I'm

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.810 
but we'll find out next part so if I'm
ways<00:05:03.810> for<00:05:04.260> weighs<00:05:04.380> 50<00:05:04.710> 50<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.430> my

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
ways for weighs 50 50 of the my

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.550 
ways for weighs 50 50 of the my
hard-earned<00:05:06.480> crystals<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.050> don't<00:05:07.200> really<00:05:07.290> care

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
hard-earned crystals I don't really care

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.380 
hard-earned crystals I don't really care
too<00:05:07.770> much<00:05:07.800> because<00:05:08.100> if<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:08.760> really<00:05:09.030> want<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.270> I

too much because if I really want to I
can<00:05:09.450> just<00:05:09.630> do<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.870> hang<00:05:10.020> glider<00:05:10.050> level<00:05:10.650> again

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
can just do the hang glider level again

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.290 
can just do the hang glider level again
which<00:05:10.980> is<00:05:11.010> always<00:05:11.250> fun<00:05:11.370> i<00:05:11.580> love<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:12.000> high<00:05:12.090> I

six<00:05:30.060> health<00:05:30.270> so<00:05:30.919> i<00:05:32.510> might<00:05:33.510> go<00:05:33.720> into<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.990> level

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
and I'll i do that before we actually

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.409 
and I'll i do that before we actually
start<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.430> next<00:05:38.550> part<00:05:38.850> because<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.240> fact

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
start the next part because the fact

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.300 
start the next part because the fact
that<00:05:39.540> i<00:05:39.810> don't<00:05:40.440> want<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.620> start<00:05:40.800> next<00:05:41.040> part<00:05:41.190> by

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
that i don't want to start next part by

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.010 
that i don't want to start next part by
me<00:05:41.430> committing<00:05:41.790> suicide<00:05:42.270> so<00:05:42.540> let's<00:05:42.810> just<00:05:42.930> buy

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
me committing suicide so let's just buy

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.990 
me committing suicide so let's just buy
the<00:05:43.080> hot<00:05:43.260> pot<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.740> get<00:05:43.890> out<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.100> here<00:05:44.130> come<00:05:44.850> on

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
the hot pot and get out of here come on

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.870 
the hot pot and get out of here come on
useful<00:05:45.419> hardpoints<00:05:45.900> yes<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.229> know<00:05:46.729> so<00:05:47.729> that's

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
useful hardpoints yes I know so that's

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.420 
useful hardpoints yes I know so that's
out<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.030> think<00:05:48.300> that's<00:05:48.450> how<00:05:48.600> I<00:05:49.310> think<00:05:50.310> that's

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
out I think that's how I think that's

out I think that's how I think that's
our<00:05:50.580> third<00:05:50.880> know<00:05:51.270> our<00:05:51.419> second<00:05:51.840> hand<00:05:52.140> pot<00:05:52.290> board

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
our third know our second hand pot board

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.210 
our third know our second hand pot board
and<00:05:53.100> our<00:05:54.320> fourth<00:05:55.320> heart<00:05:55.620> pot<00:05:55.830> in<00:05:55.919> general

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
and our fourth heart pot in general

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.770 
and our fourth heart pot in general
because<00:05:56.310> I<00:05:56.460> remember<00:05:56.700> we<00:05:56.820> we<00:05:57.690> got<00:05:57.870> one<00:05:58.110> on<00:05:58.380> the

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
because I remember we we got one on the

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.719 
because I remember we we got one on the
through<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:01.010> level<00:06:02.010> with<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:02.220> bird<00:06:02.430> and

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
through the level with the bird and

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.340 
through the level with the bird and
we've<00:06:03.510> got<00:06:03.600> the<00:06:03.690> one<00:06:03.780> from<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:03.990> challenge

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
we've got the one from the challenge

we've got the one from the challenge
with<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.560> tree<00:06:04.830> as<00:06:05.010> well<00:06:05.539> but<00:06:06.539> anyway<00:06:06.870> so<00:06:07.830> I
