and what enhancements should we expect
we<00:02:41.520> know<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.790> Apple<00:02:41.940> usually<00:02:42.570> keeps<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
we know that Apple usually keeps the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.650 
we know that Apple usually keeps the
same<00:02:43.170> design<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.860> we<00:02:44.340> always<00:02:44.610> wonder<00:02:45.300> why<00:02:45.600> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
same design and we always wonder why the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.010 
same design and we always wonder why the
protruding<00:02:46.350> camera<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> iPhone<00:02:47.670> 6<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.300> it

protruding camera on the iPhone 6 if it
doesn't<00:02:49.380> really<00:02:49.530> need<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.770> be<00:02:49.890> protruding<00:02:50.580> we

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
doesn't really need to be protruding we

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.310 
doesn't really need to be protruding we
have<00:02:50.850> optical<00:02:51.180> image<00:02:51.360> stabilization<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:52.200> the

reports<00:02:55.080> claim<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.470> apparently<00:02:55.830> Apple<00:02:56.340> is

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
reports claim that apparently Apple is

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.390 
reports claim that apparently Apple is
planning<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.750> make<00:02:57.900> some<00:02:57.930> huge<00:02:58.620> enhancements

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
planning to make some huge enhancements

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.370 
planning to make some huge enhancements
on<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.640> camera<00:03:00.090> which<00:03:00.600> could<00:03:00.870> mean<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
on the camera which could mean that

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.080 
on the camera which could mean that
that's<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.740> reason<00:03:01.980> why<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.490> have<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> design

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
that's the reason why we have the design

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.670 
that's the reason why we have the design
now<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.780> avoid<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.170> changes<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
now just to avoid the changes in the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.830 
now just to avoid the changes in the
future<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.250> apparently<00:03:05.820> Apple<00:03:06.240> is<00:03:06.360> going<00:03:06.480> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
future but apparently Apple is going to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.680 
future but apparently Apple is going to
give<00:03:07.560> us<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.890> SLR<00:03:08.250> quality<00:03:08.700> photos<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.570> the
