about this I mean obviously people don't

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.549 
about this I mean obviously people don't
really<00:00:53.600> care<00:00:53.809> about<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.020> numbers<00:00:54.290> as<00:00:54.410> much

the<00:00:55.190> nitty<00:00:55.340> gritty<00:00:55.430> but<00:00:56.090> what<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.750> really

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
the nitty gritty but what this really

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.990 
the nitty gritty but what this really
speaks<00:00:57.110> for<00:00:57.469> is<00:00:57.649> Sony's<00:00:58.010> huge<00:00:58.370> loss<00:00:58.610> they<00:00:58.850> had

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000

I<00:01:10.610> have<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> say<00:01:10.910> that<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.210> have<00:01:11.420> just<00:01:11.630> been

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
I have to say that I have just been

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.290 
I have to say that I have just been
baffled<00:01:12.649> on<00:01:12.860> an<00:01:13.070> ongoing<00:01:13.220> basis<00:01:13.820> by<00:01:13.970> seventies

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
baffled on an ongoing basis by seventies

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.660 
baffled on an ongoing basis by seventies
refusal<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.840> drop<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.350> ps3<00:01:15.650> price<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.250> just

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
refusal to drop that ps3 price I just

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.980 
refusal to drop that ps3 price I just
don't<00:01:17.000> understand<00:01:17.540> what<00:01:17.690> they're<00:01:17.840> thinking

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
don't understand what they're thinking

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.710 
don't understand what they're thinking
because<00:01:18.710> they've<00:01:18.860> been<00:01:19.040> getting<00:01:19.159> maybe<00:01:19.970> one

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
because they've been getting maybe one

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.020 
because they've been getting maybe one
or<00:01:21.020> two<00:01:21.070> consistent<00:01:22.070> messages<00:01:22.520> from<00:01:22.729> users

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
or two consistent messages from users

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.430 
or two consistent messages from users
over<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.510> over<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.750> over<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.080> first<00:01:24.290> is

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
over and over and over in the first is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.170 
over and over and over in the first is
that<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.650> ps3<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.100> too<00:01:25.250> expensive<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
that the ps3 is too expensive and the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.609 
that the ps3 is too expensive and the
second<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.720> there<00:01:27.049> aren't<00:01:27.200> enough<00:01:27.290> games

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
second is that there aren't enough games

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.710 
second is that there aren't enough games
for<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.890> ps3<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:28.820> they<00:01:28.939> have<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.360> work<00:01:29.540> on

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
for the ps3 and so they have to work on

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.690 
for the ps3 and so they have to work on
solving<00:01:29.930> one<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.770> those<00:01:31.010> problems<00:01:31.520> and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
solving one of those problems and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.480 
solving one of those problems and
ideally<00:01:32.210> both<00:01:32.390> otherwise<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:33.500> guess<00:01:34.100> they<00:01:34.310> can

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
ideally both otherwise I guess they can

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.789 
ideally both otherwise I guess they can
rest<00:01:34.729> on<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.000> ps2<00:01:35.240> morals<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:35.900> just<00:01:36.619> don't

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
rest on the ps2 morals I just don't

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.200 
rest on the ps2 morals I just don't
understand<00:01:37.310> what<00:01:37.490> they're<00:01:37.640> thinking<00:01:37.790> at<00:01:38.090> this

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
understand what they're thinking at this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.250 
understand what they're thinking at this
point<00:01:38.270> yeah<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.780> mean<00:01:38.990> it's<00:01:39.080> really

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
point yeah I mean it's really

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.560 
point yeah I mean it's really
interesting<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.950> realize<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.970> should<00:01:41.420> really

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
interesting to realize you should really

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.030 
interesting to realize you should really
change<00:01:41.840> what<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.110> can<00:01:42.259> control<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.979> that's

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
change what you can control and that's

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.620 
change what you can control and that's
really<00:01:43.340> only<00:01:43.460> thing<00:01:43.700> they<00:01:43.790> can't<00:01:44.030> control<00:01:44.390> is

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
really only thing they can't control is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.429 
really only thing they can't control is
the<00:01:44.720> price<00:01:44.960> Chris<00:01:45.619> what's<00:01:45.830> your<00:01:45.950> take<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.250> this

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
the price Chris what's your take on this

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.630 
the price Chris what's your take on this
personally<00:01:48.439> I<00:01:48.590> don't<00:01:48.650> think<00:01:48.799> that<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.189> ps2<00:01:49.610> or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
personally I don't think that the ps2 or

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.780 
personally I don't think that the ps2 or
the<00:01:50.299> ps3<00:01:50.720> offers<00:01:51.200> more<00:01:51.500> over<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.580> above<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
the ps3 offers more over and above the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.300 
the ps3 offers more over and above the
PA<00:01:53.119> than<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.509> ps2<00:01:53.960> most<00:01:54.920> people<00:01:55.159> going<00:01:55.280> to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
PA than the ps2 most people going to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.620 
PA than the ps2 most people going to
want<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.520> go<00:01:55.579> ahead<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.939> play<00:01:56.060> games<00:01:56.299> they're

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
one too many calls I mean that's the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.550 
one too many calls I mean that's the
thing<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.480> think<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:18.720> lot<00:05:18.750> of<00:05:18.870> people<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.470> know

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
thing I think a lot of people you know

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560 
thing I think a lot of people you know
being<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.400> it's<00:05:20.610> called<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.880> iphone<00:05:21.180> 3g

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
being that it's called the iphone 3g

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.000 
being that it's called the iphone 3g
regular<00:05:21.990> people<00:05:22.230> might<00:05:22.380> understand<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.860> little

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
regular people might understand a little

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.860 
regular people might understand a little
bit<00:05:23.130> better<00:05:23.280> what<00:05:23.550> 3g<00:05:23.880> is<00:05:24.030> Molly<00:05:24.540> what's<00:05:24.750> your

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
bit better what 3g is Molly what's your

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.970 
bit better what 3g is Molly what's your
take<00:05:25.050> do<00:05:25.170> you<00:05:25.230> think<00:05:25.350> regular<00:05:25.530> people<00:05:25.890> are

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
take do you think regular people are

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.070 
take do you think regular people are
getting<00:05:26.100> wireless<00:05:26.520> data<00:05:26.670> at<00:05:26.910> all<00:05:27.000> yeah<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:27.960> mean

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
getting wireless data at all yeah I mean

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.600 
getting wireless data at all yeah I mean
I<00:05:28.170> think<00:05:28.200> that<00:05:28.500> certainly<00:05:28.980> smartphone

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
I think that certainly smartphone

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.920 
I think that certainly smartphone
adoption<00:05:29.850> is<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> rise<00:05:30.480> but<00:05:30.630> it's<00:05:30.780> such<00:05:30.900> a

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
adoption is on the rise but it's such a

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.570 
adoption is on the rise but it's such a
small<00:05:31.170> percentage<00:05:31.770> still<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.340> number<00:05:32.550> of

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
small percentage still of the number of

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.800 
small percentage still of the number of
people<00:05:32.790> who<00:05:32.940> have<00:05:33.030> cell<00:05:33.330> phones<00:05:33.540> so<00:05:33.660> i<00:05:33.720> think

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
people who have cell phones so i think

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.140 
people who have cell phones so i think
chris<00:05:34.020> is<00:05:34.050> right<00:05:34.350> then<00:05:34.530> it<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:35.280> meaningless<00:05:36.000> to

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
chris is right then it is meaningless to

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.340 
chris is right then it is meaningless to
people<00:05:36.480> in<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.720> sense<00:05:36.930> that<00:05:36.990> what<00:05:37.230> they

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
people in the sense that what they

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.080 
people in the sense that what they
really<00:05:37.530> want<00:05:37.800> at<00:05:37.860> this<00:05:38.010> point<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.430> reliable

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
really want at this point is reliable

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.690 
really want at this point is reliable
service<00:05:39.480> from<00:05:39.780> anyone<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:40.950> at<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.550> point

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
service from anyone and so at the point

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.640 
service from anyone and so at the point
at<00:05:41.850> which<00:05:41.940> you're<00:05:42.180> talking<00:05:42.750> about<00:05:42.930> 3g<00:05:43.410> and

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
at which you're talking about 3g and

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.500 
at which you're talking about 3g and
most<00:05:44.070> people<00:05:44.370> aren't<00:05:44.610> getting<00:05:44.790> 3g<00:05:45.180> because

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
most people aren't getting 3g because

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.910 
most people aren't getting 3g because
the<00:05:45.630> coverage<00:05:45.930> is<00:05:46.020> so<00:05:46.170> bad<00:05:46.350> and<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.560> networks

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
the coverage is so bad and the networks

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.680 
the coverage is so bad and the networks
are<00:05:47.040> so<00:05:47.220> weak<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.580> fragile<00:05:47.790> it's<00:05:48.420> definitely

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
are so weak and fragile it's definitely

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.900 
are so weak and fragile it's definitely
not<00:05:49.140> enticing<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:50.010> is<00:05:50.190> not<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.490> thing<00:05:50.520> that

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
not enticing that is not the thing that

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.480 
not enticing that is not the thing that
is<00:05:51.000> enticing<00:05:51.330> them<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:52.080> get<00:05:52.290> smartphones<00:05:53.250> or

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
is enticing them to get smartphones or

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.190 
is enticing them to get smartphones or
to<00:05:53.640> talk<00:05:53.850> a<00:05:53.880> lot<00:05:54.180> about<00:05:54.210> wireless<00:05:54.810> data<00:05:54.930> and

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
to talk a lot about wireless data and

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.870 
to talk a lot about wireless data and
want<00:05:55.350> that<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:55.920> the<00:05:56.010> fact<00:05:56.040> is<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:56.400> wireless

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
want that but the fact is that wireless

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.270 
want that but the fact is that wireless
data<00:05:57.000> is<00:05:57.300> it's<00:05:57.990> something<00:05:58.350> that<00:05:58.650> that<00:05:59.100> the

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
data is it's something that that the

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.680 
data is it's something that that the
mainstream<00:05:59.700> wants<00:05:59.970> they<00:06:00.090> just<00:06:00.270> kind<00:06:00.450> of<00:06:00.510> don't

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
mainstream wants they just kind of don't

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
a rant that I've been on for another

a rant that I've been on for another
three<00:06:36.180> days<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.600> find<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:36.990> unconscionable<00:06:37.860> the

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
three days I find it unconscionable the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.370 
three days I find it unconscionable the
level<00:06:38.970> of<00:06:39.090> service<00:06:39.450> that<00:06:39.480> they<00:06:39.720> continue<00:06:40.230> to

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
level of service that they continue to

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.500 
level of service that they continue to
deliver<00:06:40.650> it<00:06:40.860> is<00:06:40.950> astonishing<00:06:41.520> to<00:06:41.970> me<00:06:42.000> that

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510

it<00:06:44.550> is<00:06:44.610> whether<00:06:44.820> you're<00:06:44.940> talking<00:06:45.120> about<00:06:45.240> voice

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
it is whether you're talking about voice

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
fact that they get away with that and

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.780 
fact that they get away with that and
charge<00:06:49.050> what<00:06:49.290> they<00:06:49.320> charged<00:06:49.710> for<00:06:50.220> texts<00:06:50.610> and

backwoods of you know Kentucky or
whatever<00:07:15.120> i'm<00:07:15.360> sure<00:07:15.600> that<00:07:15.750> they<00:07:15.930> are

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
whatever i'm sure that they are

worse<00:07:18.750> problems<00:07:19.320> in<00:07:19.470> this<00:07:19.590> no<00:07:19.800> I<00:07:19.830> bet<00:07:20.130> they

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
worse problems in this no I bet they

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.620 
worse problems in this no I bet they
have<00:07:20.370> better<00:07:20.610> service<00:07:20.970> I<00:07:21.240> actually<00:07:21.449> think

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.630 
have better service I actually think

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.939 
have better service I actually think
that<00:07:21.840> they<00:07:21.990> have<00:07:22.139> better<00:07:22.320> service<00:07:22.650> like<00:07:22.889> I

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949 
that they have better service like I

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:24.469 
that they have better service like I
think<00:07:23.130> these<00:07:23.220> networks<00:07:23.639> are<00:07:23.729> basically<00:07:24.120> so

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
think these networks are basically so

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.240 
think these networks are basically so
fragile<00:07:24.870> there<00:07:25.229> like<00:07:25.410> the<00:07:25.500> little<00:07:25.530> Faberge

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
fragile there like the little Faberge

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.400 
fragile there like the little Faberge
eggs<00:07:26.490> and<00:07:26.820> once<00:07:27.270> you<00:07:27.360> get<00:07:27.600> too<00:07:27.810> many<00:07:28.020> people

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410 
eggs and once you get too many people

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.659 
eggs and once you get too many people
doing<00:07:28.590> the<00:07:28.770> same<00:07:28.919> thing<00:07:29.130> all<00:07:29.250> at<00:07:29.370> once<00:07:29.520> which

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669 
doing the same thing all at once which

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:30.800 
doing the same thing all at once which
is<00:07:29.820> data<00:07:30.030> which<00:07:30.240> they<00:07:30.389> should<00:07:30.419> have<00:07:30.630> seen

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
is data which they should have seen

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.240 
is data which they should have seen
coming<00:07:31.110> because<00:07:31.320> smartphone<00:07:31.740> adoption<00:07:31.919> was

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
coming because smartphone adoption was

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.740 
coming because smartphone adoption was
predicted<00:07:32.669> for<00:07:32.789> the<00:07:32.850> last<00:07:33.060> few<00:07:33.180> years<00:07:33.270> yeah

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750 
predicted for the last few years yeah

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.990 
predicted for the last few years yeah
these<00:07:34.050> networks<00:07:34.979> are<00:07:35.100> basically<00:07:35.520> shattered

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 
these networks are basically shattered

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.340 
these networks are basically shattered
in<00:07:36.150> terms<00:07:36.360> of<00:07:36.479> their<00:07:36.630> robustness<00:07:37.020> and<00:07:37.139> it's

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.350 
in terms of their robustness and it's

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.659 
in terms of their robustness and it's
look<00:07:37.590> it's<00:07:37.620> ridiculous<00:07:38.220> guys<00:07:38.520> it's

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:38.669 
look it's ridiculous guys it's

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:39.620 
look it's ridiculous guys it's
interesting<00:07:38.880> stuff<00:07:39.240> we're<00:07:39.330> gonna<00:07:39.449> have<00:07:39.570> to
