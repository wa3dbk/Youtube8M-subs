00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.879
 Now, let's start with our first 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.580
 module where we are going to talk about the business 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.890
 of food in mexico some 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.310
 main characteristics that types of 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.519
 business many times we see so many 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 Depor business when we go through 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.849
 the street when we are driving the car 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.330
 we see a diversity of businesses 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.570
 impressive what I would like is 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.129
 classify them because it classifies them 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.010
 the national chamber of industry 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.309
 restaurant for you to have clear 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.110
 where you want to go and from there you can 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.440
 refine your idea if you're going to 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.620
 start without further preamble and greater 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.660
 introduction first there are the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.960
 food business at least in 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.780
 Mexico also internationally 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.360
 full service when we 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.210
 we discussed the issue of the full service 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.860
 whenever we train people they 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.729
 we say that the full service 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.620
 it involves everything that is to say there is usually 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.550
 tables yes yes 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.520
 there are glassware there are waiters there is kitchen 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.330
 this means that it is a restaurant 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 properly said where they are served to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.020
 the customers where there are waiters where there 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.420
 Waiters 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.939
 There are other types of services that are not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.689
 so for example if it were a business of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.229
 fast food because in many cases not 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.649
 there is service to the table only the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 people go to a counter where they are 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.100
 give their food and then they pay and they 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.679
 they are going to sit there are no waiters and there is no 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.259
 cost of waiters when we talk about the 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.360
 full service one of the great 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.659
 problems is that they require an investment 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.000
 brutal because we are talking about tables 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.009
 and chairs and when we require a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.500
 restaurant we need a very space 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.009
 great for this kind of kitchens for 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.829
 example in the case of seafood 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.440
 We normally require spaces of 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:20.250
 cook a little big too 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.769
 we need a sales floor for tables 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.819
 and chairs that also requires more 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.340
 space 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.040
 then typically this model is a 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.250
 little bit more clogs or more coarse more 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.760
 large for example in the case of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.060
 restaurant bar because we require 2 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.579
 a food area and a bar area 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.409
 therefore, many of the people do not 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.480
 have the possibility of having a 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.370
 full service business because 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.069
 they do not have enough capital 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.590
 for all investments this 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.629
 it implies then we talk first of the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.660
 restaurant bar is an example the 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.410
 restaurant bar has the benefit 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.600
 that the cocktails typically 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.970
 they present an interesting utility 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.310
 as long as we know how to do the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.340
 cocktails the right way with the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.430
 correct costs and the restaurant is 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.530
 basically a complement to the bar and it's 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.080
 very good complement because the bar 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.210
 typically it works at night and the 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.360
 restaurant typically works for 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.200
 breakfasts and meals and then when 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.690
 is the bar very crowded then 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.180
 they ask for drinks and the food serves as 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.130
 supplement of the drinks when it is 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.710
 the food service can be 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.320
 complement with some drink by 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.140
 example to whet the appetite or to 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.420
 close the food and so on several types 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.850
 of drinks in the case of the restaurant 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.310
 Coffee shop also works well 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.440
 you want to handle it as a service 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.350
 complete in the case in the coffee shops 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.140
 they are highly flexible because we 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.420
 allow an express service can be 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.530
 have a small coffee bar 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.690
 without more space than a machine 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.630
 even the cafeteria can be mixed 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.389
 with crepes and other foods and 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.510
 very well is an excellent service for 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.700
 the mornings towards the evenings 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.430
 in the nights also especially if in 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.770
 his cafeteria handles cold drinks where 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.580
 there may also be a utility or a 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.430
 gain between 50 to 70 percent 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.230
 also the service Ã  la carte is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.230
 absolutely interesting
