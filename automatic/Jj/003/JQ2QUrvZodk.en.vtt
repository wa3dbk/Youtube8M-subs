 Next, describe how the deca adviser works 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.090
 we start in file where we can create backups to restore the base of 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.330
 data 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.080
 here the backup will be awaited 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.090
 it was recommended that the guards 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.350
 in some external unit as a guest memory 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.510
 here it says that the cope is carried out successfully we will accept 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.670
 the goats in the database is done in the same way 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.730
 we continue with patients we are going to create a new patient

 since they are obligatory 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.860
 for more practical way 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.670
 many fields within the program 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 They are a selection with him for faster 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.580
 As for the date of birth, I recommend that you do it manually. 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.580
 more practical 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.070
 only level the data that have this disk 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 as I mentioned before they are mandatory 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.970
