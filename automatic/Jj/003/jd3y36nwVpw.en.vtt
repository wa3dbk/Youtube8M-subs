00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to leave a little bit of the wine behind

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.669

that out as we can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.800 
that out as we can
I'll<00:01:09.100> get<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.549> siphon<00:01:10.329> setup

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.240 

so<00:01:15.590> I've<00:01:15.680> got<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.070> siphon<00:01:16.549> hooked<00:01:16.790> up<00:01:18.159> we<00:01:19.159> have

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
so I've got the siphon hooked up we have

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.010 
so I've got the siphon hooked up we have
a<00:01:19.340> great<00:01:19.580> siphon<00:01:20.150> coming<00:01:20.450> out<00:01:20.570> from<00:01:20.869> the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
a great siphon coming out from the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:32.359 
a great siphon coming out from the
carboy<00:01:22.180> down<00:01:23.180> into<00:01:23.600> our<00:01:23.720> bucket

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.940 

and<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.409> part<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and right now at this part of the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.330 
and right now at this part of the
winemaking<00:01:35.640> process<00:01:37.460> we<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:40.310> wine<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
winemaking process we have a wine that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:51.590 
winemaking process we have a wine that
has<00:01:44.240> still<00:01:45.240> quite<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> bit<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.869> yeast<00:01:50.569> quite<00:01:51.569> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
has still quite a bit of yeast quite a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.399 
has still quite a bit of yeast quite a
bit<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.929> carbonation<00:01:52.649> left<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:54.140> we'll<00:01:55.140> rack

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
bit of carbonation left in it we'll rack

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.480 
bit of carbonation left in it we'll rack
it<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.829> time<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:58.100> leaving<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> bit<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.429> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it this time here leaving a bit of the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.179 
it this time here leaving a bit of the
wine<00:01:59.640> behind<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:03.739> then<00:02:04.739> we're<00:02:04.860> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> let

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
wine behind and then we're going to let

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:12.650 
wine behind and then we're going to let
it<00:02:05.340> sit<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:05.579> another<00:02:09.380> probably<00:02:11.239> week<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.450> ten

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
it sit for another probably week to ten

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.610 
it sit for another probably week to ten
days<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:14.269> then<00:02:15.269> one<00:02:15.660> last<00:02:15.900> time<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.530> will

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
days and then one last time I will

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.089 
days and then one last time I will
transfer<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.819> carboy<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:22.099> we'll

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
transfer it back to the carboy and we'll

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.100 
transfer it back to the carboy and we'll
do<00:02:23.250> some<00:02:23.459> stuff<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:26.900> sometimes<00:02:27.900> I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
do some stuff with it then sometimes I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:37.820 
do some stuff with it then sometimes I
use<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.349> product<00:02:28.739> called<00:02:30.500> bentonite

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.880 

and<00:02:38.340> what<00:02:38.880> bentonite<00:02:39.300> does<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.930> clarifies<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and what bentonite does is clarifies the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.980 
and what bentonite does is clarifies the
one<00:02:41.900> if<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.080> got<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> very<00:02:43.740> hazy<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.840> lot<00:02:45.840> of

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
one if you got a very hazy one a lot of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.650 
one if you got a very hazy one a lot of
floating<00:02:46.320> sediment<00:02:48.890> mainly<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.630> use<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
floating sediment mainly if I use it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.680 
floating sediment mainly if I use it
when<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.020> make<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> fruit<00:02:52.740> one<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:54.000> I'm<00:02:54.240> actually

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
when I make a fruit one and I'm actually

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.470 
when I make a fruit one and I'm actually
matched<00:02:55.610> mashing<00:02:56.610> or<00:02:57.650> have<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:59.310> pureed<00:03:00.000> fruit

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
matched mashing or have a pureed fruit

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.170 
matched mashing or have a pureed fruit
mixture<00:03:00.960> in<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.740> wine<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.460> know<00:03:02.580> we<00:03:02.760> did<00:03:02.970> use

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
mixture in the wine you know we did use

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.700 
mixture in the wine you know we did use
the<00:03:03.390> raisins<00:03:04.970> but<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> raisins<00:03:06.710> stayed

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
the raisins but the raisins stayed

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.000 
the raisins but the raisins stayed
together<00:03:07.890> pretty<00:03:08.340> good

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
together pretty good

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.840 
together pretty good
and<00:03:11.180> with<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.390> raisin<00:03:13.460> recipe<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:16.850> get

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
and with this raisin recipe you can get

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.610 
and with this raisin recipe you can get
most<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.170> kind<00:03:19.710> of<00:03:19.830> floating<00:03:21.260> pieces<00:03:22.260> of

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
most of that kind of floating pieces of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.310 
most of that kind of floating pieces of
the<00:03:22.710> fruit<00:03:23.040> out<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.450> bentonite<00:03:27.990> will

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
the fruit out that the bentonite will

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.120 
the fruit out that the bentonite will
actually<00:03:28.920> attach<00:03:29.460> itself<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.800> fruit

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
actually attach itself to the fruit

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.120 
actually attach itself to the fruit
that's<00:03:32.400> floating<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.990> wine<00:03:34.200> most<00:03:34.950> your

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
that's floating in the wine most your

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.610 
that's floating in the wine most your
sediments<00:03:35.730> at<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.970> bottom<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:37.140> up<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
sediments at the bottom but up and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.590 
sediments at the bottom but up and
inside<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.520> wine<00:03:38.730> there'll<00:03:39.270> be<00:03:39.300> all<00:03:39.570> kinds

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
inside of the wine there'll be all kinds

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.300 
inside of the wine there'll be all kinds
of<00:03:40.700> sediment<00:03:41.700> floating<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.920> bentonite

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
of sediment floating and that bentonite

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.410 
of sediment floating and that bentonite
will<00:03:44.550> stick<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:47.030> drag<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.239> the
