00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
solution to the loss of Wi-Fi connection

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.610 
solution to the loss of Wi-Fi connection
when<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.309> tablet<00:00:40.729> would<00:00:40.850> enter<00:00:41.210> sleep<00:00:41.510> mode

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
when the tablet would enter sleep mode

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.489 
when the tablet would enter sleep mode
it's<00:00:42.620> actually<00:00:43.069> an<00:00:43.190> old<00:00:43.569> application<00:00:44.569> that's

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
it's actually an old application that's

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.700 
it's actually an old application that's
been<00:00:45.920> in<00:00:46.069> the<00:00:46.479> Google<00:00:47.479> Play<00:00:47.719> market<00:00:48.049> for<00:00:48.499> quite

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
been in the Google Play market for quite

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.590 
been in the Google Play market for quite
some<00:00:48.979> time<00:00:49.010> even<00:00:49.489> back<00:00:49.879> when<00:00:49.909> it<00:00:50.239> was<00:00:50.329> the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
some time even back when it was the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.169 
some time even back when it was the
Android<00:00:51.079> Market<00:00:51.620> but<00:00:52.219> I<00:00:52.249> never<00:00:52.639> knew<00:00:52.850> about<00:00:52.999> it

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
Android Market but I never knew about it

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.110 
Android Market but I never knew about it
simply<00:00:53.749> because<00:00:54.229> I've<00:00:54.859> never<00:00:55.459> had<00:00:55.729> a<00:00:55.789> device

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
simply because I've never had a device

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.969 
simply because I've never had a device
that<00:00:56.389> would<00:00:56.539> enter<00:00:56.929> sleep<00:00:57.260> mode<00:00:57.319> and<00:00:57.709> shut<00:00:57.889> off

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
that would enter sleep mode and shut off

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.629 
that would enter sleep mode and shut off
the<00:00:58.129> Wi-Fi<00:00:58.479> so<00:00:59.479> it's<00:01:00.260> not<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.619> very<00:01:01.159> well<00:01:01.609> known

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.639 
the Wi-Fi so it's not a very well known

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:06.040 
the Wi-Fi so it's not a very well known
application<00:01:03.670> but<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:04.910> will<00:01:05.210> show<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.480> it<00:01:05.840> is
