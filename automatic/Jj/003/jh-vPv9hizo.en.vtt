what causes cankles well cankles can be

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.360 
what causes cankles well cankles can be
caused<00:00:49.190> by<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.910> lot<00:00:50.149> of<00:00:50.180> medical<00:00:50.600> conditioning

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
caused by a lot of medical conditioning

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.250 
caused by a lot of medical conditioning
conditions<00:00:52.370> vascular<00:00:53.090> compromise<00:00:53.450> kidney

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
conditions vascular compromise kidney

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.350 
conditions vascular compromise kidney
disease<00:00:54.590> lymphedema<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:55.969> really<00:00:56.210> have<00:00:56.300> to

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
disease lymphedema so you really have to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.479 
disease lymphedema so you really have to
speech<00:00:56.899> your<00:00:57.079> doctor<00:00:57.559> really<00:00:58.160> if<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.340> have<00:00:58.460> a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
speech your doctor really if you have a

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.889 
speech your doctor really if you have a
medical<00:00:58.879> condition<00:00:59.270> that's<00:00:59.300> causing<00:00:59.660> this

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
medical condition that's causing this

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.020 
medical condition that's causing this
but<00:01:00.350> typically<00:01:00.860> it's<00:01:01.129> just<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.610> fat<00:01:01.820> deposit

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
but typically it's just a fat deposit

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.079 
but typically it's just a fat deposit
that's<00:01:02.539> genetically<00:01:03.200> influenced<00:01:03.860> okay<00:01:04.519> so

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
that's genetically influenced okay so

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.270 
that's genetically influenced okay so
you<00:01:05.540> have<00:01:05.750> chunky<00:01:06.380> little<00:01:06.590> ankles<00:01:06.979> and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
you have chunky little ankles and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.920 
you have chunky little ankles and
there's<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.909> new<00:01:08.030> procedure<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:08.570> actually

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
there's a new procedure that actually

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.960 
there's a new procedure that actually
can<00:01:09.110> make<00:01:09.350> them<00:01:09.560> smaller<00:01:09.860> really<00:01:10.520> absolutely

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
can make them smaller really absolutely

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.910 
can make them smaller really absolutely
that<00:01:11.510> well<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.900> procedure<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.409> we<00:01:12.560> do<00:01:12.740> is

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
that well the procedure that we do is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.130 
that well the procedure that we do is
called<00:01:13.159> aqua<00:01:13.430> lipo<00:01:14.000> where<00:01:14.180> we<00:01:14.299> combine<00:01:14.510> using

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
called aqua lipo where we combine using

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.429 
called aqua lipo where we combine using
a<00:01:15.560> smart<00:01:16.100> lipo<00:01:16.340> laser<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.659> laser<00:01:17.689> actually

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
a smart lipo laser the laser actually

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.260 
a smart lipo laser the laser actually
melts<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.920> fat<00:01:18.950> helps<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.640> tighten<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.030> skin

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
melts the fat helps to tighten the skin

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.969 
melts the fat helps to tighten the skin
yeah<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:20.990> then<00:01:21.110> we<00:01:21.170> use<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.409> aqua<00:01:21.710> lipo

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
yeah and then we use the aqua lipo

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.289 
yeah and then we use the aqua lipo
device<00:01:22.220> which<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.549> high<00:01:22.729> powered<00:01:23.119> water

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
device which is a high powered water

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.630 
device which is a high powered water
spray<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.810> actually<00:01:24.350> remove<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.040> fat<00:01:25.310> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
spray to actually remove the fat and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.149 
spray to actually remove the fat and
this<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:25.970> lot<00:01:26.210> easier<00:01:26.750> on<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.560> patient<00:01:27.770> less

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
this is a lot easier on the patient less

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.100 
this is a lot easier on the patient less
downtime<00:01:28.430> less<00:01:28.970> trauma<00:01:29.560> result<00:01:32.110> tramatic

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
downtime less trauma result tramatic

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.230 
downtime less trauma result tramatic
says<00:01:33.860> yeah<00:01:34.220> let's<00:01:34.430> take<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.640> look<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.970> guess<00:01:35.119> we

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
says yeah let's take a look I guess we

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.670 
says yeah let's take a look I guess we
have<00:01:35.330> some<00:01:35.450> pictures<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:35.810> before<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.530> after

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
have some pictures of before and after

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.310 
have some pictures of before and after
wow<00:01:37.580> this<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.150> amazing<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.869> on<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.110> left

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
wow this is amazing so on the left

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.679 
wow this is amazing so on the left
there's<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.650> before<00:01:40.130> correct<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.390> right

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
there's the before correct on the right

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.740 
there's the before correct on the right
that<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.740> huge<00:01:43.400> difference<00:01:43.759> right<00:01:44.329> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
that is a huge difference right and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.510 
that is a huge difference right and
typically<00:01:45.200> what<00:01:45.500> this<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.009> represents<00:01:46.460> a

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
typically what this is it represents a
