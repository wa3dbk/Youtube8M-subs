00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.670
 to the guys how are I going to do this 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.520
 video to teach them how to go from this 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.480
 nail shape 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.050
 to the form stiller or redondita sopitas 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.210
 as you like to call them we are going to 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.420
 start first by making a line 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.330
 imaginary in the pure center of the nail 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.450
 down to see where you are going to 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.030
 stay what is the tip 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.940
 well more or less like here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 you're going to recharge for lima by the way 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.010
 is the roughest let's say that this is not 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.339
 has the number on the one hand I know it's a 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.030
 200 and 180 on the other then it would be the 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.030
 180 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.140
 you can start by recharging the file in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.210
 the finger against also the tip of 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.439
 the nail that would be good from the corner that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.439
 it would be this part of here 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.840
 try when you start filing no 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.590
 go to carve more the finger of your 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.390
 client I always try to advise them 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.860
 that when they are learning to put the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.570
 nails or learning to file and all that 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.240
 practice in yourselves is the only 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.430
 way you are going to see up 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.380
 where they can encourage where if 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.030
 where it does not stop at the moment of doing it with 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.350
 a customer are not struggling and not 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.960
 are going to hurt the client ok 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.960
 then let's start doing it 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.550
 Y 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.970
 since since you tried the most 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.360
 You were able to file towards the tip 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.940
 let's try to give it a little more 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.040
 so this part from here to the end 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.040
 like who says the tip 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:23.109
 you will give it a redondito or picudo touch 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.109
 how can you do it 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.820
 well slightly so that I do not give them more 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.820
 so know from behind look 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.690
 and it looks like this is not completely ready 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.690
 because look on the sides ok 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.320
 on the sides we still have this part 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.960
 from here because we were filing 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.430
 reloaded on the finger now what are we going 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.130
 to do to complete the transformation 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.430
 is to file this part of here from this 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.430
 way 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.040
 as they finish doing their 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:23.200
 its round shape the last thing that would be 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.480
 to do is polish 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.480
 and we are going to polish it with the buffer 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:50.459
 and this is the end ready and I'm left 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.230
 and the same thing you do with the others so that 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.780
 remain so 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.680
 this shine the shine that I bring in case 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.890
 have any doubt how I did this 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.450
 I grabbed it in a dollar store is a 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.010
 It was a clear 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.010
 and I put a few drops 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.670
 I put a few drops of red 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.670
 which would be this one of the ice mark 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.530
 and it's the red that I like the most 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.900
 beautiful 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.780
 a few drops of red and to give it a 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.330
 more natural touch I put a few drops of 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.969
 hueyo guayo 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.669
 that would be the number 204 b 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.489
 you mix it well to make it homogeneous and 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.319
 here you have your shine let's put it in 

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:42.319
 the new nail so they can see how it is 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.280
 with a single pass they will stay like this 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.280
 very natural 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.350
 I put two layers on mine, you let 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.500
 dry well and you can put the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.180
 next layer 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.650
 and is more quotes how are you 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.270
 thank you very much I hope you have 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.270
 liked this video and that serves them
