with it and it is pretty powerful as
well<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.700> now<00:02:24.850> I'm<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.540> talking<00:02:25.810> about<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.489> new

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
well so now I'm we talking about the new

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.509 
well so now I'm we talking about the new
extinction<00:02:28.900> that's<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.620> till<00:02:29.980> it's

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
extinction that's going on till it's

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.810 
extinction that's going on till it's
actually<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.880> new<00:02:31.000> map<00:02:31.209> with<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.670> new

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
actually a new map with that so the new

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.030 
actually a new map with that so the new
extinction<00:02:34.329> map<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.780> called<00:02:35.140> nivel<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.890> this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
extinction map is called nivel and this

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800 
extinction map is called nivel and this
episode<00:02:36.489> one<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:37.030> four<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:37.540> they<00:02:37.660> are

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
episode one out of four so they are

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.699 
episode one out of four so they are
going<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.079> make<00:02:38.200> three<00:02:38.799> more<00:02:39.160> maps<00:02:39.970> with<00:02:40.360> this

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
going to make three more maps with this

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.680 
going to make three more maps with this
extinction<00:02:41.709> story<00:02:42.130> they<00:02:42.910> do<00:02:43.120> want<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.329> make<00:02:43.450> a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
extinction story they do want to make a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.090 
extinction story they do want to make a
story<00:02:44.019> with<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.530> there's<00:02:44.680> actually<00:02:44.769> two

new aliens that come with this one of

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.319 
new aliens that come with this one of
them<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.769> don't<00:02:48.040> know<00:02:48.100> named<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.459> but<00:02:48.790> basically

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
them I don't know named up but basically

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.729 
them I don't know named up but basically
what<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.510> does<00:02:49.600> it's<00:02:49.989> purple<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.470> guys<00:02:50.650> are

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
what it does it's purple you guys are

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.800 
what it does it's purple you guys are
going<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.920> notice<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.250> right<00:02:51.280> away<00:02:51.720> when<00:02:52.720> you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
going to notice it right away when you

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.229 
going to notice it right away when you
start<00:02:53.049> playing<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:54.610> basically<00:02:54.850> goes

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
start playing it it basically goes

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.180 
start playing it it basically goes
around<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.690> map<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.079> every<00:02:56.410> time<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.769> jumps

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
around the map and every time it jumps

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.870 
around the map and every time it jumps
it<00:02:57.310> disappears<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.329> reappears<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.920> any

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
it disappears and then reappears so any

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.340 
it disappears and then reappears so any
time<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:01.299> moving<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.780> just<00:03:01.930> disappears

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
time that it's moving it just disappears

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.080 
time that it's moving it just disappears
out<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.530> thin<00:03:02.680> air<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.489> we're<00:03:03.640> gonna<00:03:03.730> be<00:03:03.880> very

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
out of thin air so we're gonna be very

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.640 
out of thin air so we're gonna be very
careful<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.690> they<00:03:04.810> do<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.019> lots<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.440> health

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
careful and they do have lots of health

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.370 
careful and they do have lots of health
too<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.100> then<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.519> second<00:03:06.880> alien<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:08.079> called

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
too and then the second alien is called

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.020 
too and then the second alien is called
the<00:03:08.470> breeder<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.920> basically<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.910> guys

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the breeder and basically if you guys

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.580 
the breeder and basically if you guys
did<00:03:10.239> play<00:03:10.420> extinction<00:03:10.900> if<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.140> guys<00:03:11.260> know<00:03:11.500> the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
did play extinction if you guys know the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.150 
did play extinction if you guys know the
barrier<00:03:11.980> hives<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:13.359> now<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.750> new<00:03:14.160> barrier

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
barrier hives it is now the new barrier

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.090 
barrier hives it is now the new barrier
high<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.519> border<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.660> basically<00:03:17.100> every

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
high of the border so basically every

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.310 
high of the border so basically every
foot<00:03:18.459> four<00:03:18.910> or<00:03:19.150> five<00:03:19.329> hives<00:03:19.690> you're<00:03:20.140> going<00:03:20.260> to

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
foot four or five hives you're going to

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.099 
foot four or five hives you're going to
shoot<00:03:20.829> at<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.070> in<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.340> certain<00:03:21.519> area<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.180> make

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
shoot at it in a certain area and make

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.509 
shoot at it in a certain area and make
it<00:03:23.230> helps<00:03:23.440> go<00:03:23.560> down<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.040> then<00:03:24.160> I'll<00:03:24.220> come<00:03:24.459> back

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
it helps go down and then I'll come back

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.620 
it helps go down and then I'll come back
at<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.970> end

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
at the end

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.510 
at the end
and<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:26.200> keep<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.710> coming<00:03:26.950> back<00:03:27.070> until<00:03:27.310> you

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
and just keep on coming back until you

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.670 
and just keep on coming back until you
reach<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.670> end<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.720> there's<00:03:29.290> actually<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.560> new

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
reach the end so there's actually a new

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.350 
reach the end so there's actually a new
weapon<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.100> clip<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> vehm<00:03:30.550> an<00:03:30.700> event<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.180> X

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
weapon to clip the vehm an event of X

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.600 
weapon to clip the vehm an event of X
which<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.630> very<00:03:31.930> powerful<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.920> has<00:03:33.070> two<00:03:33.310> shafts

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
which is very powerful it has two shafts

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.060 
which is very powerful it has two shafts
get<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.850> user<00:03:34.030> carefully<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.070> that's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
get the user carefully and that's

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.060 
get the user carefully and that's
basically<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:37.170> with<00:03:38.170> onslaught<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.860> calls

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
basically it with onslaught it calls

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.040 
basically it with onslaught it calls

1499 plus tax for 4999 deal with season

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.390 
1499 plus tax for 4999 deal with season
pass<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:44.410> want<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.650> get<00:03:44.710> it<00:03:44.830> like<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.100> and
