00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.699 
really definitely noticed a difference
in<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:32.299> in<00:03:33.299> my<00:03:33.510> accuracy<00:03:33.900> with<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> painted

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
in my in my accuracy with the painted

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.670 
in my in my accuracy with the painted
sights<00:03:34.980> I'm<00:03:35.190> able<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.489> focus<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:36.209> lot<00:03:36.930> better<00:03:37.320> on

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
sights I'm able to focus a lot better on

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.099 
sights I'm able to focus a lot better on
the<00:03:38.310> front<00:03:38.579> sight<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.540> think<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.840> helps<00:03:39.989> me

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
the front sight and I think it helps me

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.199 
the front sight and I think it helps me
pick<00:03:40.320> up<00:03:40.350> targets<00:03:40.859> quicker<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.400> think<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.000> helps

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
pick up targets quicker I think it helps

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.520 
pick up targets quicker I think it helps
a<00:03:42.239> little<00:03:42.359> bit<00:03:42.540> with<00:03:42.600> my<00:03:42.780> accuracy<00:03:43.410> because

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
a little bit with my accuracy because

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.880 
a little bit with my accuracy because
I'm<00:03:43.769> not<00:03:44.040> struggling<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.030> hard<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.890> focus

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
I'm not struggling so hard to focus

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.229 
I'm not struggling so hard to focus
because<00:03:47.400> when<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.790> these<00:03:47.910> bright

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
because when you have these bright

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.819 
because when you have these bright
colors<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> front<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.200> really<00:03:49.380> draws<00:03:49.620> your

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
colors on the front it really draws your

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.479 
colors on the front it really draws your
eye<00:03:49.890> tool<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.790> think<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.359> can<00:03:52.459> be<00:03:53.459> a

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
eye tool so I think it really can be a

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.610 
eye tool so I think it really can be a
really<00:03:53.820> big<00:03:54.000> upgrade<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.510> your<00:03:54.570> firearm<00:03:54.900> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
really big upgrade to your firearm and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.140 
really big upgrade to your firearm and
your<00:03:55.980> shooting<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.519> know<00:03:56.549> because<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:56.970> does

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
your shooting you know because it does

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.750 
your shooting you know because it does
just<00:03:57.420> draw<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:58.109> eye<00:03:58.140> rate<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.280> plus

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
just draw your eye rate to it and plus

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.979 
just draw your eye rate to it and plus
it's<00:03:59.970> wearing<00:04:00.329> those<00:04:00.510> little<00:04:00.840> light
