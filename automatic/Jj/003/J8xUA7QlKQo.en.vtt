00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.160
 francisco ruiz once again and good 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.279

 mobile world congress 2015 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:26.560
 we are looking at the new terminal s60 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.900
 the mid- range of the low-android range in 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.269
 As for price but what can we 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.870
 highlighting can be a tremendous 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.760
 competition for the motor 2015 in case 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.270
 that again he decided to 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.719
 disembark in European territory well 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.730
 as we see it has its own interface 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.449
 wii which is an interface without drawer 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.640
 applications just as in the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.320
 yao phones me the phones with the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.449
 operating system 1000 that is based 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.219
 on android where everything will go to 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.359
 our main desk and now 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.359
 we can organize folders 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:10.180
 has a qualcomm processor 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:12.100
 snapdragon 410 and four cores and 64 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.080
 bits has a screen of 5 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.390
 inches with hd resolution so that it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.520
 it remains at 1280 x 720 it's technology and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.240
 as for your front camera account 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.810
 with 5 megapixels of resolution with great 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.490
 angular and pixels for especially 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.950
 designed to take a selfish 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.100
 amazing about your camera 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.240
 rear has a 3 camera 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.399
 megapixels with autofocus and flash 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.679
 incorporated we have several colors 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.119
 different to choose now we are with 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.039
 this yellow throwing pistachio that is 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.340
 very attractive and gives a very 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.990
 juvenile the interface does not have fields 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.520
 of applications I have already explained in 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.530
 how about the blue version that is 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.200
 installed if we go to the settings 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.210
 near the phone and where he puts 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.280
 device information we are going to 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.470
 can check how it stays on android 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.570
 4.4 point 4 kat kit 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.009
 this is one thing that for example the 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.450
 to the latest 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.970
 version since they are the terminals that 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.210
 first and well androids the next 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.220
 andoain versions we are going to finish 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.740
 looking at your camera that I already told you that 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.660
 it's a good camera much better than 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.700
 of the vote in this sense let's take 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.680
 a capture for example I will set aside the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.900
 moment of the mobile and see a capture 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.100
 to the specifications now we're going to 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.870
 make a capture here in front 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.500
 and now let's change to the camera 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.850
 front so you can see the quality 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.590
 expected 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.930
 is processing the image processes it 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.520
 pretty fast and good if we go now to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.370
 The galery 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.020
 let's see how the images are from 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.960
 high quality 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.700
 the images especially in the camera 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.099
 rear 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.170
 it's a piece of camera that you shit 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.360
 as one would say vulgarly here we see the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.099
 Product specifications such as 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.720
 photo I made a resolution 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.819
 awesome with his camera 3 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.769
 megapixels as we say this can be 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.769
 a good terminal 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 alternative to the new 2015 engine what 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.750
 logically we do not believe that this 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.209
 disembarked in Europe, much less in 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.760
 SPAIN us assume that price 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.790
 will be between 150 to 160 euros 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.709
 approximately but good as I say 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.019
 a good option if you want to buy 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.450
 the terminal through the internet in 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.640
 any page that imports 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.709
 what in that case you have to have in 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.420
 count the charge that may come in 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.420
 cost of customs duties
