30 centimeters and the 35 centimeters

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.470 
30 centimeters and the 35 centimeters
basically<00:00:19.340> after<00:00:19.730> I<00:00:19.939> posted<00:00:20.210> my<00:00:20.270> video

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
basically after I posted my video

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.109 
basically after I posted my video
yesterday<00:00:20.869> with<00:00:21.230> my<00:00:21.380> new<00:00:21.529> one<00:00:22.119> everybody

yesterday with my new one everybody

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.700 
yesterday with my new one everybody
basically<00:00:23.509> was<00:00:23.840> like<00:00:23.869> I<00:00:24.080> need<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.470> see<00:00:24.590> the

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
basically was like I need to see the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.170

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
difference between the two sizes so I

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.970

so this is what this looks like the two
side-by-side<00:01:08.119> I'm<00:01:08.570> actually<00:01:08.720> gonna<00:01:08.930> get

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
side-by-side I'm actually gonna get

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.600 
side-by-side I'm actually gonna get
behind<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.619> camera<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.070> see<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.520> I'm

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
behind the camera to see that I'm

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.429 
behind the camera to see that I'm
actually<00:01:10.820> making<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.330> comparison<00:01:11.689> properly

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
actually making the comparison properly

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.910 
actually making the comparison properly
you<00:01:12.710> can<00:01:12.860> actually<00:01:13.040> see<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:14.030> difference<00:01:17.920> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
you can actually see the difference the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.929 
you can actually see the difference the
30<00:01:19.700> centimeters<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:21.460> here<00:01:22.460> let's<00:01:22.640> put<00:01:22.820> them

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
30 centimeters is here let's put them

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.539 
30 centimeters is here let's put them
end<00:01:23.149> to<00:01:23.210> end<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:24.320> your<00:01:24.500> 30<00:01:24.740> centimeters<00:01:25.310> is

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
end to end so your 30 centimeters is

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.080 
end to end so your 30 centimeters is
really<00:01:26.479> just<00:01:26.659> 5<00:01:26.840> centimeters<00:01:27.560> shorter<00:01:28.429> than

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
really just 5 centimeters shorter than

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.239 
really just 5 centimeters shorter than
the<00:01:29.359> 35<00:01:29.960> but<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:31.179> quite<00:01:32.179> here<00:01:32.749> hold<00:01:32.990> on<00:01:33.249> it

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
the 35 but it is quite here hold on it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:37.469 
the 35 but it is quite here hold on it
is<00:01:34.399> quite<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> bit<00:01:34.850> shorter<00:01:35.390> from<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.840> sides<00:01:36.109> so

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
is quite a bit shorter from the sides so

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.459 
is quite a bit shorter from the sides so
see<00:01:38.479> if<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.719> see<00:01:38.899> what<00:01:39.020> I'm<00:01:39.079> talking<00:01:39.229> about

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
there the 30 30 centimeters is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.330 
there the 30 30 centimeters is
significantly<00:01:48.759> shorter<00:01:49.759> than<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:52.179> then<00:01:53.179> the

significantly shorter than the then the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.919 
significantly shorter than the then the
35<00:01:55.340> centimeters<00:01:55.939> you<00:01:55.969> can<00:01:56.210> see<00:01:56.359> them<00:01:56.539> right

here

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.859 
here

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
and then let's go and do a front view

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.940 
and then let's go and do a front view
again<00:02:00.429> this<00:02:01.429> is<00:02:01.609> what<00:02:01.759> they<00:02:01.880> look<00:02:02.060> like

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
again this is what they look like

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.219 
again this is what they look like
front<00:02:03.950> wise<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:06.799> different<00:02:07.249> sizes<00:02:08.229> now

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
front wise and the different sizes now

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.330 
front wise and the different sizes now
I'm<00:02:09.470> actually<00:02:09.740> going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.039> put<00:02:10.220> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
I'm actually going to put the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.490 
I'm actually going to put the
measurements<00:02:10.910> on<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.150> down<00:02:11.360> bar<00:02:11.690> below<00:02:11.720> just

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
measurements on the down bar below just

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.960 
measurements on the down bar below just
so<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.740> have<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.069> exact<00:02:13.400> measurements

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
so you can have the exact measurements

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.160 
so you can have the exact measurements
of<00:02:14.030> each<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.750> need<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> information

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
of each so if you need the information

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.890 
of each so if you need the information
check<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.920> below<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.120> did<00:02:17.360> want<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.660> show

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.170 
little roundabout and from the back you
can<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.500> mean<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.890> 35<00:02:33.340> centimeters<00:02:33.910> looks

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
can I mean the 35 centimeters looks

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.740 
can I mean the 35 centimeters looks
significantly<00:02:35.140> larger<00:02:35.710> than<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:37.090> 35<00:02:39.600> okay<00:02:40.600> so

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
significantly larger than the 35 okay so

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.150 
significantly larger than the 35 okay so
I<00:02:40.870> also<00:02:40.960> want<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.230> take<00:02:41.350> five<00:02:41.530> minutes<00:02:41.740> since<00:02:42.010> I

so I want you guys to let me know what

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.550 
so I want you guys to let me know what
it<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.240> that<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.450> think<00:02:52.660> about<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
it is that you think about it if the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.410 
it is that you think about it if the
color<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:53.920> good<00:02:54.160> if<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.370> zooming<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.030> good<00:02:55.240> I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
color is good if the zooming is good I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.760 
color is good if the zooming is good I
really<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.470> going<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.650> be

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
really think that this is going to be

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.190 
really think that this is going to be
the<00:02:56.920> new<00:02:57.040> camera<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:58.090> going<00:02:58.690> forward<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.170> think

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the new camera to going forward I think

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.140 
the new camera to going forward I think
that<00:02:59.410> it's<00:02:59.620> kind<00:02:59.800> of<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.010> way<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.190> go<00:03:00.430> based<00:03:00.970> on

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that it's kind of the way to go based on

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.910 
that it's kind of the way to go based on
like<00:03:01.300> some<00:03:01.480> test<00:03:01.720> shots<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.170> did<00:03:02.410> but<00:03:02.890> I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
like some test shots that I did but I

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.710 
like some test shots that I did but I
wasn't<00:03:03.250> sure<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:03.610> I<00:03:03.760> just<00:03:04.000> really<00:03:04.360> need<00:03:04.540> your
