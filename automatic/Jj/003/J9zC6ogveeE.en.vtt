 a nice tender welcome to this 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 new video by pietro max kraft 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.050
 today we are in the company of jack like 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:36.460
 beautiful all certain that we ask if it is 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:40.000
 You can also play with a friend 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.290
 not having a server is possible 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.989
 because from version 1.3 year of cembra 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:55.420
 1.3 have enabled open to grandma 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:58.510
 in practice you must be connected 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.079
 with the same network with your friend 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.000
 with the same network for example once 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.000
 go to the home of a friend and and 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.619
 program but one day I have a deed to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.690
 your friend's house and with the new one 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.810
 same wifi you connect both 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.289
 in the same network or there is this 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.530
 little program that is called much that serves 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.330
 in cases that you are not connected to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.940
 same network you can use this 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.110
 program then how this works 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:33.250
 program you click here your friend 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.619
 which will host the world will have to do for you 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.520
 create a new network here will set the di 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.849
 network 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 we are an example we want the so 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:45.610
 password password and then create 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.289
 no one creates it because no 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.660
 and instead the friend who did not create 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.149
 then you see you participate 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.800
 half of the existing network will put them 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:02.080
 which you will have previously placed below 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:07.450
 the respective password to play one 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.590
 LAN to 200 which I will be in the computer of 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.870
 jack because I have a problem that I don't know 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.450
 why can't I do the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.610
 sleep however to open a world was 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.870
 launch makes the single player 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.870

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.500

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.440
 langa be very careful put 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.530
 creative mode or survival like 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.060

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.690
 etc. you want them 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.110

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.710
 they will ask what this number means 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.570
 this number is used to play the 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.650
 your friend who created the year 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.010

 respective ip you click of his 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:19.620

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.050
 that monitors local game hosted on 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.570

 enter your friend 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.520
 go to the single player ie 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.379
 the friend who 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.740
 the one who created the director between 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:44.099
 world that wants to play single player 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.490
 then milan opens but put the options of 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:50.460

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.179
 you can still play it though 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.589
 possibly a normal year there 

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:17.100
 the perceptions are still nothing though 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:20.730
