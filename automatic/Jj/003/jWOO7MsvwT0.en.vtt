00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hi guys, it was good today, do not talk a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.220
 few new TVs are coming out with 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.990
 4k resolution 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.190
 you must have heard and heard 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.250
 talk a lot 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.090
 from this year on this new technology 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 is with 44 cases of resolution 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.570
 which in practice says that your TV has four 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.269
 times more resolution than a duty 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.060
 full hd 1080p 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.739
 You should already be used to it. 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.630
 some people do not know if it's not for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.899
 know some details before you buy 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.170
 a 4k resolution TV 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.690
 one of the important details is you know 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.270
 that you will find in stores soon 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.460
 soon the four teams of tradition and will 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 want to buy at home and call 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.340
 There's a chance you 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 so that image wonder is well 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.489
 You're better accustomed but you? 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.060
 need to know that it locks up TV and delivers the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.430
 that it promises 4k resolution needs 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.000
 some details are observed 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 first content and is not available 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.909
 is the moment in our country does not exist 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.770
 today broadcast in 4k resolution 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 the file is quite large for you 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:29.990
 have an idea a movie that completes the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:34.320
 and Sony reported that it would not fit 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 at least 100 gigas space to power 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 put a full movie to resolution 44 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.409
 there you can use but nowadays 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.299
 she has as Portuguese how to get smaller 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:53.159
 to sony then transmit a 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.030
 content in 4k for example content 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.549
 digital 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 netflix said he will do his training 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.310
 with content from that year onwards 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.040
 four cars 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.500
 Let's see if it will work 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.030
 That way it's every moment that goes 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.640
 depend on a number of factors to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.990
 dependency you have and suitable for 171 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.850
 from the center court 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.890
 the appropriate instance can perceive the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.500
 difference will not make a difference 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.690
 between 13 in vogue hd and ours for 20081 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.480
 tend to switch from the average to 3,840 or 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.120
 2160 pixels resolution 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.730
 then not to fear the pressure to put 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.670
 it needs to be larger than for example 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.720
 and a 50 inch tv 55 inch tv 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.210
 generally 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.680
 and you can not be too far from 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.810
 tv after interesting and little else 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.360
 far to be able to have a quality of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.980
 picture better view could sit 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.930
 closest to being able to 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.250
 see it high up there on the blog 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.010
 if you want to know more about 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.580
 subject distance with the fish in 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.620
 table adding 35 40 and 50 and 60 inches 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.990
 for the distance line is the instance 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.570
 the maximum you should be able to 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.920
 perceive the difference in content with 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.740
 this quality 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.520
 Now I have a question that we're going to 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.450
 leave you and so far it has not been 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.040
 answered 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.250
 Does the naked eye get it? 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.190
 identify the difference content 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.830
 control in 48 here as they spoke 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.060
 recently in sales and so many 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.340
 Sony to Samsung are already creating the chÃ¡vez 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.440
 TV proposal and 8th resolution / thirst 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.090
 you the human eye to achieve 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.470
 see difference of a plot of 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.480
 four hectares 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.520
 some journalists in the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.590
 Our language is not to comment on a subject 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.170
 informing that simply the eye 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.690
 human would not be able to perceive 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.180
 no difference from 4 each 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.450
 resolution is that this is true 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.330
 people will only pay the investment 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.000
 buy a tv presented from the 8th of the clt 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.930
 at least 85 inches less than 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.459
 This was not going to do any good for you. 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.680
 achieve this resolution 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.239
 From this year you 'll come and see 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.850
 in the market you buy a new tv 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.970
 offer in case you will see 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.650
 various TV options in the market to 4k 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.009
 they should get even 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.290
 here in Brazil is the market is not 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:36.130
 easy being prepared for this 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.889
 I understand broadcast and movies and series 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.259
 and shows in four places not 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.620
 there is at present the transmission of this 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.300
 content you phase can find the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.880
 equipment installed in your home and 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.960
 not just the differences spares 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.449
 the goal then are the sound series of factors 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.259
 you need to observe if there is matter in 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.630
 blog 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.440
 the description to the end of it if you 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.919
 liked 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.440

 We'll release more information about 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.949
 this technology 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.949
 Thank you to watch.
