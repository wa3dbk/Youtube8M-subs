00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
just sitting down playing some League of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
just sitting down playing some League of
Legends<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:11.970> runescape<00:01:12.210> or<00:01:12.570> whatever<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
Legends or runescape or whatever and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840 
Legends or runescape or whatever and
then<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.350> listening<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> someone<00:01:14.400> ramble

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.640 
then just listening to someone ramble
about<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.689> guess<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
about that and then I guess it kind of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
about that and then I guess it kind of
influenced<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> made<00:01:18.000> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
influenced the way that I made that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179 
influenced the way that I made that
video<00:01:18.570> where<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.930> went<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.590> longer<00:01:19.890> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
video where it went on much longer it

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
video where it went on much longer it
