here's a quick comparison with the ghost
glass<00:01:26.730> for<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:26.970> galaxy<00:01:27.390> s5<00:01:27.750> versus<00:01:28.140> the

glass for the galaxy s5 versus the
feather<00:01:28.470> glass<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.010> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.310> there's

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
feather glass and as you can see there's

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.980 
feather glass and as you can see there's
a<00:01:29.700> significant<00:01:30.270> difference<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.720> thickness

the ghost glass being point three
millimeters<00:01:33.180> thick<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.900> feather<00:01:34.140> glass

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
millimeters thick and the feather glass

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
millimeters thick and the feather glass
being<00:01:34.620> point<00:01:34.920> 15<00:01:35.340> millimeters<00:01:35.940> thick<00:01:36.120> this<00:01:36.600> is

being point 15 millimeters thick this is
not<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:36.930> feather<00:01:37.200> glass<00:01:37.440> plus<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.010> does

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
not the feather glass plus so it does

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
not the feather glass plus so it does
not<00:01:38.160> have<00:01:38.520> rounded<00:01:38.910> edges<00:01:39.330> but<00:01:39.780> being<00:01:40.080> that

three<00:03:27.629> accuracy<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:29.069> worked<00:03:29.310> excellent

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
three accuracy and it worked excellent

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.399 
three accuracy and it worked excellent
plus<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> oleophobic<00:03:30.540> coating<00:03:30.629> on<00:03:31.229> this

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
smoother glide of your thumb when

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.759 
smoother glide of your thumb when
swiping<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.479> I<00:03:36.599> said<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:37.079> OEO<00:03:37.439> phobic

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
swiping and as I said the OEO phobic

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.039 
swiping and as I said the OEO phobic
coating<00:03:38.099> on<00:03:38.220> here<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.549> helps<00:03:39.060> aid<00:03:39.299> was<00:03:39.659> swiping

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
coating on here it helps aid was swiping

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.270 
coating on here it helps aid was swiping
your<00:03:40.109> finger<00:03:40.229> so<00:03:40.650> you're<00:03:40.769> going<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:40.919> get<00:03:41.099> more

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
your finger so you're going to get more

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.909 
your finger so you're going to get more
of<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.459> silky<00:03:41.849> smooth<00:03:42.150> slide<00:03:42.509> plus<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.409> aids<00:03:43.709> in

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
of a silky smooth slide plus it aids in

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.589 
of a silky smooth slide plus it aids in
fingerprint<00:03:44.519> reduction<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.299> you're<00:03:45.449> going<00:03:45.540> to

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
fingerprint reduction so you're going to

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.119 
fingerprint reduction so you're going to
be<00:03:45.720> able<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.930> wipe<00:03:46.139> off<00:03:46.349> fingerprints<00:03:46.919> much

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
be able to wipe off fingerprints much

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.860 
be able to wipe off fingerprints much
easier<00:03:47.609> than<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.939> would<00:03:48.090> put<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.509> factory

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
easier than you would put the factory

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.110 
easier than you would put the factory
screen<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.680> also<00:03:49.829> has<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.099> surface<00:03:50.400> hardness<00:03:50.849> of

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
screen it also has a surface hardness of

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.629 
screen it also has a surface hardness of
9h<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.229> it's<00:03:52.409> going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> be<00:03:52.859> excellent

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
9h so it's going to be excellent
