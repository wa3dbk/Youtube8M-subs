super bright and you can see by pulling

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.640 
super bright and you can see by pulling
this<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:14.909> right<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:16.020> adjust<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
this in and out right here it adjust it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.469 
this in and out right here it adjust it
so<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> Y<00:01:17.700> diplomat<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
so as you have the Y diplomat now you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
so as you have the Y diplomat now you
slide<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> becomes<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> focused

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
slide it in it becomes more of a focused

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.850 
slide it in it becomes more of a focused
beam<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> light<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.439> can't<00:01:22.710> necessarily

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
beam of light so you can't necessarily

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.460 
beam of light so you can't necessarily
tell<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:23.970> video<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.840> super

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
tell in this video but it's super

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.170 
tell in this video but it's super

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
focused right here obviously you can see

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
focused right here obviously you can see
that<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.720> compared<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.650> staring

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that they compared to what I'm staring

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.230 
that they compared to what I'm staring
at<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.280> personally<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> guys<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.090> see

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
on on the video it's a super focused

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
on on the video it's a super focused
beam<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> light<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> middle

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
beam of light right here in the middle

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.859 
beam of light right here in the middle
so<00:01:34.409> super<00:01:35.189> bright<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.450> nice<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> runs

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
so super bright it's really nice it runs

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.770 
so super bright it's really nice it runs
