00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.190
 in cali particularly is cali 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.670
 the 60s were like the years that 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.880
 they promised a very flourishing city 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.550
 important but let's say it's a 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.920
 miracle that vanishes with the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.920
 years later in the 70s 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.970
 is a let's say like a decade 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:42.449
 convulsed but very rich in 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:46.019
 encounters and disagreements in let's say 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:51.870
 as a crisis in society in that decade 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:55.140
 I start being part of the scene 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 Artistic city and in those years 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.720
 they created the art festivals they 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.320
 they created the student festivals of 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 art as events parallel to the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.689
 art festival and if one thinks let's say 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.560
 in all these movements in a city 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.070
 so small, so let's say you could think 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.040
 that there was a strong activity one 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.550
 around 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.990
 at 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:28.630
 in those years the place to doubt is one that 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.720
 it's basically a container a house 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.290
 There is a phrase that I like a lot about 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.280
 fernando savater I once read it 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.280
 what does it say 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.310
 the doubt is uncomfortable but the certainty is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.799
 ridiculous 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.550
 and we found that the name of the place to 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.630
 doubts was 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.830
 precisely the opposite to the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.960
 certainty 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.479
 the opposite to the place where the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.420
 contemporary artist wants to put on a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.640
 space that promotes research 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.520
 that promotes the diversity of points of 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 seen the disagreements the encounters 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.990
 it has to be a space that 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:22.030
 doubt and that accepts let's say the the others 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.030
 possible truths about something
