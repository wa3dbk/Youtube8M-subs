00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
alright here we are again after some a

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.519 
alright here we are again after some a
lot<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.319> online<00:00:04.650> research<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:06.290> getting<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.350> lot

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
lot of online research and getting a lot

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.499 
lot of online research and getting a lot
of<00:00:07.910> helpful<00:00:08.910> thoughts<00:00:09.570> from<00:00:09.929> forum<00:00:10.769> members<00:00:11.219> I

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
of helpful thoughts from forum members I

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.200 
of helpful thoughts from forum members I
have<00:00:13.549> removed<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.089> windshield<00:00:15.480> wiper<00:00:16.049> and

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
have removed the windshield wiper and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.550 
have removed the windshield wiper and
the<00:00:18.210> thought<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the thought was that it was like a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.029 
the thought was that it was like a
hollow<00:00:20.900> cavity<00:00:21.900> though<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> allowed<00:00:22.830> me<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
hollow cavity though it allowed me to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:33.080 
hollow cavity though it allowed me to
get<00:00:23.250> back<00:00:23.310> inside<00:00:25.070> here<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:31.910> obviously<00:00:32.910> is

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
get back inside here but obviously is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.389 
get back inside here but obviously is
the<00:00:33.899> case<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.710> did<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.070> allow<00:00:35.340> me

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the case but what it did do is allow me

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
the case but what it did do is allow me
to<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.790> reference<00:00:36.239> actually<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> leak

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
to get reference actually where the leak

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.660 
to get reference actually where the leak
was<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:41.010> leak<00:00:41.870> is<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.489> I'm

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
was and the leak is right in here so I'm

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.510 
was and the leak is right in here so I'm
in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> middle<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> cleaning<00:00:45.420> everything<00:00:45.840> out

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
in the middle of cleaning everything out

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.819 
in the middle of cleaning everything out
but<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.870> basically<00:00:48.870> where<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> water<00:00:49.649> is

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
but that's basically where the water is

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.760 
but that's basically where the water is
coming<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.280> from<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> outside<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> inside

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
coming in from the outside or the inside

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
coming in from the outside or the inside
so<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:53.190> only<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.550> accessible<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.539> it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so not only is it accessible but it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.459 
so not only is it accessible but it's
fixable<00:00:55.260> which<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> good<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.629> did<00:00:57.629> replace<00:00:58.050> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
fixable which is good I did replace this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.310 
fixable which is good I did replace this
windshield<00:01:01.340> Co<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.460> guess<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.290> can

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
windshield Co I guess which as you can

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.859 
windshield Co I guess which as you can
see<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.890> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.339> puts<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.950> water<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
see it kind of puts a water to

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.330 
see it kind of puts a water to
derailment<00:01:09.869> between<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> windshield<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
derailment between the windshield and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.950 
derailment between the windshield and
the<00:01:11.400> fender<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.000> also<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.990> new<00:01:13.760> scraper<00:01:14.960> in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the fender I also put new scraper in

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.280 
the fender I also put new scraper in
here<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.090> greatly<00:01:18.600> reduced<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
here all which have greatly reduced the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.600 
here all which have greatly reduced the
amount<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> water<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> floor<00:01:20.490> we

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
amount of water that's on the floor we

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.960 
amount of water that's on the floor we
just<00:01:20.640> had<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> real<00:01:21.119> big<00:01:21.240> green<00:01:21.570> last<00:01:21.810> night<00:01:22.970> so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
just had a real big green last night so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270 
just had a real big green last night so
every<00:01:24.869> move<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.350> seems<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> right

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
every move is seems to be in the right

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
every move is seems to be in the right
area<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.909> I'm<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.600> clean<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.290> as
