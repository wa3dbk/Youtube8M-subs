00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.039 

I<00:00:09.130> think<00:00:09.940> first<00:00:10.120> round<00:00:10.480> we<00:00:10.690> were<00:00:10.840> a<00:00:10.870> little

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
I think first round we were a little

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.780 
I think first round we were a little
pressurized<00:00:11.650> I<00:00:11.980> think<00:00:12.190> we<00:00:12.309> were<00:00:12.429> probably<00:00:12.549> a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
pressurized I think we were probably a

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.339 
pressurized I think we were probably a
little<00:00:12.910> tense<00:00:13.240> and<00:00:13.480> wanting<00:00:13.869> to<00:00:13.900> shoot<00:00:14.200> the

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
little tense and wanting to shoot the

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.320 
little tense and wanting to shoot the
numbers<00:00:14.619> that<00:00:14.650> we<00:00:14.860> normally<00:00:15.039> do<00:00:15.429> which<00:00:16.150> are

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
numbers that we normally do which are

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.140 
numbers that we normally do which are
really<00:00:16.630> really<00:00:16.810> good<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.490> that's<00:00:18.730> normal<00:00:19.119> for

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
really really good and that's normal for

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.330 
really really good and that's normal for
a<00:00:19.330> home<00:00:19.539> event<00:00:19.900> round<00:00:20.590> two<00:00:20.829> we<00:00:21.009> got<00:00:21.099> a<00:00:21.160> little
