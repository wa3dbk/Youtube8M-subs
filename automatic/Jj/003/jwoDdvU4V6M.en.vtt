00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.060
 hello everyone and very good I'm a picker and 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.980
 good today I bring you a new video of 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.379
 how to put dragon ball online in 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.289
 Spanish with the last patch that ends 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.850
 to go out and well it's pretty simple 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.100
 just look in the box 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.320
 description that I put in the video and 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.840
 you will see two links two links to 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.590
 good mediafire what they have to do 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.560
 is to download the first and the second 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.860
 these are the links and good the first 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.710
 is the link point pack white 0 point 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.890
 pack that are two files and we download them 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.920
 As you can see here we have them worth 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.409
 come down at a good time well now 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.160
 we go with the other one that is the patch 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.079
 2012 online triangle 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.690
 and we lower it is the last one that has come out 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 right now and good he works in a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.520
 moment and here we have them well that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.670
 must be done now 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.379
 very easy 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.390
 as we can see we have the archives 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.199
 so we created the new folder in the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.790
 desktop and we put new patch for 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.100
 example is worth it in this way what are you going to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.930
 understand super easy as well that there 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.630
 what to do we drag the files that 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.340
 we have downloaded those from inside to the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.590
 patch folder new voucher 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.590
 here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.750
 both well now with the other that we 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.579
 we open the folder patch test 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.520
 that we have downloaded and what inside 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.440
 all all the three files are put 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.560
 inside you do not leave any 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.770
 all right 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.330
 because I would be inside now it 's very 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.710
 easy what's left would be to go to 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.690
 location of the file 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.500
 for example as a team you will have 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.520
 you the game team of archives of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.200
 86 program 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.810
 and here dragon ball taiwan is worth then 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.010
 you have it, we are going to 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.750
 locate 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.740
 taiwan 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.670
 pak well now we search the archives 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.780
 lang lang point 0 point pack let's 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.360
 properties 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.780
 and we give both boxes that are 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.550
 removed that are not marked any 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.960
 If they are marked, we will demarcate them and 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.300
 We accept down 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.050
 Well, what do we have to do now? 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.370
 it's very easy we have to drag the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.120
 files that we have put in the folder 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.370
 new patch 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.220
 what is all that we have downloaded here 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:45.080
 inside it's worth looking we take everything 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.660
 everything even reading me too and if 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.270
 we replace if it jumps 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.580
 and we already have the new patch 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.460
 but an important step is missing for 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.230
 activate what would be 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.040
 do not make us wrong here 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.650
 we follow the same folder worth 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.260
 let's go to the patch test dragon ball 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.260
 online this is right button 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.910
 properties do not execute as 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.550
 administrator sorry to execute as 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.080
 administrator and it's very important that what 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.030
 execute is as administrator because if 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.370
 can give us failures and you get this 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.230
 panel good now let's do 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.300
 click to patch 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.739
 well we give it and it says to start 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.870
 patch I know it can take a little 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.569
 you 're not giving anything, we're going to accept 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.040
 and good and we have good because 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.170
 we accept and now we do have the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.060
 game in Spanish is worth to execute it is 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.970
 very easy we do not have to run the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.170
 file launcher like many do that 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.620
 it's just to update 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.040
 we execute the exe point that has this 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:52.400
 this way you can see it in team 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.470
 program files 86 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.460
 I for example I have there each one where 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.300
 have dragon ball online 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.890
 and let's go there we have it up as 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.050
 possible is the launcher that is the one that does not 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.690
 you have to execute you have to run this 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.430
 here that puts of I see to dry it is worth 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.090
 run as administrator always for 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.090
 avoid failures 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:19.090
 we do not give anything permission 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.300
 and well this would be the process of how 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.060
 put this game in spanish vale 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.580
 obviously it is produced only 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.259
 interface because the whole game has not 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.110
 gone out is still impossible to translate 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.210
 so for now we have to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.639
 conform to this and nothing up to here the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.289
 video I will not be able to continue recording the 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.080
 game because I was recording with a 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.249
 program that does not support recording the game and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.309
 good 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.919
 So, look if you are admitted, I do not know 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:50.619
 how good, because here you can see 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.099
 that I have users videos credits all 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:55.479
 in Spanish in Spanish and nothing up 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.879
 here the video everyone who puts his 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.919
 account and I hope it has been served 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.529
 quite especially to those who are 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.989
 starting in this game and nothing to leave me 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:09.959
 a like and a subscription to follow 

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:09.959
 uploading videos so to another
