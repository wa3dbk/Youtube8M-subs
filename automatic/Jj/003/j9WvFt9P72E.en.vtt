two quarters two quarters and then you

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.699 
two quarters two quarters and then you
spray<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:06.020> then<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.170> mix<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.560> with<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
spray it and then you mix it with the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
then you sand it and then you clear it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.410 
then you sand it and then you clear it
so<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.630> will<00:03:13.140> help<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.860> definitely<00:03:14.730> blend

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
so that will help it definitely blend

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.870 
so that will help it definitely blend
into<00:03:15.600> my<00:03:16.250> blend<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.489> like<00:03:17.670> look<00:03:17.820> at
