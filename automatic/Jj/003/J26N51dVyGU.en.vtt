00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
I guess we'll look that up before I did

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.789 
I guess we'll look that up before I did
this<00:01:56.540> video<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.500> um<00:01:58.240> if<00:01:59.240> your<00:01:59.750> skin<00:02:00.080> is<00:02:00.350> dry

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
this video but um if your skin is dry

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.820 
this video but um if your skin is dry
and<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:02.840> feel<00:02:03.049> like<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.320> have<00:02:03.440> any<00:02:03.650> dry

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
and you feel like you have any dry

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.520 
and you feel like you have any dry
patches<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:04.580> would<00:02:04.820> recommend<00:02:05.270> maybe<00:02:06.140> putting

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
patches I would recommend maybe putting

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.940 
patches I would recommend maybe putting
a<00:02:06.560> moisturizer<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:07.299> under<00:02:08.299> this<00:02:08.539> like<00:02:09.409> I<00:02:09.619> did

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
a moisturizer on under this like I did

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.410 
a moisturizer on under this like I did
have<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.159> moisturizer<00:02:10.519> on<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.150> had<00:02:11.299> my

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
have a moisturizer on but I had my

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.320 
have a moisturizer on but I had my
proactively<00:02:11.989> shower<00:02:12.349> on<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.910> kind<00:02:14.209> of

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
proactively shower on and it is kind of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.220 
proactively shower on and it is kind of
drying<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
drying and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.740 
drying and
dries<00:02:15.410> my<00:02:15.620> skin<00:02:15.650> out<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> little<00:02:16.220> bit<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:17.239> I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
dries my skin out a little bit so I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.809 
dries my skin out a little bit so I
think<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.170> better<00:02:21.319> with<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.489> wish

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
think this would be better with a wish

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.960 
think this would be better with a wish
right<00:02:23.090> nice<00:02:23.540> moisturize<00:02:24.230> skin<00:02:24.860> underneath<00:02:25.730> it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
right nice moisturize skin underneath it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.390 
right nice moisturize skin underneath it
because<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.840> did<00:02:27.110> cold<00:02:27.319> my<00:02:27.470> skin<00:02:27.709> very<00:02:27.920> nice<00:02:28.099> it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
because it did cold my skin very nice it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.040 
because it did cold my skin very nice it
smoothed<00:02:28.670> out<00:02:28.849> my<00:02:29.030> skin<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.569> made<00:02:29.720> my<00:02:29.840> apt

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
smoothed out my skin it made my apt

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.070 
smoothed out my skin it made my apt
makeup<00:02:30.500> application<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.730> effortless

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
makeup application so it's effortless

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320 
makeup application so it's effortless
but<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.530> didn't<00:02:34.250> feel<00:02:34.400> like<00:02:34.459> my<00:02:34.700> skin<00:02:34.760> was<00:02:35.000> being

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
but I didn't feel like my skin was being

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.720

wish dries so I definitely would do it

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.820 
wish dries so I definitely would do it
with<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.150> moisturizer<00:02:41.569> which<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.440> have<00:02:42.620> tried

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
with a moisturizer which I have tried

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.630 
with a moisturizer which I have tried
and<00:02:43.250> actually<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.360> does<00:02:44.660> work<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.989> lot<00:02:45.140> better

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
and actually it does work a lot better

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.729 
and actually it does work a lot better
