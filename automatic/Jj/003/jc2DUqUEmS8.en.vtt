00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.490
 I greet everyone with you again I am Olga 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.480
 Mamistov aromatherapist and psychologist 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.290
 and the creator of the Internet Academy 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.500
 aromatherapy and today I want to continue 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:26.529
 our new tradition is monthly 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.619
 Aromashoping That is, what is new bought 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.789
 I have in October, those who have not yet 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.680
 saw September 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.199
 I advise you to see since September 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.750
 turned out very fruitful precisely in 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.180
 plan different aroma shopping let's 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.590
 let's start with spices like 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.469
 it turned out from the comments on this 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.540
 channel buy vanilla point it 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.120
 some kind of problem especially 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.520
 probably in small towns so i am 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.980
 I decided to show this vanilla which I 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.520
 usually buy and how much it costs 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.100
 let's see here she is good for them and 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:06.550
 Now open and through the wrapper can be 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.190
 feel that they are very soft that already 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.410
 they speak as a taiwan or in extreme 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.990
 least who were buried properly and she did not 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.200
 it dried up already very good smell 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.180
 her wonderful quality me now he 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.330
 quite a few years now buy exactly 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.509
 this is probably not the best vanilla 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.729
 quality but I'm with this now and not often 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.970
 so I came across from this 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.740
 none of the very best worth it in 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.619
 In general, I would not say that at all 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.619
 cheap it costs lush like vanilla 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.560
 I bought for 131 rubles you such a price 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.759
 some cities say they are worth it 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.729
 three times more expensive 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.490
 such fine vanilla infused and in 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.729
 oil and alcohol that is very useful 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.729
 thing to create high schools of oils i think 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.040
 tour yes and if we already opened the topic of spice 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.310
 let's see more cinnamon sticks and 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.990
 seems to be such a simple thing and and 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.680
 much easier to meet than pods 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.460
 vanilla 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.130
 but there are certain nuances I bought them 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.030
 for the most part for some crafts and 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.240
 some aromatherapy 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.590
 they do not look different but I wanted you 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.100
 show no because 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.590
 with cinnamon sticks usually easier to do 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.630
 several firms and they are supermarkets 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.910
 meet i want to tell you about 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.709
 which in general is cinnamon which 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.900
 most are for sale or 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.420
 supermarkets or in some shops 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.720
 spices she for the most part just me 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.200
 I think I'll show you the real K 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.190
 to face 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.459
 which I bought earlier this year in 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.820
 China 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.050
 but European manufacturers are 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.440
 real cinnamon 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.239
 now you will see the difference far-fetched 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.900
 quite obviously unfortunately 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:00.660
 Fragrance not convey through video clip but 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.959
 what does cinnamon look like i think not 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.180
 that is, here we see the real 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.010
 cinnamon 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.739
 she is 4 times probably thinner than that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.540
 cinnamon which gives us and to the word 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.299
 saying here it is cinnamon which 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.959
 all over the place it's not cinnamon acacia 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.739
 this is the closest relative of cinnamon and she 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.230
 has a similar smell and as for 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.810
 smell and taste that's real cinnamon 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.720
 Here she focused he more 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.910
 volumetric more beautiful but yours up to such 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.790
 in fact, also on the classic 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.060
 cinnamon smell and these are the lines here 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.000
 more saturated in taste and aroma 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.290
 they have any such chocolate 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.530
 notes some very interesting they are easy 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.180
 break crumble because the quran itself 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.780
 very thin, that is to say, it has crumbled 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.660
 if you see such cinnamon sticks 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.850
 they easily snap because here to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.070
 Unfortunately, in Russia, this is still a rarity. 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.120
 I never met and now you know 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.670
 what is the difference between real cinnamon sticks 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.680
 from the sticks of cassia further actually already 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.500
 defense therapeutic products i 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.739
 bought two hydrolat hydrolat it 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.270
 distillation by -product 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.160
 It is a process that leads 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.410
 making essential oils 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.300
 hydrolates also have therapeutic 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.789
 effects and are actively used in 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.000
 Aromacosmetology that is what I bought in 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:39.410
 this month is my favorite little water 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.110
 cars such a nice blue plastic 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.569
 jar her convenient to take yourself everywhere and in 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.539
 traveling generally just a handbag to me 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:52.340
 she really likes back the earlier usual 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.919
 cork with hole inside in the box 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.440
 there is even an instruction 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.210
 Well, rose hydrolat is so for me 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.210
 certain aromatic anchor 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.610
 since it was one of the first here 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.830
 natural such aroma with which I 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.190
 met then I was very 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.130
 limited range of essential oils it 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.530
 was about eight ten years ago 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.599
 back and expensive oils I have not bought 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.630
 since there was a lot of other oils 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:23.180
 who needed to buy which from me 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.090
 was not yet and now rose hydrol became 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.580
 the first such gorgeous scent that 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.159
 I appeared and just now I'm with him 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.740
 met when I spent my 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.500
 first aromatherapy workshop for me 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.259
 it's some kind of completely magical smell 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.199
 and therefore I have been buying for many, many years 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.110
 It is this hydrolat 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.759
 ikarov i have tried other 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.940
 Other companies' hydrolates but that's it 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.610
 This hydrolate is the most magical for me 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.919
 that is, if there is an anchor on which the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.560
 positive event explosion naturally 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.199
 need to use next i have one more 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.150
 hydrolate is lavender hydrolate too 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.819
 wonderful thing is suitable for 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.759
 irritated skin la the same I 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.949
 I use as a tonic that is most 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.349
 I use a piece of hydrolates just like 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.569
 face tonic for rubbing the skin 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.539
 but in the cream is the same lavender hydrolat 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:21.199
 very well go hydrolat firm frame 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:23.539
 And daisy, by the way, he says 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.729

 did not happen since last month 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.819
 I went quite devastating but 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.490
 it's not just in terms of saving just not 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.770
 We had many more oil is over, I 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.499
