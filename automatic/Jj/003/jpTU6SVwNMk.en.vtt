00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Mantzios hello to all its key 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.830
 brands in tuft and today I'm going 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 introduce my payet 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.790
 then I stop you right now 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.070
 just the nickname that I gave to my 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.379
 new fashion ford 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.520
 so here is the system so like all 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.369
 the pharma modes she does not look like 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.230
 so much from the outside we see 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.050
 not very well these benefits so I'm going 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.949
 you say them mainly she 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.369
 consumes very few resources that's 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.140
 99% of the blocks and the glass and we 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.850
 just a tiny circuit that is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.320
 super easy to build so no 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 redstone all around the farm is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 nothing and so to explain to you how 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.680
 she walks I propose that I you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.780
 propose is to show you one by one 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 the steps that led me to this design 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 so we'll see together 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 innovations and optimizations that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.780
 I implemented for construction 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.579
 so in a furniture farm what we 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.760
 goes in general so it's a succession 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.500
 of steps so here I symbolize one 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 so not my idea was to make a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.830
 rhodes farm using water 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 so the first thing I did 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 thought is to make a hole in the center of 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.350
 the farm and run water on 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.080
 the sides 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.520
 so here we see it works well 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 furniture is well beaten towards the center 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 but there is a problem is that if we 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.330
 look at the water source blocks so 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.040
 I symbolize with blocks of udder 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.049
 we see that there is a lot 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.900
 since you have to fill all the sides 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.009
 with his blogs so imagine for example 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.159
 if we had wanted to put ten 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.710
 sponsors to place and remove these 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.090
 back blocks it would take a lot of dee 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 spencer what would make a circuit that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.860
 would be enough water so I have that 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.270
 I'm trying to do is reduce the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.580
 number of water source blogs so 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.140
 I was going there only one in four 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.080
 we see that there are still 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.600
 a lot when we do that and so what 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.320
 happens when we are but that's it 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 does this form there with water so saab 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.230
 well the furniture towards the center the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.400
 problem is that one month remaining 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.650
 stuck so the only thing that we 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.690
 remains to be done is to remove the blocks 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.200
 who stays and we have something 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.700
 functional 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.380
 note that it is this form that has 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.810
 given the nickname fly on the farm 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.310
 so that was the first optimization 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.730
 which allowed us to simplify the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.950
 system 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.480
 the second is the system of 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.580
 water supply so rather than 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.900
 put dispensaries of pistons to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.100
 each floor 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.390
 in fact I did something but there 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.470
 I'm going to activate it with a lever but 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.170
 normally there is circuit that is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.610
 charge your watches and hop we have one 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.330
 source of water for any building 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.860
 and when the harvest activates the water goes 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.890
 spread through the canals 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.090
 go down to the farm and push all 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.760
 furniture down 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.860
 so the whole system trick is to 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.269
 do zig zag batches from left to right and 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.860
 every time we go to do it 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.860
 on one side we will also make it flow to 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.510
 inside the farm 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.069
 besides being economical this method 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.290
 it allows us one thing is that a 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.269
 once we have built the tasks of the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.129
 on there with the circuit and the system 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.410
 of distribution of one can put as much 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.739
 tasks that we want below that 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.470
 this is the 4-story version of the farm 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.879
 but if for example we wanted something 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.190
 more productive thing we could 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.799
 add stuff we can go up 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.660
 up to eight floors or more that's 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.269
 you who see it will only cost you 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.160
 more blocks and no redstone not 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.349
 to be complicated too I want to 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.400
 specify that I have studied as much as possible 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.079
 timeliness so that the farm is the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.090
 more productive possible that is to say that 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.700
 the mobs have barely time to fall 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.849
 that water has already disappeared 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.069
 and between two waves I try to put 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.319
 a time that they are not too long nor 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.629
 too short to have a maximum of 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.630
 pub a maximum of furniture possible in 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.609
 supply in the system too I want to 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 specify that this timer is not mine 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.420
 it is worth noting youtuber which I would put 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.670
 a link in the description let's go tutorial 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.160
 so as we have seen so far 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.579
 I really tried to reduce to 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.739
 minimum the cost of the farm so there is 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.380
 a moment when I asked myself the question 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.030
 since as we all know 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.400
 furniture that is pushed by water 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.730
 are pushed faster when they are 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.700
 pushes on the pacice dice so I'm 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.129
 am asked the question 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.829
 point it accelerated the speed is this 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.840
 that finally it was worth it or not 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.669
 used to pikes so there until here 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.550
 we have a little set up that I put in 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.740
 point to test the speed so of the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.620
 two so the first test we will do that 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.570
 on a creep hours and so yeah so 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.100
 in my set up on the right of the screen you 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.590
 look at it is written in block of ice 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.900
 in reality it is to time the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.340
 time spent by an entity on 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.370
 platforms so if you look judge 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.870
 is an item the stern 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.680
 it does not work because I beg you 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.380
 of assets and to people credibility 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.950
 this is tac we see the time that increases 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.900
 to the right 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.570
 so we see that there is an item that is 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.100
 stayed for I do not know exactly 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.560
 but 8 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.410
 we're going to say hui tic on the stuff 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.880
 just a comparative measurement between so 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.669
 if we put to mob 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.880
 for example a scream fear we will look 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.530
 up 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.080
 well we see something 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.880
 from quite unexpectedly they make to the 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.990
 same speed so as you can see 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.000
 they stayed 27000 27 time units 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.979
 indefinite 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.080
 we will say tic but I do not know if 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.389
 it's exactly betty then we're going 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.919
 test with spiders since can 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:38.639
 to say that it's not the same with everyone 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:40.330
 the mobs and the like the same time 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.580
 But it's not possible 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.620
 so maybe there is still a 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.330
 advantage for example on the mobs that 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.400
 are fighting against the current so for that 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.260
 I put a villager here we will do 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.479
 this pony zombies they're going to be 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.880
 attracted to the villager and will try 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.419
 to fight the camp and so we're going 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.419
 to see that makes the difference 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:08.170
 but no but it means that everything 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.810
 that time I was lied to 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.540
 that means that there is a person who 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.790
 said that monsters were more 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.890
 fast on the pac thais and we have it all 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.360
 believed everyone believed and copied 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.790
 stupidly his thing 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:28.660
 all these expeditions to the biome 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:31.180
 high stakes it was for nothing so good 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.790
 sure I joke all these expeditions to 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.620
 Biomass pikes so far away is it 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.090
 have not been used for nothing since you 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.500
 can actually recover your 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.770
 package if you have built a 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.080
 meuf farm who understands and replaces 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.490
 its part of the blocks without taking anything away from 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.780
 efficiency and use it for your 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.500
 networks of items there at least she will be 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.440
 really useful 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.470
 so that's it over I finished you 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:57.490
 present all the little tricks that 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:00.520
 I put end-to-end to build 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.470
 this new factory to mob and who him 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.030
 so allow the blow to be very little 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.900
 expensive and will reach that production 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:10.420
 theory in creative mode of 5700 items 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.580
 per hour so for those who are 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.920
 ask for the blade from the front bowl it's 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.830
 just what is it for show 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.340
 is it for orders already 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.800
 the chicken jokes and so the zombies that 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.960
 are on chickens they are not dying 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.790
 fall case so a small blade of 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.290
 wash his rule their account 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.510
 in short, it's over for this 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.670
 presentation for the construction I 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.010
 will soon publish a tutorial on my 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.520
 chain I tell you next time in 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.000
 this video 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.000
 ciao
