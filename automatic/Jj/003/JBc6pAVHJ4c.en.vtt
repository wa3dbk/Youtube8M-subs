00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
2 tunnel and just watch the magic happen

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.889

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
if a skeleton spawns by you you control

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
if a skeleton spawns by you you control
them<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:38.010> unable<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.670> shoot<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
them like this it's unable to shoot you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
them like this it's unable to shoot you
so<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.440> trying<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> kill<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.460> trying<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
kill you if i were to skeleton i would

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.170 
kill you if i were to skeleton i would
be<00:00:43.860> frustrated<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.610> apparently<00:00:45.000> I'm

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
be frustrated because apparently I'm

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 
be frustrated because apparently I'm
supposed<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> follow<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> law<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.440> shooting

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
supposed to follow the law of shooting

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.729 
supposed to follow the law of shooting
above<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:47.760> head<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.870> why<00:00:49.050> Celtics<00:00:49.680> are

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
above my head so this is why Celtics are

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.740 
above my head so this is why Celtics are
not<00:00:49.920> able<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.399> actually<00:00:50.579> hit<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.629> you're

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
not able to actually hit you when you're

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.110 
not able to actually hit you when you're
in<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.899> 2<00:00:52.079> by<00:00:52.230> 2<00:00:52.260> space<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.280> also<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
in a 2 by 2 space but also it is a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
in a 2 by 2 space but also it is a
convenient<00:00:54.539> way<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> kill<00:00:55.170> zombies<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> even

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
convenient way to kill zombies and even

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.099 
convenient way to kill zombies and even
creepers<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.660> hit<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:57.989> with

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
creepers because when you hit them with

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
creepers because when you hit them with
a<00:00:58.170> sword<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> there's<00:00:59.039> open<00:00:59.340> space<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.850> make

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a sword and there's open space and make

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.599 
a sword and there's open space and make
some<00:01:00.239> bounce<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> fly<00:01:01.350> back<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.430> when

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
some bounce and fly back but when

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.390 
some bounce and fly back but when
there's<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> 2<00:01:03.090> by<00:01:03.239> 2<00:01:03.270> space<00:01:03.960> type<00:01:04.379> tunnel<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there's a 2 by 2 space type tunnel you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.550 
there's a 2 by 2 space type tunnel you
can<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:05.909> kill<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.570> faster<00:01:07.170> because

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
can actually kill a lot faster because

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.870 
can actually kill a lot faster because
they're<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> hit<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> ceiling

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
they're just going to hit the ceiling

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
they're just going to hit the ceiling
come<00:01:09.210> back<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.080> only<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.320> time

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
come back down and they only have time

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.330 
come back down and they only have time
to<00:01:10.979> cover<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.229> classified<00:01:13.950> back<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to cover so it is classified back and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.850 
to cover so it is classified back and
you<00:01:14.430> cannot<00:01:14.790> jump<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.229> an<00:01:16.350> unable<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you cannot jump you are an unable to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
you cannot jump you are an unable to
jump<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.930> way

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
jump but if you want to do it that way

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.260 
jump but if you want to do it that way
it's<00:01:19.290> fine<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.189> 3<00:01:20.400> by<00:01:20.549> 3<00:01:20.580> tunnel<00:01:21.150> where

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it's fine I like it 3 by 3 tunnel where

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.690 
it's fine I like it 3 by 3 tunnel where
I<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:21.479> actually<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.960> least<00:01:22.200> jump<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.340> right

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
I could actually at least jump but right

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
I could actually at least jump but right
now<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.240> skeletons<00:01:24.720> spawn<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> tries<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
