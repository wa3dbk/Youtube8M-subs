00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.859 
well sure I had one computer catch on
fire<00:00:22.760> then<00:00:23.760> about<00:00:24.029> two<00:00:24.240> years<00:00:24.300> later<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.689> had

another computer literally blow up and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.569 
another computer literally blow up and
then<00:00:28.380> figured<00:00:29.279> ok<00:00:31.009> what<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.130> time<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> replace

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

nothing's wrong with Mac well at least

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
nothing's wrong with Mac well at least
walk<00:00:37.710> well<00:00:38.370> there's<00:00:38.579> no<00:00:38.760> computer<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
walk well there's no computer that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
walk well there's no computer that
doesn't<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.600> anything<00:00:39.780> wrong<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.340> but
