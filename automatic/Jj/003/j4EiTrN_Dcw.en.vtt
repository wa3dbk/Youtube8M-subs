00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
thing about it that actually keeps the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.170 
thing about it that actually keeps the
sound<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.860> shoots<00:05:11.039> at<00:05:11.160> 120<00:05:11.820> frames<00:05:11.850> per

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
sound and it shoots at 120 frames per

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.210 
sound and it shoots at 120 frames per
second<00:05:12.780> so<00:05:13.260> when<00:05:13.380> you<00:05:13.470> playback<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.190> can

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
second so when you playback you can

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.190 
second so when you playback you can
choose<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.760> slow<00:05:15.000> down<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.210> particular<00:05:15.479> part<00:05:16.110> of

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
choose to slow down a particular part of

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.140 
choose to slow down a particular part of
the<00:05:16.260> video<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:17.340> also<00:05:17.490> could<00:05:17.760> speed<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.060> up

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
the video and you also could speed it up

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.150 
the video and you also could speed it up
at<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.450> end<00:05:18.570> if<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:18.720> want<00:05:21.620> in<00:05:22.620> your<00:05:22.800> camera

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
at the end if you want in your camera

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.440 
at the end if you want in your camera
view<00:05:23.340> at<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.550> top<00:05:23.760> you'll<00:05:23.970> see<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> button<00:05:24.330> that

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
view at the top you'll see a button that

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.200 
view at the top you'll see a button that
says<00:05:24.660> HDR<00:05:25.260> turning<00:05:25.979> on<00:05:26.039> HDR<00:05:26.550> could<00:05:26.789> really

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
says HDR turning on HDR could really

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.240 
says HDR turning on HDR could really
save<00:05:27.630> a<00:05:27.660> photo<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.650> now<00:05:28.800> when<00:05:28.950> you<00:05:29.070> take<00:05:29.220> a

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
save a photo so now when you take a

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.020 
save a photo so now when you take a
picture<00:05:30.380> it<00:05:31.380> actually<00:05:31.740> creates<00:05:32.100> two<00:05:32.460> versions

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
picture it actually creates two versions

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.330 
picture it actually creates two versions
the<00:05:33.300> original<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.919> one<00:05:35.070> that<00:05:35.250> it

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
the original and the one that it

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.490 
the original and the one that it
enhances<00:05:35.640> so<00:05:36.450> in<00:05:36.570> this<00:05:36.660> comparison<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.350> can

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
enhances so in this comparison you can

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.409 
enhances so in this comparison you can
see<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.889> sky<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.190> really<00:05:38.639> washed<00:05:39.030> out<00:05:39.240> on

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
see that the sky is really washed out on

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.360 
see that the sky is really washed out on
the<00:05:39.510> left<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.110> fixes<00:05:40.500> it<00:05:40.680> on<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:41.070> picture

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
the left and it fixes it on the picture

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.170 
the left and it fixes it on the picture
on<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.669> right

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
on the right

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.429 
on the right
I've<00:05:44.180> never<00:05:44.330> been<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.659> a<00:05:44.689> concert<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.229> you

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:45.439 
I've never been to a concert and you

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:46.749 
I've never been to a concert and you
can't<00:05:45.680> decide<00:05:45.979> whether<00:05:46.159> you<00:05:46.310> should<00:05:46.340> record

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
can't decide whether you should record

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.149 
can't decide whether you should record
it<00:05:46.879> or<00:05:47.030> take<00:05:47.210> pictures<00:05:47.389> well<00:05:48.169> now<00:05:48.439> you<00:05:48.499> can<00:05:49.039> do

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
it or take pictures well now you can do

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.890 
it or take pictures well now you can do
both<00:05:49.400> so<00:05:49.969> if<00:05:50.060> you<00:05:50.180> push<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.389> little<00:05:50.749> white

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
both so if you push that little white

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.450 
both so if you push that little white
button<00:05:51.139> there<00:05:51.379> you<00:05:51.620> actually<00:05:52.219> could<00:05:52.340> take

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
button there you actually could take

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.209 
button there you actually could take
photos<00:05:52.699> at<00:05:52.969> the<00:05:53.029> same<00:05:53.120> time<00:05:56.650> so<00:05:57.650> now<00:05:57.800> you<00:05:57.860> don't

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
photos at the same time so now you don't

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.129 
photos at the same time so now you don't
have<00:05:58.279> to<00:05:58.460> choose<00:05:58.669> before<00:05:59.539> taking<00:05:59.840> a<00:05:59.930> photo

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
have to choose before taking a photo

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.689 
have to choose before taking a photo
it's<00:06:00.379> really<00:06:00.650> good<00:06:00.800> to<00:06:00.979> tap<00:06:01.219> around<00:06:01.520> the

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
it's really good to tap around the

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.339 
it's really good to tap around the
screen<00:06:02.029> so<00:06:02.479> that<00:06:02.509> you<00:06:02.689> can<00:06:02.930> adjust<00:06:03.289> your

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
screen so that you can adjust your

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.010

exposure<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.099> your<00:06:04.189> focus<00:06:04.729> once<00:06:05.629> you<00:06:05.779> find

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
down and it'll actually lock that focus
