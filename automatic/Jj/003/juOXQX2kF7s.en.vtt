00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
gonna find where the front of the board

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.970 
gonna find where the front of the board
is<00:02:14.360> you're<00:02:15.360> gonna<00:02:15.420> put<00:02:15.540> them<00:02:15.930> start<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
repeat it for down the middle leaving

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.789 
repeat it for down the middle leaving
small<00:02:46.170> spaces<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.349> looks<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
small spaces so that it looks like the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.400 
small spaces so that it looks like the
mortar<00:02:50.099> in<00:02:50.220> between<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.610> bricks<00:02:51.410> was

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
mortar in between the bricks was

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.539 
mortar in between the bricks was
actually<00:02:52.680> gonna<00:02:52.769> look<00:02:52.890> pretty<00:02:52.980> sick<00:02:53.340> because

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
actually gonna look pretty sick because

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:00.680 
actually gonna look pretty sick because
the<00:02:54.180> deck<00:02:54.360> has<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> yellow<00:02:55.500> top<00:02:55.709> play<00:02:59.630> okay<00:03:00.630> so

the deck has a yellow top play okay so

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.000 
the deck has a yellow top play okay so

once you have your pizzas down the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.979 
once you have your pizzas down the
middle<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:03.450> doesn't<00:03:03.630> matter<00:03:03.870> how

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
middle like that it doesn't matter how

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.479 
middle like that it doesn't matter how
many<00:03:04.079> bricks<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.530> have<00:03:04.709> depends<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.310> which

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
many bricks you have depends on which

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.509 
many bricks you have depends on which
size<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:05.940> make<00:03:06.299> them<00:03:06.540> you're<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.859> find

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
size you make them you're going to find

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.370 
size you make them you're going to find
just<00:03:08.790> about<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.060> middle<00:03:09.329> of<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:10.200> can

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
just about the middle of it you can

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.319 
just about the middle of it you can
measure<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.859> or<00:03:11.069> just<00:03:11.280> estimate<00:03:11.819> how<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.150> looks

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
measure it or just estimate how it looks

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.509 
measure it or just estimate how it looks
and<00:03:14.750> then<00:03:15.750> put<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.109> grip<00:03:16.350> where<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.190> middle

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
and then put the grip where the middle

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.509 
and then put the grip where the middle
of<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.819> brick<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.239> pretty<00:03:18.540> much<00:03:19.519> alternating

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
of the brick is pretty much alternating

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.390 
of the brick is pretty much alternating
with<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.700> other<00:03:20.790> side<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.810> have<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:23.160> about

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
with the other side so I have that about

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.569 
with the other side so I have that about
there<00:03:26.060> also<00:03:27.060> leave<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.299> little<00:03:27.510> space<00:03:27.810> again

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
there also leave a little space again

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:37.699 
there also leave a little space again
for<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:30.380> mortar<00:03:31.380> style<00:03:31.680> look<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.380> now<00:03:37.560> after

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
for the mortar style look so now after

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.110 
for the mortar style look so now after
you<00:03:37.859> have<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.160> one<00:03:38.310> side<00:03:38.519> done<00:03:38.730> you're<00:03:39.030> gonna

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
you have that one side done you're gonna

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.200 
you have that one side done you're gonna
do<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.269> same<00:03:39.450> thing<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> other<00:03:39.930> side

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.960 

cool<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.810> these<00:03:47.350> sides<00:03:47.680> are<00:03:47.920> now<00:03:48.040> all<00:03:48.670> done

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
cool so these sides are now all done

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.240 
cool so these sides are now all done
obviously<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:50.140> still<00:03:50.260> have<00:03:50.500> small<00:03:50.800> spaces

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
obviously I still have small spaces

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.840 
obviously I still have small spaces
there<00:03:51.460> so<00:03:51.820> whatever<00:03:52.690> leftover<00:03:53.200> grip<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.470> have

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
there so whatever leftover grip you have

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.070 
there so whatever leftover grip you have
just<00:03:54.850> ration<00:03:55.330> out<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.780> correct

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
just ration out to the correct

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:08.790 
just ration out to the correct
proportions<00:04:06.060> all<00:04:07.060> right<00:04:07.300> so<00:04:07.690> now<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.320> should
