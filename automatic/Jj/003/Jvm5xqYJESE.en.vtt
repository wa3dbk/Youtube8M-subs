at the cellular level it's all broken
down<00:05:08.139> ready<00:05:08.499> to<00:05:08.589> go<00:05:08.679> for<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:08.979> we're<00:05:09.189> just

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:09.309 
down ready to go for you we're just

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.419 
down ready to go for you we're just
going<00:05:09.429> to<00:05:09.459> jump<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.789> in<00:05:10.619> all<00:05:11.619> that<00:05:11.889> nice<00:05:12.099> fresh

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:12.429 
going to jump it in all that nice fresh

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:30.140 
going to jump it in all that nice fresh
flour<00:05:15.179> and<00:05:16.179> we're<00:05:16.389> just<00:05:16.479> going<00:05:16.569> to<00:05:16.749> mix

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.790 

so<00:05:31.150> since<00:05:31.569> these<00:05:31.689> grains<00:05:32.020> are<00:05:32.199> so<00:05:32.409> high<00:05:32.590> in

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
so since these grains are so high in

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.920 
so since these grains are so high in
protein<00:05:32.979> this<00:05:33.550> is<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:34.150> reason<00:05:34.300> why<00:05:34.569> we<00:05:34.719> call

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
protein this is the reason why we call

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.529 
protein this is the reason why we call
these<00:05:35.080> protein<00:05:35.590> bars<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:37.000> is<00:05:37.210> natural

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
these protein bars this is natural

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.459 
these protein bars this is natural
protein<00:05:38.280> complete<00:05:39.280> proteins<00:05:39.990> along<00:05:40.990> with<00:05:41.199> so

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
protein complete proteins along with so

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.420 
protein complete proteins along with so
much<00:05:41.650> fiber<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.550> nutrients<00:05:44.189> definitely<00:05:45.189> has

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
much fiber and nutrients definitely has

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.839 
much fiber and nutrients definitely has
the<00:05:46.800> essential<00:05:47.800> amino<00:05:48.009> acid<00:05:48.580> balance<00:05:48.759> in<00:05:49.180> it

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
the essential amino acid balance in it

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.499 
the essential amino acid balance in it
alright<00:05:51.849> now<00:05:52.000> we're<00:05:52.180> going<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.360> make<00:05:52.449> our

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
alright now we're going to make our

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:58.399 
alright now we're going to make our
flocks<00:05:52.900> mixture<00:05:55.050> okay<00:05:56.050> oh<00:05:56.669> that<00:05:57.669> smells<00:05:57.939> nice

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
flocks mixture okay oh that smells nice

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.749 
flocks mixture okay oh that smells nice
okay<00:05:59.409> let's<00:05:59.620> remove<00:05:59.830> these<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:00.279> get<00:06:00.370> our<00:06:00.490> flux
