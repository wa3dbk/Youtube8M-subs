00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
trolling us this hard but since the maps

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.210 
trolling us this hard but since the maps
are<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.080> elaborate<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> they're<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
are so elaborate and they're so kind of

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
are so elaborate and they're so kind of
you<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.250> they're<00:01:11.820> fairly<00:01:12.119> decent<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you know they're fairly decent and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.039 
you know they're fairly decent and
they're<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:15.090> easter<00:01:15.479> eggs<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.810> them

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
they're there the easter eggs on them

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.499 
they're there the easter eggs on them
you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.500> die<00:01:16.740> rise<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.820> admit<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
you know die rise i will admit was the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.080 
you know die rise i will admit was the
hardest<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.860> overall<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.850> seem

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
hardest one to do but overall they seem

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
hardest one to do but overall they seem
pretty<00:01:21.119> easy<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.049> these<00:01:22.200> extra

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
pretty easy and they have these extra

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
pretty easy and they have these extra
stuff<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.640> seems<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
stuff that it just seems to be in the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
stuff that it just seems to be in the
map<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.290> i<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.700> would<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> shame

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
map and i just think it would be a shame

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.179 
map and i just think it would be a shame
if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.420> had<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.930> stuff<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> they

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
if you had all this stuff and they

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.240 
if you had all this stuff and they
didn't<00:01:29.520> give<00:01:30.060> us<00:01:30.090> an<00:01:30.420> extra<00:01:30.860> really<00:01:31.860> well

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
didn't give us an extra really well

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.620 
didn't give us an extra really well
hidden<00:01:32.759> easter<00:01:33.720> egg<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.439> find<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.540> what<00:01:36.540> I'm

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
on until the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.469 
on until the
the<00:01:56.469> die<00:01:56.799> rise<00:01:57.039> map<00:01:57.280> came<00:01:57.549> out<00:01:57.700> adjustable

the die rise map came out adjustable

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.160 
the die rise map came out adjustable
leather<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.240> mean<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:01.539> have<00:02:01.689> all<00:02:01.810> these<00:02:01.930> nap

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
leather but I mean we have all these nap

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.999 
leather but I mean we have all these nap
cards<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:04.270> know<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:05.590> haven't<00:02:05.710> figured

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
cards and you know we haven't figured

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.740 
cards and you know we haven't figured
out<00:02:06.039> what<00:02:06.130> they<00:02:06.250> all<00:02:06.369> do<00:02:06.640> yet<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:07.210> think<00:02:07.659> they're

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
out what they all do yet I think they're

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.359 
out what they all do yet I think they're
gonna<00:02:07.840> transport<00:02:08.349> us<00:02:08.500> from<00:02:08.619> map<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.920> map<00:02:09.129> but

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
gonna transport us from map to map but

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.949 
gonna transport us from map to map but
I'm<00:02:09.459> not<00:02:09.610> gonna<00:02:09.729> make<00:02:09.970> any<00:02:10.149> solid<00:02:10.539> theories

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
I'm not gonna make any solid theories

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.790 
I'm not gonna make any solid theories
until<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:13.030> maps<00:02:13.269> are<00:02:13.510> out<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:14.019> think

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
until all of the maps are out I think

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.259 
until all of the maps are out I think
that's<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.700> wait<00:02:15.819> on<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.000> mean

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
that's what we have to wait on I mean

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.940 
that's what we have to wait on I mean
you<00:02:16.750> know<00:02:16.840> they<00:02:16.989> have<00:02:17.170> all<00:02:17.290> these<00:02:17.410> DLCs

you know they have all these DLCs
they've<00:02:18.250> been<00:02:18.459> thought<00:02:18.670> out<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.030> while

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
they've been thought out for a while

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.580 
they've been thought out for a while
somehow<00:02:19.840> they're<00:02:19.989> gonna<00:02:20.110> all<00:02:20.380> tie<00:02:20.560> in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
somehow they're gonna all tie in

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.339
