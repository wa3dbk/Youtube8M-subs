00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.830 
high-pitched screeches and stuff and it
was<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:26.209> destroying<00:02:27.209> my<00:02:27.480> show<00:02:27.829> so<00:02:28.829> I

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
was really destroying my show so I

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.390 
was really destroying my show so I
figured<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.870> know<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.109> gotta<00:02:31.620> find<00:02:31.980> another

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
figured you know I gotta find another

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.759 
figured you know I gotta find another
way<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.239> figured<00:02:33.510> let<00:02:33.720> me<00:02:33.810> try<00:02:34.079> this<00:02:34.140> because

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
way so I figured let me try this because

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.119 
way so I figured let me try this because
I<00:02:34.859> heard<00:02:35.129> I<00:02:35.909> heard<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:37.049> little<00:02:37.200> bit<00:02:37.379> about<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
I heard I heard a little bit about it

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.429 
I heard I heard a little bit about it
and<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.909> preview<00:02:39.389> article<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.989> read<00:02:40.230> on

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
and in a preview article that read on

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.390 
and in a preview article that read on
and<00:02:40.920> gadget<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:42.180> they<00:02:42.329> never<00:02:42.510> did<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.750> review

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
and gadget but they never did a review

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.069 
and gadget but they never did a review
so<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.459> figured<00:02:45.120> let<00:02:45.269> me<00:02:45.389> try<00:02:45.599> it<00:02:45.629> there's<00:02:45.989> only

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
so I figured let me try it there's only

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.129 
so I figured let me try it there's only
50<00:02:46.739> bucks<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.639> bad

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
50 bucks not bad

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.339 
50 bucks not bad
for<00:02:49.530> its<00:02:49.650> size<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.579> does<00:02:51.139> this<00:02:52.139> is

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
for its size and what it does this is

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.710 
for its size and what it does this is
the<00:02:52.500> x5<00:02:52.859> which<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:54.450> top-of-the-line

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the x5 which is the top-of-the-line

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.259 
the x5 which is the top-of-the-line
stuff<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.579> plug<00:02:57.419> into<00:02:57.629> any<00:02:57.959> old<00:02:58.139> USB<00:02:58.709> port

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:09.920 

and<00:03:03.590> then<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:06.780> now<00:03:07.129> active<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.389> if<00:03:09.750> you

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and then it's now active so now if you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.250 
and then it's now active so now if you
if<00:03:10.139> you<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.379> any<00:03:11.150> sound<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.359> will<00:03:12.569> pop<00:03:12.870> up<00:03:12.900> with

if you do any sound you will pop up with

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.289 
if you do any sound you will pop up with
the<00:03:13.409> x5<00:03:14.129> go<00:03:14.579> which<00:03:16.609> you<00:03:17.609> know<00:03:17.699> you<00:03:17.909> don't<00:03:18.060> need

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
the x5 go which you know you don't need

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.719 
the x5 go which you know you don't need
