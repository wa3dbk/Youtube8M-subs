00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello everyone here is the new video for 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
 the nail art collection in this video 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.700
 I'll show you how to do this 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.219
 nail art very cartoons style with i 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.840
 acrylic colors and classic enamel if 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.120
 you are interested follow the tutorial 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.070
 first of all if we give a base the 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.290
 base the spread on all the nails serves 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.330
 to protect the nail from color 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.490
 next we're going to use each 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.860
 based its own function among others 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.800
 really very drying things 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.510
 very fast we wait for you to dry now 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.040
 we take our fuchsia and it 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.230
 we spread a single color on all the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.600
 nails we give very thin passes 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.220
 because we will do two passes anyway 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.230
 and we wait between one pass and the other 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.120
 that the enamel is completely dry 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.680
 finished the two past wait at least 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.079
 a quarter of an hour before proceeding with 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.059
 nail art as I said we must do 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.309
 very very thin states cover 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.079
 good side and also the tip because 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.079
 the double detachment must not be seen 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.489
 now take the tinfoil 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.290
 we take our black acrylic color 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.510
 we place it on aluminum foil 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.010
 where I previously also positioned 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.900
 a drop of water 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.210
 we take our paintbrush 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.800
 mix natural bristles we mix 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.810
 together black with water and him 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.180
 we decrease to the right point that we need 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.820
 to paint as a center, I remind you that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.369
 the color must be diluted not too much 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.140
 or too little and we will be able to understand it 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.970
 because it must not be transparent and 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.650
 however, we also manage to pull some 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.440
 straight lines as you are about to see 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.780
 from the image now that our color is 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.570
 ready we begin to draw what 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.009
 we must do we must make an edge 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.259
 around like a frame 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.180
 therefore around the unga strÃ  therefore neither towards 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.810
 the tip towards the cuticles the two 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.060
 lateral 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.530
 the first pass is used to define 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.000
 we await a little bit that dries i 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.640
 many acrylic colors dry 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.440
 very fast in the air after that 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.820
 we do however the second pass of 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.740
 acrylic color to intensify 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.479
 more color 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.280
 I remind you that once you have it 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.960
 finished painting the paintbrush va 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.070
 cleaned to perfection as already explained 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.360
 in in previous releases 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.490
 this nail art and should be done on all 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.899
 fingernails fangs on the ring finger then one 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.399
 once we have finished ours 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.200
 frame we take again from the paper 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.060
 foil we always take water 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.250
 we take our acrylic color in 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.049
 this time we take it white and le 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.690
 two always have the same criteria 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.700
 principle already explained before why the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.310
 color must be diluted perfection 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.870
 to still be able to draw what 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.610
 we have to do with white with white 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.640
 we will have to pull a kind of point 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.560
 exclamation mark to the side of the nail where in 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.730
 previously it was done pulls even a 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 dot as you see from the image 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.069
 as always the first pass is used for 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.930
 outline our decorum 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.300
 the second to define the whole and 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.560
 however intensify color as 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.000
 see the decorum I did it 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.370
 all on all the nail textures 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.230
 we were rare on the ring finger 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.330
 now we are going to decorate it 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.950
 most do we do this sort of 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.480
 drawing as you are seeing precisely 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.130
 of the image where the first pass 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.410
 serves to define the whole 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.720
 that is to say excuse the whole and the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.000
 second that we're going to give will serve to 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.800
 intensify the color to color too 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 the inside of our memory as you are 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.959
 seeing from the image we now take the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.569
 our spot barrel or needle in short, that one 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.670
 what have you and we do all the dots 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.500
 around where there is the space of the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.269
 monochrome pink 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.340
 we await also in this case the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.620
 acrylic color dries a lot 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.720
 faster than the enamels but being 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.310
 a dot richer in colors we must 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.310
 however they are always waiting for a moment 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.599
 now let's take our black color back 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.939
 which we used previously 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.920
 construction we draw the design as is 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.840
 seeing from the image even here the first 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.610
 past we should give it very thin 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.640
 because it serves precisely to outline the 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.620
 as you can see they are very thin lines and 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.260
 very light and the second pass 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.060
 we will ask to intensify the decorum 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.400
 it is not finished here because inside there 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 we will make other exclamation points always 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.060
 with black 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.210
 Now 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.460
 seeing the second pass I will give 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.830
 precisely to this black border for 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.720
 the note delineating it intensify it 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.609
 especially the color more because 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.290
 initially having been so light 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.420
 it was just a thin veil 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.850
 now what we do anyway let's go to 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.680
 also decorate the interior of our 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.950
 drawing however making other points 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.950
 exclamation 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.410
 our exclamation points as we do 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.389
 yes position as you are seeing 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.370
 from the image the brush goes 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.289
 slightly towards the belly or the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.810
 wider part of the brush so 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.970
 will form but sort of drop is indeed 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.650
 you are seeing I will do 3 at the end of 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.180
 drop I will still make a point was not 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.229
 precisely to give the image of the bridge 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.669
 exclamation 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.169
 once everything is dry then it 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.000
 dry enamel the acrylic color is 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.160
 completely dry we pass the top 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.080
 coat to seal ours is the rwc 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.740
 make nail art last longer and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.020
 same decor 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.430
 this is the final result I hope so much 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.410
 that you like it on the card is 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.210
 also the decoration a big kiss of 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.210
 how many next videos hello
