so<00:00:01.050> for<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.290> selected<00:00:01.650> task<00:00:01.890> for<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.520> boxer

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
so for the selected task for the boxer

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.579 
so for the selected task for the boxer
engine<00:00:03.510> I'm<00:00:03.870> just<00:00:03.990> going<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.140> show<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.319> how<00:00:04.529> to

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
engine I'm just going to show you how to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.410 
engine I'm just going to show you how to
add<00:00:04.859> limits<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.580> Fitz<00:00:05.819> whilst<00:00:06.210> you're

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
add limits and Fitz whilst you're

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
add limits and Fitz whilst you're
modeling<00:00:06.660> so<00:00:07.529> I'm<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:07.980> start<00:00:08.160> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
modeling so I'm just going to start a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.709 
modeling so I'm just going to start a
new<00:00:08.429> part<00:00:08.760> here<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.179> I'm<00:00:09.269> doing<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
new part here and I'm doing the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.390 
new part here and I'm doing the
crankshaft<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.469> I've<00:00:10.559> got<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.800> drawing<00:00:11.040> open

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
crankshaft so I've got the drawing open

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.759 
crankshaft so I've got the drawing open
so<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.269> put<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.769> shaft

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
so I'm going to put in the shaft

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.589 
so I'm going to put in the shaft
diameter<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.460> which<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.880> six<00:00:15.150> millimeters

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
diameter here which is six millimeters

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.070 
diameter here which is six millimeters
but<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.320> actually<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.650> g6

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
but you can see that it's actually a g6

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.300 
but you can see that it's actually a g6
so<00:00:19.080> when<00:00:19.289> you're<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.590> your<00:00:19.619> damage<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
so when you're in your damage and you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
so when you're in your damage and you
have<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.520> little<00:00:20.699> arrow<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.050> click

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
have this little arrow here if you click

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.900 
have this little arrow here if you click
on<00:00:22.410> there<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.130> here<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
on there you can go in here you can you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.240 
on there you can go in here you can you
can<00:00:24.060> measure<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.930> get

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
can measure so you can go and get

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.900 
can measure so you can go and get
measurements<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.340> somewhere<00:00:26.519> else<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
measurements with somewhere else to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.250 
measurements with somewhere else to
change<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.420> dimension<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.170> go<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
change this dimension or you can go to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
change this dimension or you can go to
tolerance<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.849> intolerance<00:00:30.119> you've<00:00:30.510> got

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
tolerance and intolerance you've got

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.620 
tolerance and intolerance you've got
your<00:00:30.750> types<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.730> into<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.059> limits

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
your types so if you go into your limits

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.180 
your types so if you go into your limits
and<00:00:33.870> fits<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.700> we'll<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.079> linear<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.829> here

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and fits and we'll go to linear in here

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
and fits and we'll go to linear in here
you<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.790> change<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.540> limit<00:00:39.930> or

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you can see you can change the limit or

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
you can see you can change the limit or
the<00:00:40.140> fit<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.950> change<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> hole<00:00:41.520> size

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the fit so you can change the hole size

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
the fit so you can change the hole size
here<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.329> course<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.260> shaft<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
here but of course this is a shaft and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.299 
here but of course this is a shaft and
up<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> hole<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.360> type<00:00:45.539> G<00:00:45.780> six

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
up to hole to go in here in type G six

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.260 
up to hole to go in here in type G six
you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> add<00:00:48.090> this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you can see that you can add this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
you can see that you can add this
tolerance<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.500> from<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
tolerance in and as you can see from the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
tolerance in and as you can see from the
drawing<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.250> six<00:00:50.489> mil<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.879> six<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.449> press

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
drawing it's a six mil to six I press

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.630 
drawing it's a six mil to six I press
okay<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> press<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> tick<00:00:53.460> button

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
okay now and press the tick button

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
okay now and press the tick button
you'll<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.090> changed<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> g6<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.890> now

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you'll see it's changed to g6 so now

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.970 
you'll see it's changed to g6 so now
this<00:00:56.309> part<00:00:56.610> has<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:56.969> g6<00:00:57.600> added<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.320> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
this part has the g6 added to it so you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
this part has the g6 added to it so you
can<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.399> reference<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> drawings

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
can then reference that in the drawings

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
can then reference that in the drawings
later<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.170> also<00:01:01.320> show<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.680> upper<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
later on you can also show the upper and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.500 
later on you can also show the upper and
lower<00:01:02.309> limits<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.059> sort<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> good

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
lower limits and all that sort of good

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
lower limits and all that sort of good
stuff<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> carry<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
stuff so I'm just going to carry on and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.219 
stuff so I'm just going to carry on and
finish<00:01:05.400> modeling<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.080> I'm

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
finish modeling this one here so I'm

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.679 
finish modeling this one here so I'm
going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> add<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> length<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> shaft

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
going to add in the length of the shaft

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
going to add in the length of the shaft
that<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.020> gonna<00:01:10.170> make<00:01:10.380> sure<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.710> mid<00:01:10.860> plane

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that I'm gonna make sure it's mid plane

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
that I'm gonna make sure it's mid plane
and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> add<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> two

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and then I'm going to add the two

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.929 
and then I'm going to add the two
cutaways<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> sketch<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
cutaways I'm going to do a sketch for a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.330 
cutaways I'm going to do a sketch for a
small<00:01:15.210> boy's<00:01:15.479> head<00:01:15.750> plane<00:01:15.990> press<00:01:16.680> f7<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
small boy's head plane press f7 it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
small boy's head plane press f7 it
slices<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> graphics<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.900> gonna<00:01:19.020> fit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
slices the graphics I'm just gonna fit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.550 
slices the graphics I'm just gonna fit
to<00:01:19.380> view<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.520> again<00:01:20.610> project<00:01:21.000> geometry<00:01:21.720> it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to view and again project geometry it's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
to view and again project geometry it's
very<00:01:22.950> useful<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.460> us<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:23.850> gonna<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.119> use

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
very useful for us so I'm gonna just use

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
very useful for us so I'm gonna just use
the<00:01:24.390> rectangle<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.200> draw<00:01:25.500> these<00:01:25.650> two

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the rectangle and just draw these two

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.670 
the rectangle and just draw these two
shapes<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:29.780> I'm<00:01:30.780> gonna<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.409> use<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
shapes in I'm gonna then use the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
shapes in I'm gonna then use the
constraints<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.340> make<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.299> debts<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> same

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
constraints to make the debts the same

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
constraints to make the debts the same
for<00:01:34.259> both<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.119> we<00:01:36.119> don't<00:01:36.270> listen

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
for both of them and we don't listen

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:44.969 
for both of them and we don't listen
here<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.079> 2.6<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.409> length<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.070> also

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.649 

I'm<00:01:45.979> gonna<00:01:46.100> completely<00:01:46.850> constrain<00:01:47.240> my<00:01:47.360> sketch

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
I'm gonna completely constrain my sketch

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:57.999 
I'm gonna completely constrain my sketch
of<00:01:47.900> course<00:01:52.780> cut<00:01:53.780> all<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:56.659> oops<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.770> both

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
of course cut all in oops in both

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.530 
of course cut all in oops in both
directions<00:01:58.399> very<00:01:58.820> important<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.270> select

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
directions very important you select

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.530 
directions very important you select
that<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.159> it's<00:02:01.580> not<00:02:01.700> right<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:02.299> got<00:02:02.420> that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
that is it it's not right so we got that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.750 
that is it it's not right so we got that
piece<00:02:02.750> now

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.610 

again<00:02:12.450> projection<00:02:12.959> which<00:02:13.050> surely<00:02:13.170> says<00:02:13.409> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
again projection which surely says that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:32.180 
again projection which surely says that
this<00:02:13.739> same<00:02:13.980> principle

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.230 

and<00:02:33.190> again<00:02:33.430> make<00:02:33.640> sure<00:02:33.670> when<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.000> do<00:02:34.120> you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
and again make sure when you do you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.670 
and again make sure when you do you
actually<00:02:34.630> cut<00:02:34.840> those<00:02:35.110> both<00:02:35.320> ways<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.260> then

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
actually cut those both ways and then

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.290 
actually cut those both ways and then
that's<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.280> part<00:02:42.520> finished<00:02:42.910> once<00:02:43.150> I've

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
that's that part finished once I've

00:02:43.300 --> 00:03:00.770 
that's that part finished once I've
added<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.570> material<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.320> we<00:02:44.530> know<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:44.830> steel

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.030 

let's<00:03:01.780> save<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.110> one<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.650> appropriate

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
let's save that one in the appropriate

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.940 
let's save that one in the appropriate
place<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.660> how<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.870> add<00:03:11.140> limits

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
place and that is the how to add limits

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.910 
place and that is the how to add limits
and<00:03:12.070> Fitz<00:03:12.280> whilst<00:03:12.520> modeling
