he has that protection and the second
main<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.740> his<00:01:38.070> utilities<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.500> do<00:01:40.500> you

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
system and what's really really set up

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.139 
system and what's really really set up
probably<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.250> playing<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.850> my

probably going to be playing it on my

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.920 
probably going to be playing it on my
iPhone<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.850> friendly

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930

iPhone<00:02:20.330> yeah<00:02:21.330> okay<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.950> second<00:02:23.340> question<00:02:23.489> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
iPhone yeah okay the second question is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.400 
iPhone yeah okay the second question is
what<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.239> think<00:02:24.480> about<00:02:24.540> current<00:02:25.080> decade

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
what do you think about current decade

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.300 
what do you think about current decade
States<00:02:25.769> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:27.350> we<00:02:28.350> are<00:02:28.530> very<00:02:28.560> binary

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
States I think that we are very binary

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.050 
States I think that we are very binary
binary<00:02:30.209> class<00:02:30.840> where<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.650> do<00:02:32.160> damage<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.819> with

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
binary class where we do damage and with

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 
binary class where we do damage and with
that<00:02:33.300> there's<00:02:33.720> nothing<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.680> middle

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
that there's nothing in the middle

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.250 
that there's nothing in the middle
there's<00:02:35.280> not<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.519> lot<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.910> rule<00:02:36.660> there's<00:02:37.080> not<00:02:37.230> a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
there's not a lot of rule there's not a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.610 
there's not a lot of rule there's not a
lot<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.440> things<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.069> maneuver<00:02:38.550> room<00:02:38.760> um<00:02:39.620> frost

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
lot of things to maneuver room um frost

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.830 
lot of things to maneuver room um frost
is<00:02:40.920> actually<00:02:41.340> two<00:02:41.519> more<00:02:41.850> extended<00:02:42.269> unholy

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
is actually two more extended unholy

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.870 
is actually two more extended unholy
it's<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.319> very<00:02:43.739> very<00:02:43.830> squishy<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.489> very

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
it's like very very squishy and very

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's like very very squishy and very
very<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.630> will<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.260> somewhere<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
very then and will be somewhere in the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890 
very then and will be somewhere in the
middle<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.430> less<00:02:47.819> squishy<00:02:48.150> but<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:48.720> also

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
middle it's less squishy but it's also

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.690 
middle it's less squishy but it's also
less<00:02:49.230> deadly<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.950> frost<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.709> Sun<00:02:53.069> is<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
less deadly as frost so that Sun is I

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.030 
less deadly as frost so that Sun is I
like<00:02:54.660> what<00:02:54.870> they're<00:02:55.019> doing<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> case<00:02:55.769> in

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
Ferris and gave me freaking beta so I

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.440 
Ferris and gave me freaking beta so I
could<00:03:19.440> actually<00:03:19.620> record<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.640> do<00:03:21.209> everything

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
could actually record and do everything

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.780 
could actually record and do everything
from<00:03:21.959> analytical<00:03:22.650> perspectives<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.549> have

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
from analytical perspectives and have

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.240 
from analytical perspectives and have
actually<00:03:24.299> sort<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.079> comparable<00:03:25.680> numbers

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
actually sort of a comparable numbers

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.729 
actually sort of a comparable numbers
with<00:03:26.970> my<00:03:27.000> decay<00:03:27.480> right<00:03:27.870> now<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.410> see<00:03:28.620> what

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
with my decay right now and see what

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.490 
with my decay right now and see what
actually<00:03:29.130> can<00:03:29.280> expect<00:03:29.730> from<00:03:29.820> my<00:03:30.090> class<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:31.290> of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
actually can expect from my class but of

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.930 
actually can expect from my class but of
course<00:03:31.769> they<00:03:31.890> did<00:03:32.070> not<00:03:32.220> give<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.579> betta<00:03:32.820> yet

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
course they did not give you betta yet

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.099 
course they did not give you betta yet
so<00:03:33.570> what<00:03:34.440> happened<00:03:34.850> now<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.660> question<00:03:36.900> is

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
so what happened now the question is

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.810 
so what happened now the question is
what<00:03:37.560> do<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.709> think<00:03:37.950> about<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.370> guild<00:03:38.579> wars

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820
