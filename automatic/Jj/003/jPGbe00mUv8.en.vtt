common<00:00:14.190> deadlifting<00:00:14.880> errors<00:00:15.269> especially<00:00:15.630> in

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
common deadlifting errors especially in

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.090 
common deadlifting errors especially in
someone<00:00:16.260> learning<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.650> deadlift<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
someone learning the deadlift for the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.820 
someone learning the deadlift for the
first<00:00:17.340> time<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.690> two<00:00:18.960> exercises<00:00:19.680> or

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
first time and and two exercises or

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.769 
first time and and two exercises or
drills<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.400> can<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:21.210> fix<00:00:21.539> these

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
drills that we can do to fix these

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
drills that we can do to fix these
errors<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.010> first<00:00:23.250> error<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.850> see

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
errors so the first error that we see

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.310 
errors so the first error that we see
typically<00:00:24.750> with<00:00:24.900> people<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:25.199> they're

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
typically with people when they're

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.150 
typically with people when they're
learning<00:00:25.470> how<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> deadlift

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
learning how to deadlift

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.179 
learning how to deadlift
is<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> bar<00:00:27.240> comes<00:00:28.019> off<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.800> their<00:00:28.949> body

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
is that the bar comes off of their body

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.820 
is that the bar comes off of their body
during<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> descent<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.119> ascent<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.109> instead

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
during the descent and ascent so instead

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.959 
during the descent and ascent so instead
of<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.130> instead<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.489> keeping<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.790> nice<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of just instead of keeping it nice and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.280 
of just instead of keeping it nice and
close<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> their<00:00:33.450> body<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.840> they'll<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
close to their body what they'll do is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.330 
close to their body what they'll do is
that<00:00:34.410> they'll<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.739> let<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.950> come<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.190> here

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
that they'll just let it come out here

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
that they'll just let it come out here
like<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.420> need<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.840> way<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.200> drill

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
like this and so we need a way to drill

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
like this and so we need a way to drill
that<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:39.030> using<00:00:39.420> words<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.079> using<00:00:40.320> other

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that not using words but using other

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
that not using words but using other
cues<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.550> learn<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
cues so that they can learn what it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.670 
cues so that they can learn what it
feels<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.440> number

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
feels like to do that so that's number

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.279 
feels like to do that so that's number
one<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.550> other<00:00:44.780> common<00:00:45.780> mistake<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> we

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
one and the other common mistake that we

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.959 
one and the other common mistake that we
see<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.620> people<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.160> they'll<00:00:47.730> come

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
see is that people will do they'll come

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.180 
see is that people will do they'll come
down<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> their<00:00:49.350> knees<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.950> Bend

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
down like this and their knees will Bend

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
down like this and their knees will Bend
too<00:00:50.789> too<00:00:51.420> early<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> dead<00:00:52.289> lip<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
too too early and the dead lip and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.600 
too too early and the dead lip and
you'll<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:52.890> around<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.460> knees

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you'll have to go around the knees

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.430 
you'll have to go around the knees
rather<00:00:54.300> than<00:00:54.570> keeping<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> knees<00:00:55.140> kind<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
rather than keeping the knees kind of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.010 
rather than keeping the knees kind of
back<00:00:55.710> until<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.520> transition<00:00:57.000> past<00:00:57.270> knees<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
back until we transition past knees so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.479 
back until we transition past knees so
what<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.250> first

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
what I'm going to do for this first

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.279 
what I'm going to do for this first
drill<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.719> specifically

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
drill and this is really specifically

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.619 
drill and this is really specifically
going<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> help<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.219> keeping<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> bar<00:01:03.059> close

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
going to help with keeping the bar close

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.929 
going to help with keeping the bar close
to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> body<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.470> how<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> engage<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to the body and how to engage the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
to the body and how to engage the
shoulder<00:01:05.970> while<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.170> descending<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
shoulder while you're descending and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.890 
shoulder while you're descending and
ascending<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:09.000> I'm<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> take<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.570> band

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
ascending so I'm going to take this band

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
ascending so I'm going to take this band
I'm<00:01:10.140> gonna<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.590> dowel<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.310> broomstick

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I'm gonna put my dowel or my broomstick

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.780 
I'm gonna put my dowel or my broomstick
through<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> band<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.729> does

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
through the band and then what this does

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.600 
through the band and then what this does
is<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.780> because<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> tension<00:01:17.549> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
is it because of the bit the tension of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.179 
is it because of the bit the tension of
the<00:01:17.670> band<00:01:17.880> pulls<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.689> dowel<00:01:19.320> away<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:20.100> me

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the band pulls the dowel away from me

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.820 
the band pulls the dowel away from me
accuse<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.330> pull<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
accuse me to pull it in which can be a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
accuse me to pull it in which can be a
better<00:01:23.310> way<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.610> someone<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.270> learn<00:01:24.509> how<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
better way for someone to learn how to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
better way for someone to learn how to
do<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.170> versus<00:01:25.860> using<00:01:26.070> words<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.670> cue<00:01:26.939> them

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
do this versus using words to cue them

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
do this versus using words to cue them
so<00:01:27.270> feeling<00:01:28.170> something<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.530> much<00:01:28.650> more

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so feeling something is much more

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
so feeling something is much more
powerful<00:01:29.189> than<00:01:29.310> hearing<00:01:30.030> words<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.840> I'm<00:01:30.930> gonna

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
powerful than hearing words so I'm gonna

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
powerful than hearing words so I'm gonna
pull<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.640> just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
pull this in here and then I'm just

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.300 
pull this in here and then I'm just
going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> descend<00:01:33.630> down<00:01:33.900> into<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.740> bottom<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
going to descend down into the bottom of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
going to descend down into the bottom of
the<00:01:35.400> deadlift<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.840> come

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the deadlift and then I'm going to come

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
so that's drill number one which we're

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.710 
so that's drill number one which we're
using<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.950> help<00:01:47.070> Q<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.880> being<00:01:48.210> away<00:01:48.479> from<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
body for the second problem that I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.160 
body for the second problem that I
talked<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.420> around<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
talked about which was going around the

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
knees kind of premature knee bending

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.069 
knees kind of premature knee bending
what<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.670> drill<00:01:57.030> where<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.930> use

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
what we can do is a drill where we use

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.160 
what we can do is a drill where we use
the<00:01:58.259> dowel<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.090> instead<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> holding<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the dowel and instead of holding the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.219 
the dowel and instead of holding the
dowel<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> hands<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.420> pin<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
dowel with the hands I kind of pin the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.649 
dowel with the hands I kind of pin the
dowel<00:02:04.469> against<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> body<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:06.030> an<00:02:06.119> open<00:02:06.420> hand

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
dowel against the body with an open hand

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.290 
dowel against the body with an open hand
and<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.500> does<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.729> makes<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.119> so

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and what that does is it makes it so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780 
and what that does is it makes it so
that<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:09.899> down<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.890> your

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that if you get down to here and your

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.340 
that if you get down to here and your
knees<00:02:11.970> go<00:02:12.209> forward<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.750> literally

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
knees go forward you literally

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.500 
knees go forward you literally
cannot<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:13.980> around<00:02:14.070> your<00:02:14.370> knees<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.270> I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
cannot go around your knees and so I

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
cannot go around your knees and so I
will<00:02:16.020> have<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.350> person<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:17.610> an<00:02:17.730> open

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
they get past the knees then the knees

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.550 
they get past the knees then the knees
can<00:02:23.400> bend<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.970> then<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> way<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:25.080> they<00:02:25.410> can
