00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.089
 RAA 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.120
 Interested parents are definitely going to be Johann Friedrich Klanke 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.669
 is in a staging of the world steer turtle species ran mountain 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.099
 Yes, it is exactly there to find people helping Beijing 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.119
 a short term success is century 2 2 2 2 addition 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360
 Oh 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 driver 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.039
 After getting the informants, the classic has how to do it right 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.949
 If the company is at heart now is a long-forgotten prince 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770
 Philip 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.740
 only one fifth is important 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.880
 So 17 37 has that its world premiere 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.700
 and the prohibition list in back opera in London was a German and together 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.990
 he had decided with other clinics 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.470
 and write the burgeoning opera 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.540
 this parody has hit like a bomb people want the North Hesse 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.270
 a short jet of flame 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.160
 Decarnin but not 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.910
 because we know Henkel 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.790
 So the parody did not take too long as he parodied him 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.560
 and that different basis for our ears you feel almost all UCS segments 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.969
 and the Libyans not that I want to be elected to the Austrian master thus 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.440
 the question is obvious why has the plus in the state parliament 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.009
 Schiller wrote against the post office with Mendelssohn 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.920
 finally singing on a stage again it was coincidence in the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.140
 Forgottenness came 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.990
 the tail the percent 17 37 was very up to date but then after 17 what was 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.690
 I percentages 60 percent no longer really percent of that huge 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.340
 Resonance had the Ranger Mariner features says al Stewart joyfully 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.400
 accept how much confusion in audience and ensemble we impress 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.590
 Tribute SID and in general is love 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 the market value is recognized 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.969
 Arndt percent 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.379
 I believe the euro presented are empty of advantage 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.649
 Peter Lindbergh 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:22.799
 that he may become unconventional and nobody else like Russia 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.170
 then you can get them from a hotel in some chambers of the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.740
 the hero of the play become Berlin 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.249
 in Stoxx 50 a many cases 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.819
 Here begins the story studied economist and the children's hands 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.599
 fall 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.439
 there are areas there as well others 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.360
 but it makes me happy if it can be my first that costs strength 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:42.680
 Not 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.890
 at the stern the operation of the most famous protest songs i believe my hero too 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.589
 His intelligence is not eternal 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:54.289
 Percent e and and they just have courage and percent and so many hotels here 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.259
 then you need 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.089
 above all courage and then I give the whole place 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.520
 during the grace period of Heesen inherited and this with the sexes 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.299
 sighted with blood smeared 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.959
 so surprised small hall is scary for hairstyles 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.970
 I believe Mr. Weber then Red 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.799
 had used 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.910
 for every five percent 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.910
 somewhere is listening to the danger 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:23.019
 but back then it was gear and would make any new baroque opera a new monster 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:23.879
 need 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.340
 Percent and percent that actually percent lamp has this piece for 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.909
 Piece is being built 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.270
 while I think the thighs are knocking in Cameroon 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.900
 Stage experience on the knees in operation is well suited for one of 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.640
 maybe most important visitor 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.029
 the ad-hoc clearly signposted 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:44.419
 it is still made by hand 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.229
 in the previous year
