have the white mint version here and I
especially<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:25.050> how<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.289> colors<00:00:25.619> gradually

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
especially like how the colors gradually

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
especially like how the colors gradually
transformed<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> silver<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.570> mint

transformed from the silver to mint
color<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> back<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.490> different

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
color here in the back it's different

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
color here in the back it's different
and<00:00:30.000> very<00:00:30.210> cool<00:00:30.390> looking<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:31.410> that's<00:00:31.740> about

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
and very cool looking but that's about

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.160 
and very cool looking but that's about
all<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.250> liked<00:00:32.610> about<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.969> design<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.809> screen

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
all I liked about the design the screen

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
all I liked about the design the screen
is<00:00:34.200> smaller<00:00:34.710> than<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> original<00:00:35.430> shadow<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
is smaller than the original shadow and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.940 
is smaller than the original shadow and
it's<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:36.180> sharp<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.780> bright<00:00:36.989> also<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it's not very sharp or bright also the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's not very sharp or bright also the
navigation<00:00:38.550> controls<00:00:38.910> are<00:00:39.030> okay<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
navigation controls are okay but I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
navigation controls are okay but I
thought<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> navigation<00:00:40.440> wheel<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:40.829> here

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
thought the navigation wheel here here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.810 
thought the navigation wheel here here
felt<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.820> bit<00:00:42.000> cheap<00:00:43.340> also<00:00:44.340> when<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> slide<00:00:44.789> up

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
felt a bit cheap also when you slide up

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
felt a bit cheap also when you slide up
the<00:00:45.030> screen<00:00:45.329> you'll<00:00:45.510> find<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> 20<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.289> ensure

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the screen you'll find the 20 but ensure

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
the screen you'll find the 20 but ensure
type<00:00:47.100> keypad<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> even<00:00:48.030> though<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> buttons

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
type keypad and even though the buttons

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
type keypad and even though the buttons
are<00:00:48.629> large<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> easy<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.379> press<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.160> dial<00:00:50.309> pad

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
are large and easy to press the dial pad

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
are large and easy to press the dial pad
just<00:00:50.730> looks<00:00:50.969> bad<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.870> backlighting<00:00:52.379> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
just looks bad the backlighting is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.950 
just looks bad the backlighting is
uneven<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> dim<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.210> only<00:00:54.480> highlight

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
uneven and dim and so it only highlight

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
some of the keys and just kind of gives

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
some of the keys and just kind of gives
the<00:00:56.610> illusion<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.420> paint<00:00:57.690> has<00:00:57.780> worn<00:00:58.109> off

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the illusion that the paint has worn off

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.520 
the illusion that the paint has worn off
and<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.710> keypad<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.460> old<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.850> used<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.530> do
