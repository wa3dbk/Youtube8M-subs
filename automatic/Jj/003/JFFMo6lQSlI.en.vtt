building<00:00:09.380> my<00:00:10.380> last<00:00:10.530> portion<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.130> were<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.519> I

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
building my last portion that were on I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.570 
building my last portion that were on I
was<00:00:13.460> discussing<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.000> wing<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:15.839> Ward

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
was discussing the wing and now Ward

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.650 
was discussing the wing and now Ward
fashioned<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:20.150> eventually<00:00:21.150> finished<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
fashioned it over eventually finished it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.970 
fashioned it over eventually finished it
now<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.050> satellite<00:00:25.050> pod<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.769> put

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
now I just got the satellite pod to put

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.189 
now I just got the satellite pod to put
on<00:00:26.099> when<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.820> finished<00:00:27.180> they're<00:00:27.510> clean<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
on when I finished they're clean in it

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.720 
on when I finished they're clean in it
that<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> bitter<00:00:29.070> Austin

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
that the bitter Austin

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.659 
that the bitter Austin
the<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> had<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.349> other<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the one I had the other one was to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
the one I had the other one was to
bubble<00:00:33.000> over<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.630> where<00:00:33.870> repair<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.469> I'll<00:00:34.530> buy

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
bubble over to where repair so I'll buy

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.090 
bubble over to where repair so I'll buy
a<00:00:34.739> new<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> off<00:00:35.850> side<00:00:36.649> but<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
a new one for the off side but as you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.490 
a new one for the off side but as you
can<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:40.100> it's<00:00:41.100> come<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.790> okay<00:00:42.500> had

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
can see it's it's come on it's okay had

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
can see it's it's come on it's okay had
fun<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.250> games<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> thought<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.210> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
fun and games with it I thought that it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.990 
fun and games with it I thought that it
would<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.750> been<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> lot<00:00:46.140> easier<00:00:46.700> when<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> put

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
would have been a lot easier when I put

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.690 
would have been a lot easier when I put
this<00:00:48.149> piece<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.750> steel<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.710> had<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> two

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this piece of steel in here I had a two

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490 
this piece of steel in here I had a two
and<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> quarter<00:00:51.000> inches<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> piece<00:00:52.230> our

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and a quarter inches to this piece our

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.209 
and a quarter inches to this piece our
way<00:00:52.710> down<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:54.690> could<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.469> where<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:55.980> was

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
way down and I could see where it was

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.490 
way down and I could see where it was
the<00:00:56.910> flattest<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.570> could<00:00:57.750> find<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> wing

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the flattest I could find on the wing

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.560 
the flattest I could find on the wing
obviously<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.399> compound<00:00:59.820> curve<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.480> it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
obviously it's a compound curve but it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.590 
obviously it's a compound curve but it
was<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> highest<00:01:01.140> point<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.760> piece<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
was the highest point so the piece a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.230 
was the highest point so the piece a
pudding<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.860> nearly<00:01:05.369> enough<00:01:05.640> flat<00:01:06.030> it's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
pudding would be nearly enough flat it's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.460 
pudding would be nearly enough flat it's
not<00:01:06.420> flat<00:01:07.110> flat<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> shap

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
not flat flat but it's it's not a shap

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
not flat flat but it's it's not a shap
shap<00:01:10.470> compound<00:01:11.010> curve<00:01:11.220> anywhere<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.210> but

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
shap compound curve anywhere so but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.330 
shap compound curve anywhere so but
anyway<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> bit<00:01:13.830> higher<00:01:14.010> than<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
anyway it was a bit higher than what I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.840 
anyway it was a bit higher than what I
expected

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
expected

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
expected
especially<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.939> corner<00:01:18.900> area<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.500> I've

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
especially this corner area which I've

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.730 
especially this corner area which I've
made

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
made

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.960 
made
I<00:01:23.560> pretty<00:01:24.560> much<00:01:24.710> achieved<00:01:25.250> what<00:01:25.549> I<00:01:25.580> was<00:01:25.760> after

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
I pretty much achieved what I was after

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.350 
I pretty much achieved what I was after
with<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:30.159> it<00:01:31.159> turned<00:01:31.369> out<00:01:31.520> quite<00:01:31.580> good

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
with it it turned out quite good

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.149 
with it it turned out quite good
I<00:01:32.390> think<00:01:37.360> panel<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:38.630> area<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.560> want<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.800> it

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
I think panel in this area I want to it

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.440 
I think panel in this area I want to it
was<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:41.750> was<00:01:41.899> easy<00:01:42.110> not<00:01:42.500> for<00:01:42.619> suppose<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:44.300> get

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
was it was easy not for suppose to get

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.200 
was it was easy not for suppose to get
to<00:01:44.810> get<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.590> shape<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:46.119> getting<00:01:47.119> the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
to get in the shape of getting the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.969 
to get in the shape of getting the
contour<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.960> right<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:48.409> rather

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
contour in the right was rather

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.870 
contour in the right was rather
difficult<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.210> became<00:01:50.600> awkward<00:01:51.080> here<00:01:51.880> not

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
difficult but it became awkward here not

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.190 
difficult but it became awkward here not
to<00:01:53.000> use<00:01:53.119> I've<00:01:53.420> got<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> spot<00:01:53.869> weld<00:01:54.050> in

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
to use I've got a spot weld in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.859 
to use I've got a spot weld in
attachment<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:54.920> pulling<00:01:55.190> dings<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.869> because

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
attachment for pulling dings and because

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.630 
attachment for pulling dings and because
I<00:01:56.990> just<00:01:57.229> couldn't<00:01:57.500> physically<00:01:57.830> get<00:01:58.070> into<00:01:58.399> here

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
I just couldn't physically get into here

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.580 
I just couldn't physically get into here
one<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.539> reasons<00:01:59.840> because<00:01:59.960> me<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.259> just

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
one of the reasons because me and just

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.020 
one of the reasons because me and just
wasn't<00:02:00.860> long<00:02:01.009> enough<00:02:01.250> with<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.520> dollar<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
wasn't long enough with the dollar and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.020 
wasn't long enough with the dollar and
two<00:02:02.270> panel<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.720> at<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.289> same<00:02:03.500> times<00:02:04.030> second

two panel it at the same times second
one<00:02:05.149> was<00:02:07.000> where<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.869> inner<00:02:09.170> panel<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.739> their

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
one was where this inner panel of their

one was where this inner panel of their
de<00:02:10.130> comes<00:02:10.369> will<00:02:10.610> put<00:02:10.789> all<00:02:10.880> over<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.959> just

that's<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.670> grill<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:26.860> also<00:02:27.860> when<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.370> welded

that's a grill on also when I welded

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
down this seam here onto this folded

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.560 
down this seam here onto this folded
edge<00:02:33.739> up<00:02:34.010> mid<00:02:34.310> well<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.670> made<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> whole<00:02:35.299> piece

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
edge up mid well I made the whole piece

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.009 
edge up mid well I made the whole piece
and<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.260> welded<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.709> wing<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.190> oh<00:02:37.870> well<00:02:38.870> did

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.130 
and I welded the wing to it oh well did
it<00:02:39.170> seem<00:02:39.410> well<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.739> they<00:02:39.829> aren't<00:02:40.010> way<00:02:40.190> down

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
it seem well that they aren't way down

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.289
