00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
are you guy do we fuel inject so to have

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.090 
are you guy do we fuel inject so to have
a<00:00:49.949> fuel<00:00:50.370> injection<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> car<00:00:51.960> why<00:00:52.710> did<00:00:52.980> we

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
a fuel injection on a car why did we

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.960 
a fuel injection on a car why did we
have<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.400> do<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
have to do that

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.200 
have to do that
carburetors<00:00:54.870> work<00:00:55.080> just<00:00:55.350> fine<00:00:55.650> for<00:00:56.519> many<00:00:56.850> many

years a carburetor fueled a car in fact
when<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:01.110> look<00:01:01.140> back<00:01:01.650> it<00:01:02.070> at<00:01:02.339> cars<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
when you look back it at cars and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.660 
when you look back it at cars and
automobiles<00:01:03.620> from<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:04.739> horseless<00:01:05.220> carriage

when<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> put<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> motor<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
when I put a motor in this thing I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.310 
when I put a motor in this thing I
didn't<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> lot<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.000> changes<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.960> far<00:01:10.200> as

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
didn't have a lot of changes as far as

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.340 
didn't have a lot of changes as far as
electrical<00:01:10.890> system<00:01:11.340> pretty<00:01:11.520> much<00:01:11.729> right<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
electrical system pretty much right and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.820 
electrical system pretty much right and
a<00:01:13.350> scan<00:01:13.710> tool<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.400> only<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.630> tool<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.470> gather

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
a scan tool is only a tool to gather

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
a scan tool is only a tool to gather
data<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:18.600> rapidly<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.580> make<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.630> diagnostic

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
data very rapidly and make a diagnostic

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
data very rapidly and make a diagnostic
decision<00:01:22.260> where<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> use<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> scope<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.119> ammeter

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
decision where I use a scope or ammeter

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.399 
decision where I use a scope or ammeter
to<00:01:25.049> validate<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.010> circuits<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
to validate the circuits it is not a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
to validate the circuits it is not a
tool<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.280> tells<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.700> what's<00:01:29.880> wrong<00:01:30.060> with

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
tool that tells you what's wrong with

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.950 
tool that tells you what's wrong with
the<00:01:30.420> car<00:01:30.660> it<00:01:30.930> guides<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.370> direction

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
the car it guides you in a direction

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.930 
the car it guides you in a direction
it's<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:34.800> trying<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.370> get<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.730> to

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
it's like if I'm trying to get back to

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.720 
it's like if I'm trying to get back to
Albuquerque<00:01:36.620> there's<00:01:37.620> a<00:01:37.770> lot<00:01:38.010> of<00:01:38.130> road<00:01:38.340> signs

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
Albuquerque there's a lot of road signs

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.640 
Albuquerque there's a lot of road signs
along<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> way<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.050> got<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.320> take<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
along the way but I got to take the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.420 
along the way but I got to take the
right<00:01:40.830> ones<00:01:41.160> right<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.190> road

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
right ones right it's only the road

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370 
right ones right it's only the road
signs<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.120> a<00:01:45.240> pointer<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.260> gonna

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
signs it's a pointer and it's gonna

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.820 
signs it's a pointer and it's gonna
drive<00:01:46.920> me<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.490> gonna<00:01:47.640> show<00:01:48.030> me<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.830> but

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
drive me it's gonna show me my way but

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.460 
drive me it's gonna show me my way but
it<00:01:49.950> isn't<00:01:50.220> gonna<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.550> me<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:51.350> you're<00:01:52.350> gonna

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
it isn't gonna get me there you're gonna

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.740 
it isn't gonna get me there you're gonna
have<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:53.010> use<00:01:53.220> an<00:01:53.430> oscilloscope<00:01:53.760> or<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> meter

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
have to use an oscilloscope or a meter

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.290 
have to use an oscilloscope or a meter
in<00:01:54.960> order<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.350> fix<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.430> obviously<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.030> need

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
in order to fix this so obviously I need

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.360 
in order to fix this so obviously I need
lots<00:01:57.480> of<00:01:57.690> parts<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.170> ionization<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.220> mass

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
lots of parts and ionization for a mass

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.280 
lots of parts and ionization for a mass
sensor<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.650> piece<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.890> paper<00:02:03.290> we

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
sensor and it was a piece of paper we

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.410 
sensor and it was a piece of paper we
got<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.830> better<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.400> got<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.730> pay<00:02:05.909> attention

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
got to be better we got to pay attention

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.029 
got to be better we got to pay attention
to<00:02:06.510> what<00:02:06.659> we're<00:02:06.810> doing<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.409> air<00:02:07.800> guys

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
to what we're doing it's about air guys

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.740 
to what we're doing it's about air guys
you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.159> when<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> pulled<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.940> off<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.330> knew<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you know when I pulled it off I knew the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.270 
you know when I pulled it off I knew the
mass<00:02:12.959> sensor<00:02:13.440> was<00:02:13.590> bad<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.800> thought<00:02:14.129> it

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
mass sensor was bad I thought it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.710 
mass sensor was bad I thought it
wouldn't<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.519> new<00:02:14.640> math<00:02:14.879> sensors<00:02:15.360> something

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
wouldn't the new math sensors something

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660 
wouldn't the new math sensors something
was<00:02:15.810> bad<00:02:16.019> when<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> went<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.860> pull<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.220> mass<00:02:17.400> air

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
was bad when I went to pull the mass air

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.430 
was bad when I went to pull the mass air
sensor<00:02:18.090> off<00:02:18.209> there<00:02:18.420> was<00:02:18.480> no<00:02:18.659> air<00:02:18.900> filter<00:02:19.409> in<00:02:19.590> it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
sensor off there was no air filter in it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.559 
sensor off there was no air filter in it
these<00:02:22.440> guys<00:02:22.500> put<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> mass<00:02:23.430> sensor<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> a

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
these guys put a mass sensor on it a
