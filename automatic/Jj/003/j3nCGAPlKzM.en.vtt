00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 very good people here we are in what 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.430
 is a hard team and I'm going to 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.560
 put the hyper whit with half to be and 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.990
 with a silencer and well, I told you that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 was going to do a 2.0 not that from 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.429
 now I was going to fuck I was going to comment on 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 videos as always not but I was going to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.359
 do with the webcam there a little bit 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.539
 to interact with you I know 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 I thought it was a good idea and I also put it 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.900
 in two videos back I did not put it before 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.609
 yesterday in a video and you thought it was good 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.529
 idea gave then look says I can be 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 do something different and so not remembering 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.530
 that's about Robert and well, nothing 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.989
 going back a little bit to the good game 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 to tell you nothing but you already know her 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.180
 everything kills a lot or is hip 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.890
 half of the laser is replaced and that is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 tremendous or it is tremendous kills 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.989
 very much this soul is that it is to possess a 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.870
 submachine gun sitting down not for people 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.850
 evidently you will catch the dlc and such 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.050
 although the times are beautiful and over 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.480
 everything for the people who like the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.730
 zombies and well that's what I got 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.010
 It seemed like a good idea to upload a game 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 more with this diamond 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.290
 also on the same day that the dlc came out 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.970
 first dlc that same night I had it 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 of diamond because I had all the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.880
 diamond submachine guns already then by 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.220
 Well, this one takes it out of gold already 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 you know or nobody or nothing new and such and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.030
 Well, nothing the truth is that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.800
 thinking like that a little bit is worth thinking about 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.770
 little bit also with the issue of the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.380
 webcam and it is I do not know that all I know 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.150
 and I have to think and do a lot 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.670
 time not with questions and answers 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.580
 and in the last truth I think that what 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.690
 I had a lot of fun 9 or apart from 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.610
 the comments men 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.410
 to me what I am not obviously 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.040
 Well, it's the comments that 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.260
 ask things that arise to you 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.200
 and well, also, there is no question 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.780
 in white poll I have not fixed this 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.450
 these questions a little fact trait that 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.040
 you laugh a button and the truth that they are very 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.010
 fun not to cheer up a little there 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.060
 the theme and in the pimps and well then the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.619
 true that I believe that when it was 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.420
 from summer to early summer 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.820
 not two or three months ago that not 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.590
 questions and answers and I know that well 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.050
 If you want to put me in the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.550
 comments and well then I take it 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.010
 I point pim pam pim pam and see if the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.110
 next week or the next one 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.300
 questions and answers like that live and 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.100
 you ask me in the chat no longer tell me 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.860
 is where we can ask you anything 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.430
 directly when that at least I 'm worth 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.700
 what I usually do is catch and when 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.440
 I do streaming on YouTube because in the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.030
 chat I read the questions and I'm going 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.920
 answering I'm stopping it so that 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.290
 they do not pass very fast and I'm answering 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.180
 tweet and titi and that's it or does not do 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.260
 no need to put any hashtag or 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.230
 no history 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.610
 odd roll of those so well then if 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.670
 it seems good idea we put the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.310
 comments and well then when we ask 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.220
 some day and such also that you are 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.500
 starting all the high school or 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.540
 it is practically everything because we will see 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.670
 see how we can fit in there so that 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.799
 good to you too and good 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.780
 because nothing here is pin for kids 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.659
 paint it match look what we call 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.319
 52 casualties I have nothing left or for 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:20.140
 finish the game and nothing I'm happy about 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.909
 I'm really trying to do this because I 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.740
 I found it a bit funny 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.710
 to comment on videos 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.650
 in 2.0 well, what do I know about a 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.510
 little bit of joke and laughter and is very 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.220
 fun the truth is very good and 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.220
 Well, this time I took off my 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.140
 another helicopter is worth or I removed the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.600
 be and I have put a little bit because the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.800
 agr what good then at the end within what 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.440
 that fits and you'll see when the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.970
 departure are under schemes of much 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.130
 with the streaks but good at least 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.900
 arba I swell now then you go to 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.050
 see that it is also ahead that they were 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.420
 ten casualties until he's already sucking 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.370
 you know it's already ending and with the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.410
 showers did not kill much either me 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.690
 inflated with the weapon or with the weapon is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.920
 that some tremendous damage and good 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.050
 well nothing here I was looking 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.830
 for basin I do not know what I was doing 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.890
 the poor man and good is already here 75 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.220
 41 certain game I've done a 37 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.320
 2 besides, look, I think I know 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.900
 When the game ends, it gives the sedet 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.510
 running and it was that I had feeling 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.940
 that I know that I was walking 30 casualties or 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.920
 a little less than 30 and when it was 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.810
 siege my mother 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.700
 72 and I say if it swells me with a 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.210
 Do you know that I did not like it? 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.860
 really that I killed so much I do not know to 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.350
 the best thing in that moment is me 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.480
 going down and such and well then nothing I'm going to 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.040

 six with the iron that is killed 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.280
