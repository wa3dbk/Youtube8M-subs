00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
 Hello, how are you guys in this video? 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.570
 to show how to make the 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:12.929
 7 inch galaxy 3 light 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.929
 [Music] 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.350
 well as you will have noticed this galaxytab to 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.480
 Sometimes it gets a bit slow on everything 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.940
 at the beginning when you just take it out of the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.940
 box and you start to try it 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.720
 and now I'm going to give some tips so that 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.370
 go a little faster and I have been 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.620
 served 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.170
 and well let's start the first thing you're going to 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.989
 make some adjustments 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.239
 and we will look for options 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.010
 developer if you do not have 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.229
 activated those options what are we going to 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.059
 to do is to go to close we are going to go to the 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.729
 part where it says about the device 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.409
 and let's give it five times we're going to 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.750
 press five times the number of 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.489
 compilation of alternatiba so to me 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.229
 It's not going to work for me because we're leaving 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.030
 now to developer options once 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.480
 activated 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.659
 and we activate this obviously and we search 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.040
 the part that tells us at scale 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.960
 window animation and we give 0.5 0.5 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.549
 the transitional investment scale 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.310
 and the school of animation duration 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.340
 we also put it to 0.5 so we 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.869
 are these 3 with 0.5 ok then what 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.600
 second is that we're going to go in the 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.310
 energy saving and disappear these 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.080
 even if it is off saving 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.210
 energy these for these two parts do not 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.490
 is going to come out with the check we're going to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.399
 activate we were going to get these two 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.759
 checks well now it stays like this for 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.759
 simple 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.740
 unless you obviously do not 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.090
 want to save energy and good what 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.179
 reactivated science 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.310
 another thing is that we're going to 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.100
 download google lend the nova 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.480
 launcher that is the fastest launcher 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.340
 that exists in google press store 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.700
 and once installed we will select 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.650
 let's press the center button and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.010
 we are going to select nova launcher for 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.010
 simple 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.420
 after having made these tips what 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.560
 let's do is simply control 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.480
 the applications that we have open 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.610
 in this case I do not have any but in the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.610
 case they were for example now 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.280
 I open gmail 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.750
 abro play store 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.550
 in the case they had 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.350
 pressed on this button and good as 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.090
 any other android slide the finger 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.400
 to close them they will also be able to 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.630
 free memory and in our part the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.069
 task manager in ram manager 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.560
 and import memory 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.819
 so with these little tips we're going to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.290
 to be able to make your tablet faster and 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.990
