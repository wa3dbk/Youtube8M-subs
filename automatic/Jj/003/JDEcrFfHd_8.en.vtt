the<00:01:31.380> 21<00:01:31.860> 21<00:01:32.430> days<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.060> need

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the 21 21 days you need

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
the 21 21 days you need
so<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.520> wanting<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.120> tell<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.720> sure

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
so this but for wanting to tell for sure

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.330 
so this but for wanting to tell for sure
is<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.410> if<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.940> egg<00:01:42.510> that<00:01:42.900> it's<00:01:43.340> it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is that if you see an egg that it's it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.650 
is that if you see an egg that it's it's
not<00:01:44.550> having<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:46.619> means<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.090> pigeon<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
not having it means that the pigeon is

00:01:48.660 --> 00:02:04.340 
not having it means that the pigeon is
not<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> egg<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.890> means<00:01:50.250> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.409
