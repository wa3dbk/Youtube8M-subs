00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello, I'm cooking chops today 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.160
 in Kiev 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.550
 for this we need the following products 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.110
 one kilo of minced chicken breast 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.960
 200 grams of breadcrumbs 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.980
 2 eggs 150 grams of frozen 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.980
 butter salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.160
 break the egg and add to the mince salt 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 and pepper to taste in a separate plate 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.840
 beat the egg well and mix 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.309
 put off the side 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.620
 cooking butter pieces 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.640
 divide it into small pieces by weight 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.640
 in 20 grams 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.609
 then mix the meat with the egg 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.150
 and put the oil get warm using 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.230
 for frying vegetable oil 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.230
 then form the patties themselves 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.729
 putting butter in the middle well with 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 I fasten it to the sides 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.990
 frying time did not flow 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.750
 well shaped patty 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.750
 lubricate the egg 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.049
 then shrouded in breadcrumbs 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.869
 best after each burgers 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.780
 rinse your hands and re-do all this 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:09.649
 procedure and so having formed all the chops 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.649
 proceed to roasting 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.600
 fry over medium heat without a lid 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.730
 I got 7 cutlets four of them I 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.320
 roasted the rest sent to 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.120
 freezer is a great cake mix 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.550
 which can also fry defrosting 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.710
 its at room temperature 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.670
 previously pulled out of the freezer 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.950
 an hour before cooking and so one country is already 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.080
 roasted alien to them second to red 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:52.270
 crusts best garnish for cutlets 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.270
 in Kiev are fried potatoes 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.519
 then cut to you 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.209
 there is of course 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.709
 and the most important thing is to drain 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.599
 if you go out 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.190
 spilled oil means everything we cooked 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.190
 properly bon appetit
