stevo<00:00:07.130> here<00:00:07.430> with<00:00:08.059> another<00:00:08.330> update<00:00:08.680> about<00:00:09.680> an

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
stevo here with another update about an

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.330 
stevo here with another update about an
hour<00:00:10.130> ago<00:00:10.250> I<00:00:10.400> posted<00:00:10.780> a<00:00:11.780> design<00:00:12.290> this<00:00:12.710> one<00:00:12.950> was

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
hour ago I posted a design this one was

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.430 
hour ago I posted a design this one was
something<00:00:13.580> I<00:00:13.730> came<00:00:13.790> up<00:00:14.000> with<00:00:14.120> which<00:00:14.930> was<00:00:15.170> a

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
something I came up with which was a

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.170 
something I came up with which was a
five-minute<00:00:16.219> time<00:00:16.400> and<00:00:16.640> that<00:00:16.730> didn't<00:00:17.000> need

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
five-minute time and that didn't need

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.240 
five-minute time and that didn't need
ever<00:00:17.480> to<00:00:17.750> be<00:00:17.900> replenished<00:00:18.380> it<00:00:19.070> would

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
ever to be replenished it would

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.160 
ever to be replenished it would
replenish<00:00:19.610> yourself<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.390> continue<00:00:20.810> to<00:00:20.840> time

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
replenish yourself and continue to time

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.550 
replenish yourself and continue to time
now<00:00:22.100> the<00:00:22.160> design<00:00:22.670> i<00:00:22.699> put<00:00:23.570> together<00:00:23.689> was<00:00:24.170> fairly

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
now the design i put together was fairly

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.989 
now the design i put together was fairly
compact<00:00:24.980> but<00:00:25.609> it<00:00:25.669> had<00:00:25.759> one<00:00:25.970> major<00:00:26.179> flaw<00:00:26.800> as<00:00:27.999> you

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:28.999 
compact but it had one major flaw as you

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.409 
compact but it had one major flaw as you
can<00:00:29.749> see<00:00:30.130> here<00:00:31.130> obviously<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:32.150> would<00:00:32.270> retract

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
can see here obviously it would retract

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.210 
can see here obviously it would retract
and<00:00:32.990> then<00:00:33.230> it<00:00:33.440> would<00:00:33.560> have<00:00:33.680> time<00:00:33.920> to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
and then it would have time to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.580 
and then it would have time to
apparently<00:00:34.790> regrow<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:35.900> didn't<00:00:36.290> know<00:00:36.410> at

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
apparently regrow now I didn't know at

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.229 
apparently regrow now I didn't know at
the<00:00:36.620> time<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:36.890> didn't<00:00:37.160> realized<00:00:37.490> that<00:00:37.730> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
the time I didn't realized that the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.970 
the time I didn't realized that the
growing<00:00:38.690> time<00:00:38.930> was<00:00:39.110> just<00:00:39.410> over<00:00:39.710> five<00:00:39.949> minutes

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
growing time was just over five minutes

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.040 
growing time was just over five minutes
so<00:00:40.489> I<00:00:40.520> thought<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:40.879> was<00:00:41.000> earlier<00:00:41.510> than<00:00:41.930> that

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
so I thought it was earlier than that

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.010 
so I thought it was earlier than that
like<00:00:42.350> mostly<00:00:43.309> because<00:00:43.520> I<00:00:43.940> tendon<00:00:44.629> grow<00:00:44.750> pretty

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
like mostly because I tendon grow pretty

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.360 
like mostly because I tendon grow pretty
quick<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.410> it<00:00:45.530> does<00:00:45.680> grow<00:00:45.920> pretty<00:00:46.190> quick

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
quick and it does grow pretty quick

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.900 
quick and it does grow pretty quick
sometimes<00:00:46.820> but<00:00:47.719> on<00:00:48.620> average<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:49.460> can<00:00:49.550> get<00:00:49.879> a

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
sometimes but on average you can get a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.759 
sometimes but on average you can get a
less<00:00:50.120> than<00:00:50.329> five<00:00:50.510> minute<00:00:50.809> but<00:00:51.079> on<00:00:51.590> average

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
less than five minute but on average

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.950 
less than five minute but on average
it's<00:00:52.129> about<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.940> five<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.660> half<00:00:53.690> minutes

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
it's about a five and a half minutes

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.869 
it's about a five and a half minutes
around<00:00:54.379> about<00:00:54.590> five<00:00:54.980> minutes<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.550> twenty

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
around about five minutes and twenty

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.799 
around about five minutes and twenty
twenty<00:00:56.390> seconds<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:57.859> had<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.359> modify<00:00:59.359> my

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
twenty seconds so I had to modify my

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.180 
twenty seconds so I had to modify my
design<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.440> concept<00:01:00.739> still<00:01:01.010> does<00:01:01.190> work<00:01:02.109> and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
design the concept still does work and

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.090 
design the concept still does work and
so<00:01:04.190> I<00:01:04.220> made<00:01:04.990> another<00:01:05.990> one<00:01:06.110> here<00:01:06.470> which<00:01:06.650> was<00:01:06.830> a

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
so I made another one here which was a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.830 
so I made another one here which was a
tee<00:01:07.490> flip-flop<00:01:07.970> one<00:01:08.120> would<00:01:08.360> go<00:01:08.450> back<00:01:08.660> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
tee flip-flop one would go back and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.870 
tee flip-flop one would go back and
forth<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:09.890> once<00:01:10.130> again<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.400> same<00:01:10.670> problem

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
forth but once again the same problem

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.480 
forth but once again the same problem
the<00:01:11.840> thing<00:01:12.080> was<00:01:12.230> blocking<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.740> thing<00:01:13.220> for<00:01:13.400> the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
the thing was blocking the thing for the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.420 
the thing was blocking the thing for the
other<00:01:13.520> side<00:01:13.940> made<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:14.780> difficult<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:18.430> it

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
other side made it it difficult and it

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.920 
other side made it it difficult and it
was<00:01:19.520> just<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.790> few<00:01:20.000> things<00:01:20.210> on<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.720> won't

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
was just a few things on that won't

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.750 
was just a few things on that won't
write<00:01:21.290> about<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.800> just<00:01:21.830> I<00:01:22.220> wasn't<00:01:22.640> happy

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
write about it I just I wasn't happy

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.190 
write about it I just I wasn't happy
with<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.640> made<00:01:25.880> another<00:01:26.270> overkill

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
with it and so I made another overkill

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.720 
with it and so I made another overkill
version<00:01:27.590> which<00:01:27.860> is<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.190> one<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.460> about<00:01:28.610> to

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
version which is the one that about to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.120 
version which is the one that about to
show<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:28.910> in<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.120> moment<00:01:29.240> but<00:01:30.170> as<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.680> will<00:01:30.980> be

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
show you in a moment but as you will be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.920 
show you in a moment but as you will be
able<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.520> see<00:01:31.760> in<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.360> moment<00:01:34.540> this<00:01:35.540> here<00:01:35.900> is

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
able to see in a moment this here is

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.100 
able to see in a moment this here is
basically<00:01:36.200> how<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.650> works<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.870> same

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
basically how it works so it's the same

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.840 
basically how it works so it's the same
sort<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.440> concept<00:01:39.770> but<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.190> only<00:01:40.250> has<00:01:40.520> five

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
sort of concept but it only has five

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.450 
sort of concept but it only has five
minutes<00:01:41.180> still<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.480> to<00:01:42.470> regrow<00:01:42.890> like<00:01:43.130> this<00:01:43.310> is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
minutes still to to regrow like this is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.980 
minutes still to to regrow like this is
pushed<00:01:43.730> out<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:45.880> yeah<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.360> just<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.840> same

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
pushed out and yeah it's just the same

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.530 
pushed out and yeah it's just the same
as<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.350> but<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:48.710> just<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.310> other<00:01:49.820> one<00:01:50.000> it's

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
as that but it's just the other one it's

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.630 
as that but it's just the other one it's
blocking<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.410> regrowth<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.800> itself<00:01:52.280> so

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
blocking the regrowth of itself so

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.480 
blocking the regrowth of itself so
anyway<00:01:53.330> that's<00:01:53.780> not<00:01:54.200> important<00:01:54.680> this<00:01:55.310> one

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
anyway that's not important this one

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.510 
anyway that's not important this one
here<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.080> basically<00:01:57.080> four<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.860> them<00:01:58.040> you<00:01:58.370> can

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
here is basically four of them you can

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.850 
here is basically four of them you can
do<00:01:58.640> three<00:01:59.140> which<00:02:00.140> would<00:02:00.290> probably<00:02:00.560> work<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
do three which would probably work the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.210 
do three which would probably work the
best<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:02.060> what<00:02:02.300> happens<00:02:02.660> basically<00:02:02.900> is<00:02:03.440> it

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
best but what happens basically is it

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.010 
best but what happens basically is it
pushes<00:02:04.640> off<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:05.720> was<00:02:05.810> fail<00:02:09.429> all<00:02:10.429> right<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.020> it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
pushes off that was fail all right so it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.649 
pushes off that was fail all right so it
pushes<00:02:12.260> off<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:13.129> sugar<00:02:13.520> cane<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.450> lands

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
pushes off this sugar cane and it lands

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.630 
pushes off this sugar cane and it lands
on<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> pressure<00:02:15.049> plate<00:02:15.170> five<00:02:16.129> minutes<00:02:16.430> later

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
on the pressure plate five minutes later

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.369 
on the pressure plate five minutes later
it<00:02:16.879> goes<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.599> next<00:02:17.870> one<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.019> goes<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:18.319> the

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
it goes to the next one and goes all the

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.300 
it goes to the next one and goes all the
way<00:02:18.469> around<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.069> like

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
way around so like

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.990 
way around so like
for<00:02:19.940> example<00:02:20.360> like<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:21.650> then<00:02:22.430> if<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.640> grab<00:02:22.819> that

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
for example like so then if I grab that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.890 
for example like so then if I grab that
one<00:02:23.209> you'll<00:02:24.110> go<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.349> first<00:02:24.620> one<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.900> it'll

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
one you'll go to the first one and it'll

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900 
one you'll go to the first one and it'll
keep<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:27.319> around<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> cycle<00:02:28.069> now<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.819> have

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
keep going around the cycle now I have

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.390 
keep going around the cycle now I have
20<00:02:29.420> nuts<00:02:29.660> around<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> cycle<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:30.770> it's<00:02:30.920> plenty

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
20 nuts around the cycle so it's plenty

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.610 
20 nuts around the cycle so it's plenty
of<00:02:31.489> time<00:02:31.700> for<00:02:31.940> everything<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.420> regrow<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.590> I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
of time for everything to regrow but I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.780 
of time for everything to regrow but I
just<00:02:33.800> really<00:02:34.069> wanted<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.340> do<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> proof<00:02:34.670> of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
just really wanted to do a proof of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.880 
just really wanted to do a proof of
concept<00:02:35.349> there's<00:02:36.349> going<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.650> obviously

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
concept there's going to be obviously

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920 
concept there's going to be obviously
more<00:02:37.310> compact<00:02:37.730> designs<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.690> just

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
more compact designs of this I just

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.050 
more compact designs of this I just
wanted<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.170> put<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.470> design<00:02:39.739> out<00:02:39.950> there<00:02:40.160> cuz

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
wanted to put the design out there cuz

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.440 
wanted to put the design out there cuz
it's<00:02:41.569> pretty<00:02:41.870> cool<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.760> never<00:02:44.000> have<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.300> look

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it's pretty cool you never have to look

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.500 
it's pretty cool you never have to look
at<00:02:44.540> your<00:02:44.630> thing<00:02:44.780> again<00:02:45.050> but<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:46.180> like<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.300> said<00:02:47.480> I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
at your thing again but I like I said I

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.699 
at your thing again but I like I said I
was<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:47.870> trying<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.200> figure<00:02:48.380> out<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
was just trying to figure out the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.559 
was just trying to figure out the
concept<00:02:49.069> first<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:49.910> everything's<00:02:50.480> a

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
concept first and so everything's a

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.059 
concept first and so everything's a
little<00:02:50.690> bit<00:02:50.870> haphazard<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.500> whatever<00:02:51.830> and

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
little bit haphazard and whatever and

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.479 
little bit haphazard and whatever and
the<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.299> 5am<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.290> didn't<00:02:54.620> bother<00:02:54.650> doing<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the it's 5am so I didn't bother doing a

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.070 
the it's 5am so I didn't bother doing a
more<00:02:55.819> compact<00:02:56.209> when<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.510> live<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.959> you

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
more compact when I live that to you

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.690 
more compact when I live that to you
guys<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.860> essentially<00:02:58.220> you've<00:02:58.340> got<00:02:58.430> again

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
guys but essentially you've got again

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.910 
guys but essentially you've got again
gate<00:02:59.000> here<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.480> if<00:02:59.750> when<00:03:00.200> they<00:03:00.380> all<00:03:00.500> turn<00:03:00.709> off

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
gate here so if when they all turn off

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.789 
gate here so if when they all turn off
which<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.250> when<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.670> D<00:03:01.880> spawns<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:03.470> sends<00:03:03.739> a

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
which is when this D spawns it sends a

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.949 
which is when this D spawns it sends a
pulse<00:03:04.010> through<00:03:04.400> here<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.390> time<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:05.630> it

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
pulse through here in the time that it

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.420 
pulse through here in the time that it
takes<00:03:06.140> for<00:03:06.319> one<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.739> these<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.010> get<00:03:07.069> pushed<00:03:07.280> off

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
takes for one of these to get pushed off

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.630 
takes for one of these to get pushed off
so<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.880> will<00:03:08.060> come<00:03:08.660> through<00:03:08.900> here<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:10.430> will

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
so this will come through here this will

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.030 
so this will come through here this will
turn<00:03:10.760> on<00:03:11.000> for<00:03:11.360> two<00:03:11.510> tix<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.049> then<00:03:12.769> push<00:03:13.010> down

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
turn on for two tix and then push down

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.400 
turn on for two tix and then push down
which<00:03:13.819> will<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.390> two<00:03:14.450> tix<00:03:14.810> will<00:03:14.959> come<00:03:15.110> through

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
which will so two tix will come through

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.759 
which will so two tix will come through
and<00:03:16.030> pull<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.180> cycle<00:03:17.569> through<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.049> then<00:03:18.650> it

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
and pull the cycle through and then it

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.710 
and pull the cycle through and then it
will<00:03:18.890> change<00:03:19.190> between<00:03:19.730> these<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.480> fairly

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
will change between these so it's fairly

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.530 
will change between these so it's fairly
simple<00:03:21.019> how<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.890> works<00:03:22.130> but<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:23.120> wanted<00:03:23.420> to

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
simple how that works but I wanted to

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.140 
simple how that works but I wanted to
get<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.750> concept<00:03:24.079> down<00:03:24.260> there<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.640> let<00:03:26.090> me

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
get the concept down there so let me

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.680 
get the concept down there so let me
know<00:03:26.239> what<00:03:26.359> you<00:03:26.420> think<00:03:27.579> revise<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.329> change

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
know what you think revise it to change

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.539 
know what you think revise it to change
it<00:03:29.900> whatever<00:03:30.230> however<00:03:30.799> you<00:03:30.980> whatever<00:03:31.459> you

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
it whatever however you whatever you

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.060 
it whatever however you whatever you
think<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.989> let<00:03:33.140> me<00:03:33.170> know<00:03:33.350> what<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.590> think<00:03:33.769> I

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
think but let me know what you think I

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.580 
think but let me know what you think I
think<00:03:34.370> it's<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.609> pretty<00:03:34.790> pretty<00:03:35.299> cool<00:03:36.170> thing

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
think it's a pretty pretty cool thing

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.590 
think it's a pretty pretty cool thing
and<00:03:36.829> there's<00:03:37.609> a<00:03:37.700> lot<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:37.910> can<00:03:38.150> be<00:03:38.209> done<00:03:38.299> with

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
and there's a lot that can be done with

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.690 
and there's a lot that can be done with
it<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.019> yeah<00:03:39.950> let<00:03:40.190> me<00:03:40.250> know<00:03:40.280> what<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.519> think
