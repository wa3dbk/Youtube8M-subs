the<00:00:39.750> stats<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> also<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.360> exactly<00:00:42.360> when

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the stats this is also just exactly when

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.729 
the stats this is also just exactly when
the<00:00:42.690> game<00:00:42.840> came<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.470> there's<00:00:43.620> any

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the game came out so if there's any

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:53.299 
the game came out so if there's any
patches<00:00:44.220> or<00:00:44.520> anything<00:00:44.580> like<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:52.070> here<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.129> go

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
patches or anything like that here we go

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.360 
patches or anything like that here we go
overall<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.750> 83<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.830> a<00:00:55.860> rookie<00:00:56.250> that's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
overall and 83 for a rookie that's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.579 
overall and 83 for a rookie that's
pretty<00:00:56.699> good<00:00:56.909> but<00:00:57.269> I<00:00:57.600> still<00:00:58.199> think<00:00:58.409> it<00:00:58.470> should

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
pretty good but I still think it should

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.299 
pretty good but I still think it should
be<00:00:58.710> higher<00:00:58.890> than<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.550> honest

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
be higher than that to be honest

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
be higher than that to be honest
his<00:01:02.309> speed<00:01:02.670> 93<00:01:03.540> I<00:01:03.720> think<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.320> pretty

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
his speed 93 I think that's pretty

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.070 
his speed 93 I think that's pretty
decent<00:01:04.800> he<00:01:05.760> may<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.030> faster<00:01:06.600> than<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:06.780> they

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
decent he may be faster than that they

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
decent he may be faster than that they
may<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> changed<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.890> strength<00:01:08.729> doesn't

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
may have changed it strength doesn't

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
may have changed it strength doesn't
really<00:01:09.120> matter<00:01:09.330> Jilly<00:01:09.720> 96<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:10.620> you<00:01:10.710> go

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
really matter Jilly 96 there you go

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
really matter Jilly 96 there you go
that's<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.150> good<00:01:12.330> stat<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.720> have

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's a pretty good stat to have

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.530 
that's a pretty good stat to have
acceleration<00:01:13.500> 90<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.240> wide

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
acceleration 90 that's like wide

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560 
acceleration 90 that's like wide
receivers<00:01:17.120> capabilities<00:01:18.120> right<00:01:18.330> there

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
receivers capabilities right there

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
receivers capabilities right there
awareness<00:01:19.320> that's<00:01:19.890> kind<00:01:20.190> of<00:01:20.280> low<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> guess

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
awareness that's kind of low I guess

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:32.690 
awareness that's kind of low I guess
because<00:01:30.619> we<00:01:31.619> breaking<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.039> lot<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.219> tackles

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because we breaking a lot of tackles

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.120 
because we breaking a lot of tackles
that<00:01:32.789> video<00:01:33.270> later

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.840 

these<00:01:43.130> are<00:01:43.280> all<00:01:43.430> things<00:01:43.729> very<00:01:45.700> she'll<00:01:46.700> be

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
these are all things very she'll be

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.370 
these are all things very she'll be
pretty<00:01:47.060> good<00:01:47.180> out<00:01:47.329> of<00:01:47.360> catching<00:01:47.810> on<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.200> White

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
pretty good out of catching on the White

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.539 
pretty good out of catching on the White
House<00:01:48.590> fall<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:51.219> feel<00:01:52.219> like<00:01:52.369> there's

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
House fall but feel like there's

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:06.069 
House fall but feel like there's
actually<00:01:59.679> 95<00:02:01.810> 94<00:02:02.979> 95<00:02:03.979> some<00:02:04.250> power<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:05.079> sticks

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
actually 95 94 95 some power that sticks

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.690 
actually 95 94 95 some power that sticks
out<00:02:06.259> pretty<00:02:06.500> good<00:02:08.349> accuracy<00:02:09.429> it's<00:02:10.429> gonna<00:02:10.519> be

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
out pretty good accuracy it's gonna be

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.570 
out pretty good accuracy it's gonna be
in<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.970> 80s<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.890> 94<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.069> know<00:02:13.190> different

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
in the 80s and 94 you know different

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.440 
in the 80s and 94 you know different
ranges<00:02:13.880> but<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:16.819> definitely<00:02:16.970> seems<00:02:17.390> a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
ranges but it's definitely seems a

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
ranges but it's definitely seems a
little<00:02:17.540> bit<00:02:17.750> better<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.500> game<00:02:18.739> when<00:02:19.250> it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
little bit better in the game when it's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.190 
little bit better in the game when it's
actually<00:02:19.700> going<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.060> one<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.239> feel<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:20.540> these

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
actually going the one I feel like these

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.710 
actually going the one I feel like these
stats<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.829> kind<00:02:22.069> of<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.390> what<00:02:23.630> he

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
stats just kind of on what he

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.539 
stats just kind of on what he
actually<00:02:23.959> really<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> game<00:02:25.220> you'll

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
actually really is in the game you'll

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.620 
actually really is in the game you'll
see<00:02:25.610> some<00:02:25.880> videos<00:02:26.239> later<00:02:26.890> running<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.980> ball

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
see some videos later running the ball

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.449 
see some videos later running the ball
run<00:02:30.730> 93<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:32.470> mean<00:02:33.470> he's<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> rookie<00:02:33.890> but<00:02:34.220> look<00:02:34.340> at

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
run 93 I mean he's a rookie but look at

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.699 
run 93 I mean he's a rookie but look at
these<00:02:34.549> stats<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.239> still<00:02:36.049> feel<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.290> some<00:02:36.650> of

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
these stats I still feel like some of

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.610 
these stats I still feel like some of
these<00:02:36.799> should<00:02:37.010> be<00:02:37.099> higher<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:38.440> I'm<00:02:39.440> sure

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
these should be higher but I'm sure

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.440 
these should be higher but I'm sure
there<00:02:39.829> may<00:02:39.950> be<00:02:39.980> patches<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:40.700> come<00:02:40.880> out<00:02:43.450> next

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
there may be patches that come out next

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.330 
there may be patches that come out next
next<00:02:45.410> year<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.709> definitely<00:02:46.100> looking<00:02:46.160> better

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
next year is definitely looking better

00:02:46.340 --> 00:03:04.890 
next year is definitely looking better
stats<00:02:46.880> telling<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:51.019> what<00:02:51.170> else

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900
