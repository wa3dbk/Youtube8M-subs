 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:11.733
 and welcome movie I will describe the situation when a person lost his Polish driving license for alcohol, our Polish beloved driving license, 

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:21.600
 but she did not make the required medical and psychological examinations and then she went abroad to an EU country. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.800
 There she made a non-Polish law from scratch and this person now wants to come back to Poland. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.067
 And will it be possible to exchange this foreign document for our beloved Polish back? 

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:46.167
 Internaut's question: "My driving license situation - in 2007 I was driving a Fiat 126p and I was stopped 

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:54.567
 to traffic control and the consequence was to retain the driving license based on the state of drunk 1.16 per mille. 

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:59.733
 Of course, a 24-hour court and a 3-year ban on moving vehicles. 

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:10.267
 I had a driving license for category B, C, C + E until then I was the driver of a truck driver for about 5 years. 

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:17.100
 Of course, when I lost my driving license, I lost my job and did not see any prospects for life, I went abroad. 

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:23.500
 There, I took a job on a construction site, and in order to develop in a new environment, I had to do this driving license again 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.567
 and in 2008 I passed the exam for category B, then in 2010 I acquired the rights for C, in the current year I passed on the C + E, 

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:33.700
 or trailers. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.500
 So today I have a European Union driving license for category A, B, C and C + E. 

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:47.470
 I still work abroad, but recently I started thinking back to my country. 

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.600
 And here my doubts appeared. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.570
 Is it possible to exchange this driving license for this Polish document? 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.270
 One of the problems is that I did not do the required psychotestes and medical examinations about which I was obliged to do 

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:08.370
 already for 2007. 

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:15.400
 But at that time I was abroad, 3 months earlier I made standard psychotestes for a professional driver 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.400
 which are theoretically valid until the end of 2011. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.770
 So, I am asking for an opinion from you, thank you in advance, greetings. " 

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:35.870
 An interesting situation, although I have already met her several times and answered these doubts of the Lord. 

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:44.630
 Unfortunately, our system of central registration of drivers is already so tight that without performing backlog research 

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:52.300
 you do not have any chance for a Polish driving license. 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:01.070
 You are so fortunate that at that time there was no exchange of information between the department of transport of this country 

00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:06.630
 and the Polish department of communication - somehow you have done it right to all categories. 

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:18.530
 What to do - I would rather discourage disclosure of this driving license here, but I would suggest doing some outstanding research because it has passed 

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:26.270
 One year is yet to prepare for state exams for all exams for all categories 

00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:33.370
 in the provincial traffic center, which is of course with an additional cost and it is not so easy to walk through 

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:35.830
 even professional drivers. 

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:45.670
 So here are even a few hours of extra rides in a decent driving school with emphasis typically on the WORD state exam. 

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:48.400
 Surely you will not hurt ... 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:58.530
 Well, if you had a similar problem with your beloved Polish driving license and then foreign ones, 

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:06.470
 I can only invite you here for comments on my blog www.psychotestykierowcow.pl. 

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:15.670
 By the way, you may also be interested in using my psychotesting workshop for drivers in Wrocław 

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:21.970
 at ul. Kmicica 3, tel. 601 775 123. 

00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:30.970
 I am afraid of address: Wrocław 54-514 ul. Kmicica 3, tel. 601 775 123. 

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:34.230
 I also test drivers for alcohol there. 

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:39.030
 Your Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław spoke. 

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:50.900
 I can only say one thing: "the system is not rash but fair", let's be nice, too, because for driving a Fiat 126p 

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:58.400
 the invention of communism, it is really a shame on this EU document. 

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.600
 Your Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław once again spoke.
