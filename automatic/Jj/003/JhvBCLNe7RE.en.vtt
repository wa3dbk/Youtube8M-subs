00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello friends, classmates 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.730
 I will show you the order today. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.730
 my mini paint spray gun 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.080
 the meeting request will show that 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:42.230
 my little school is a GM without the okay romi 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:48.239
 is coconut of 125 ml beak of 1.0 she has 1.8 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 sorry it has to 01 08 to 1,011 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.860
 my 1.0 she has some adjustments ok 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 Here's range of control here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.370
 flow control and here below it is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.870
 something unusual in these pistols 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.950
 simpler 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.830
 she has an airflow control 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 Okay, so we have three controls on it. 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.320
 which would be fan flow and airflow 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.759
 Okay, she works with low pressures. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 between 20 and 30 ps is that the streak is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.500
 here is because her trigger is square 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.319
 and he hurts my finger so I rolled 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.380
 a piece of inner tube rubber 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.209
 here to be able to solve is the only thing 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.369
 I do not like this story. 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.670
 trigger it could be a little bit 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.110
 the bigger he and his cancer hurts I go 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.970
 put some of the water in my 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.649
 We are going to do some tests in the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.700
 demonstrate everything in the test to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.099
 you 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.319
 so come on, I'll put it on. 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:57.209
 take the test or show it to you 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:02.520
 she comes this little box and accompanies two 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:07.050
 filters of this here that are to avoid 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 waste to practice then 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.650
 put this filter here 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:16.500
 he will sift is its ink that 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.180
 talk is that the needle is made of stainless steel 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.170
 What's cool is you can work with 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.610
 a right water-based continuum 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.420
 now I'm going to put some of the water in it 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.160
 and we are going to wait if it was 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.280
 front you can apply some water and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.280
 v 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:43.140
 now I will open flight will open up the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.260
 air flow then there 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.640
 the lec is wide open she was 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.640
 in the middle of the camera 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.019
 now with the fully enclosed fan 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.909
 then he would have to take control now of 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.370
 air flow to this oppression for this 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.919
 type of action 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.620
 so whenever you touch a 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:19.159
 regulation you have to move the eleven 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.159
 then it will open a little more here 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.709
 volume 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.819
 I'll put the fan fully open 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.280
 for you to see and I will open all 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.950
 my reason my whole daily reason 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.950
 here to walk with the camera 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.030
 as you can see in relation to this 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.599
 here fan 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's already a lot bigger look, but that's it. 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.519
 I need to get in the three settings 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.430
 and not touch the pressure and still have a 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.560
 fourth regulation that would be pressure but 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.870
 in summary about the pistol let's conclude 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.769
 the pistol then a pistol that costs 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.400
 for about 1 100 reais 100 130 reais 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.489
 she is not av lp she has a consumption 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.579
 low air is ideal for those who have 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.000
 small compressors with low 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:22.500
 air production is not recommended for 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.599
 Big pieces would be a table of up to 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.349
 one meter I think it's cool to paint with 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.570
 she 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.240
 from there starts to get 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.919
 complicated for those who are 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.009
 there starting out why not make parts 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.889
 this fan facility and 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.690
 all the adjustments are very legal, it's a 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.630
 reliable person thus far 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.289
 working with her for a year and a half 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.839
 two and 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.409
 understanding very well, okay, so it is 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.669
 that 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.229
 A hug, I hope you all 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.569
 If you liked any doubt, you 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.279
 ask and then not in the comments 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.279
 until the next hug video
