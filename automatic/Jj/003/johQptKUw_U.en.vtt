00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.219
 For many years, the company has been narrow 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.280
 specialization and it has become a tradition 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.320
 crash tests for baby car seats 1 share in 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.210
 during 2012 thirty-three models 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 baby car seats have been studied on 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 subject of security ease in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.320
 operation 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 ergonomic and harmful content 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 substances for each child can 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.740
 pick a good baby car seat then 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 there are parents regardless 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.880
 can find suitable car seats 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.770
 among the rich assortment we have 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.580
 several certificates confirming 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.020
 security 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.170
 we also have some results 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 tests demonstrated 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 unsatisfactory quality of some 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.770
 models 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.719
 particularly pleased that no child 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.149
 car seat this time did not fail 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.980
 test for the presence of harmful substances to 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.000
 Unfortunately, very often users 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.309
 mounting car seats 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 make a lot of mistakes in case of an accident 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.559
 will lead to the obvious sad 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.809
 the consequences 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 very often such an error occurs when 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.329
 installation of the cradle for transportation of chest 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.429
 children in the car 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.920
 seat belts for shoulders and belt 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.420
 confused among themselves and fastened the opposite of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.580
 for this it turns out that the lap belt 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.009
 security is conducted over those sites 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.840
 cradles where the babyâ€™s feet are if 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.890
 the cradle has so-called fasteners 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.780
 isofix points 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.880
 this such danger will not happen in 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.170
 next crash test one cradle we 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 fix on isofix 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.430
 and the other on confused among themselves and 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.960
 the strap during slow motion is clearly visible 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.250
 that wrongly fixed cradle 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.409
 becomes ductile 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 a toy under the influence of inertia forces 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.090
 isofix child car seat 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.890
 very firmly she steadily holds 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.869
 baby seat belts 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.090
 besides this cradle is very simple 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 unfasten from the base isofix attachment and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 shoot it can not be wrong when 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.890
 assembling a baby cradle is just 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.170
 excluded 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.149
 shoulder and lap belts between each other 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.070
 confusing is not possible a 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.290
 baby cradle can not be fixed 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.990
 the wrong direction is very 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.909
 reliable model in group 0 plus for 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.100

 kilograms from 1 to 4 years old 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.320
 Saibeks juno fix model 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.320
 showed good results 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.950
 group 123 for children weighing 9 36 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.920

 age from 1 to 12 years kitty model 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.190
 guardian fix pro got 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.190
 unsatisfactory rating group 23 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.160
 for children weighing 15 36 kilograms per 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.020
 age 4 12 years model maxi-cosi rodi 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.820
 fix got a good mark along with 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.410
 easy baskets inflate and was in this group 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.540
 were rejected with a rating 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.070
 unsatisfactory two other models 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.630
 mainly due to the presence 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.050
 unacceptable in side impacts the same 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:08.390
 picture of the model graco junior maxi 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:10.700
 unsatisfactory also for models 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.380
 gaiter logic l crash test showed me 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.360
 satisfactory car seat results 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.670
 for older children not necessarily 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.190
 must have backs so we test 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.140
 designs with removable backs but they 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.680
 cannot provide protection when side 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.510
 blows 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.660
 so the results are unsatisfactory 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.850
 and in the future 1c 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.709
 thanks to crash tests will not only increase 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.510
 safe transportation of children but also 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.190
 make it easier for parents to choose flour when 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.410
 buying car seats 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.420
 our motive is the opportunity 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.400
 make baby car seats more 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.080
 safe in side collisions 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.600
 chairs for older children 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.100
 must be equipped with side protection in that 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.840
 number and head level 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.030
 In addition, it is important for us to 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.720
 content of harmful substances in children 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.760
 car seats 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.390
 was minimal and every year 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.390
 decreased
