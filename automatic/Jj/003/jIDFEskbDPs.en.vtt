00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.250
 galaxytab 10.1 is the tablet that came 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.920
 to compete with the iPad 2 lighter 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.630
 the thinner it really surprises but 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.500
 Can he overcome the gadget? 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960
 apple 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.359
 check our analysis find out which 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.340
 are your good points and know where the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.340
 samsung tablet still needs improvement 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.570
 the difference is almost imperceptible but 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.640
 the galaxy tab 10.1 still manages to be 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.129
 thinner than ipad 2 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
 this is a great feat of samsung that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.480
 achieved an ultra thin thickness without 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 sacrificing performance at the time of use to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 battery is one of the best 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.110
 of the category reaching almost 10 hours 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.210
 use with wifi on 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.879
 another feature that surpasses the tablet 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 apple is the weight with a few grams of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 any less 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.289
 the galaxy tab 10.1 is lighter than the ipad 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.019
 2 are 565 grams of the Samsung gadget 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.460
 against 601 adopted apple 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.860
 one of the factors contributing to this 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 change is the plastic rear that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.760
 It may be even less resistant than 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.729
 ipad but offers the same 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.560
 economic comfort on the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.060
 speakers that performs 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.640
 satisfactory 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.830
 the maximum volume but not enough 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.930
 Expect nothing too extraordinary to 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 advantage is the position in which it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.280
 find what holds the tablet 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 with both hands without obstructing the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.130
 sound 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 the screen is quite sharp has color 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 alive and maintains good visibility 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.549
 even with a wider viewing angle 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.810
 inclined touchscreen response is 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.299
 excellent being virtually instantaneous 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.610
 galaxy processor tab 10.1 allied to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.770
 1gb RAM works the way 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.799
 satisfactory experience to maintain a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.390
 of pleasant and natural use the execution of 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 games is quiet for the most part 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.719
 time for games that require 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.180
 plus the tablet 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.680
 even with multiple applications open 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.439
 gadget features a performance 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.259
 able to compete with others 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.560
 tablets with android the galaxy tab 10.1 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.930
 brings the version 3.1 of the android being a 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.270
 a surprising new experience 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.400
 use one 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.350
 it with google 's operating system is 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.780
 incredibly easy to adapt to your 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.880
 use and everything is very intuitive 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.860
 the lack of physical buttons is not a problem 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.680
 here as a bar at the bottom 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.630
 the screen has everything you need 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.760
 he is also the area of 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.250
 notifications and a 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.170
 connections or practical fast access to 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.470
 settings of the device and the last 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.000
 download by clicking on the middle setinha is 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.790
 open the task manager 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.990
 and some basic items like the calendar 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.540
 and calculator 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.010
 version 3.1 of the android was a 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.290
 improvement that seems of little importance 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.930
 but it's very interesting and promises 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.850
 enough for the future is now possible 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.080
 resize the videos 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.750
 quickly 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.370
 not all have this function even more 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.270
 is something that developers can 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.270
 use in your favor 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.480
 it was not this time that the tablet succeeded 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.160
 surprise at the camera 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.320
 although it is better than the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.970
 ipad that does not mean that the photos 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.920
 are really good 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.740
 the video mode is also not surprising 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.480
 it can record everything in 720p 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.220
 but this is no guarantee that the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.660
 images look something like 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.050
 filmed in HD 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.790
 for being so thin the galaxy tab 10.1 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.440
 had to sacrifice the expected slot for 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.570
 micro sd cards 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.580
 the only existing entries are 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.270
 connector for power and transfer of 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.460
 data 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.040
 the headphone plug and a space 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.950
 Yes if you are going to use the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.230
 galaxy tab 10.1 and have as computer 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.280
 main a machine with windows can 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.260
 stay calm 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.930
 but one of the biggest negatives 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.940
 of this tablet is his inability to 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.580
 connect natively to the mec 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.320
 android version 3.1 now requires a 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.910
 proprietary software installed on the 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.890
 computer to connect 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.100
 something exceeded in the days of 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.100

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.020
 who is looking for an android tablet that 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.840
 can really compete with the ipad 2

 will find on the galaxy tab 10.1 a 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.820
 great samsung device on align

 hardware software you can not leave 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.700
 little to be desired in relation to the tablet 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.680
 apple 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.490
 prices vary somewhat according to 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.130
 the operator 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.000
 however it is generally cheaper than 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.830
 ipad 2 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.990
 there are cheaper android tablet 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.210
 than this one but for those looking for a 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.330
