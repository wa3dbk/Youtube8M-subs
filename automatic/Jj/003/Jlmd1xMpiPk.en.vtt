00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 I'm going to make a very different blog today 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.610
 when you listen next 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.230
 Ariana she promised she was going to take me to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.480
 Pauline pleasure 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 I was going to spend 200 reais that I was going to change 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
 my wardrobe 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 I talked about Victor so now we 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
 Are you going to do this? I'm going to need controversy. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.640
 Mariani spend 200 reais which is what I 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.769
 I have, however, taking more to not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 correct the table and let's see if I can 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.059
 can do this feat digibrás epa 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.870
 I have to make a locution though 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:47.879
 do not eat the ground I'll burn it could 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:51.719
 here it's okay, I said, can you say hello? 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.730
 today we never know what they like and the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.780
 who does not like to record here that I know 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.219
 that in our sea 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.219
 she has a lot of choice 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.860
 yesterday you see when you arrive at 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.490
 producer and then came to the son if he 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.900
 you have 1,500 reais to receive and the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.900
 middle of medical mail 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.250
 the clothes have to get home full 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 so people have a big difference 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.840
 between locution and brazil things 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 completely different 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.240
 is the option is to 56 in the text so the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.470
 We have to speak normally has a 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.619
 background music 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 here at our producer hi well 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.070
 and there the dilma this producer they make the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.660
 background music usually 90% have 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.369
 music that helps a lot gives an option 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.649
 also because even the climate in option 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.490
 also cool because nothing like that is good 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.820
 funny 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.950
 In dubbing you have the television that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.320
 come to fate you have text 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.720
 but you have to watch the scene watch the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.899
 details what you think I put the actor does 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.950
 in these operations the words he gives 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.330
 aecid the text 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 there look selection check the text fit 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.250
 The mouth you learn to drive if you go. 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.770
 change the march a march has to think 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.049
 I 'm still in the stage of dubbing a 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.049
 I'll do this automatically, but 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.970
 It's still okay, I'll take it and 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.280
 stepping on the clutch now has to change 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.060
 march this one is a film I've ever 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.880
 I actually did around sites and that in the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.519
 Truth now has a few more things 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.500
 I will not have to record just a few things 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.959
 more to put a movie that is already 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.310
 at the height of the country, you still have 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:49.739
 Watch redox themos fun that helps 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.930

 leaving I just warned yane that I am 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.090
 gone out 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.390
 she kept waiting for me cursing me 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.580
 now located the area is 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.730
 and then we'll learn the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.260

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.420
 of the subway that I will add to it 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.190
 I think she's still loose because she 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.640
 it's also over 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.160
 so our beautiful chose the people 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.810
 because that I chose the wrong output she 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.570
 picks up and yellow with the line had 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.510
 Who does not get there, I got it wrong. 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.910
