00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.759
 A) Yes 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.289
 unless all playmates 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.619
 well-known friends friends in general 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.570
 good channel happy new year 2013 I do not 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.609
 I had taken the time to congratulate you 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.800
 personally and the truth what I 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.199
 I imagined one day is that I could 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.510
 say in front of a micro and that people 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.089
 I will hear these words and good 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.370
 It seems a long time ago that came 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.229
 wanting to make a video like this one 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.420
 this style that is not part of a 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.699
 series or of a particular game and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.759
 just be to tell you some 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.280
 things, although that does make us bored 

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:56.290
 and I leave this item to accrue from 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.879
 background part of which I draw 30 and a 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.559
 death said no but I'm going to make a 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.890
 collection of the deaths was in this 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.420
 in these good Christmas this will not 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.030
 be the Christmas video of the king is worth 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.009
 no I do not want I do not want to put now 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.040
 here everything is not perfect I live all 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.689
 Christmas milk wanted to comment 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.340
 a couple of little things you 're thinking about 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.170
 do that I came from long ago wanting 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.979
 to do the same instead of telling a 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 video that is bland 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.610
 so how good are we going to talk about 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.620
 them a little 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.740
 well first what they thought to do has been 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.480
 create a chat room in the same game 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.640
 which is called nahuel gaming because 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.640
 some of you told me that's why 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.760
 that he wants to play and I think the idea 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.430
 it was best to create a meeting point 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.170
 where we can all meet there will be people 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.729
 who wants to play games that do not 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.260
 find people to play with and I think 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.940
 which is a good idea so that we 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.800
 we could unite everything apart from me when 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.870
 Record a video if people miss it 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.090
 I 'll look for people out there I'll know who 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.610
 want to play someone not common not to 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.259
 this room, as you can see here, click on 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.750
 the bottom part on the right in this 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.479
 little button you write nawal gaming you dais 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.509
 to the button and be in there so simple 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.400
 how that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.280
 another thing that I had so many 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.129
 wanting to make guys was the draw for 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.829
 a skin from long ago in one 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.650
 of the videos from a few months ago 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:27.120
 I said I wanted to do one but 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.430
 for reasons beyond my control I could not do it 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.620
 I was able to do river did not allow to draw a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.900
 corner that had good allowed us 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.069
 the skin raffle because to give it to 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.079
 the only thing he could do is give a 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.939
 award code and did not have any of 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.890
 those codes he asked for somebody's river but 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.930
 he gave me none so now he wins the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.280
 possibility thanks to the gift this 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.290
 Christmas, what are we going to do now? 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.940
 What do you have to do to draw for 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.650
 participate in the draw this is very 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.500

 the essence of what this has to be 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.730

 my experience tells me that all these 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.699
 things already happen from these comments 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.500
 because to those already known who returns 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.060

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.180
