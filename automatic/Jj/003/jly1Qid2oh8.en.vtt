there's<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.720> lot<00:05:13.870> of<00:05:13.960> problem<00:05:14.230> with<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.820> flying

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
there's a lot of problem with it flying

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.580 
there's a lot of problem with it flying
everywhere<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:16.660> was<00:05:16.810> like<00:05:16.960> screw<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.530> I'm

everywhere so I was like screw it I'm
gonna<00:05:17.740> put<00:05:18.010> it<00:05:18.250> together<00:05:18.400> so<00:05:19.380> that's<00:05:21.270> pretty

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
gonna put it together so that's pretty

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.010 
gonna put it together so that's pretty
much<00:05:22.360> it

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
much it

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.420

oh wait let me take this thing out me
springing<00:05:27.880> out<00:05:27.940> need<00:05:28.510> a<00:05:28.540> smaller<00:05:28.900> pen

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
springing out need a smaller pen

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.510 
springing out need a smaller pen
actually

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.589 

so<00:05:31.699> do<00:05:31.819> you<00:05:31.910> just<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:34.400> little<00:05:34.789> tin<00:05:35.090> thing<00:05:35.419> out

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
so do you just this little tin thing out

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.869 
so do you just this little tin thing out
and<00:05:38.169> yeah<00:05:39.199> there<00:05:39.530> we<00:05:39.620> go<00:05:39.770> there's<00:05:40.759> the

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
and yeah there we go there's the

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.730 
and yeah there we go there's the
mainspring<00:05:42.129> there's<00:05:43.129> a<00:05:43.190> little<00:05:43.430> two<00:05:44.060> guides

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
mainspring there's a little two guides

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.040 
mainspring there's a little two guides
so<00:05:45.740> there<00:05:46.090> that's<00:05:47.090> pretty<00:05:47.240> much<00:05:47.449> it<00:05:47.780> other
