00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.589
 and in this video I show you how to correctly 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:13.860
 in the winter to start the car of special growth and 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:16.020
 so squeeze the clutch thinks nothing 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.390
 before plant when squeeze the clutch for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.580
 what does this need other words and we 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.130
 we release the engine but how about if we donâ€™t 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 squeeze the clutch then we have the engine 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.949
 the starter turns both the engine and the box 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.530
 transmissions thus it seems to be the most well 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.410
 difficult yes in the winter everything freezes there and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.020
 starter sometimes if you are dead 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 the battery can not crank all the cases 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.860
 the question will not lead so that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.550
 make it easier for the battery like that 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.350
 action so push the entry 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.120
 turn the key 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.379
 all time to this wealth of panties here 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.010
 whether they go out 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.460
 because they go out when charging and 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.049
 we start to wind the elders up to those 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 until the car starts in the cold you 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.920
 understand the engine will be hard 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.810
 wind up here we are now with me 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.259
 car warmed up on 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.270
 so you will be overpriced momentum 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.770
 somewhere here so here he is also left vase 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.350
 somewhere 1200 will be yes here and warm cars 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 until the arrow and fall from me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.090
 but just below the unit will be thousands 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.420
 turns the prince is already possible on the sly 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.540
 drive to or arrow temperature 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.189
 rises then you can even their session 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.210
 passively sheet this video was 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:47.850
 useful yes even in severe frosts and even 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.119
 recommended before starting up 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.500
 turn on some electrical appliance either here 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.250
 so blink 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.710
 and the farthest seconds by five thereby we 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.020
 as if 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.490
 we bring the battery in working condition 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.840
 it warms up and it seems to improve 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.840
 launch in hard frost
