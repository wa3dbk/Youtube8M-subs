00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
system is the battery backup year and a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
system is the battery backup year and a
half<00:00:59.070> ago<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.519> so<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> Neptune's<00:01:00.900> I

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
had three of them and the power would go

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.900 
had three of them and the power would go
out<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.890> were<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.280> piece<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> crap

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
out and they were just a piece of crap

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.590 
out and they were just a piece of crap
to<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:06.899> them<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.200> read<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.710> reset<00:01:08.280> them<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.300> we

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to get them to read to reset them so we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.570 
to get them to read to reset them so we
don't<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.960> those<00:01:10.140> anymore<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> reef

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
don't do those anymore we're on the reef

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
don't do those anymore we're on the reef
keeper<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.780> power<00:01:13.020> goes<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.440> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
keeper when the power goes out the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
starting up and I thought I was going to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.270 
starting up and I thought I was going to
lose<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> while<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.899> back<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:23.190> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
lose it for a while but it's back and I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
want to go down under the sump where I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.210 
want to go down under the sump where I
have<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.270> electronics<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:31.160> show<00:01:32.160> you

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.809 
keeper parts I'll do this a little
farther<00:01:37.410> back<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.069> we<00:01:38.160> don't<00:01:38.310> hear<00:01:38.459> so<00:01:38.670> much

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
farther back so we don't hear so much

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:39.609 
farther back so we don't hear so much
noise

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
noise

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:47.660 
noise
I've<00:01:40.619> got<00:01:42.830> three<00:01:43.830> PC<00:01:44.280> force<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:45.330> SL<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
I've got three PC force an SL one and a

I've got three PC force an SL one and a
net<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.179> used<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:48.660> have<00:01:48.840> an<00:01:48.959> mlc<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.739> it<00:01:49.860> seemed

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
net I used to have an mlc but it seemed

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.040 
net I used to have an mlc but it seemed
kind<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.429> cartoonish<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.149> me<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> got<00:01:51.810> rid<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
kind of cartoonish to me so I got rid of

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.440 
kind of cartoonish to me so I got rid of
that<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:55.220> will<00:01:56.220> just<00:01:56.429> start<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.179> right-hand

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
that I will just start on the right-hand

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.880 
that I will just start on the right-hand
side<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:59.069> on<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> back<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.849> the<00:01:59.910> aquarium

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
side here up on the back of the aquarium
and<00:02:02.070> we'll<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.640> zoom<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.720> can<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:04.020> away

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and we'll just zoom in we can get away

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.440 
and we'll just zoom in we can get away
from<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.470> light<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.070> I've<00:02:05.340> got<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.580> PC<00:02:06.150> for

lights on you see there on your left as

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.100 
lights on you see there on your left as
the<00:02:27.390> return<00:02:27.780> bomb<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:29.580> left<00:02:30.210> vortex<00:02:30.810> right

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the return bomb the left vortex right

the return bomb the left vortex right
Vortech<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.310> left<00:02:32.550> radion<00:02:33.150> plugged<00:02:33.600> into

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
Vortech and the left radion plugged into

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.550 
Vortech and the left radion plugged into
it<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.820> then<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.450> look<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:37.080> closely

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it and then if you look really closely

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.240 
it and then if you look really closely
back<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:39.750> how<00:02:39.870> close<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.800> get<00:02:40.950> as

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
back there see how close I can get as

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.160 
back there see how close I can get as
the<00:02:41.430> sl1

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
the sl1

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.140 
the sl1
and<00:02:45.020> that's<00:02:46.020> got<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.620> pH<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.520> tenth<00:02:47.820> probes

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
and that's got the pH and tenth probes

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.240 
and that's got the pH and tenth probes
in<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.510> I've<00:02:48.630> taken<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.080> switch<00:02:49.380> out<00:02:49.680> with

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
in it I've taken the switch out with

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.040 
in it I've taken the switch out with
this<00:02:50.459> bigger<00:02:50.790> skimmer<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.300> don't<00:02:51.570> think<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:51.990> need

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
this bigger skimmer I don't think I need

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.170 
this bigger skimmer I don't think I need
the<00:02:52.260> float<00:02:52.470> switch<00:02:52.500> anymore<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.820> I've<00:02:53.940> taken

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the float switch anymore so I've taken

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.060 
the float switch anymore so I've taken
that<00:02:54.330> out<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:56.480> if<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:57.690> head<00:02:57.930> over<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.530> left

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
that out and if we head over to the left

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.130 
that out and if we head over to the left
a<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.310> more<00:02:59.610> I've<00:03:00.000> got<00:03:00.150> another<00:03:00.420> PC<00:03:00.930> 4

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
I'll put 2 600 watt heaters in coming up

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.300 
I'll put 2 600 watt heaters in coming up
here<00:03:15.540> soon<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.019> have<00:03:16.590> them<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:16.890> haven't

done it yet and then I have the map

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.760 
done it yet and then I have the map
module<00:03:20.420> hidden<00:03:21.420> back<00:03:21.600> there

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.790 

and<00:03:24.849> it<00:03:25.849> works<00:03:26.090> great<00:03:26.290> never<00:03:27.290> had<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.530> problem

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
and it works great never had a problem

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.759 
and it works great never had a problem
with<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.190> works<00:03:28.400> awesome<00:03:28.610> compared<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
with it works awesome compared to the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.949 
with it works awesome compared to the
net<00:03:30.769> dude<00:03:31.720> never<00:03:32.720> fails<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:34.269> how<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.300> use<00:03:35.690> that

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
net dude never fails and how I use that

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.339 
net dude never fails and how I use that
wirelessly<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.459> have<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.760> connected<00:03:38.720> to

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
wirelessly is I have it connected to

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.740 
wirelessly is I have it connected to
this<00:03:40.340> net<00:03:40.670> here<00:03:41.980> Wi-Fi<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:44.000> was<00:03:44.120> about<00:03:44.269> fifty

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
this net here Wi-Fi it was about fifty

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.430 
this net here Wi-Fi it was about fifty
bucks<00:03:44.959> for<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.590> unit<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.239> have<00:03:47.269> it<00:03:47.660> wired

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
bucks for that unit and I have it wired

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.289 
bucks for that unit and I have it wired
into<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:49.130> can<00:03:49.160> see<00:03:49.370> all<00:03:49.519> three<00:03:49.819> lamps<00:03:50.150> or

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
into that you can see all three lamps or

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.589 
into that you can see all three lamps or
live<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.310> will<00:03:52.459> be<00:03:52.549> Reaper<00:03:53.120> number<00:03:53.420> one

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
live so this will be Reaper number one

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.990 
live so this will be Reaper number one
I'll<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.170> three<00:03:54.650> I'll<00:03:54.860> probably<00:03:55.129> I'll<00:03:55.370> do<00:03:55.790> this

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
I'll do three I'll probably I'll do this

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.440 
I'll do three I'll probably I'll do this
one<00:03:56.209> I'll<00:03:56.480> do<00:03:56.750> one<00:03:56.989> with<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.380> net<00:03:57.560> server<00:03:57.890> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
one I'll do one with the net server and

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.640 
one I'll do one with the net server and
then<00:03:59.450> I'll<00:03:59.630> do<00:03:59.840> one<00:03:59.870> with<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:02.079> I'll<00:04:03.079> do<00:04:03.380> one

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
then I'll do one with the I'll do one

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.979 
then I'll do one with the I'll do one
with<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.160> actual<00:04:04.670> software<00:04:05.000> connected<00:04:05.840> to

with the actual software connected to
the<00:04:06.170> reef<00:04:06.349> keeper<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.519> can<00:04:07.670> see<00:04:07.849> all<00:04:08.030> three

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
the reef keeper so you can see all three

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.949 
the reef keeper so you can see all three
but<00:04:09.380> that's<00:04:09.620> my<00:04:10.310> reef<00:04:10.880> keeper<00:04:11.120> system<00:04:11.720> here

but that's my reef keeper system here

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.420 
but that's my reef keeper system here
all<00:04:12.470> underneath<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:14.860> I've<00:04:15.860> got<00:04:16.100> everything

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
all underneath and I've got everything

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.430 
all underneath and I've got everything
in<00:04:17.030> control<00:04:18.669> from<00:04:19.669> those<00:04:20.479> parts<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.200> see

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
in control from those parts that you see

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.050 
in control from those parts that you see
anybody<00:04:22.100> who<00:04:22.250> touch<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.639> you<00:04:22.729> need<00:04:22.910> more

anybody who touch and you need more
parts<00:04:23.540> tell<00:04:23.990> them<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.200> get<00:04:24.290> lost<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:25.490> want<00:04:25.639> a

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
parts tell them to get lost you want a

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.610 
parts tell them to get lost you want a
moonlight<00:04:26.090> controller<00:04:26.450> that's<00:04:26.960> fine<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.169> used

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
moonlight controller that's fine I used

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.370 
moonlight controller that's fine I used
to<00:04:27.740> have<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.100> right<00:04:28.400> back<00:04:28.610> there<00:04:29.169> you<00:04:30.169> probably

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
to have it right back there you probably

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
to have it right back there you probably
still<00:04:30.680> see<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.039> screw<00:04:31.310> holes<00:04:31.550> enough<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:34.190> the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
still see the screw holes enough in the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.190 
still see the screw holes enough in the
back<00:04:34.580> but<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.660> only<00:04:35.810> thing<00:04:36.050> I'm<00:04:36.169> thinking

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
back but the only thing I'm thinking

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.290 
back but the only thing I'm thinking
about<00:04:36.740> doing<00:04:37.100> when<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.310> change<00:04:37.700> this<00:04:38.000> and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
about doing when I change this and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.850 
about doing when I change this and
that'll<00:04:38.690> be<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> perfect<00:04:39.229> spot<00:04:39.410> for<00:04:39.470> me<00:04:39.740> to

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
that'll be a perfect spot for me to

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.370 
that'll be a perfect spot for me to
mount<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.160> APC<00:04:40.789> is<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:42.169> install<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:44.200> get<00:04:45.200> rid
