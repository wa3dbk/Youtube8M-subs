00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
you actually get the credit you deserve
for<00:00:53.070> winning<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> number<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.789> races<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
for winning the number of races that you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.010 
for winning the number of races that you
have<00:00:54.600> done<00:00:55.489> honestly<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.780> get

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
have done honestly I think we all get

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.959 
have done honestly I think we all get
enough<00:00:58.260> credit<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.699> enough

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
enough credit you know there's enough

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.990 
enough credit you know there's enough
attention<00:01:00.590> but<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> think<00:01:01.949> there's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:02.850> more

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
attention but I think there's a lot more

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
attention but I think there's a lot more
people<00:01:03.180> behind<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.049> whole<00:01:04.229> project<00:01:04.470> which

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
people behind the whole project which

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.969 
people behind the whole project which
don't<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:06.000> credit<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.960> people<00:01:07.350> going

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
don't get credit you know people going

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
don't get credit you know people going
in<00:01:08.250> into<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> office<00:01:09.540> day<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.869> day<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
in into the office day in day out in the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
in into the office day in day out in the
factory<00:01:10.890> working<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.580> hard<00:01:11.820> coming<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.960> with

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
factory working very hard coming up with

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.740 
factory working very hard coming up with
very<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.619> clever<00:01:13.920> ideas<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:15.270> lead<00:01:15.479> into<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
very very clever ideas which lead into a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
very very clever ideas which lead into a
project<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.310> an

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
project and then you know into an

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
project and then you know into an
upgrade<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.630> don't<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
upgrade I think they don't get the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140 
upgrade I think they don't get the
credit<00:01:19.200> which<00:01:19.619> obviously<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.670> impossible

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
credit which obviously is impossible

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.570 
credit which obviously is impossible
because<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.450> can't<00:01:21.750> name<00:01:22.049> yeah<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:23.040> 500

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
because you can't name yeah going 500

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
because you can't name yeah going 500
people<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:25.290> interview<00:01:25.740> like

people you know in an interview like

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
people you know in an interview like
that<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> think<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:27.390> last<00:01:27.840> year

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049

Newey and not you but people might not
realize<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.150> Adrian<00:01:33.659> had<00:01:33.780> been<00:01:33.900> at<00:01:33.990> Red

any doubts or regrets over multi 21 in
that<00:02:10.200> case<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:11.250> regrets<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.120> way<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that case I think regrets in a way that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.050 
that case I think regrets in a way that
and<00:02:13.200> that's<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.740> regretted<00:02:14.340> after<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and that's what I regretted after the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
and that's what I regretted after the
race<00:02:16.160> mostly<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:18.319> didn't<00:02:19.319> obey<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
race mostly is that I didn't obey the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.290 
race mostly is that I didn't obey the
team<00:02:20.310> order

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
team order

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.960

of<00:04:22.090> us<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.690> know<00:04:22.720> plans<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.860> advance<00:04:23.949> because

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
of us you know plans in advance because

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.510 
of us you know plans in advance because
if<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.419> goes<00:04:25.539> wrong<00:04:25.810> then<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.139> end<00:04:26.320> up<00:04:26.520> looking

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
if it goes wrong then you end up looking

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.719 
if it goes wrong then you end up looking
like<00:04:27.550> an<00:04:27.789> idiot<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:29.590> if<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.070> works<00:04:30.370> then

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
like an idiot and if it works then

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.570 
like an idiot and if it works then
there's<00:04:31.570> always<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:32.020> way<00:04:32.979> somehow

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
there's always a way somehow

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.700 
there's always a way somehow
spontaneously<00:04:34.419> to<00:04:34.810> arrange<00:04:35.710> something<00:04:35.979> so

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
spontaneously to arrange something so

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.610 
spontaneously to arrange something so
very<00:04:37.400> boring
