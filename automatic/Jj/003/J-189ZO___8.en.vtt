00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
give it a nice wipe anyways just to make

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.859

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
this microfiber cloth it comes with now

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.510 
this microfiber cloth it comes with now
the<00:01:58.049> reason<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.680> tempered<00:01:59.219> glass<00:01:59.369> is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the reason I like tempered glass is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.499 
the reason I like tempered glass is
because<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.149> hard<00:02:01.219> so<00:02:02.219> obviously<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> feels

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
because it's hard so obviously it feels

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.789 
because it's hard so obviously it feels
just<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.850> glass<00:02:05.850> screen<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:07.229> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
just like a glass screen and it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.690 
just like a glass screen and it
scratches<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.369> lot<00:02:08.459> less<00:02:09.000> than<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.989> actual

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
scratches a lot less than the actual

a glass screen with a little bit of

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.330 
a glass screen with a little bit of

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
curve there on the edge so your finger

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.220 
curve there on the edge so your finger
never<00:02:59.579> actually<00:02:59.939> catches<00:03:00.389> which<00:03:00.870> makes<00:03:01.109> it

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
gonna play with it a little bit here so

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.569 
gonna play with it a little bit here so
I'm<00:04:01.709> just<00:04:01.769> gonna<00:04:02.180> set<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.349> on<00:04:04.349> here<00:04:04.949> give<00:04:05.549> it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.170 

as<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.560> can<00:04:14.680> see<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.130> pretty<00:04:15.430> pretty<00:04:15.880> tough

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
as you can see it is pretty pretty tough

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.729 
as you can see it is pretty pretty tough
actually<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.910> can<00:04:19.060> get<00:04:19.180> some<00:04:19.330> real<00:04:19.739> flex

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
actually so you can get some real flex

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.230 
actually so you can get some real flex
into<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.190> too<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:21.580> it's<00:04:21.700> going<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.880> take<00:04:22.060> some

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
into it too so it's going to take some

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.040 
into it too so it's going to take some
punctures<00:04:22.720> as<00:04:22.930> well<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:24.750> probably<00:04:25.750> shouldn't

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
punctures as well I probably shouldn't

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.410 
punctures as well I probably shouldn't
put<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.320> on<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.530> microfiber<00:04:27.130> bit<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.700> micro

against the phone is actually as smooth
as<00:05:58.480> can<00:05:58.660> be<00:05:58.840> which<00:05:59.530> means<00:05:59.770> it's<00:05:59.950> still<00:06:00.040> even

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
though that I've destroyed it like that

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.620 
though that I've destroyed it like that
it's<00:06:02.410> not<00:06:02.650> actually<00:06:02.890> going<00:06:03.370> to<00:06:03.640> hurt<00:06:04.419> your
