00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.960
 Good evening 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.660
 Today is 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.910
 About the atrial side 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 That the Tteyuu reading how ally of the electrocardiogram 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 I would like to explain 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.860
 First say atrial fibrillation and says that what it 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 Here's a stimulation conduction system 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.030
 I have a head though 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 I think everyone knows 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.760
 Wintering 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.100
 First of all 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.449
 From the right atrium 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.449
 Electricity is generated 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:00.780
 There is a sinus node because it is a clown called a sinus node 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.930
 It is divided into right leg left leg by His bundle and stimulation conduction system goes down by Purkinje fiber 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.710
 I will 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.490
 If it is 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.640
 This so-called nostril node is called 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.510
 Face maker 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.620
 It is where you are taking the rhythm constant 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.610
 Dog 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.390
 Gain 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.940
 Good deal 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.570
 With a certain rhythm 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.750
 I am sending a signal by scribing a rhythm 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.750
 However, atrial fibrillation is 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.090
 Signal 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.860
 VI sinoatrial node in the snow care 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.710
 From 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.710
 Originally, where the stimulation conduction system is transmitted 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:51.850
 Right atrium left atrium generates electricity from various places 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.290
 It is a state of 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 When you say whether become what wind new lens because it is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580
 it's here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 It is the first place to notice and see this 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.790
 Next cleaning 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 It is this to say that gaze 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.820
 It is a line of books 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.820
 If that heart stops, it will be peeing straight and I will say that it is a steamer 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.190
 usually 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.630
 And say normal thin lens 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.900
 In this way 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.670
 b wave 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.230
 qrs wave b wave comes constant 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.099
 but 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.110
 The sinus node is a place Tteyuu 9 p wave 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.620
 It becomes stimulation of 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.620
 various 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.600
 Moisture-proof Shinpo left atrium from various places 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.300
 Because the battery is generated 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.300
 I can not see p waves such as beautiful 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.890
 As you can see this because it is 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.200
 Where is p wave 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.190
 Say 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.910
 I do not understand it is jagged 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.910
 Anytime 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.540
 q There surfer 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.170
 This qrs wave that is this baggage get get get 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.980
 Say 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.400
 Though it becomes employment of spring quality 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.450
 As you can see this 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.450
 Not constant 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.290
 If it is 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.050
 It becomes q rs q rs 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.990
 Uoh 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.990
 I say this r is the q topmost 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.880
 rrrrrr sense 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.260
 This is the Tteyuu the meantime become a regular intervals 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.070
 However, when you'll look at this 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.340
 It's not like 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.630
 Short place long place 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.070
 Various children short 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.070
 Longer than that 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.360
 If you think that this area is longer than that, it is short again 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.530
 Is its rr cans with the feeling that say 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.530
 It will fall apart 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.229
 In this 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.229
 Where atrial fibrillation comes out often 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:57.430
 It will come out well with cars outside already, but if atrial fibrillation occurs blood in patience 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.910
 It becomes difficult to flow well by doing so 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.960
 I can have a clot 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.960
 The decisive battle is 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.490
 When I beat my blood 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.580
 I get stuck in my brain 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.610
 6 is fast 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.950
 Well that once in a while 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:24.370
 Though I'm also cause financial restraint Toka jammed in the coronary artery of the heart that 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:28.840
 The rhythm of this atrial fibrillation is 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:31.470
 In the field of neurosurgery, it is particularly common 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:39.390
 We are watching this 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:43.160
 After sister where is has become this jagged jagged jagged that what I'm t faction 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.700
 A certain Han Chinese steak 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.650
 There is a long place that is not constant at all or a short place 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.340
 You can see immediately if you look at this Tino Shin lens 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:58.390
 The say this new Bosusaido is 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:04.860
 Remember that this is a basic waveform that comes out really well 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:07.860
 I think that there is no problem at all Well translated af af 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.500
 often called af 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:15.510
 So this time atrial fibrillation 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.510
 Let's remember this
