00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.830
 and 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.950
 good night my name is the link 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.520
 zambrano and I'm 16 years old and I come to 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.779
 interpret a song by kany garcÃ­a 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.190
 someone who sad when he collapses 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:34.360
 everything becomes unfair to us and 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.690
 life that lasts when it is not what you thought 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.410
 when you gave me a face which was another 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.519
 there were triads I heard the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.210
 words is that we all get some 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:55.560
 day love though so nobody pound 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:59.910
 Do not want to break your heart either 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:05.480
 As I walk I do not know if someone today 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.480
 can equal me and thank you for coming 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.300
 you changed antonio the tone of the song 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.110
 like three times 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.180
 ok it's important that a singer knows 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.340
 when it's out of tune and when it's not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 I think you have to work more on your 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.130
 melodic ear so you can know 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.390
 when you're out of tune and when you're not 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.000
 good night my name is in situ and 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.230
 I come to sing the one of bad luck 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 by jesse james 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:42.760
 I kept hope knowing your 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.760
 inside feeling your heat so alien 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.810
 all the people who are watching 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.220
 you must feel what you are singing and 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.830
 here there was none of that apart 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.909
 we have tuning problems 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.040
 Pronunciation breathing many things 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.140
 that work I suggest you first 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.330
 practice at home that you look for 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.550
 study that you prepare and then come back 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:09.179
 you can't and everything i have you can be 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:13.140
 pretty there is already a mere plan 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.510
 There is with me paper 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:23.610
 but I swear that in the end I'm just going to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 lift there is that 'skyscraper' 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.380
 o light 'skyscraper' 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.750
 thank you I like that combination 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.300
 spanglish 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.550
 Spanglish can always be done and 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.160
 when it is well pronounced ok if we go 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.680
 to handle another language we must us 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.600
 we emphasize that part a lot because it is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 While pronounce quite important 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.410
 words and we articulate well and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.540
 we pronounce well in Spanish we must 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.110
 do it a lot better when we sing 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.350
 in a language that is not ours 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.350
 I do not know 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.040
 if what happens is that we are 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.160
 surprised because he has a voice 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.900
 quite bright arrives very high have 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.660
 a pretty broad record apparently 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.750
 you are 18 you have a very voice 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.840
 bright to be 18 years old I do not know what 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.350
 you say 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.350

 program how you feel extremely happy 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.920
 happy because I remember that my father was 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.750
 a great singer and this mediates here the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.060
 reason the reason is that my first reason 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.710
 is my father good that family support 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.050

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.140
 and sleep in your voice 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.190
 I'm dying to say 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.020
 that the world was wrong 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.020
 that is wrong 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.229

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.890
 pretty sweet 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.640
 It is a voice that can be worked on because 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.430
 you can work what are arrangements 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.830
 Vibrato ornaments that apparently a tube 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.750
 It is not so prepared but I liked it 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.300
 I do not know what you say, I liked it 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.700
 quite as the teacher says in January 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.050
 he has a very sweet voice and I think he 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.890
 can work continuist can do 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.890

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.310

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.310

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.200
 the night congratulations how you feel 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.780
 very excited because I really do not 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.550
 I thought I could get here for that 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.680
 is the academy to grow and so 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.690
 those dreams are fulfilled already you are inside 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.910
 of the 24 officially selected 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.600
 you are inside the program 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:20.020
 space asks me for that space and never 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.600
 I could not have full - time 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.870
 I understand so that you talk to me about 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.350
 space when in a kiss I gave you everything 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.350

 great to be 17 years old my love 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.180
 you have a very nasal voice, super nasal 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.340
 I made the comparison of when you spoke 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.960
 when you started singing we do not have 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.630
 good breathing management see what 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.660
 you are doing, you must work a lot 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.520
 lots of things but if you have a voice 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.000
 with which you can which you can 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.000
 take advantage 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.990
 or 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:11.250

 I think you have a very good voice 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.719
 a strong enough voice I would say 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:34.539
 you project a lot that's good but 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.669
 you can also play against many 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.249
 times but I think you can 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.960
 work I would give you the step is a voice 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:43.319
 pretty engolada 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.530
 good but that can be corrected 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:49.960
