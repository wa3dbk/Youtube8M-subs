00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:05.530 

check<00:00:03.679> the<00:00:03.800> condition<00:00:04.310> of<00:00:04.430> the<00:00:04.520> flywheel<00:00:05.090> if

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
check the condition of the flywheel if

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.110 
check the condition of the flywheel if
there's<00:00:05.930> any<00:00:06.080> bluing<00:00:06.559> scouring<00:00:07.430> or<00:00:07.670> cracks

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
there's any bluing scouring or cracks

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.030 
there's any bluing scouring or cracks
then<00:00:08.840> you'll<00:00:08.990> have<00:00:09.139> to<00:00:09.290> replace<00:00:09.530> it

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
then you'll have to replace it

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.070 
then you'll have to replace it
I<00:00:11.210> can<00:00:12.210> give<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> quick<00:00:12.720> comparison<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
I can give you a quick comparison of the

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.019 
I can give you a quick comparison of the
discs<00:00:16.250> this<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.170> new<00:00:19.170> clutch<00:00:20.040> disc<00:00:20.369> nice

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
discs this is the new clutch disc nice

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.130 
discs this is the new clutch disc nice
nice<00:00:21.390> deep<00:00:21.689> grooves<00:00:23.360> this<00:00:24.360> is<00:00:24.540> the<00:00:24.689> old<00:00:24.810> disc

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
nice deep grooves this is the old disc

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.960 
nice deep grooves this is the old disc
you<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> grooves<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.130> almost<00:00:26.400> all<00:00:26.610> worn

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
you see the grooves are almost all worn

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.659 
you see the grooves are almost all worn
away<00:00:27.290> if<00:00:28.290> you<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.560> real<00:00:28.770> close<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.520> real

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
away if you look real close and real

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.999 
away if you look real close and real
carefully<00:00:30.180> it's<00:00:30.360> typical<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> see<00:00:30.890> with<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
carefully it's typical to see with the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.100 
carefully it's typical to see with the
rivet<00:00:32.310> heads<00:00:32.899> were<00:00:33.899> shiny<00:00:34.520> on<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.760> side

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
rivet heads were shiny on this side

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
rivet heads were shiny on this side
that's<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.700> friction<00:00:38.970> surface<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that's because the friction surface is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240 
that's because the friction surface is
one<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> way<00:00:40.260> down<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.920> here's<00:00:41.130> what

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
one all the way down so here's what

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.670 
one all the way down so here's what
we've<00:00:41.370> got<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> old<00:00:42.989> trout<00:00:43.290> bear<00:00:43.560> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
we've got this is the old trout bear and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.110 
we've got this is the old trout bear and
I've<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.950> taken<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> transmission<00:00:47.120> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
I've just taken out the transmission you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.020 
I've just taken out the transmission you
get<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.390> spinning<00:00:53.030> very<00:00:54.030> loose<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.660> very

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
get that spinning very loose and very

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.420 
get that spinning very loose and very
grindy<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.720> new<00:00:57.900> one<00:01:01.430> utterly

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
grindy this is the new one utterly

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.490 
grindy this is the new one utterly
silent

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.660 

clean<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.620> flywheel<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.460> pressure

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
clean the flywheel and the pressure

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.210 
clean the flywheel and the pressure
plate<00:01:11.090> with<00:01:11.720> brake<00:01:12.050> cleaner<00:01:14.920> there<00:01:15.920> will<00:01:16.040> be<00:01:16.070> a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
plate with brake cleaner there will be a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.270 
plate with brake cleaner there will be a
lot<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.580> residue<00:01:17.510> of<00:01:17.810> clutch<00:01:18.500> material<00:01:19.130> from

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
lot of residue of clutch material from

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.860 
lot of residue of clutch material from
the<00:01:19.430> previous<00:01:19.580> clutch<00:01:20.120> on<00:01:20.300> here<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:20.720> it's

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
the previous clutch on here so it's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.010 
the previous clutch on here so it's
important<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.380> get<00:01:21.560> as<00:01:21.740> clean<00:01:25.840> use<00:01:26.840> your

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
important to get as clean use your

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.070 
important to get as clean use your
alignment<00:01:27.500> tool<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:28.100> line<00:01:28.310> up<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.640> clutch

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.690 

install<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.260> pressure<00:01:33.530> plate<00:01:33.890> bolts<00:01:37.750> and

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
install the pressure plate bolts and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.210 
install the pressure plate bolts and
then<00:01:40.700> tighten<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.270> bolts<00:01:41.510> bit<00:01:41.870> by<00:01:42.110> bit<00:01:42.220> evenly

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
then tighten the bolts bit by bit evenly

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.060 
then tighten the bolts bit by bit evenly
in<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.640> crosswise<00:01:44.210> pattern<00:01:44.780> after<00:01:45.380> installing

in a crosswise pattern after installing

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.740 
in a crosswise pattern after installing
the<00:01:46.160> new<00:01:46.190> throwout<00:01:46.610> bearing<00:01:46.730> it's<00:01:47.330> time<00:01:47.570> to

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
the new throwout bearing it's time to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.300 
the new throwout bearing it's time to
connect<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.110> transmission<00:01:48.740> back<00:01:49.010> to<00:01:49.220> the

connect the transmission back to the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.790 
connect the transmission back to the
engine<00:01:49.760> this<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.810> most<00:01:51.020> difficult<00:01:51.320> part

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
engine this is the most difficult part

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.290 
engine this is the most difficult part
of<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.980> operation<00:01:52.040> because<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.880> engine

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
of the operation because the engine

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.690 
of the operation because the engine
transmission<00:01:53.540> have<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.320> line<00:01:54.530> up<00:01:54.740> perfectly

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.749 

if<00:01:59.119> you<00:02:00.110> remove<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.650> drive<00:02:01.009> shafts<00:02:01.460> at<00:02:01.670> the

if you remove the drive shafts at the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.899 
if you remove the drive shafts at the
front<00:02:02.060> then<00:02:02.659> reinstall<00:02:03.259> them<00:02:03.439> now<00:02:03.650> along<00:02:04.640> with

then reinstall the turbo heat shield tap

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.650 
then reinstall the turbo heat shield tap
off<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.130> transmission<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:56.090> replace<00:02:56.450> any
