00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 looks right out of hello dear people 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.610
 yes, such a printed picture says 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.960
 as you know, more than a thousand words like that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.360
 in terms of looks cool 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.190
 but especially in image transfer 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.770
 when watching computer or computer 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.460
 Filming is something completely different 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.980
 turn up at 1080p and there 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.529
 there's synonymous 1080p had the difference 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.740
 the woman learn her berger now 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.740
 shock 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.659
 yes a video signal film signal is yes 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.010
 mostly you know that from daumenkino 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:52.600
 many pictures in a row unwound 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.010
 reproduced so fast that the eye 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.149
 certainly no single pictures more 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.309
 perceives but a flowing 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.359
 I now have movement daumenkino here 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.449
 not but I try that anyway 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.070
 now just a little bit on to 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:08.920
 clarify where the difference between 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:12.819
 this 1080p 1080i is 1080p so this 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.000
 is yes for progressive full frame that 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:19.210
 So you get when you have a movie 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.140
 see that often with 25 pictures or 50 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.569
 pictures per second 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.899
 then the film runs with 25 or 50 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.649
 pictures per second and indeed with full 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.080
 images 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.289
 that means you really get 25 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.850
 full pictures on the canvas 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.799
 therefore shown a flowing 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.569
 movement is the 1080i process 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.939
 works a little differently the e 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:47.500
 stands for interlaced lines jump 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.359
 you can say that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.000
 because there are not full pictures 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.189
 shown but every half field 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.409
 I would have to imagine that now 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.259
 pay jump procedure that means it 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:05.020
 are only certain lines in the first 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:07.420
 picture shown and then the other lines 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.459
 In the picture you would line them up now 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.070
 alternately in a row the pictures 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.260
 alternately show in succession 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.450
 her also the full picture if now for 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.850
 example, there is somewhere 1016 1080i 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.500
 then that is so that we always stop 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.900
 We have pictures but one 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:33.030
 full-hd resolution, the resolution 1920 x 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.600
 1980 1180 are the image lines at the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:42.180
 1080i will be processed per second 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.670
 50 pictures with the resolution 1920 x 540 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.860
 shown every time but half 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.290
 picture that always changes so 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.450
 then you have a full screen so you have 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.560
 actually, if you are somewhere 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.200
 with 1080p and 60p it means that he 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.550
 60 pictures per second have that is so 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.260
 not quite right because she has only 60 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.330
 fields in the second so 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.050
 Actually the right pictures are 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.330
 only 30 full pictures in seconds 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.330
 the problem is that it is for 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.810
 the tv often a giant giant 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.970
 Accounting is this interface procedure 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.569
 in a progressive way to 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.370
 count 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.530
 that's a huge billing and if 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.530
 the image processor on the television is not there 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.090
 just the bang is then you see that 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.819
 in the picture sometimes, too, if you are more specific 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.890
 Looks like the pictures are in here 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.329
 this paid game procedure is made 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.340
 sometimes the pictures are not quite 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.590
 match has determined ever 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.660
 Seen here advertise or advertising 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.160
 something here werbetafel if he is the type 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.750
 thereby new advertising on it papered 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.489
 if he does not do it exactly 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.170
 then suddenly missing with the one type 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.760
 because the eye is somehow a bit 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.810
 wrong or the other one is missing 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.239
 finger or something like that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.890
 and that may be interlaced with this one 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.720
 procedure also happen 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.109
 that's why this 1080p is of course that 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.750
 better procedures but it is synonymous 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.989
 much more data volume in doing so 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.459
 play it if you have 50 frames 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.200
 then that's such a dataset but 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.660
 if you HÃ¤upl 50 of these then you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.639
 then that is only half because 50 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.209
 Field pictures are 25 great pictures in 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.900
 the second 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.660
 it's hard to understand though 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.940
 Actually, you can do it very well 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.220
 You can also do research on the internet 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.919
 read again there that is actually 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.410
 so what i actually just told 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.320
 written in text but if he is now to 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.919
 example somehow tv receiver 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.620
 TV programs are mainly 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.360
 if in full-hd then with 1080i 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.430
 Transferred because the data rate easy 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.720
 is much smaller 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.400
 I would recommend but then 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.930
 omit the 1080i and then 720p 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.099
 to go back because that is for the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.930
 tv if the picture for example 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.849
 wants to scale up is with the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.010
 TV easier that is compatible 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.720
 and earlier that was the play 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.210
 anyway, maybe he was 1080p 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.810
 but I do not think that was 1080p 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.220
 that was always only 1080 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.270
 Data volume is easy for small has 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.070
 that's definitely noticed 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.120
 somehow intervideo made with 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.990
 1080p 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.240
 there you have so much and so much megabyte movie 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.840
 video and 1080i you have all at once 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.690
 still half 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.500
 and that's just because a lot more 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.180
 images 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.540
 So there are still times briefly 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.760
 summarized 1080p or the sp stands 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.460
 always for progressive are role models 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.510
 that's actually best quality though 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.660
 the advantage of being huge 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.130
 data volume has left unused for this 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.330
 TV unusual or whole program 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.600
 Another method is the half picture 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.830
 Procedure is the half-image procedure 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.470
 So the internet experience half-pictures 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.479
 1080i if he has 60 pictures a second 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.139
 smells are served in front of 60 fields 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.330
 and 30 frames so you can get that 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.430
 remember and then you know already 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.620
 actually where is with money and both 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.860
 not necessarily compatible that means you 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.680
 can not necessarily 1080i or 1 720 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.970
 how picture turns into 1080p that works 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.580
 but already if he at the 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.530
 computer makes use incredibly long and 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.419
 the TV or the receiver cable 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.919
 receiver or something like that sometimes 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.479
 Do not go and the picture sometimes bad 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.850
 So you either have to do that if you have 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.680
 1080i program start then let it on 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.270
 1080i run in the fans supported 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.010
 or if not then take the smaller one 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:31.039
 hd stage then you have in effect 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:32.780
 better picture Birds chirping goes 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.800
 already spring is so soon spring 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.910
 I hope I have given you a bit 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.419
 can help with this picture 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.669
 thing with the 1080i and 1080p 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:42.320
 it really is not that way 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.030
 hard to understand but if you want that 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.020
 only text moderately reads you can 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.600
 hard to imagine 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.389
 picture is sometimes a little better 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.330
 the next video will probably be 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.560
 then its sound checks and if you look 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.039
 You can see more of a nice one 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.850
 weekend 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.850
 the speaker shocker
