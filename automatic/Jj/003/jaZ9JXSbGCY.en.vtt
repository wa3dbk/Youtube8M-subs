00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.099
 hello I'm marisol gÃ³mez adviser style 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.829
 image and I'm looking at the segment of 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.410
 marisol you hear and question today 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:18.840
 send mariana from Spain 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 or the nose or you write Mariana from 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.789
 Spain I have a question I would like 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.099
 make me a new haircut but 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.410
 I would like to choose the appropriate one 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.950
 could you indicate that I should keep in mind 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.600
 when choosing my new haircut 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.820
 marianas there are several factors that are 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
 in mind when choosing your 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.280
 new haircut first thing 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.559
 you should keep in mind is your kind of two 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.839
 sometimes identify your kind of face to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 to be able to ask your stylist to make you 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.760
 a haircut that enhances your 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 traits in the most favorable way 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.350
 possible for example if you have a face 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.110
 or next door you can take a chance with 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.199
 any cut because your angles are 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.300
 balanced naturally if you have a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.180
 circular face disjoint the cuts in 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 smooth layers at shoulder height or 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.340
 below these avoiding any 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.050
 cut that generates volume to the sides if 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 you have a square face my 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.060
 recommendation is that you opt for the cuts 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.480
 short or long with slashed or 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.630
 grassi sides that simulate the line 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.450
 straight lines of your face you have the face 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.700
 rectangular cuts at the height of 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.250
 the ears or a little higher will go 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.320
 very good if you have your face type 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.600
 triangle I recommend the cuts 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.300
 shorts that add volume in the part 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.490
 top of your head and if you have a 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.430
 face type inverted triangle a type 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.890
 diamond cuts with layers below 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.110
 of the ears at chin height and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.510
 up to the middle of the neck are your 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.640
 best options you should also 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.670
 consider what you want to get to 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.650
 change cutting style because the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.140
 emotional part also good a role 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.540
 essential when performing a 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.090
 makeover note if you 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.130
 you want is to soften your image 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.860
 externalize your inner strength see 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.230
 more modern or more classical because once 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.840
 define this choose the style will be 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.180
 much easier texture and thickness 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.460
 of your hair are other factors that is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.410
 consider because not all types of 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.660
 hair adapt to all cuts 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.230
 you must choose one that suits the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.240
 natural fall and the thickness of your hair 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.940
 in this aspect 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.370
 Your stylist can help you consult the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.500
 what is the best style for your type of 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.630
 hair the time you have to 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.330
 to fix your hair daily is 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.150
 vital when choosing the style 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.820
 right if you do not have much time to 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.970
 dedicate to combing your hair is not 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.400
 choose cuts that require it but 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.680
 if you have enough time available 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.290

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.060
 last you should consider the province of 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.820
 your facial features when choosing 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.710
 your cut for example if you have a nose 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.230
 big you should avoid cuts of 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.510
 manly hair because these will make 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.640
 your nose looks more noticeable and big to 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.620
 the eyesight if you have very wide eyes 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.440
 avoid fringes because these will make 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.770
 that your eyes look more distant between 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.990
