00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
enjoy it has like I said a thread in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.590 
enjoy it has like I said a thread in
style

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
style

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
style
so<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.320> basically<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.860> thread<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.280> into

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
so you basically is thread it right into

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
so you basically is thread it right into
the<00:01:05.580> onto<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> lens<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:07.320> once<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.710> figure

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the onto the lens then once you figure

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.230 
the onto the lens then once you figure
out<00:01:08.040> we've<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.369> lined<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.729> where<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.150> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
out we've got lined up where you want it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.670 
out we've got lined up where you want it
you<00:01:09.270> actually<00:01:09.720> tighten<00:01:10.170> down<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.500> lock

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you actually tighten down the lock

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.060 
you actually tighten down the lock
washer<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.720> basically<00:01:12.720> ties<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.200> good<00:01:13.439> again

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
washer so basically ties on good again

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130 
washer so basically ties on good again
like<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.340> said<00:01:14.400> also<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.540> retain<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like I said also then will retain the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710 
like I said also then will retain the
lens<00:01:16.470> cap<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.130> let's<00:01:17.970> Cup<00:01:18.150> works<00:01:18.360> well<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
lens cap so let's Cup works well with it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
lens cap so let's Cup works well with it
but<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> comes<00:01:19.890> time<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.400> in

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
but when it comes time to put this in

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.399 
but when it comes time to put this in
the<00:01:20.700> camera<00:01:20.970> bag<00:01:21.150> knock<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> off<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.900> camera

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the camera bag knock it off the camera

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
the camera bag knock it off the camera
basically<00:01:23.220> dropping<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.060> order<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.299> remove

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
basically dropping in in order to remove

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.109 
basically dropping in in order to remove
it<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.049> had<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> untighten<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> lock<00:01:26.820> nut

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it you had to untighten the lock nut

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
it you had to untighten the lock nut
you've<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:27.990> been<00:01:28.110> unthread<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you've got have been unthread it and you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
you've got have been unthread it and you
got<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> lens<00:01:29.490> cap<00:01:29.700> back<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> lens<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
got the lens cap back to the lens and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.700 
got the lens cap back to the lens and
put<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.750> separate<00:01:31.140> location

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
put it in a separate location

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.920 
put it in a separate location
unlike<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> nice<00:01:32.400> ones<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:32.939> slip

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
unlike the nice ones that are just slip

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.050 
unlike the nice ones that are just slip
on<00:01:34.110> basically<00:01:34.740> flip<00:01:35.100> over<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> reverse<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
on basically flip over and reverse the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
on basically flip over and reverse the
lens<00:01:36.360> cap<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:37.890> sure<00:01:38.070> how<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:38.400> I'm

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
lens cap so not really sure how much I'm

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
lens cap so not really sure how much I'm
going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> hood<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
going to like the hood if I'm going to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
going to like the hood if I'm going to
I'll<00:01:40.290> probably<00:01:40.350> slap<00:01:40.920> already<00:01:41.369> paid<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.549> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
I'll probably slap already paid for it
