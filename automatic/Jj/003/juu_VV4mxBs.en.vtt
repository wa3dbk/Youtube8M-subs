00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 summer and winter it is always possible 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.370
 to make cuttings of saint paul ya 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.370
 two sheets of his police 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.440
 to succeed a saint's shop 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.389
 paulien it is already necessary to saint paul yesterday 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.340
 than a certain age more than six months to 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.950
 inside the house since it is 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.320
 already hardened too soft the cuttings 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.920
 are a little more complicated to 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.039
 achieve 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.960
 so we will use leaves not 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.670
 any leaf then on a 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.140
 saintpaulia the old leaves of 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.029
 when buying so these are 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.010
 leaves that are on the periphery 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.390
 it's a rosette inside the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.610
 very small leaves we are not going 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.460
 not use them we will use the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.979
 intermediate sheets so these are these 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.729
 leaves they find themselves close enough to 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.589
 the rosette we cut them with a one 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.870
 knife then you will quickly understand 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.720
 that it's a cutting that has been pretty 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.350
 easy to realize since it is enough 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.250
 to use a glass of water we will put 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:06.020
 a little water at the bottom of the glass 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.750
 alas a little glass of brandy we 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.250
 let's soak the leaf but before 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.549
 soak the leaf in masters a whole 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.469
 little piece of charcoal since 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.369
 charcoal will prevent that water 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.630
 croupie this the petiole soaks slightly 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.729
 in the green 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.829
 and that's our cuttings is over 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.369
 now we will use another 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.100
 system 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.960
 we will make a cut in a glass 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.520
 so for that we will fill this glass with 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.520
 two thirds of water almost until 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.869
 always the piece of charcoal 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.149
 and there we will do a little bit like 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.939
 jams or when you want to isolate 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.939
 food against the outside we use 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.359
 a film was serious we will go through 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:09.209
 above we will take our cuttings 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:14.319
 always the same way long enough 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:17.170
 we're going to make a hole then on the 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:22.860
 side to prevent the cutting from 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 flip flop the cutting inside and 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.379
 it floats slightly just at 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.160
 water's edge that's it's one of the 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.599
 techniques then there is another 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.629
 also technical that can be realized 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.239
 we will use a bottle a 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.970
 deco bottle that has and decorative in 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.069
 meter inside the clay balls 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.110
 and there instead of doing a cutting in 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.810
 the water we are going to make a cuttings in 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.459
 potting so in this same bottle 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.670
 henry puts the most complicated potting soil 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.220
 in this kind of system it's about 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.549
 to put the potting soil 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:06.099
 gone through the special mold bottleneck 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:08.170
 seedlings and cuttings it is important to 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.739
 sinks potting way those who go down 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:16.590
 well in the background we take a cuttings 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.099
 not very big what it takes 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.280
 go through the job we slip it to 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.280
 interior 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.209
 falcon slipped the cuttings 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.180
 the trick is the hold and that's it 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.760
 and that it is slightly there is more than 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.440
 to mouth and mervans mouth and we 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.609
 will put a little bit of water then not 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.109
 too huh that's important 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:48.459
 the carnival value will always be 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.500
 enough early enough to bring water 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.560
 here 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.560
 now good bottle cap 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.250
 so we have a stifled culture and the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.290
 our cuttings will start to 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.450
 take root then, of course, since 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.490
 she will get fatter with bigger than the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.230
 glass will leave it inside and 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.180
 that will make you why not a plant 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.180
 green inside a bottle
