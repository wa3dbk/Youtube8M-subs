00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.890 

also<00:01:02.329> after<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:04.680> smoke<00:01:05.430> eat<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.659> drink

anything<00:01:07.369> other<00:01:08.369> than<00:01:08.670> water<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:10.290> should

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
anything other than water you should

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.240 
anything other than water you should
rinse<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:10.920> mouth<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.630> mouthwash<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
rinse your mouth out with mouthwash and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.420 
rinse your mouth out with mouthwash and
alcohol-free<00:01:14.250> mouthwash<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.390> preferred

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
alcohol-free mouthwash is preferred

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.760

because<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.470> alcohol<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.810> mouthwash

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
because the alcohol in the mouthwash

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.990 
because the alcohol in the mouthwash
that<00:01:23.369> has<00:01:23.610> alcohol<00:01:24.770> can<00:01:25.770> kill<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that has alcohol can kill more of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.990 
that has alcohol can kill more of the
good<00:01:27.210> germs<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:30.920> it'll<00:01:31.920> take<00:01:32.250> longer<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.759> heal

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
good germs and it'll take longer to heal

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.380 
good germs and it'll take longer to heal
so<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.890> should<00:01:35.070> use<00:01:35.390> non<00:01:36.390> alcohol<00:01:37.049> mouthwash

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.720 
it somehow it's very unlikely but if you
do<00:03:09.930> go<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.889> hospital<00:03:11.430> right<00:03:11.579> away<00:03:15.169> if

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
do go to the hospital right away if

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.170 
do go to the hospital right away if
mouthwash<00:03:17.730> isn't<00:03:18.239> available<00:03:19.819> mix<00:03:20.819> one

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
mouthwash isn't available mix one

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.050 
mouthwash isn't available mix one
tablespoon<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.989> sea<00:03:22.290> salt<00:03:24.290> with<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.819> cup<00:03:26.819> of

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
tablespoon of sea salt with a cup of

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.129 
tablespoon of sea salt with a cup of
warm<00:03:27.480> water<00:03:27.599> and<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:30.480> don't<00:03:30.660> want<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.870> too

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
warm water and you don't want it too

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.759 
warm water and you don't want it too
high<00:03:31.859> because<00:03:32.340> hot<00:03:33.180> stuff<00:03:33.840> will<00:03:34.169> burn<00:03:34.440> your

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
high because hot stuff will burn your

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.849 
high because hot stuff will burn your
tongue<00:03:35.010> more<00:03:36.200> because<00:03:37.200> your<00:03:37.319> tongue<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.680> more

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
tongue more because your tongue is more

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:44.059 
tongue more because your tongue is more
sensitive<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:41.630> it'll<00:03:42.630> it'll<00:03:43.019> burn<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.040> hurt

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
sensitive and it'll it'll burn and hurt

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.190 
sensitive and it'll it'll burn and hurt
a<00:03:44.430> lot<00:03:45.230> also<00:03:46.230> with<00:03:46.410> cold<00:03:46.739> things<00:03:47.639> like<00:03:48.200> ice

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
a lot also with cold things like ice

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.280 
a lot also with cold things like ice
cream<00:03:49.590> or<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:50.069> ice<00:03:50.370> water

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
cream or just ice water

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.509 
cream or just ice water
that<00:03:52.500> will<00:03:52.860> be<00:03:53.819> cold<00:03:54.209> on<00:03:54.480> your<00:03:54.689> tongue<00:03:55.519> because

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
that will be cold on your tongue because

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.030 
that will be cold on your tongue because
it<00:03:56.700> makes<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.870> barbell<00:03:58.799> cold<00:04:00.379> just<00:04:01.379> like<00:04:01.469> half

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
it makes the barbell cold just like half

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.450 
it makes the barbell cold just like half
staff<00:04:02.430> would<00:04:02.579> make<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.849> barbell<00:04:03.150> hot

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.540 

I<00:04:10.970> also<00:04:11.600> don't<00:04:11.990> take<00:04:12.350> out<00:04:12.530> your<00:04:12.860> tongue<00:04:13.280> ring

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
I also don't take out your tongue ring

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.260 
I also don't take out your tongue ring
for<00:04:14.000> any<00:04:14.150> length<00:04:14.450> of<00:04:14.630> time<00:04:15.880> especially<00:04:16.880> if

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
for any length of time especially if

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:25.810 
for any length of time especially if
you're<00:04:17.510> not<00:04:17.840> ready<00:04:18.110> to<00:04:18.260> change<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.770> yet<00:04:18.980> oh<00:04:24.820> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
you're not ready to change it yet oh and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.520 
you're not ready to change it yet oh and
when<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.120> use<00:04:26.240> sea<00:04:26.570> salt<00:04:26.600> make<00:04:27.230> sure<00:04:27.260> it

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
when you use sea salt make sure it

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.000 
when you use sea salt make sure it
doesn't<00:04:27.710> have<00:04:28.010> iodine<00:04:28.640> in<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.320> because<00:04:30.320> iodine

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
doesn't have iodine in it because iodine

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.710 
doesn't have iodine in it because iodine
is<00:04:31.460> just<00:04:32.450> bad<00:04:32.750> for<00:04:33.110> tongue<00:04:33.470> piercings<00:04:34.630> for<00:04:35.630> the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
is just bad for tongue piercings for the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.310 
is just bad for tongue piercings for the
first<00:04:35.870> couple<00:04:36.140> weeks<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.840> can<00:04:42.020> change

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
first couple weeks and you can change

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.920 
first couple weeks and you can change
your<00:04:42.650> barbell<00:04:43.370> after<00:04:43.880> one<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.330> half<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.900> two

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
your barbell after one and a half to two

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.390 
your barbell after one and a half to two
weeks<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:47.330> should<00:04:47.570> probably<00:04:47.750> use<00:04:48.400> barbells

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
weeks you should probably use barbells

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.900 
weeks you should probably use barbells
with<00:04:49.610> acrylic<00:04:50.210> balls<00:04:50.740> because<00:04:51.740> if<00:04:52.070> you<00:04:52.490> end<00:04:52.700> up

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
with acrylic balls because if you end up

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.110 
with acrylic balls because if you end up
biting<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:55.640> ball<00:04:56.600> a<00:04:57.220> metal<00:04:58.220> one<00:04:58.400> will<00:04:58.820> more

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
biting the ball a metal one will more

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.950 
biting the ball a metal one will more
likely<00:04:59.150> is<00:04:59.840> more<00:05:00.500> likely<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:01.540> chip<00:05:02.540> your<00:05:02.690> teeth

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
likely is more likely to chip your teeth

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.280 
likely is more likely to chip your teeth
than<00:05:03.890> an<00:05:04.340> acrylic<00:05:04.880> ball<00:05:05.090> because<00:05:05.900> acrylic

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
than an acrylic ball because acrylic

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.440 
than an acrylic ball because acrylic
balls<00:05:06.500> will<00:05:06.800> break<00:05:07.010> easier<00:05:07.490> much<00:05:08.030> easier<00:05:09.850> so<00:05:10.850> I

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
balls will break easier much easier so I

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.210 
balls will break easier much easier so I
think<00:05:11.870> that's<00:05:12.110> about<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.410> for<00:05:12.620> tongue

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
think that's about it for tongue

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.880 
think that's about it for tongue
piercing<00:05:13.580> aftercare<00:05:13.730> so<00:05:14.600> um<00:05:15.020> I'll<00:05:15.620> try<00:05:15.860> to

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
piercing aftercare so um I'll try to

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.420 
piercing aftercare so um I'll try to
make<00:05:16.100> videos<00:05:16.130> afterwards<00:05:17.740> about<00:05:18.740> changing

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
make videos afterwards about changing

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.270 
make videos afterwards about changing
your<00:05:19.460> tongue<00:05:19.760> ring<00:05:20.000> or<00:05:20.620> cleaning<00:05:21.620> them<00:05:21.830> and

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
your tongue ring or cleaning them and

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.440 
your tongue ring or cleaning them and
you<00:05:22.820> know<00:05:22.910> stuff<00:05:23.180> like<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.710> um<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:25.240> I'll<00:05:26.240> see

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
you know stuff like that um so I'll see

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.720 
you know stuff like that um so I'll see
you<00:05:26.540> later
