00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.959
 from horror horror to face 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.110
 when they started to hurt 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.640
 the unemotional consoles with a 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.860
 pure will like diamond pokemon 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720
 I realized it took me like a 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.920
 big slap in the heart if you're 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.990
 more just his gains against nintendo 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.990
 it's issa the war 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 I am 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.199
 1 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.199
 o o 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.800
 indeed there are two kinds of players 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.240
 those who feel obliged to be 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.160
 the promoters of the console they have 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.270
 bought and the others the first 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.010
 have debates that contain 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.020
 by so much animosity that we speak 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.120
 willingly war consoles these 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.950
 vehement debates sometimes bring life to the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.720
 gamers community and that's for sure 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.729
 he thinks with nostalgia is that these 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.900
 animated discussions literally the 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.940
 playground our childhood 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.320
 however beyond the madeleine effect 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.940
 It is clear that these conflicts 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.170
 who embodies a war that 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.910
 actually publishers on the plane 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.830
 economic never really stopped 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.830
 so we can talk about permanent war 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.730
 in the 80s while the West 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.070
 was struggling to recover from the crash of 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.990
 83 the video game world has experienced a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.479
 perpetual war of the publishers for 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.920
 to assert their hegemony in the market of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.229
 these premises until today 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.520
 how did this conflict evolve and it's 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 what we are going to put to the test 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.869
 history and proof cards 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.790
 facts we will focus on the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.650
 unfolding of the conflict in France in order to 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 easily visualize the effects of 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.390
 war on people's lives 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.740
 the period 87.89 corresponds to a peace 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.300
 which is explained by the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.000
 equitable distribution of the territory 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.190
 between nintendo in glass and goes astray in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.810
 hatches and apart from a few episodes 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.560
 violent repression of possessors of 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.020
 master system here here and there we can see 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.910
 a rather cordial existence 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.220
 the peoples trials guy and pro 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.580
 nintendo this balance is handed over 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.290
 cause 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.209
 quite quickly by the exit of the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.010
 megadrive that stirs up the 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.739
 tensions and one can observe then 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.180
 a real phenomenon of balkanization as well 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.709
 that a multiplication of 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.440
 conflict throughout the country 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.570
 the peak of violence will be reached in 1994 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.920
 with the terrible attack of choisy the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.380
 king in the communal school jacques 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.330
 prevert or the now famous banda 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.190
 the gameboy kidnaps the little henri 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.140
 barnier thus obliging his parents to 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.190
 to burn under his eyes his collection of 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.750
 megadrive games 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.910
 the publishers themselves did not hesitate 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.709
 to stir up these conflicts through child 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.790
 advertisement 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.290
 of course the comparative ads 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.540
 being then banned in France we 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.940
 did not suffer the famous campaign 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.320
 genesis 2 watts nintendo who touted the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.190
 technical superiority of the megadrive 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.190
 compared to the nes 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.520
 that said it was still them who 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
 provide and the children of that time 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.490
 key arguments of these verbal jousts and 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.200
 no need to understand 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.060
 really what was bleis processing 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.130
 of the megadrive or the super fx 2 of the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.150
 super nintendo to be convinced that he 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.400
 it was really the proof year 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.570
 irrefutable of the superiority of such 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.100
 console relative to such other 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.840
 oh no, but we would have been stupid to 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.280
 not do it all our consumers 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.900
 become so many commercial loans 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.520
 before our machines to their buddies and 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.110
 voluntarily in addition a parent need 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.970
 a subtle hack then it was 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.100
 kids they have the energy to spare 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.270
 to tell salads is not the 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.770
 housewives who put so much pressure 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.390
 to defend their fridge brands in 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.650
 that I tell you the builders have 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.060
 as quickly understood the interest they 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.980
 had to position themselves as 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.120
 cultural marker conveying an image 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.830
 which players could 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.780
 identify 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.550
 I liked sega because this 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.930
 is he had sneakers and me 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.400
 also I had tic or sneakers 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.650
 sneakers it's better than a jumpsuit and 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920
 a red sweater in worse and then it's me 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.870
 scratch 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.310
 it is by playing the card of the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.200
 coolitude and giving to his players 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.280
 a rebel image that these guys with 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.600
 without killing the idea of a conflict of 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.130
 generation rather than conflict 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.170
 of sega publishers it was the brand of 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.940
 Teen mature pen while nintendo 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.200
 kept in respect of the public the image 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.850
 of builders should for children 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.590
 but let's not reduce the fight he 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.090
 then led to simple sega antagonisms 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.750
 nintendo since even before the release of 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.190
 the playstation 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.450
 they were not the only ones to 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.450
 share the console market 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.190
 snk especially occupied only the sector of 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.380
 luxury in the video game 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.570
 the neogeo selling like the rolls 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.480
 royce consoles the proletarians 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.200
 driven by private interest groups 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.750
 to tear each other apart to find out who had the 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.260
 bigger between sega and nintendo but 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.450
 it's disgusting 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.010
 we should have all united together against 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.690
 an objective enemy an opponent of 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.010
 class the petty bourgeois who was playing 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.560
 quietly at home in his big 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.090
 apartment at his neo geo 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.470
 it has been said the console war has 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.850
 especially animate the playgrounds 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.350
 however in recent years the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.180
 conflict has shifted to now 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.800
 on the internet some sites like 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.660
 jeuxvideo.com even has their forum 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.460
 dedicated to these discussions and to the trolls of 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.990
 any kind forum that claims 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.410
 proudly the naming war of 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.850
 consoles 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.710
 it is quite amusing to 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.450
 find adults speaking 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.010
 to maintain rivalries and 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.180
 debates now obsolete but force 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.100
 is to note that the public evoking 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.110
 the conflicts have diminished each 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.770
 let's see that ps3 and xbox 360 are 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.360
 about the machines 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 similar are more or less the same 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.930
 games catalog then the players get themselves 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.400
 are found a new common enemy the 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.590
 casual gamer who play the wii 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.930
 and how to give them wrong everyone knows 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.430
 that get fit with mel b on ps3 that's 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.640
 still really more hardcore gamer 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.080
 that nag massano blade this 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.590
 behavior is it peculiar to the world of 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.600
 video game 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.590
 we looked for equivalents the 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.100
 console war but in others 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.870
 areas 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.670
 and if you have to find a social group 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.050
 having the same kind of behavior he 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.300
 we have to stop at the case of the 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.260
 quality of sports fans who 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.850
 is not unrelated to that of 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.170
 gamers these support a 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.640
 team for identity reasons at 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.570
 place to support such or such a player at the 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.190
 favor of his performances 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.420
 now remains to know if it's good 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.420
 there what we want to look like 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.580
 just like the cold war these 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.350
 quarrels seems doomed to drag on 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.570
 every generation of consoles bringing 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.920
 his lot of new conflicts 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.810
 is there no solution for 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.580
 put an end to it will we ever captive 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.470
 of the console war are enough 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.330
 simple with a power strip you can rager 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.530
 all the races at the same time and then 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.510
 for TV there is a small socket 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.780
 scart month will play why is taking the 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.520
 cabbage 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.780
 of course we will be told that this healthy 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.280
 competition is an engine for 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.810
 technological innovation testifies 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.700
 the appearance of kinect after the release 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.040
 of the wii but is it really necessary 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.210
 that we players to come where the soldiers 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.710
 of this war that is not ours 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.120
 and wish to see our children 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.760
 become themselves so small 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.200
 child soldiers to spin the metaphor 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.930
 of the war I will end on a 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.370
 montaigne quote that said the 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.970
 soldiers should fear their general 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.050
 far more than their enemies 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.520
 attention the kids she's not 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.820
 waste your data from any 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.410
 multi scart socket to invest makes the 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.940
 Good choice 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.560
 go to your usual store 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.090
 accompanied by your parents and be sure 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.920
 well to ask for a multi-truth 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.080
 active that recognizes it by the presence 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.100
