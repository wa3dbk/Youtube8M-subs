00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.140
 organizational behavior 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.770
 We study the sciences. 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.260
 contributed to the understanding of this 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.469
 science and then we have sciences as 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.860
 psychology as sociology as 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.450
 social psychology anthropology and 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.120
 political sciences 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.070
 each of these sciences contributed 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.149
 for understanding the behavior 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.050
 organizational structure with regard to

 in respect of the group and in what 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.219
 refers to the organizational system 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 but it's very important we have 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.680
 issues that have charged this 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.159
 which sciences have contributed to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.170
 which studies and which unit of 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.229
 This analysis is very important. 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.240
 let us see then that the psychology that arises 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.649
 from the 1930s onwards contributing 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 much for the understanding of

 understanding of the individual 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.579
 then studies like human learning 

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:38.929

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.509
 understand the individual and have been 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.259
 contributions of psychology 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.709
 let us also see sociology, sociology 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.380

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:00.289
 the group as well as the understanding of

 see we will have the opportunity here with 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.960
 these tips and analyze some issues 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.420
 which have already been collected in respect of 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.320
 framework and systematic relationship 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.040
 sciences with some studies that 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.810

 applied for anac 2002 12 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.300
 the question thus says the contributions of 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.930

 from an erroneous point of view 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.350
 of science 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.460
 Another question also asked in ANAC 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.940
 2012 see the studies developed there 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.610
 by the political sciences on the

 understanding the behaviors 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.910
 individual in zon 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.210

 policies that actually contributed 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.729

 system we have several groups within 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.210
 of these groups we have indy glasses and 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.190

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.840
 contributions with a few lines 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.810
