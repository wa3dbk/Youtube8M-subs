design stylists now let's get started

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.569 
design stylists now let's get started
with<00:00:30.000> our<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.210> tutorial<00:00:36.950> now<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.460> have

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
with our first tutorial now that we have

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
with our first tutorial now that we have
a<00:00:38.610> designer<00:00:39.000> account<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
a designer account we can go in and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.889 
a designer account we can go in and
start<00:00:40.649> digitizing<00:00:40.829> our<00:00:41.370> patterns<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.690> let's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
start digitizing our patterns so let's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.459 
start digitizing our patterns so let's
take<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> look<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> designer<00:00:44.250> interface

particular button or item does whilst
developing<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.640> shapers<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.990> let's<00:01:25.170> take<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
developing your shapers so let's take a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.990 
developing your shapers so let's take a
look<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.799> some<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> CAD<00:01:26.369> drawings<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.909> we

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
look at some of the CAD drawings that we

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.929 
look at some of the CAD drawings that we
have<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.930> interface<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.759> we'll<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
have in this interface so we'll just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
have in this interface so we'll just
drop<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> look<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> DTN<00:01:31.590> files

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
drop down here and look at the DTN files

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.300 
drop down here and look at the DTN files
and<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.470> Daisy<00:01:34.920> hat

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and right here we have the Daisy hat

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
and right here we have the Daisy hat
frame<00:01:35.579> let's<00:01:35.820> take<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> look<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.720> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
frame let's take a look at that and that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.980 
frame let's take a look at that and that
pattern<00:01:37.710> will<00:01:38.009> load<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.150> will<00:01:39.299> load<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
pattern will load and it will load up to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
pattern will load and it will load up to
the<00:01:40.140> size<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.890> particular<00:01:41.250> model<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.610> we

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the size of the particular model that we

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
the size of the particular model that we
want<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.299> we're<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.659> sending<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.200> for

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
want and we're just sending this up for

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.330 
want and we're just sending this up for
a<00:01:43.670> size<00:01:44.670> 18<00:01:45.000> inches<00:01:45.680> fits<00:01:46.680> conveniently<00:01:46.890> on

a size 18 inches fits conveniently on

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
a size 18 inches fits conveniently on
one<00:01:47.549> page<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
one page here as you can see we have the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.219 
one page here as you can see we have the
scale<00:01:49.740> system<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> 1<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.329> 2<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
scale system if we go up to 1 to 2 that

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
scale system if we go up to 1 to 2 that
would<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> 4<00:01:52.860> page<00:01:53.159> layout<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:54.210> would

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
would be a 4 page layout that would

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.450 
would be a 4 page layout that would
allow<00:01:54.899> us<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.110> create<00:01:55.259> larger<00:01:56.040> pattern

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
allow us to create larger pattern

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.319 
allow us to create larger pattern
shapers<00:01:57.020> let's<00:01:58.020> go<00:01:58.200> back<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> 1<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> 1<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
shapers let's go back to the 1 to 1 and

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.520 
shapers let's go back to the 1 to 1 and
of<00:02:00.329> course<00:02:00.509> we'll<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:00.810> into<00:02:01.020> these<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.350> much

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
of course we'll get into these in much

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190 
of course we'll get into these in much
greater<00:02:01.560> detail<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> seam<00:02:03.240> tool<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.990> what

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
greater detail now the seam tool is what

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
greater detail now the seam tool is what
allows<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.860> set<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> parameters<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:05.820> how

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
allows you to set the parameters for how

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.839 
allows you to set the parameters for how
the<00:02:06.210> seam<00:02:06.540> attaches<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.890> pattern<00:02:08.160> shaper

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the seam attaches to your pattern shaper

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.320 
the seam attaches to your pattern shaper
so<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.319> wanted<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.069> can<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.849> access

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so if you wanted you can you have access

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
so if you wanted you can you have access
to<00:02:12.450> each<00:02:12.629> one<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.989> these<00:02:13.080> control<00:02:13.470> point

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to each one of these control point

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.490 
to each one of these control point
and<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> curve<00:02:14.190> points<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.820> they<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:16.080> in

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and the curve points and they in the in

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.560 
and the curve points and they in the in
the<00:02:16.590> control<00:02:16.950> points<00:02:17.370> list<00:02:17.670> boxes<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:18.390> and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
the control points list boxes here and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.910 
the control points list boxes here and
these<00:02:18.990> are<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.200> control<00:02:19.500> points<00:02:19.740> for<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
these are the control points for the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.800 
these are the control points for the
arcs<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.520> these<00:02:21.000> are<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> control<00:02:21.510> points

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
arcs and these are the control points

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.140 
arcs and these are the control points
for<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.740> XY<00:02:23.130> coordinates<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.790> each<00:02:23.910> one

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
for the your XY coordinates of each one

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.980 
for the your XY coordinates of each one
dividual<00:02:24.510> points<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.770> shaper<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:27.480> edit

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
dividual points in the shaper to edit

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.690 
dividual points in the shaper to edit
this<00:02:28.110> pattern<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:28.710> would<00:02:28.830> simply<00:02:29.040> select<00:02:29.580> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
this pattern we would simply select a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.130 
this pattern we would simply select a
point<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.120> we<00:02:30.240> would<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.600> edit<00:02:30.780> and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
point that we would like to edit and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
point that we would like to edit and
then<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.770> just<00:02:31.950> simply<00:02:32.280> dragging<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
then it's just simply dragging it and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.840 
then it's just simply dragging it and
moving<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.690> where<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.110> would<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.850> like

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
moving it where you would like it like

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.200 
moving it where you would like it like
so<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.600> if<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.530> want<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.770> change<00:02:38.010> an<00:02:38.160> arc<00:02:38.400> say

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
so and if you want to change an arc say

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.640 
so and if you want to change an arc say
for<00:02:39.420> example<00:02:39.810> let's<00:02:40.020> do<00:02:40.140> something<00:02:40.620> here

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
for example let's do something here

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.610 
for example let's do something here
we'll<00:02:40.800> change<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.190> back<00:02:41.310> later<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.470> go

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
we'll change it back later if you go

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.400 
we'll change it back later if you go
ahead<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.310> redraw<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.060> seam<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.660> can

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
ahead and you redraw the seam you can

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.820 
ahead and you redraw the seam you can
see<00:02:46.620> how<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.860> seam<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.430> attached<00:02:47.880> itself<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
see how the seam is attached itself to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.670 
see how the seam is attached itself to
this<00:02:49.850> particular<00:02:50.850> polygon<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.350> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
this particular polygon so that you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.890 
this particular polygon so that you
don't<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.310> worry<00:02:53.520> about<00:02:53.580> reshaping<00:02:54.510> your

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
don't have to worry about reshaping your

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.020 
don't have to worry about reshaping your
seams<00:02:55.440> after<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.190> make<00:02:56.340> alterations<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.000> your

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
seams after you make alterations to your

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.000 
seams after you make alterations to your
polygons<00:02:57.510> which<00:02:58.080> makes<00:02:58.350> editing<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.830> lot

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
polygons which makes editing a lot

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.860 
polygons which makes editing a lot
faster<00:02:59.520> plus<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.210> can<00:03:00.420> make<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:00.840> own

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
faster plus you can make your own

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.590 
faster plus you can make your own
different<00:03:01.830> designs<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.520> your<00:03:02.820> basic<00:03:03.210> pattern

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
different designs of your basic pattern

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.140 
different designs of your basic pattern
shapers<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:04.200> use<00:03:05.100> those<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.760> different

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
shapers and use those for different

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.260 
shapers and use those for different
design<00:03:06.540> options<00:03:07.430> now<00:03:08.430> let's<00:03:08.610> take<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> look<00:03:09.060> at

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
design options now let's take a look at

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.500 
design options now let's take a look at
some<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.840> other<00:03:09.990> available<00:03:11.300> drawing<00:03:12.300> soon

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
some of the other available drawing soon

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.900 
some of the other available drawing soon
we've<00:03:12.660> got<00:03:12.780> another<00:03:13.530> round<00:03:13.980> brim<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
we've got another round brim here and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.060 
we've got another round brim here and
this<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:16.020> case<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.380> want<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> make<00:03:16.770> say<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
this is in case you want to make say a

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.979 
this is in case you want to make say a
man's<00:03:17.400> hat<00:03:17.790> or<00:03:18.090> let's<00:03:18.420> say<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> mod

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
man's hat or let's say you have a mod

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.810 
man's hat or let's say you have a mod
for<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.140> man's<00:03:19.290> hat<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.770> what<00:03:20.400> I've<00:03:20.520> done<00:03:20.640> here

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
for a man's hat and what I've done here

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.550 
for a man's hat and what I've done here
is<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.030> I've<00:03:21.450> changed<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.230> want<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.410> change

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
is I I've changed this I want to change

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.780 
is I I've changed this I want to change
this<00:03:22.739> curve<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.040> little<00:03:23.190> bit<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.430> think<00:03:23.550> it's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
this curve a little bit I think it's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.030 
this curve a little bit I think it's
just<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.000> little<00:03:24.180> bit<00:03:24.390> too<00:03:24.660> bumpy<00:03:24.959> here<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.860> what

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
just a little bit too bumpy here so what

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.890 
just a little bit too bumpy here so what
I'm<00:03:26.130> going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.670> I'm<00:03:26.820> going<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.150> go<00:03:27.450> into

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go into

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.530 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go into
the<00:03:28.170> arc<00:03:28.530> here<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.070> I'm<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.700> gonna<00:03:29.940> flatten

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
the arc here and I'm just gonna flatten

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.300 
the arc here and I'm just gonna flatten
that<00:03:30.840> curve<00:03:31.110> here<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.590> give<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.830> exact<00:03:32.070> idea

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
that curve here just give the exact idea

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.880 
that curve here just give the exact idea
of<00:03:32.850> how<00:03:33.270> you<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.660> reshape<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.800> then

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
of how you can reshape that and then

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.340 
of how you can reshape that and then
simply<00:03:35.160> by<00:03:35.280> saving<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.750> saved<00:03:37.140> that

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
simply by saving that you saved that

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.670 
simply by saving that you saved that
drawing<00:03:37.770> into<00:03:38.580> your<00:03:38.760> selection<00:03:39.570> now<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.590> we

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
drawing into your selection now that we

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.110 
drawing into your selection now that we
have<00:03:40.860> all<00:03:41.040> these<00:03:41.190> different<00:03:41.370> pattern<00:03:41.940> pieces

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
have all these different pattern pieces

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.240 
have all these different pattern pieces
what<00:03:43.020> we<00:03:43.140> want<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.680> want<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.010> create

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
what we want to do is we want to create

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.370 
what we want to do is we want to create
them<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.910> way<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.540> they<00:03:45.660> get<00:03:45.810> organized

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.500 
female round brim here or our vice versa
and<00:04:07.020> that's<00:04:07.739> how<00:04:07.920> we<00:04:07.980> would<00:04:08.340> set<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.910> up<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.300> the

and that's how we would set it up in the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.680 
and that's how we would set it up in the
style<00:04:10.260> matrix<00:04:11.010> here<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.430> they<00:04:12.150> start<00:04:12.360> outfit

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
style matrix here and they start outfit

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.870 
style matrix here and they start outfit
file<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:13.620> we<00:04:13.709> go<00:04:13.800> to<00:04:13.860> Daisy<00:04:14.100> hat<00:04:14.430> here<00:04:14.670> I've

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
file so if we go to Daisy hat here I've

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.909 
file so if we go to Daisy hat here I've
just<00:04:14.910> loaded<00:04:15.390> some<00:04:15.540> patterns<00:04:15.959> into<00:04:16.230> these

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
just loaded some patterns into these

your<00:04:35.940> patterns<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.660> take<00:04:36.930> measurements<00:04:37.320> off

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
your patterns to take measurements off

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.440 
your patterns to take measurements off
your<00:04:37.770> patterns<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:38.700> that<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.330> know

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
your patterns so that you you know

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.910 
your patterns so that you you know
you're<00:04:39.690> getting<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:39.960> correct<00:04:40.320> size<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.800> you

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
you're getting the correct size that you

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.360 
you're getting the correct size that you
want<00:04:41.070> for<00:04:41.790> your<00:04:42.060> for<00:04:42.690> your<00:04:42.720> slopers<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.470> and

want for your for your slopers and and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.270 
want for your for your slopers and and
your<00:04:44.490> designs<00:04:45.620> we'll<00:04:46.620> go<00:04:46.740> into<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.010> with

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
your designs we'll go into that with

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.010 
your designs we'll go into that with
greater<00:04:47.550> detail<00:04:47.760> but<00:04:48.210> this<00:04:48.450> is<00:04:48.630> just<00:04:48.810> getting

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
greater detail but this is just getting

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.600 
greater detail but this is just getting
you<00:04:49.080> familiar<00:04:49.470> with<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.830> with<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.280> pattern

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
you familiar with the with the pattern

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.280 
you familiar with the with the pattern
design<00:04:50.940> system<00:04:51.390> that's<00:04:51.570> available<00:04:51.810> in

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
design system that's available in

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.100 
design system that's available in
designer<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:54.090> let's<00:04:54.390> get<00:04:54.540> started<00:04:54.960> with

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
designer so let's get started with

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.320 
designer so let's get started with
creating<00:04:55.410> our<00:04:55.740> very<00:04:56.040> own<00:04:56.160> or<00:04:56.610> digitizing<00:04:57.240> our

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
creating our very own or digitizing our

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.630 
creating our very own or digitizing our
own<00:04:57.450> pattern<00:04:57.870> from<00:04:58.080> scratch<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.740> then<00:04:59.460> you'll

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
own pattern from scratch and then you'll

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.370 
own pattern from scratch and then you'll
see<00:04:59.850> how<00:04:59.880> these<00:05:00.510> patterns<00:05:00.780> are<00:05:01.020> created<00:05:01.320> and

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
see how these patterns are created and

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.870 
see how these patterns are created and
how<00:05:01.500> quick<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:01.950> easy<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.430> for<00:05:02.700> you<00:05:02.790> to

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
how quick and easy it is for you to

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.640 
how quick and easy it is for you to
create<00:05:03.060> your<00:05:03.240> own<00:05:03.270> patterns<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.140> get<00:05:04.530> your

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
create your own patterns and get your

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.520 
create your own patterns and get your
own<00:05:04.680> designs<00:05:05.190> into<00:05:05.670> digital<00:05:06.210> format<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.380> that

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
own designs into digital format so that

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.680 
own designs into digital format so that
gives<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:07.950> power<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.280> edit<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:09.180> reform

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
and create the patterns exactly the way

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.650 
and create the patterns exactly the way
that<00:05:11.640> you<00:05:11.760> want<00:05:12.000> need<00:05:12.210> them<00:05:12.330> for<00:05:12.480> your
