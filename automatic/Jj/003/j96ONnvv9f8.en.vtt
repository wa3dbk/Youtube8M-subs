is<00:00:19.680> where<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> saw<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.220> first<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is where I saw it first and it is a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.759 
is where I saw it first and it is a
mallet<00:00:22.740> made<00:00:23.400> by<00:00:23.730> using<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.420> tee<00:00:24.960> fitting<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
mallet made by using a tee fitting a

mallet made by using a tee fitting a
plumbing<00:00:26.760> tee<00:00:27.000> fitting<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.289> picked

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
plumbing tee fitting now I just picked

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.939 
plumbing tee fitting now I just picked
the<00:00:29.849> inexpensive<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.960> three<00:00:31.349> dollar<00:00:31.590> one

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the inexpensive like three dollar one

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.790 
the inexpensive like three dollar one
which<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> galvanized<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.170> could<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
which is galvanized but you could get a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
which is galvanized but you could get a
brass<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.760> would<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.149> look<00:00:36.300> sharp

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
brass one and it would really look sharp

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.490 
brass one and it would really look sharp
as<00:00:37.020> well<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.850> from<00:00:39.450> wood<00:00:39.719> Smith<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
as well I got this from wood Smith a

tips which was on pinned on Pinterest I
looked<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.100> very<00:00:44.370> simple<00:00:44.820> project

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
looked it up in it's very simple project

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.080 
looked it up in it's very simple project
you<00:00:46.140> make<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> three<00:00:46.950> pieces<00:00:47.219> from<00:00:47.670> wood<00:00:47.879> on

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
you make the three pieces from wood on

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
you make the three pieces from wood on
the<00:00:48.270> lathe<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:50.010> use<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the lathe and then you actually use the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.450 
the lathe and then you actually use the
T<00:00:50.730> fitting<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.809> cut<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.350> threads<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
T fitting to cut the threads into the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
T fitting to cut the threads into the
piece<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.850> wood<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> install<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.559> into

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
piece of wood in it and install it into

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.650 
piece of wood in it and install it into
the<00:00:55.829> T<00:00:56.129> fitting<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.300> you're<00:00:57.480> done

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the T fitting and when you're done

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.310 
the T fitting and when you're done
obviously<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.420> handy-dandy<00:01:00.420> mallet

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
obviously you have a handy-dandy mallet

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
obviously you have a handy-dandy mallet
for<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.649> shop<00:01:01.920> I'm<00:01:02.219> excited<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.239> this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
for your shop I'm excited about this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.070 
for your shop I'm excited about this
project<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:05.070> more<00:01:05.400> simpler<00:01:05.939> than

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
project it can be much more simpler than

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.570 
project it can be much more simpler than
this<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> wouldn't<00:01:07.770> even<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.220> have

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this and you wouldn't even really have

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
this and you wouldn't even really have
to<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> lathe<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> don't<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
to have a lathe if you don't have a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
to have a lathe if you don't have a
lathe<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.619> could<00:01:10.860> shape<00:01:11.159> these<00:01:11.460> pieces<00:01:11.820> by

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
lathe you could shape these pieces by

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.890 
lathe you could shape these pieces by
hand<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.619> cut<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.600> tenon<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> end

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
hand and then cut the tenon on the end

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.350 
hand and then cut the tenon on the end
of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> piece<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> thread<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.150> way

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
of the piece and thread it in that way

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:39.840 
of the piece and thread it in that way
let's<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.140> ahead<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.439> started

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.830 

I've<00:01:40.850> filed<00:01:41.569> these<00:01:41.960> grooves<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:44.420> can<00:01:44.569> see

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
I've filed these grooves you can see

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:54.099 
I've filed these grooves you can see
that<00:01:45.079> in<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:51.789> have<00:01:52.789> four<00:01:53.149> locations<00:01:53.659> around

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
that in the have four locations around

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.120 
that in the have four locations around
the<00:01:54.939> tube<00:01:56.259> that<00:01:57.259> will<00:01:57.409> help<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.859> cutting

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the tube that will help in cutting

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.770 
the tube that will help in cutting
threads<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.909> wood<00:01:59.090> when<00:01:59.270> we<00:01:59.420> screw<00:01:59.750> it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
threads in the wood when we screw it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.729 
threads in the wood when we screw it
into<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:01.179> piece<00:02:04.810> okay<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:05.840> have<00:02:05.989> a<00:02:06.020> blank<00:02:06.469> that

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
into the piece okay I have a blank that

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.339 
into the piece okay I have a blank that
I've<00:02:06.920> made<00:02:07.159> for<00:02:07.849> this<00:02:08.090> project<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.869> glued<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:09.229> a

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
I've made for this project I glued up a

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.140 
I've made for this project I glued up a
couple<00:02:09.649> pieces<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.429> hard<00:02:12.610> white<00:02:13.610> oak<00:02:13.879> that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
couple pieces of the hard white oak that

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.569 
couple pieces of the hard white oak that
I<00:02:14.180> had<00:02:14.450> left<00:02:14.720> over<00:02:14.870> from<00:02:15.140> another<00:02:15.290> project

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
I had left over from another project

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.640 
I had left over from another project
this<00:02:16.579> stuff<00:02:16.849> really<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.390> hard<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.079> think<00:02:18.410> it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
this stuff really is hard I think it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.050 
this stuff really is hard I think it
will<00:02:18.709> work<00:02:18.769> great<00:02:18.890> for<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.459> mallet

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
will work great for a mallet

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.660 
will work great for a mallet
so<00:02:20.510> I've<00:02:20.900> glued<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.349> up<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.739> I'm<00:02:21.829> going<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.340> cut

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
so I've glued it up and I'm going to cut

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.660 
so I've glued it up and I'm going to cut
a<00:02:22.879> round<00:02:23.209> tenon<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.230> end<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:25.400> fit

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
a round tenon on this end that will fit

00:02:25.670 --> 00:03:06.640 
a round tenon on this end that will fit
inside<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.540> t-connector

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.040 

okay<00:03:07.650> I've<00:03:07.740> got<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.980> first<00:03:08.540> connection<00:03:09.540> on

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
okay I've got the first connection on

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.300 
okay I've got the first connection on
and<00:03:10.920> this'll<00:03:11.340> be<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> handle<00:03:12.770> it<00:03:13.770> took<00:03:14.040> quite

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
and this'll be the handle it took quite

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.960 
and this'll be the handle it took quite
a<00:03:14.370> bit<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:15.890> squeaking<00:03:16.890> there<00:03:17.099> quite<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
a bit of just squeaking there quite a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.710 
a bit of just squeaking there quite a
bit<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.360> trial<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.870> error<00:03:19.730> but<00:03:20.730> I've<00:03:21.209> got<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
bit of trial and error but I've got it

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.949 
bit of trial and error but I've got it
all<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.290> threads<00:03:22.650> cut<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.280> wood<00:03:23.959> simply

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
all the threads cut in the wood simply

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.020 
all the threads cut in the wood simply
using<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.530> tee<00:03:25.709> fitting<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.459> had<00:03:26.700> filed

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
using the tee fitting that I had filed

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.260 
using the tee fitting that I had filed
those<00:03:27.390> grooves<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:29.550> put<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
those grooves in and I put it in the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.370 
those grooves in and I put it in the
vise<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.930> then<00:03:31.769> put<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.840> clamp<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.260> other

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
vise and then put a clamp on the other

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.120 
vise and then put a clamp on the other
end<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.830> here<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.610> order<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.180> turn<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.900> into<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
end of here in order to turn it into the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.270 
end of here in order to turn it into the
tee<00:03:38.880> fitting<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:40.410> still<00:03:40.680> snug<00:03:40.980> but

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
tee fitting and it's still snug but

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.740 
tee fitting and it's still snug but
that's<00:03:41.489> that's<00:03:41.790> okay<00:03:41.940> that's<00:03:42.360> what<00:03:42.510> we're

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
cut in it put this back on the lathe

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.210 
cut in it put this back on the lathe
will<00:04:14.370> turn<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.760> handle<00:04:15.769> then<00:04:16.769> we'll<00:04:16.950> go<00:04:17.100> from

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
will turn the handle then we'll go from

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:39.210 
will turn the handle then we'll go from
there

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.480

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
you got the basic shape I wanted a few

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.670 
you got the basic shape I wanted a few
beads<00:04:42.760> here<00:04:43.120> just<00:04:43.390> a<00:04:43.510> little<00:04:43.750> decoration<00:04:44.290> and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
beads here just a little decoration and

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.700 
beads here just a little decoration and
I've<00:04:45.580> sanded<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:46.180> some<00:04:46.480> and<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:47.230> think<00:04:47.530> that's

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
I've sanded it some and I think that's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.950 
I've sanded it some and I think that's
going<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:47.980> make<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:48.130> great<00:04:48.430> handle<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.600> we're

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
going to go ahead and part this off sand

going to go ahead and part this off sand
up<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.540> end<00:04:52.690> here<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.960> little<00:04:53.200> bit<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:54.450> install

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
ought to make a great mallet surface

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.550 
ought to make a great mallet surface
because<00:07:33.190> it's<00:07:33.400> so<00:07:33.580> hard<00:07:34.020> I've<00:07:35.020> thoroughly
