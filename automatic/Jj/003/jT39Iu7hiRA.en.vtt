00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.810 
the end I think ultimately you know came
down<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.619> often<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> read<00:01:40.950> miles<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.310> gave<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.640> I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
down so often to read miles we gave up I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.499 
down so often to read miles we gave up I
think<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.829> play<00:01:43.829> great<00:01:44.070> defense<00:01:44.479> held<00:01:45.479> them

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
think on play great defense held them

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.980 
think on play great defense held them
forty<00:01:46.439> three<00:01:46.560> percent<00:01:46.649> shooting<00:01:47.840> but<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
forty three percent shooting but we

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.359 
forty three percent shooting but we
didn't<00:01:49.170> finish<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> job<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> got

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
didn't finish the job you know you got

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
didn't finish the job you know you got
it<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.549> got<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> rebound<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.250> think

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it you got to get the rebound I think

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.940 
it you got to get the rebound I think
everywhere<00:01:53.700> else<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.710> like<00:01:55.710> their

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
everywhere else you know like their

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.700 
everywhere else you know like their
energy<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:57.329> play<00:01:57.540> well<00:01:57.750> offensively<00:01:58.110> well

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
energy we play well offensively well

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.730 
energy we play well offensively well
enough<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> win<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.350> play<00:02:01.500> great

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
enough to win it would play great

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
enough to win it would play great
defense<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.610> finishing<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.090> some<00:02:03.149> place

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

how much of that was just the way that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.859
