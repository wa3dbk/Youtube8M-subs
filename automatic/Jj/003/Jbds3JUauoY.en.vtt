00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello people here should be bomb loni 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.550
 axel lucassen is the mobile tv and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.889
 Today we make a video of that 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.030
 incident before, that is, more specifically 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.420
 upgrade video 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.180
 I build the mpu this today 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.400
 I have quite cheap on ebay 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 I bought somehow for 40 years 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.420
 euro get that right stable 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.610
 steel drive shafts so really solid 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.730
 the front parts you screw 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.260
 here they have diameter 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.899
 here two millimeters so for the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.329
 wrench two millimeters and 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.410
 You can do it like the original ones 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.190
 take out here so switch right 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.960
 good together 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.890
 and I need that now in the video 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.219
 Today I am still holding new ones 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.430
 Tires bought his ansmann racing 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.470
 I got tyson for 15 euros 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.939
 have quite good profile with the coming 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.390
 you really good through the terrain 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.490
 so nice sticky so comes through good 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.950
 in any case and then 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.640
 even here they also ventilate this one 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 by hansmann 12 euro to the cost Yes 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.610
 then we'll do the rhine in the back 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.570
 now the first time the span axle 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.070
 and then you can do it here too 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 take everything apart here 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.540
 first of all the request with the client 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.200
 make that is still the plastic 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.390
 just with that but were still there 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.939
 such i do not know or suspect now 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.439
 steel to steel council with takers 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.740
 supplied and of course that needs 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:00.240
 then you can already get in there already 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.710
 from making so that we have the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.780
 plastic part already outside 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.179
 that's how it looks 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.720
 and then the others share that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.720
 counterpart 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.600
 one can not so well off wm 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.670
 stabilizer as if the whole 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.450
 Drive will be out there so looks now 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.060
 yes it is simple and too unstable 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.800
 The hot too often if you do the part up 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.400
 Three worth it and that's why I do too 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:46.080
 the steel parts first then yes only then 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:47.760
 so do it here and then loctite 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.930
 because it will probably 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:58.260
 quickly come off as a bit off the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.680
 so and then you can already that part 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.680
 install 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.269
 the parts are pretty heavy so 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.879
 is there of course it is hard on everyone 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:21.879
 then it is at least 400 grams 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:24.870
 or the more so just for fun as a comment 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:28.110
 in addition, because it is of course difficult 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.900
 and maybe it gets slower or slower 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.489
 Tires use up quickly so it 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.379
 dress properly and then we have that 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.319
 a piece of trainer so it looks 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:42.760
 Now off so and then you can too 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.139
 actually the opposite pure 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.599
 make it so I do it one more time 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:55.590
 little new high-performance fed from us 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.590
 bought purely in the hardware store 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.120
 10 euro that's how I do it here 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:08.220
 that's a little bit 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.220
 better slip in here again 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.430
 somehow 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:29.210
 So solid yourself and then you can 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:32.850
 turn the tension on again 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:38.130
 also with a bit loctite metal on 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.710
 metal so metal screw in metal 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.530
 always thread a bit loctite 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:54.620
 otherwise it always goes a bit 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:58.970
 So it will be easy 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.970
 in there and now it looks like 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:07.680
 this in any case already now 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.770
 inside here on the other times here 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.130
 I've already done it and 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.130
 now the advice with takers 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.479
 whose other wheel I know 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.130
 Not like the hot ones you klimt 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.650
 just so with a little bath 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.360
 screw here so that's here 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.880
 not even this little pin here where 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.240
 I have it in the not to 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.169
 small pen here you can see it that way 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.240
 we do not have yes and then just too 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:45.930
 again a little bit 3 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:47.699
 have I also believe that one 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.870
 screw and then of course one 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.870
 a little bit more time 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:15.050
 that's what it looks like now is the mature 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.050
 and the xcs cleaned up 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:23.430
 everywhere did not just built it that way 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.640
 We'll do it on the 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.410
 video with the new mature also so in 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.050
 which I think that is actually 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:36.710
 looks pretty good to the black tire 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.910
 where it then yes thanks for watching 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.370
 if you want the video 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.950
 he could have liked me or us 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.390
 like to go up and down to the 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.390
 next time thanks to from
