00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:54.069
 ask seconds so 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:56.830
 all that this moment adds to you 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.130
 when you play survival you can 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.250
 switch to this creative here 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.590
 see here but this is when it is impossible 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.890
 touch the community break give three modes 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.780
 that is, this survival is creative and just 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.120
 Paris where you can't be charmed 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.230
 walk watch there piggy even a couple 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.690
 snooping can kill 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.959
 Tomatoes land I know that you can not touch 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.970

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:37.810
 Here is what sits there day 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.810
 This day is shorter than the night, too, this night 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.560
 the complexity is peaceful lung there is normal 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.380
 that is, if you check 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:55.620
 where you pledged then damn well let's say you 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:55.620
 stand on a tree survival mode on 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.180
 although you have no life, or you can 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.570
 view the tablet alone 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.580

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.260

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:35.530
 so you have diamonds prices per block 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.260

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.230

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.170

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.600

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.760

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.870

 and we can all these items to remove them 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:26.590

 make my own potion and love it here too 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.210
 can be done but it's not knowing 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.780
 It uses the main ones, that is, these 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:51.129
 and these but sometimes this is all 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.929
 In principle, I do not use anything anymore. 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.899
