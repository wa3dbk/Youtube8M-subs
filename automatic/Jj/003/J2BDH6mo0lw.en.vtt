00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.999 

I<00:01:26.020> think<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.140> can<00:01:27.320> hold<00:01:27.500> one<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.860> biggest

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
I think it can hold one of the biggest

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.530 
I think it can hold one of the biggest
waves<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.430> world<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.759> mean<00:01:29.090> if<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:29.330> look<00:01:29.479> at

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
waves in the world I mean if we look at

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.910 
waves in the world I mean if we look at
all<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.750> loads<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.110> come<00:01:30.619> around<00:01:30.740> the
