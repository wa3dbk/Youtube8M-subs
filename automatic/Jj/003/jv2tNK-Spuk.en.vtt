00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.220 
bank line and a liter of braided line
and<00:00:22.949> then<00:00:23.039> monofilament<00:00:23.869> use<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> couple

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and then monofilament use a couple

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.330 
and then monofilament use a couple
different<00:00:25.470> flies<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.070> I'm<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
different flies out here I'm going to

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.419 
different flies out here I'm going to
use<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.849> sink<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:28.019> float<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:29.189> big

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
use some that sink some float some big

use some that sink some float some big
some<00:00:29.640> small<00:00:29.699> strike<00:00:30.420> indicator<00:00:30.869> no<00:00:31.019> strike

some small strike indicator no strike
indicator<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.700> experimentation

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
indicator just do some experimentation

out<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:33.870> well<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> guess<00:00:34.680> fish<00:00:34.950> seem

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
out here see well I guess fish seem

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.889 
out here see well I guess fish seem
pretty<00:00:35.309> aggressive<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:35.969> yesterday<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
pretty aggressive out here yesterday so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.880

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I figured this would be a good place to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100 
I figured this would be a good place to
test<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.610> theories<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> $0.18<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.780> angling

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
test the theories of $0.18 your angling

00:00:40.110 --> 00:01:06.760 
test the theories of $0.18 your angling
