that<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:41.709> have<00:02:41.859> time<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:43.269> talk<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.750> person

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
that we have time to talk to the person

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.500 
that we have time to talk to the person
and<00:02:44.500> let<00:02:44.620> them<00:02:44.799> know<00:02:44.980> we<00:02:45.400> are<00:02:45.579> what<00:02:45.910> we<00:02:46.060> do<00:02:46.269> I
