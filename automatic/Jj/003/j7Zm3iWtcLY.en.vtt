zangoose well it could be but I'm not

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.360 
zangoose well it could be but I'm not
sure<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:40.320> might<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.500> other<00:03:40.800> battles<00:03:41.220> that

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
sure there might be other battles that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.270 
sure there might be other battles that
have<00:03:41.550> been<00:03:41.730> suggested<00:03:42.620> just<00:03:43.620> as<00:03:43.770> frequently

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
have been suggested just as frequently

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.610 
have been suggested just as frequently
but<00:03:46.220> since<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.520> says<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.200> quite<00:03:49.590> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
but since it says that it's a quite a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.060 
but since it says that it's a quite a
common<00:03:50.010> suggestion<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:51.440> I'm<00:03:52.440> gonna<00:03:52.709> guess<00:03:53.040> it's

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
common suggestion I I'm gonna guess it's

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:00.590 
common suggestion I I'm gonna guess it's
