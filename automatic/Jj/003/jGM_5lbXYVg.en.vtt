don't you wouldn't expect someone
walking<00:02:56.500> out<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.650> maybe<00:02:59.650> it's<00:02:59.889> not<00:03:00.010> a

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
walking out this is maybe it's not a

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.289 
walking out this is maybe it's not a
great<00:03:00.370> example<00:03:00.639> because<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:01.060> does<00:03:01.150> have

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
great example because it does have

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.910 
great example because it does have
anything<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.780> do<00:03:01.930> with<00:03:02.079> religion<00:03:02.379> but<00:03:02.709> perhaps

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
anything to do with religion but perhaps

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.240 
anything to do with religion but perhaps
if<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.909> want<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.269> organize<00:03:04.709> even<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.799> fashion

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
if you want to organize even a fashion

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.220 
if you want to organize even a fashion
shoot<00:03:06.489> involving<00:03:07.150> some<00:03:07.450> kind<00:03:07.689> of<00:03:07.810> nakedness

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
shoot involving some kind of nakedness

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.929 
shoot involving some kind of nakedness
somewhere<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.829> Red<00:03:08.980> Square<00:03:09.159> for<00:03:09.489> example

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
somewhere on the Red Square for example

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.229 
somewhere on the Red Square for example
you<00:03:10.030> need<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.329> get<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.840> much<00:03:11.790> paperwork<00:03:12.790> sorted

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
you need to get so much paperwork sorted

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.449 
you need to get so much paperwork sorted
before<00:03:13.629> hand<00:03:14.109> so<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.620> think<00:03:14.709> maybe<00:03:14.919> that's<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
before hand so I think maybe that's the

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.250 
before hand so I think maybe that's the
issue<00:03:15.639> if<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.030> go<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.389> do<00:03:16.480> something<00:03:16.510> gonzo

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
issue if you go and do something gonzo

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.990 
issue if you go and do something gonzo
you<00:03:17.799> will<00:03:17.949> probably<00:03:18.190> face<00:03:18.609> repercussions

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
you will probably face repercussions

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.650 
you will probably face repercussions
yeah<00:03:19.900> indeed<00:03:20.829> I<00:03:20.949> just<00:03:21.129> another<00:03:21.639> point<00:03:21.940> final

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
yeah indeed I just another point final

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.180 
yeah indeed I just another point final
