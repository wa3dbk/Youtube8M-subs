digestive<00:01:40.020> tract<00:01:40.640> hormones<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.820> messengers

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
digestive tract hormones are messengers

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.560 
digestive tract hormones are messengers
that<00:01:42.829> travel<00:01:43.829> through<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.399> body<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.000> they

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that travel through your body and they

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.569 
that travel through your body and they
bring<00:01:45.750> signals<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.590> bring<00:01:46.799> messages<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
bring signals they bring messages to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
bring signals they bring messages to
different<00:01:47.909> parts<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.509> tell<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.200> needs

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
different parts to tell them what needs

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.280 
different parts to tell them what needs
to<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.740> done<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.450> hormone<00:01:51.450> insulin<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to be done so hormone insulin is the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740 
to be done so hormone insulin is the
hormone<00:01:52.439> messenger<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:54.060> tells<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.600> body

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
hormone messenger that tells your body

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.340 
hormone messenger that tells your body
ah<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.100> sugar<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.880> our<00:01:56.969> blood<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.540> we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
ah we have sugar in our blood and we

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.160 
ah we have sugar in our blood and we
need<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> convert<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.040> sugar<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.700> energy<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
need to convert that sugar to energy so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.219 
need to convert that sugar to energy so
let's<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> sugar<00:02:03.090> transported<00:02:04.020> into

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
let's get that sugar transported into

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.010 
let's get that sugar transported into
the<00:02:04.259> cells<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.310> insulin<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.540> wonderful

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the cells so insulin is this wonderful

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.979 
the cells so insulin is this wonderful
chemical<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:08.069> tells<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.670> cells<00:02:09.000> hey<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
chemical that tells the cells hey it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.100 
chemical that tells the cells hey it

have<00:02:14.990> some<00:02:15.230> sugar<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.070> need<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.580> to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
have some sugar for you I need you to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.780 
have some sugar for you I need you to
make<00:02:16.790> some<00:02:16.850> energy<00:02:17.450> okay<00:02:18.170> let<00:02:18.470> her<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.710> boom<00:02:19.130> he

sugar<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:59.209> they<00:02:59.720> shut<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.080> down<00:03:00.260> so

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
sugar in and the they shut it down so

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.800 
sugar in and the they shut it down so
what<00:03:00.770> is<00:03:00.860> insulin<00:03:01.459> do<00:03:01.670> well<00:03:02.150> what<00:03:02.480> does<00:03:02.570> any

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
what is insulin do well what does any

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.440 
what is insulin do well what does any
good<00:03:03.110> kid<00:03:03.470> do<00:03:03.709> when<00:03:03.950> they<00:03:04.040> say<00:03:04.250> mom<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:05.030> mom

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
good kid do when they say mom and mom

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.080 
good kid do when they say mom and mom
doesn't<00:03:05.780> answer<00:03:05.900> mom<00:03:06.620> mom<00:03:07.580> doesn't<00:03:07.850> answer

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
doesn't answer mom mom doesn't answer

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.670 
doesn't answer mom mom doesn't answer
mom<00:03:10.090> shouts<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.810> that's<00:03:11.989> what<00:03:12.140> insulin<00:03:12.530> does

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
mom shouts so that's what insulin does

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.050 
mom shouts so that's what insulin does
that's<00:03:12.800> what<00:03:12.920> your<00:03:13.070> pancreas<00:03:13.459> does<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.880> says

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
that's what your pancreas does it says

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.090 
that's what your pancreas does it says
okay<00:03:14.720> I'm<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:15.050> gonna<00:03:15.200> shoot<00:03:15.650> out<00:03:15.770> some<00:03:16.010> more

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
okay I'm just gonna shoot out some more

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.100 
okay I'm just gonna shoot out some more
insulin<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:17.150> shoots<00:03:17.360> out<00:03:17.540> more<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.019> more

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
insulin and it shoots out more and more

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.840 
insulin and it shoots out more and more
and<00:03:18.320> more<00:03:18.440> insulin<00:03:18.799> so<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.400> bypasses

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
and more insulin so that it bypasses

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.820 
and more insulin so that it bypasses
some<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.390> insulin<00:03:20.989> kind<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.230> forces<00:03:21.650> its

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
some of that insulin kind of forces its

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.770 
some of that insulin kind of forces its
way<00:03:21.890> in<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.700> sugar<00:03:22.910> can<00:03:23.120> force<00:03:23.360> its<00:03:23.510> way<00:03:23.630> in

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
way in the sugar can force its way in

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.479 
way in the sugar can force its way in
our<00:03:23.900> insulin<00:03:24.200> can<00:03:24.320> open<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.340> get

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
our insulin can open that and you get

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.610 
our insulin can open that and you get
some<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.690> then<00:03:26.900> there's<00:03:27.320> all<00:03:27.500> this

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
some of it in but then there's all this

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.530 
some of it in but then there's all this
sugar<00:03:27.920> left<00:03:28.220> because<00:03:28.549> all<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.820> receptors<00:03:29.390> on

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
sugar left because all the receptors on

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.039 
sugar left because all the receptors on
those<00:03:29.720> cells<00:03:29.959> are<00:03:30.080> not<00:03:30.230> open<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:32.049> what

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
those cells are not open and what

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.340 
place to store it is a belly shoots it
out<00:03:54.950> stores<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.820> as<00:03:55.910> belly<00:03:56.150> fat<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:57.260> the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
out stores it as belly fat and so the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.660 
out stores it as belly fat and so the
belly<00:03:57.500> gets<00:03:57.709> bigger<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.130> rest<00:03:58.280> of<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.519> may

because<00:04:06.290> all<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.890> sugar<00:04:07.160> you're<00:04:07.430> eating<00:04:07.640> is

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
because all the sugar you're eating is

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.220 
because all the sugar you're eating is
just<00:04:07.760> getting<00:04:08.150> converted<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.660> fat<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.110> you're

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
just getting converted to fat so you're

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.780 
just getting converted to fat so you're
getting<00:04:09.470> fatter<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.860> fatter<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.459> start

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
getting fatter and fatter so you start

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.940 
getting fatter and fatter so you start
eating<00:04:10.880> less<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.209> less<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:12.590> still<00:04:12.829> keep

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
eating less and less and you still keep

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.590 
eating less and less and you still keep
getting<00:04:13.130> fatter<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.700> fatter<00:04:13.760> because<00:04:14.269> your

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
getting fatter and fatter because your

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.310 
getting fatter and fatter because your
metabolism<00:04:14.720> shut<00:04:15.500> down<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:17.049> what<00:04:18.049> do<00:04:18.109> we<00:04:18.200> do

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320

it<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.479> also<00:05:11.840> helps<00:05:12.409> to<00:05:12.470> get<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.800> insulin

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
it it also helps to get the insulin

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.510 
it it also helps to get the insulin
receptors<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.270> calm<00:05:14.930> down<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.590> be<00:05:16.310> less

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
receptors to calm down and be less

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.939 
receptors to calm down and be less
sensitive<00:05:16.900> there's<00:05:17.900> some<00:05:18.080> nutrients<00:05:18.650> that

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
sensitive there's some nutrients that

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.969 
sensitive there's some nutrients that
you<00:05:19.069> can<00:05:19.250> take<00:05:19.870> glutamine<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.169> one<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.680> them<00:05:21.860> it

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
you can take glutamine is one of them it

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.040 
you can take glutamine is one of them it
really<00:05:22.340> helps<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.909> insulin<00:05:23.449> receptors<00:05:24.020> to

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
really helps the insulin receptors to

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.700 
really helps the insulin receptors to
open<00:05:24.560> up<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:24.949> get<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.580> blood<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.240> insulin

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
open up and get the blood the insulin

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.219 
open up and get the blood the insulin
put<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.800> sugar<00:05:27.919> in<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.159> system<00:05:29.020> chromium<00:05:30.020> is

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
put the sugar in the system chromium is

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.279 
put the sugar in the system chromium is
another<00:05:30.590> one<00:05:30.770> magnesium<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.610> another<00:05:31.849> one<00:05:32.060> but

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
another one magnesium is another one but

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.200 
another one magnesium is another one but
at<00:05:33.289> the<00:05:33.590> heart<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.919> it<00:05:34.099> no<00:05:34.520> matter<00:05:34.729> how<00:05:35.030> much

sugar you're going to have the same

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.439 
sugar you're going to have the same
problem<00:06:01.190> so<00:06:01.310> you<00:06:01.370> have<00:06:01.639> to<00:06:01.819> start<00:06:02.210> with<00:06:02.330> the

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
problem so you have to start with the

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.830 
problem so you have to start with the
basic<00:06:02.900> situation<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:03.680> have<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:03.949> start<00:06:04.490> with

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
basic situation you have to start with

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.450 
basic situation you have to start with
changing<00:06:05.840> the<00:06:05.930> day<00:06:06.080> sometimes<00:06:06.710> it<00:06:07.009> does<00:06:07.190> help

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
changing the day sometimes it does help

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.450 
changing the day sometimes it does help
to<00:06:07.610> eat<00:06:08.090> to<00:06:08.750> take<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:09.800> nutrients<00:06:10.250> at<00:06:10.370> the

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
to eat to take the nutrients at the

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.700 
to eat to take the nutrients at the
beginning<00:06:10.930> because<00:06:11.930> one<00:06:12.139> of<00:06:12.169> the<00:06:12.319> things<00:06:12.530> that

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
beginning because one of the things that

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.740 
beginning because one of the things that
happens<00:06:13.190> when<00:06:13.819> you<00:06:14.030> have<00:06:14.060> this<00:06:14.360> insulin

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
happens when you have this insulin

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.700 
happens when you have this insulin
resistance<00:06:15.229> problem<00:06:15.710> is<00:06:15.889> that<00:06:17.229> your<00:06:18.229> cells

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
resistance problem is that your cells

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.790 
resistance problem is that your cells
are<00:06:19.060> shooting<00:06:20.060> out<00:06:20.210> messages<00:06:20.840> that<00:06:21.380> say<00:06:21.650> we

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
are shooting out messages that say we

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.189 
are shooting out messages that say we
need<00:06:21.979> more<00:06:22.190> food<00:06:22.400> we<00:06:23.180> need<00:06:23.389> more<00:06:23.569> food<00:06:23.870> even

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
need more food we need more food even

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.930 
need more food we need more food even
though<00:06:24.289> you've<00:06:24.440> eaten<00:06:24.560> plenty<00:06:25.039> we<00:06:25.520> need<00:06:25.729> more

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
though you've eaten plenty we need more

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.909 
though you've eaten plenty we need more
food<00:06:26.210> because<00:06:26.419> it's<00:06:26.690> not<00:06:26.900> making<00:06:27.169> it<00:06:27.469> in<00:06:27.650> and

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
food because it's not making it in and

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.860 
food because it's not making it in and
so<00:06:28.490> your<00:06:28.639> appetite<00:06:29.120> goes<00:06:29.270> up<00:06:29.419> and<00:06:29.599> what<00:06:29.750> do<00:06:29.810> you

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
so your appetite goes up and what do you

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.140 
so your appetite goes up and what do you
crave<00:06:30.139> you<00:06:30.349> crave<00:06:30.560> carbs<00:06:31.190> you<00:06:31.580> crave<00:06:31.819> sugar

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
crave you crave carbs you crave sugar

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.080 
crave you crave carbs you crave sugar
and<00:06:32.690> so<00:06:32.870> people<00:06:33.080> with<00:06:33.319> this<00:06:33.440> insulin

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
and so people with this insulin

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.550 
and so people with this insulin
I'll<00:06:34.510> eat<00:06:34.660> a<00:06:34.690> meal<00:06:34.900> and<00:06:34.930> then<00:06:35.169> there's<00:06:35.320> still

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
I'll eat a meal and then there's still

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.870 
I'll eat a meal and then there's still
want<00:06:35.770> more<00:06:36.010> they<00:06:36.610> want<00:06:36.910> sugar<00:06:37.360> and<00:06:38.639> so<00:06:39.639> what

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
want more they want sugar and so what

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.030 
want more they want sugar and so what
you<00:06:39.970> can<00:06:40.150> do<00:06:40.360> is<00:06:40.630> start<00:06:41.050> by<00:06:41.080> helping<00:06:41.830> with<00:06:42.010> some

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
you can do is start by helping with some

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.040 
you can do is start by helping with some
of<00:06:42.280> the<00:06:42.340> nutrients<00:06:42.880> giving<00:06:43.660> it<00:06:43.750> some<00:06:43.900> B

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
of the nutrients giving it some B

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.810 
of the nutrients giving it some B
vitamins<00:06:44.080> that's<00:06:44.770> another<00:06:44.979> thing<00:06:45.280> that<00:06:45.520> we

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
vitamins that's another thing that we

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.340 
vitamins that's another thing that we
talked<00:06:46.000> about<00:06:46.120> in<00:06:46.240> another<00:06:46.330> video<00:06:46.600> B<00:06:46.930> vitamins
