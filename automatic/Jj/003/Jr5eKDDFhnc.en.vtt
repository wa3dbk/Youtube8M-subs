monster you're attacking there are two

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.979 
monster you're attacking there are two
ways<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> resolve<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.849> battle<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.990> wait<00:00:31.289> yeah

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
ways to resolve a battle to wait yeah

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.870 
ways to resolve a battle to wait yeah
the<00:00:33.989> first<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.800> happens<00:00:35.280> when<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> attack

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the first way happens when you attack

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.520 
the first way happens when you attack
your<00:00:36.059> opponent's<00:00:36.540> monster<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.410> attack

your opponent's monster that's in attack
position<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.030> other<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.170> attack

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
position the other is when you attack

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
position the other is when you attack
your<00:00:40.620> opponent's<00:00:41.070> monster<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.670> defense

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
position in defense position a monster

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.630 
position in defense position a monster
can<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.270> either<00:00:45.420> face<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.260> face<00:00:46.350> down<00:00:46.800> but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
can be either face up or face down but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.630 
can be either face up or face down but
that<00:00:47.789> doesn't<00:00:47.940> affect<00:00:48.360> damage<00:00:48.780> calculation

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
that doesn't affect damage calculation

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
that doesn't affect damage calculation
now<00:00:50.640> explain<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> calculate<00:00:51.870> damage<00:00:52.530> both

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
now explain how to calculate damage both

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.380 
now explain how to calculate damage both
ways<00:00:53.100> Oh<00:00:54.199> calculations<00:00:55.199> uh-oh<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.149> pretty

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
ways Oh calculations uh-oh it was pretty

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.439 
ways Oh calculations uh-oh it was pretty
bad<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.899> math<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:59.160> true<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.329> just

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
bad at math that's not true it's just

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.689 
bad at math that's not true it's just
simple<00:01:01.140> subtraction<00:01:01.320> Leo<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.340> don't<00:01:02.520> worry

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
simple subtraction Leo so don't worry

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.140 
simple subtraction Leo so don't worry
I'm<00:01:03.300> gonna<00:01:03.660> explain<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.530> stay<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.129> me<00:01:05.369> okay

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I'm gonna explain so stay with me okay

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960 
I'm gonna explain so stay with me okay
