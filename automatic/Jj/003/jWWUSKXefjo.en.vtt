all<00:00:01.680> right<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:01.949> decided<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.580> make<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> little

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
all right I decided to make a little

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.079 
all right I decided to make a little
video<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:04.190> wire<00:00:05.190> your<00:00:05.430> fan<00:00:05.730> up<00:00:05.910> to

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
video on how to wire your fan up to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.070 
video on how to wire your fan up to
where<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.330> can<00:00:06.480> have<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> little<00:00:06.960> toggle

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
where you can have a little toggle

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.810 
where you can have a little toggle
switch<00:00:07.500> where<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.099> can<00:00:08.220> turn<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.610> whenever

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
switch where you can turn it on whenever

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.370 
switch where you can turn it on whenever
you<00:00:09.000> want<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.570> don't<00:00:09.780> have<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.080> rely<00:00:10.349> on

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
you want so you don't have to rely on

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.180 
you want so you don't have to rely on
the<00:00:11.929> thermostat<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.139> automatically<00:00:13.830> turn<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the thermostat to automatically turn it

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.359 
the thermostat to automatically turn it
on<00:00:14.570> you<00:00:15.570> just<00:00:15.870> flip<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> switch<00:00:16.770> right<00:00:17.160> there

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
on you just flip a switch right there

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.779 
on you just flip a switch right there
and<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> turns<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.940> fan<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> did<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and it turns a fan on so what I did is I

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.800 
and it turns a fan on so what I did is I
took<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:21.500> old<00:00:22.500> fan<00:00:23.119> right<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> found

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
took an old fan right here that I found

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.599 
took an old fan right here that I found
in<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.019> garage<00:00:25.109> had<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> switch<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> back

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
in my garage had the switch on the back

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.140 
in my garage had the switch on the back
on<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:26.939> plate<00:00:27.210> right<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:29.029> it<00:00:30.029> would

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
on this plate right here and it would

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
on this plate right here and it would
hook<00:00:30.330> into<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.199> car<00:00:31.500> cigarette<00:00:31.830> lighter<00:00:32.279> so

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
hook into a car cigarette lighter so

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.069 
hook into a car cigarette lighter so
that's<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> power<00:00:33.570> source

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that's the power source

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.650 
that's the power source
so<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> took<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.649> side<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.180> switch<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
so I took the side of the switch that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389 
so I took the side of the switch that
goes<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> power<00:00:37.320> source<00:00:37.710> which<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.129> happen

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
goes to the power source which is happen

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.840 
goes to the power source which is happen
to<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.930> wired<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> around

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
to be this and I wired it around

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.580 
to be this and I wired it around
underneath<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.059> frame<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> can't<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
underneath the frame so you can't see it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.119 
underneath the frame so you can't see it
until<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.890> there's<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> little

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
until right here and there's a little

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.119 
until right here and there's a little
tiny<00:00:47.430> hole<00:00:47.730> underneath<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> battery<00:00:49.129> rice

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
tiny hole underneath the battery rice

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.270 
tiny hole underneath the battery rice
stuck<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> wire<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.620> then<00:00:52.620> connected<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
stuck the wire up and then connected it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.450 
stuck the wire up and then connected it
accordingly<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> positive<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.840> negative

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
accordingly to the positive and negative

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
accordingly to the positive and negative
would<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.640> want<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> make<00:00:57.180> sure<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.629> or<00:00:57.840> else

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
would you want to make sure of or else

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.010 
would you want to make sure of or else
it<00:00:58.140> will<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:58.440> burning<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:59.690> then<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> did

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it will start burning up then what I did

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.889 
it will start burning up then what I did
I<00:01:01.379> took<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.039> side<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.670> goes<00:01:02.910> into<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I took the side that goes into the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.750 
I took the side that goes into the
actual<00:01:04.199> fan<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.739> controls<00:01:05.129> whether<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.549> on

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
actual fan that controls whether it's on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.310 
actual fan that controls whether it's on
fast<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.630> slow<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.770> ran<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.280> down<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
fast or slow and I ran that down to the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.429 
fast or slow and I ran that down to the
radiator<00:01:10.680> fans<00:01:11.100> power<00:01:11.490> which<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:12.900> here

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
radiator fans power which is right here

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.730 
radiator fans power which is right here
and<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.400> still<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> plugged<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> it'll

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and I still have it plugged in so it'll

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.030 
and I still have it plugged in so it'll
still<00:01:16.979> work<00:01:17.009> off<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> thermostat<00:01:18.170> even<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.290> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
still work off the thermostat even if I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.330 
still work off the thermostat even if I
don't<00:01:20.700> turn<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> switch<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.590> cut

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
don't turn the switch on and I just cut

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.640 
don't turn the switch on and I just cut
away<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> plastic<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.290> expose

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
away a little bit of a plastic to expose

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.310 
away a little bit of a plastic to expose
the<00:01:25.830> wire<00:01:26.009> wrap<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> wire<00:01:27.180> around<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.840> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the wire wrap the wire around it and I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.280 
the wire wrap the wire around it and I
wrapped<00:01:29.100> electrical<00:01:29.790> tape<00:01:30.079> around<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
wrapped electrical tape around the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
wrapped electrical tape around the
positive<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.920> negative<00:01:32.220> side<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.759> keep

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
positive and negative side just to keep

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.910 
positive and negative side just to keep
them<00:01:33.060> separate<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.530> touch<00:01:34.680> it'll

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
them separate because if it touch it'll

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
them separate because if it touch it'll
shorted<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.430> start<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> heat<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.500> then

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
shorted out and start to heat it up then

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
shorted out and start to heat it up then
when<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> did<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.159> wrapped<00:01:38.520> electrical<00:01:39.060> tape

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
when I did I wrapped electrical tape

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.539 
when I did I wrapped electrical tape
around<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> wires<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.070> matches

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
around the wires so it kind of matches

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.149 
around the wires so it kind of matches
with<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> rest<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> electrical

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
with the rest of the electrical

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.850 
with the rest of the electrical
components<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.470> looks<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.680> bit

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
components on here so looks a little bit

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.819 
components on here so looks a little bit
cleaner<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.840> an<00:01:49.049> easy<00:01:49.409> thumb

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
cleaner and I have this an easy thumb

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.490 
cleaner and I have this an easy thumb
range<00:01:50.149> when<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.270> riding<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.140> stuck

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
range when I'm riding so if I get stuck

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.819 
range when I'm riding so if I get stuck
in<00:01:52.590> traffic<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.340> flip<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.960> or<00:01:54.960> flip

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
in traffic I can just flip it on or flip

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.209 
in traffic I can just flip it on or flip
it<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.040> slow<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.670> any<00:01:57.469> regular<00:01:58.469> on-off<00:01:58.890> switch

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it to slow but any regular on-off switch

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.950 
it to slow but any regular on-off switch
would<00:01:59.310> work<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.490> fine<00:01:59.930> alright<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.829> it
