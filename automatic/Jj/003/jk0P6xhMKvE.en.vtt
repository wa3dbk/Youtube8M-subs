00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
values here and putting down some

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.530 
values here and putting down some
information<00:00:40.370> of<00:00:41.370> course<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:41.850> nearly<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.210> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
information of course not nearly all of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.319 
information of course not nearly all of
it<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:45.680> with<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> yellow<00:00:46.980> ocher<00:00:47.520> I'm<00:00:47.940> just

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it but with the yellow ocher I'm just

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.700 
it but with the yellow ocher I'm just
going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.629> over<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> areas<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
going to go over some of the areas that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.670 
going to go over some of the areas that
I've<00:00:49.980> already<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.379> we'll<00:00:52.379> start<00:00:52.469> up

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
I've already put down and we'll start up

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.459 
I've already put down and we'll start up
here<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> ear<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.510> I'll<00:00:54.660> start<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.140> define

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
here in the ear and I'll start to define

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.029 
here in the ear and I'll start to define
some<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> those<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:58.050> areas<00:00:58.440> they're<00:00:58.739> going

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
some of those the areas they're going

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
some of those the areas they're going
back<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.250> forth<00:00:59.640> between<00:00:59.730> my<00:01:00.030> federal

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
back and forth between my federal

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.130 
back and forth between my federal
reference<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.530> I'm<00:01:01.800> also<00:01:02.899> thinking<00:01:03.899> about

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
reference and I'm also thinking about

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.830 
reference and I'm also thinking about
the<00:01:04.379> cross<00:01:05.159> contour<00:01:05.729> lines<00:01:08.330> missed<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:10.380> part

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
the cross contour lines missed that part

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
the cross contour lines missed that part
and<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.130> Sienna<00:01:14.820> here

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and in just a little bit of Sienna here

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.830 
and in just a little bit of Sienna here
to<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> yellow<00:01:17.670> ocher<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.570> we've<00:01:18.689> already

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
to the yellow ocher that we've already

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.350 
to the yellow ocher that we've already
put<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.770> edge<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.360> people<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
put down here edge of the people a

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.590 
put down here edge of the people a
little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.479> lighter<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:25.650> around<00:01:26.009> here

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
little bit lighter right around here

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.730 
little bit lighter right around here
I<00:01:31.340> thought<00:01:32.340> was<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.700> conducive<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.560> just

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
I thought was a conducive so I'm just

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
I thought was a conducive so I'm just
switch<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> black<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> white

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
switch over to the black and the white

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.039 
switch over to the black and the white
now<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.340> we're<00:01:38.970> gonna<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.299> ahead<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> start

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
now and we're gonna go ahead and start

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
now and we're gonna go ahead and start
defining<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.740> form<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> face<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
defining the form of the face now that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.070 
defining the form of the face now that
we've<00:01:42.149> got<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.360> good<00:01:42.600> amount<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.930> information

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
we've got a good amount of information

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.039 
we've got a good amount of information
it<00:01:43.920> kind<00:01:44.190> of<00:01:44.220> dilutes<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> pigment<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.720> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it kind of dilutes the pigment a bit so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.240 
it kind of dilutes the pigment a bit so
that's<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.470> something<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> keep<00:01:47.009> them<00:01:47.220> on

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
that's just something to keep them on

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
that's just something to keep them on
all<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> other<00:01:51.299> side<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:52.080> the

the<00:03:57.810> whites<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.859> I'm<00:03:59.250> kind<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.519> trying<00:03:59.849> to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the whites and I'm kind of trying to

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.420 
the whites and I'm kind of trying to
concentrate<00:04:00.299> on<00:04:00.690> just<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.590> shapes<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.130> I'm

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
concentrate on just the shapes that I'm

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.159 
concentrate on just the shapes that I'm
seeing<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.269> I'm<00:04:03.450> filling<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.049> those

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169

seeing and as I'm filling in those
shapes<00:04:04.819> I'm<00:04:05.819> thinking<00:04:06.599> about<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.840> crossing

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
and sometimes you just have to let go of

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.920 
and sometimes you just have to let go of

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
that I will share with you that will

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.870 
that I will share with you that will
kind<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.710> help<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.190> get<00:04:46.370> in<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.640> mode<00:04:46.850> of

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
kind of help you get in the mode of

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.460 
kind of help you get in the mode of
recognizing<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.850> lines<00:04:50.120> shapes<00:04:50.750> as<00:04:51.110> laurels

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
recognizing the lines shapes as laurels

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.260 
recognizing the lines shapes as laurels
into<00:04:51.710> cobalt<00:04:52.280> blue<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:52.790> I've<00:04:52.880> actually

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
into cobalt blue so I've actually

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.990 
into cobalt blue so I've actually
switched<00:04:53.540> blue<00:04:53.870> here<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.700> see<00:04:55.700> how<00:04:55.820> this

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
switched blue here and see how this

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.060 
switched blue here and see how this
looks<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.540> again<00:04:56.780> if<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.080> doesn't<00:04:57.470> look<00:04:57.650> the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
looks and again if it doesn't look the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.430 
looks and again if it doesn't look the
way<00:04:58.280> I<00:04:58.400> want<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:59.870> can<00:05:00.020> always<00:05:00.169> go<00:05:00.410> to

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
way I want it to you can always go to

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.790 
way I want it to you can always go to
the<00:05:00.680> top<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:02.510> is<00:05:02.870> important<00:05:03.560> in

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
the top of it it is important in

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.230 
the top of it it is important in
deciding<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:05.210> edges<00:05:05.720> so<00:05:06.400> I<00:05:07.400> might<00:05:07.820> come<00:05:08.030> in<00:05:08.210> a

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
deciding the edges so I might come in a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.480 
deciding the edges so I might come in a
little<00:05:08.600> bit<00:05:08.750> up<00:05:08.870> here<00:05:09.110> on<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.350> ear<00:05:09.590> just<00:05:09.950> a<00:05:10.700> bit

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
little bit up here on the ear just a bit

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.580 
little bit up here on the ear just a bit
so<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.520> don't<00:05:13.640> blend<00:05:14.120> together<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:15.260> a<00:05:15.290> certain

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
so you don't blend together to a certain

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.350 
so you don't blend together to a certain
extent<00:05:15.919> but<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.669> oil<00:05:16.820> pastels<00:05:17.530> are<00:05:19.360> creamier

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
extent but the oil pastels are creamier

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.600 
extent but the oil pastels are creamier
say<00:05:21.260> they're<00:05:21.440> gonna<00:05:21.560> blend<00:05:21.919> differently

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
say they're gonna blend differently

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.050 
say they're gonna blend differently
they're<00:05:22.850> gonna<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:24.100> will<00:05:25.100> very<00:05:25.490> rarely<00:05:25.820> ever

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
they're gonna I will very rarely ever

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.260 
they're gonna I will very rarely ever
use<00:05:26.930> my<00:05:27.110> finger<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.500> blend<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:28.310> oil<00:05:28.490> pastels<00:05:29.000> I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
use my finger to blend the oil pastels I

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.760 
use my finger to blend the oil pastels I
prefer<00:05:29.600> to<00:05:29.810> kind<00:05:29.930> of<00:05:30.110> build<00:05:30.320> up<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.590> oil

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
prefer to kind of build up the oil

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.100 
prefer to kind of build up the oil
pastels<00:05:31.280> on<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.580> surface<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.270> let<00:05:32.900> the

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
pastels on the surface and let the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.620 
pastels on the surface and let the
blending<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.710> mixing<00:05:33.770> happen<00:05:34.520> with<00:05:35.300> Jessa

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
blending and mixing happen with Jessa

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:43.210 
blending and mixing happen with Jessa
I'm<00:05:35.810> just<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.169> little<00:05:36.350> bit<00:05:36.560> further

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.400 

each<00:05:43.850> time<00:05:44.120> you<00:05:44.240> add<00:05:44.420> a<00:05:44.450> little<00:05:44.810> bit<00:05:44.930> more<00:05:45.050> but

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
each time you add a little bit more but

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.500 
each time you add a little bit more but
another<00:05:45.830> color<00:05:46.130> in<00:05:46.430> there<00:05:46.610> on<00:05:46.730> the<00:05:46.880> surface<00:05:47.330> so

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
another color in there on the surface so

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.270 
another color in there on the surface so
I<00:05:47.750> really<00:05:48.230> love<00:05:48.530> drawing<00:05:49.280> with<00:05:49.460> oil<00:05:49.670> pastels
