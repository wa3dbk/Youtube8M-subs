00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
that it's a really neat game and it's a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 
that it's a really neat game and it's a
great<00:00:37.020> application<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> Fate<00:00:37.980> system<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
great application of the Fate system and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.430 
great application of the Fate system and
that<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.270> has<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> wealth<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> background

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that it has a wealth of background

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
that it has a wealth of background
available<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.059> why<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
available to it I just don't get why it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.880

had<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.690> called<00:00:42.870> rock<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.350> roll<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.649> think

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
had to be called rock and roll I think

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.440 
had to be called rock and roll I think
the<00:00:44.100> original<00:00:44.520> comic<00:00:44.879> line<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.360> was
