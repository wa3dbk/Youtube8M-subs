rodeo and everything seemed to be in
order<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.820> placed<00:01:25.720> my<00:01:26.320> scanner<00:01:26.740> on<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.010> vehicle

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
order I placed my scanner on the vehicle

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.440 
order I placed my scanner on the vehicle
to<00:01:27.820> see<00:01:27.850> if<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.510> ECM<00:01:29.200> was<00:01:29.470> functioning<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.450> did

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
to see if the ECM was functioning I did

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.870 
to see if the ECM was functioning I did
have<00:01:31.659> communication<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.619> all<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.310> data<00:01:33.460> was

placed<00:01:42.610> my<00:01:42.760> scope<00:01:43.240> unit<00:01:43.689> on<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.930> vehicle<00:01:44.409> to

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
placed my scope unit on the vehicle to

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.670 
placed my scope unit on the vehicle to
prove<00:01:44.860> out<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.070> harness<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:46.260> wanted<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.439> check

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680

all<00:01:47.950> powers<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.700> grounds<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.750> make<00:01:49.780> sure<00:01:50.290> the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
all powers and grounds to make sure the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.820 
all powers and grounds to make sure the
ACM<00:01:51.189> had<00:01:51.520> what<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:51.909> needed<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.590> placed<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
ACM had what it needed I placed the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.740 
ACM had what it needed I placed the
scope<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.310> sweep<00:01:54.640> mode<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.180> all<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.540> wires

scope and sweep mode and all the wires

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.359 
scope and sweep mode and all the wires
passed<00:01:56.229> with<00:01:56.560> flying<00:01:56.740> colors

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
passed with flying colors

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.980 
passed with flying colors
I<00:01:58.680> knew<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.890> ACM<00:02:00.460> needed<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.060> proper<00:02:01.270> rpm

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
I knew the ACM needed the proper rpm

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.760 
I knew the ACM needed the proper rpm
signals<00:02:02.650> before<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.369> could<00:02:03.580> perform<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.210> task

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
signals before it could perform a task

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.920 
signals before it could perform a task
so<00:02:05.770> my<00:02:05.979> next<00:02:06.340> move<00:02:06.549> was<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.119> monitor<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.659> crank

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
so my next move was to monitor the crank

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.440 
so my next move was to monitor the crank
and<00:02:08.140> cam<00:02:08.470> signals<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.549> make<00:02:09.729> sure<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.390> were

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
and cam signals to make sure they were

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.080 
and cam signals to make sure they were
toggling<00:02:11.230> at<00:02:11.409> the<00:02:11.829> proper<00:02:12.220> thresholds<00:02:12.939> and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
toggling at the proper thresholds and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.680 
toggling at the proper thresholds and
frequency<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.099> also<00:02:15.099> needed<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:16.000> see<00:02:16.209> if<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
frequency I also needed to see if the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.839 
frequency I also needed to see if the
crank<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.140> cam<00:02:17.470> signals<00:02:17.980> were<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.400> proper

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
crank and cam signals were in proper

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.170 
crank and cam signals were in proper
synchronization<00:02:19.840> with<00:02:20.050> one<00:02:20.319> another

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
synchronization with one another

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.720 
synchronization with one another
I<00:02:21.239> placed<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.230> scope<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.769> waveform<00:02:22.980> viewer

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
I placed the scope and waveform viewer

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.569 
I placed the scope and waveform viewer
and<00:02:24.090> selected<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.079> crank<00:02:25.349> hand<00:02:25.620> cam<00:02:25.920> signals

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
and selected the crank hand cam signals

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.240 
and selected the crank hand cam signals
I<00:02:26.930> cranked<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.079> engine<00:02:28.469> and<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.799> signals

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
I cranked the engine and the signals

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.569 
I cranked the engine and the signals
seemed<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.879> be<00:02:30.060> correct<00:02:30.620> at<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.859> point<00:02:32.159> my

notes<00:02:37.319> on<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.579> had<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.329> with<00:02:39.629> what<00:02:39.659> I<00:02:39.900> had

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
notes on so I had to go with what I had

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.490 
notes on so I had to go with what I had
by<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.370> looks<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.909> things<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.689> seemed<00:02:43.230> like

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
by the looks of things it seemed like

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.220 
by the looks of things it seemed like
the<00:02:43.680> ECM<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.790> fault<00:02:45.209> but<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:45.719> still

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the ECM was that fault but I still

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.099 
the ECM was that fault but I still
needed<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.769> go<00:02:46.950> further<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.569> proved<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.599> the

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
needed to go further I proved that the

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.500 
needed to go further I proved that the
signals<00:02:49.560> looked<00:02:49.859> good<00:02:50.129> but<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.579> could<00:02:50.969> not<00:02:51.180> be

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
signals looked good but I could not be

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.420 
signals looked good but I could not be
sure<00:02:51.689> if<00:02:51.719> the<00:02:52.049> signals<00:02:52.500> were<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.829> sync

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
sure if the signals were in sync

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.390 
sure if the signals were in sync
I<00:02:53.459> pulled<00:02:54.419> the<00:02:54.599> timing<00:02:55.109> cover<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.189> I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
I pulled the timing cover so that I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.550 
I pulled the timing cover so that I
could<00:02:56.669> inspect<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.329> timing<00:02:57.780> belt<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.230> gear

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
could inspect the timing belt and gear

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.259 
could inspect the timing belt and gear
to<00:02:58.739> shaft<00:02:59.090> orientation<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.389> flaws<00:03:00.689> I<00:03:02.269> then

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
to shaft orientation for flaws I then

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.979 
to shaft orientation for flaws I then
proceeded<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.959> inspect<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.799> timing<00:03:05.310> belt<00:03:05.549> I

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
proceeded to inspect the timing belt I

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.140 
proceeded to inspect the timing belt I
was<00:03:06.989> surprised<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.859> find<00:03:07.889> everything<00:03:08.730> was<00:03:08.969> in

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
was surprised to find everything was in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.199 
was surprised to find everything was in
order<00:03:09.530> at<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.769> point<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:11.280> was<00:03:11.549> running<00:03:11.849> out<00:03:12.180> of

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
order at this point I was running out of

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.649 
order at this point I was running out of
algorithmic<00:03:12.959> ideas<00:03:13.379> it<00:03:14.250> seemed<00:03:14.909> like<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.419> was

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
algorithmic ideas it seemed like I was

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.780 
algorithmic ideas it seemed like I was
hitting<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.200> dead<00:03:16.409> end<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.739> all<00:03:16.889> directions<00:03:17.099> I

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
hitting a dead end in all directions I

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.720 
hitting a dead end in all directions I
left<00:03:18.689> the<00:03:18.900> shop<00:03:19.139> to<00:03:19.439> hopefully<00:03:20.040> regroup<00:03:20.489> my

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
left the shop to hopefully regroup my

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.209 
left the shop to hopefully regroup my
robotic<00:03:21.239> thought<00:03:21.510> process<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.379> come<00:03:22.799> up<00:03:22.859> with

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
robotic thought process to come up with

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.369 
robotic thought process to come up with
a<00:03:23.250> new<00:03:23.489> game<00:03:23.700> plan<00:03:24.060> for<00:03:24.419> my<00:03:24.629> next<00:03:24.989> visit

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
a new game plan for my next visit

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.399 
a new game plan for my next visit
I<00:03:25.590> finished<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.790> day<00:03:26.940> out<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.659> I<00:03:27.690> still<00:03:28.169> had

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
I finished the day out but I still had

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.069 
I finished the day out but I still had
this<00:03:28.560> Isuzu<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.729> back<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:30.150> my<00:03:30.359> processor

this Isuzu in the back of my processor

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.580 
this Isuzu in the back of my processor
mind<00:03:31.379> I<00:03:31.650> decided<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:33.120> go<00:03:33.329> home<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.900> my<00:03:34.079> team<00:03:34.319> Ken

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.309 
mind I decided to go home to my team Ken
and<00:03:34.799> do<00:03:35.370> some<00:03:35.669> digging<00:03:36.000> for<00:03:36.269> information<00:03:36.930> to

help me build my next plan of attack the
next<00:03:41.849> day<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.000> woke<00:03:42.269> up<00:03:42.510> with<00:03:42.689> another<00:03:43.019> plan

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
next day I woke up with another plan

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.319 
next day I woke up with another plan
this<00:03:44.579> was<00:03:44.939> a<00:03:45.000> rebuilt<00:03:45.599> engine<00:03:47.060> what<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
this was a rebuilt engine what if the

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.839 
this was a rebuilt engine what if the
crankshaft<00:03:48.959> was<00:03:49.260> not<00:03:49.530> machined<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.519> specs

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
crankshaft was not machined to the specs

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.089 
crankshaft was not machined to the specs
of<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.180> old<00:03:51.329> one<00:03:51.659> I<00:03:52.009> had<00:03:53.009> an<00:03:53.220> idea<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:55.099> called

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
of the old one I had an idea I called

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.890 
of the old one I had an idea I called
the<00:03:56.310> shop<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.879> told<00:03:57.120> them<00:03:57.449> to<00:03:57.599> pull<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
the shop and told them to pull the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.929 
the shop and told them to pull the
crankshaft<00:03:58.500> sensor<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.280> turn<00:03:59.759> the

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
crankshaft sensor and turn the

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.179 
crankshaft sensor and turn the
crankshaft<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.229> double<00:04:01.530> notch<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.979> the

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
crankshaft so the double notch on the

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.259 
crankshaft so the double notch on the
crank<00:04:02.459> pulse<00:04:02.729> ring<00:04:03.000> lined<00:04:03.239> up<00:04:03.419> with<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.750> hole

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
crank pulse ring lined up with the hole

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.059 
crank pulse ring lined up with the hole
then<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.569> told<00:04:07.019> them<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.500> mark<00:04:07.769> where<00:04:08.040> the

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
then I told them to mark where the

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.699 
then I told them to mark where the
position<00:04:08.459> of<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.000> crankshaft<00:04:09.389> keyway<00:04:10.199> was<00:04:10.500> in

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
position of the crankshaft keyway was in

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.229 
position of the crankshaft keyway was in
relation<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.759> engine<00:04:12.180> block<00:04:12.359> markings

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
relation to the engine block markings

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.939 
relation to the engine block markings
next<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.389> told<00:04:15.599> them<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.049> do<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.289> same<00:04:16.320> with<00:04:16.769> the

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
next I told them to do the same with the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.009 
next I told them to do the same with the
old<00:04:17.130> engine<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.299> see<00:04:18.509> if<00:04:18.599> the<00:04:18.780> pulse

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
old engine just to see if the pulse

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.960 
old engine just to see if the pulse
rings<00:04:19.470> were<00:04:19.709> synced<00:04:20.099> properly<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:20.820> their

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
rings were synced properly on their

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.140 
rings were synced properly on their
shafts<00:04:21.299> as<00:04:21.800> far-fetched<00:04:22.800> as<00:04:23.039> this<00:04:23.610> seemed<00:04:23.940> it

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
shafts as far-fetched as this seemed it

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.220 
shafts as far-fetched as this seemed it
was<00:04:24.479> all<00:04:24.720> this<00:04:24.960> robot<00:04:25.409> had<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.889> offer

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.710 

the<00:04:28.320> shot<00:04:28.590> later<00:04:28.830> called<00:04:29.310> me<00:04:29.610> back<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.060> told

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
the shot later called me back and told

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.300 
the shot later called me back and told
me<00:04:30.930> they<00:04:31.080> found<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.650> problem

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
me they found the problem

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.970 
me they found the problem
they<00:04:33.000> would<00:04:33.210> not<00:04:33.480> tell<00:04:33.690> me<00:04:34.050> over<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.500> Airways

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
they would not tell me over the Airways

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.540 
they would not tell me over the Airways
but<00:04:35.550> only<00:04:35.730> said<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.420> bring<00:04:36.690> your<00:04:36.960> camera<00:04:37.550> when

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
but only said to bring your camera when

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.060 
but only said to bring your camera when
I<00:04:38.580> got<00:04:38.970> there<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.510> could<00:04:39.960> see<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.350> mechanic<00:04:40.830> was

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
I got there I could see the mechanic was
