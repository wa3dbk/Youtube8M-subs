 agents working in the 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.479
 importance because they can 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.310
 find several different situations 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.110
 then in these situations 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.150
 differentiated we have to have a 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.650

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.200
