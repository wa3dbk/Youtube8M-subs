00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to do that experiment for 10 years we're

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.080 
to do that experiment for 10 years we're
trying<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> raise<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.740> money<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.250> perform

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

trying to raise the money to perform
that<00:01:57.299> experiment<00:01:57.810> because<00:01:57.930> nobody<00:01:58.560> knew

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that experiment because nobody knew

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.010 
that experiment because nobody knew
nobody<00:01:59.280> knew<00:01:59.850> how<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.869> turn

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020

outlined you got exactly the results we

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.809 
outlined you got exactly the results we
were<00:02:07.140> imagining<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.640> can
