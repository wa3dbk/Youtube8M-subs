00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:04.749 
bits of it there we go and we're going

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:08.789 
bits of it there we go and we're going
to<00:04:04.779> pop<00:04:05.139> them<00:04:05.349> right<00:04:05.379> there<00:04:05.889> on<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:07.329> tray<00:04:08.319> end

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
I'm going to get the trait all done here

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.970 
I'm going to get the trait all done here
so<00:04:12.819> we<00:04:12.939> can<00:04:13.060> pop<00:04:13.329> them<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.689> our<00:04:13.840> oven<00:04:14.079> which<00:04:14.799> i

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
so we can pop them in our oven which i

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.349 
so we can pop them in our oven which i
preheated<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:16.230> 375<00:04:17.230> degrees<00:04:17.980> so<00:04:18.489> get<00:04:19.329> that

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
preheated the 375 degrees so get that

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.420 
preheated the 375 degrees so get that
ready<00:04:19.870> kind<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.410> space<00:04:20.680> them<00:04:20.859> apart<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.400> they

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
ready kind of space them apart so they

pattern<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:32.050> take<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.320> fork<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.760> press<00:04:33.970> it

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
pattern you take a fork and you press it

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.840 
pattern you take a fork and you press it
once<00:04:34.450> down<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.290> then<00:04:35.889> back<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.400> other<00:04:36.430> way<00:04:36.669> so

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
once down and then back the other way so

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.790 
once down and then back the other way so
it<00:04:37.090> makes<00:04:37.240> like<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.480> little<00:04:37.780> crisscross<00:04:38.080> and

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
it makes like a little crisscross and

I'm sure you've seen that before even in
the<00:04:41.260> store<00:04:41.500> brain<00:04:41.800> ones<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.400> do<00:04:42.580> they<00:04:42.790> get<00:04:43.030> so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
the store brain ones that do they get so

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.240 
the store brain ones that do they get so
you<00:04:43.330> can<00:04:43.450> do<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.200> can<00:04:44.380> figure<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.710> out<00:04:44.889> it's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
you can do you can figure that out it's

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.330 
you can do you can figure that out it's
a<00:04:45.340> fork<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:46.000> just<00:04:46.900> go<00:04:47.080> ahead

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
a fork and just go ahead

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.650 
a fork and just go ahead
do<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.610> on<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.880> tops<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.419> we're<00:04:49.510> going<00:04:49.630> to

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
do that on the tops and we're going to

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.409 
do that on the tops and we're going to
pop<00:04:49.900> them<00:04:50.139> in<00:04:50.260> there<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.650> just<00:04:50.889> a<00:04:51.070> moment<00:04:51.460> there

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
pop them in there in just a moment there

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.870 
pop them in there in just a moment there
we<00:04:52.660> go<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.350> I<00:04:53.530> did<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.889> intricate<00:04:54.580> little

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
we go and I did the intricate little

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.909 
we go and I did the intricate little
fork<00:04:55.330> pattern<00:04:55.840> on<00:04:56.020> top<00:04:56.050> which<00:04:56.500> I'm<00:04:56.680> sure<00:04:56.889> you

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
fork pattern on top which I'm sure you

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.770 
fork pattern on top which I'm sure you
can<00:04:57.250> figure<00:04:57.460> out<00:04:57.610> because<00:04:58.090> he<00:04:58.210> do<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.630> your

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
can figure out because he do it to your

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.560 
can figure out because he do it to your
mashed<00:04:58.960> potatoes<00:04:59.620> anybody<00:05:00.550> dinner<00:05:01.060> when

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
to 375 degrees and we're going to pop

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.580 
to 375 degrees and we're going to pop
them<00:05:07.150> in<00:05:07.300> for<00:05:07.510> about<00:05:07.660> eight<00:05:07.960> minutes<00:05:08.229> until

that there's no flour in here at all and
that<00:06:16.570> was<00:06:16.900> so<00:06:17.289> simple<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:18.180> easy<00:06:19.180> in<00:06:19.889> this

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
that was so simple and easy in this

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.050 
that was so simple and easy in this
would<00:06:21.160> be<00:06:21.280> great<00:06:21.430> in<00:06:21.729> milk<00:06:22.030> and<00:06:22.419> I<00:06:23.940> think<00:06:24.940> I'm

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
would be great in milk and I think I'm

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.920 
would be great in milk and I think I'm
going<00:06:25.210> to<00:06:25.270> be<00:06:25.389> eaten<00:06:25.889> this<00:06:26.889> whole<00:06:27.130> pan<00:06:27.400> because

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
going to be eaten this whole pan because

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.629 
going to be eaten this whole pan because
these<00:06:28.930> are<00:06:29.289> the<00:06:29.320> easiest<00:06:29.889> benefit<00:06:30.430> and<00:06:30.580> that
