00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.080 
middle and that allows you to trigger
samples<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.369> we've<00:01:51.520> actually<00:01:51.670> laid<00:01:51.940> on<00:01:52.060> top

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
samples that we've actually laid on top

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.090 
samples that we've actually laid on top
of<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.390> mixes<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.290> allows<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.040> sort

okay so that's the actual turntable to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.040 
okay so that's the actual turntable to
explain<00:01:57.610> here<00:01:58.119> we've<00:01:58.270> got<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.479> natural

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
explain here we've got a natural

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.630 
explain here we've got a natural
crossfader<00:01:59.440> exactly<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.280> same<00:02:00.430> as<00:02:00.550> a<00:02:00.610> normal

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
crossfader exactly the same as a normal

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
play that way around you just have

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.430 
play that way around you just have
patience<00:02:19.450> got<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.810> pot<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.320> can

patience got to take that pot so you can

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.570 
patience got to take that pot so you can
play<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.799> line<00:02:20.950> which<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.160> whichever<00:02:21.400> way

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
