movie<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.050> don't<00:03:18.350> think<00:03:18.530> people<00:03:18.650> should

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
movie so I don't think people should

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.850 
movie so I don't think people should
worry<00:03:19.160> about<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.550> too<00:03:19.730> much<00:03:19.760> my<00:03:20.210> opinion<00:03:20.630> if

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
you are concerned about it that's

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.420 
you are concerned about it that's
understandable<00:03:24.560> some<00:03:24.860> people<00:03:25.130> would<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.250> a
