00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:13.839
 [Music] 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.630
 welcome to a new video tutorial and 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.539
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.720
 the office 2013 the professional version 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.480
 plus the 64-bit version is the version 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.980
 more complete than there is of the office and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 well I'll show how to activate 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.960
 with a simple program that only 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.329
 requires a few steps first of all 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.440
 let's 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.210
 the file image 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 which contains the office professional plus 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 2013 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.920
 and once downloaded I'll leave the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.929
 link in the video description 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.530
 once the disk image has been downloaded 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:55.629
 let's open let's open it with winrar 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.629
 that I will also leave you a link in the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.470
 well here we have the professional plus 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.950
 in the image 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.780
 we open it and we are going to put it in 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.450
 I recommend that you draw him in the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.380
 desktop to make it easier 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.399
 process we wait a bit for that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.399
 extract all the files from 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.100
 since missing three seconds 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.480
 I use the program has been 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.300
 has decompressed the files of the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.670
 we already have this folder 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.520
 in these files what we have to 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.900
 do now is open the other program 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.000
 which is called microsoft turkey 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.000
 we open it repeat this 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.210
 there is a window like this 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.460
 is 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.470
 some people give error to the 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.720
 time to do your steps or not open them 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.920
 then the most recommended is 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.920
 disable the antivirus 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.770
 protection in the case of bitdefender 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.500
 2015 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.730
 we are not antivirus we disable this 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.730
 half an hour is fine 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.420
 we do not know how to pass those little ones 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.960
 well now what we have to do is 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.110
 select the office option 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.340
 will load a larger window and 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.280
 is going to tell us that we do not have any 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.130
 this look installed what we have to 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.620
 do now is 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.890
 and put here where the setting saler says 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.120
 pass we open it and we go to the folder 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.890
 that we just extracted 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.159
 on the desk here in office 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.760
 professional plus and we choose setup 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.760
 exe point 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.660
 there it is tells us that it is the version 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.580
 retail we have to convert it to a 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.050
 volume version so that it is 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.090
 activated so you can activate 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.090
 then we will put them in 30 na 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.290
 to load 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.450
 the program 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.470
 there is already we change the type of 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.100
 license that manages the office and already 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.100
 we have the volume version 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.900
 ready that would be all now we can already 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.420
 we can minimize this or we can 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.600
 leave aside nothing is happening now 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.670
 we open the folder again and we have 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.020
 that run zero to the point of excel the 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.020
 permissions we gave him yes 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.390
 and we put it install now 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.540
 yes 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.859
 to verify if it is the correct version 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.709
 this when it comes to doing this process 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.489
 the screen asks for a 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.489
 a serial 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.210
 a product key so they can 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.990
 activate it as is the license by 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.930
 volume is no longer asked for 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.100
 and that's why we can install it without 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.850
 any 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.850
 no key 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.940
 I'm going to press the video and when I finish 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.940
 the installation we return 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.090
 and this operation may take a few 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.050
 minutes 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.050
 much 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.680
 now if the windows the office 2000 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.360
 and there are all the applications 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.620
 installed well here we're going to open by 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.620
 example work to see what 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.740
 and opened now we can open a document 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.740

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.300
 we are files on account and here it says 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.590
 that the activation is necessary here says 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.590
 that the product is not licensed 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.220
 is installed correctly and is missing 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.220
 activate it 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.289
 and we go to the office toolkit we put 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.360
