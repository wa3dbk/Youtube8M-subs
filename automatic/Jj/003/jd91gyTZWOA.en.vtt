00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.160
 with this the mass of dry air so strong 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.530
 acting on the southeastern region of brazil 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 absence of rain will continue for 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.960
 a few more days 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 we will only have a cold front with 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.779
 more strength coming to the southeast 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 Brazil with the capacity to reach the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.730
 southeast region of brazil 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.329
 after October 18th 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.820
 there in these maps here we see the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.950
 projection of rain for these near 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.320
 days until the 14th 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.230
 is the predominance of this white color on the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.070
 region indicates the absence of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.930
 some small areas of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.260
 instability may form in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.020
 mountainous regions but are hit in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.500
 small areas and the chance of rain is 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.890
 actually is quite low and in the period 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.830
 next from 15 to 19 here we will have a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.470
 another cold front that must pass through the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 coast of sao paulo we have there there 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.860
 also an expectation that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.070
 between the São Paulo coast and also the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.159
 rio de janeiro there is between the days 15 and 16 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 but it is also a very weak cold front 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 this cold front may even give you 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.850
 some rain showers than for the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.040
 east of the state of são paulo south of 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.590
 mines but also small areas 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 this cold front of days 15 and 16 also 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.810
 will not have the strength to make 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.150
 we have changes in time in the interior 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.909
 of the Southeast region, most of the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.460
 continues without rain and finally the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.729
 large cold front that should come only after 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.920
 same day on October 18 and then this 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.950
 cold front must advance the region 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 southeast of Brazil and the projection is that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.380
 can re-enter the region 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.850
 northeast then it passes over the region 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.119
 southeast of the country 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 after the 18th, and then it should stimulate 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.100
 occurrence of large areas of rainfall 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.509
 on the southeast region also on the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.509
 western central region of the country
