where<00:03:20.890> does<00:03:21.070> this<00:03:21.190> leave<00:03:21.430> rural<00:03:22.000> communities

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
where does this leave rural communities

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.620 
where does this leave rural communities
in<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.110> family<00:03:23.530> farm<00:03:23.860> one<00:03:24.610> farm<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.090> year<00:03:25.450> in

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
in the family farm one farm a year in

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.160 
in the family farm one farm a year in
some<00:03:26.200> cases<00:03:26.440> maybe<00:03:26.770> two<00:03:27.220> in<00:03:27.730> some<00:03:28.030> years<00:03:28.300> gone

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
some cases maybe two in some years gone

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.560 
some cases maybe two in some years gone
so<00:03:29.890> if<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.130> do<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.430> math<00:03:30.670> from<00:03:31.030> now<00:03:31.180> from

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
so if you do the math from now from

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.320 
so if you do the math from now from
sixty<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.080> now<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:32.770> at<00:03:33.520> one<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:33.850> year<00:03:34.150> that's

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
sixty to now so at one a year that's

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.690 
sixty to now so at one a year that's
about<00:03:34.660> how<00:03:34.810> many<00:03:34.870> firms<00:03:35.200> we've<00:03:35.470> lost<00:03:38.700> this
