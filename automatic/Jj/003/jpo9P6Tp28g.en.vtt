thinking that the bridle is lsq maybe

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.460 
thinking that the bridle is lsq maybe
low<00:04:00.680> lsq<00:04:01.250> quality<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.269> very<00:04:03.230> high<00:04:03.410> psq<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:05.470> and

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
low lsq quality to very high psq and and

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.580 
low lsq quality to very high psq and and
I<00:04:06.650> would<00:04:06.800> say<00:04:07.010> that<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.310> Marten<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:08.330> this<00:04:09.290> is

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
I would say that the Marten the this is

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.960 
I would say that the Marten the this is
lsq<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.510> saddle<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:12.170> high<00:04:12.739> psq<00:04:13.370> quality

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
lsq and the saddle is high psq quality

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.580 
lsq and the saddle is high psq quality
too<00:04:14.470> low<00:04:15.500> ellis<00:04:16.489> key<00:04:16.729> because<00:04:17.359> people<00:04:18.320> show

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
too low ellis key because people show

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.659 
too low ellis key because people show
horses<00:04:19.250> in<00:04:19.519> briar<00:04:20.209> tech<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:21.490> this<00:04:22.490> is

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
horses in briar tech and this is

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.320 
horses in briar tech and this is
definitely<00:04:22.940> better<00:04:23.180> than<00:04:23.389> a<00:04:23.780> Brice<00:04:24.140> huddle

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
definitely better than a Brice huddle

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:33.969 
definitely better than a Brice huddle
so<00:04:26.330> yeah<00:04:28.210> it's<00:04:29.210> got<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.570> be<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:30.020> less<00:04:30.440> Q<00:04:32.979> these

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
so yeah it's got to be a less Q these

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.210 
so yeah it's got to be a less Q these
