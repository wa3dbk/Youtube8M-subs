have to be perfect but make sure that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.510 
have to be perfect but make sure that
one<00:03:11.260> side<00:03:11.710> is<00:03:11.740> pretty<00:03:12.340> round<00:03:14.070> because<00:03:15.070> that's

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
one side is pretty round because that's

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.460 
one side is pretty round because that's
important<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.510> these<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.140> be<00:03:17.260> the

important and these are going to be the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.450 
important and these are going to be the
petals<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.640> yeah<00:03:22.380> musea<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.830> put<00:03:24.160> them<00:03:24.280> onto

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
petals so yeah musea I put them onto

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.530 
petals so yeah musea I put them onto
little<00:03:24.990> arm<00:03:27.210> circles<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:29.320> know<00:03:30.210> little<00:03:31.210> link

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
little arm circles you know little link

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.040 
little arm circles you know little link
so<00:03:31.810> these<00:03:31.960> are<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.170> pedals<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:34.030> yeah<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.720> only

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
so these are the pedals and yeah I only

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.740 
so these are the pedals and yeah I only
did<00:03:35.260> five<00:03:35.590> okay<00:03:36.310> yeah<00:03:36.490> oh<00:03:36.760> yeah<00:03:37.270> those<00:03:37.480> are<00:03:37.540> the

did five okay yeah oh yeah those are the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.510 
did five okay yeah oh yeah those are the
petals<00:03:38.080> I'll<00:03:38.560> show<00:03:38.770> you<00:03:38.830> how<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.070> mix<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.340> file

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
petals I'll show you how to mix a file

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.620 
petals I'll show you how to mix a file
from<00:03:39.700> here<00:03:40.410> that's<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:43.120> like<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.450> fun

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
from here that's this is like the fun

from here that's this is like the fun
part<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.990> me<00:03:44.110> anyway<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:46.030> probably<00:03:46.270> would

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
part to me anyway but I probably would

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.340 
part to me anyway but I probably would
take<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.380> smallest<00:03:48.070> petal<00:03:48.610> maybe<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.480> what

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
take the smallest petal maybe and what

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.540 
take the smallest petal maybe and what
you<00:03:50.440> want<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.620> do<00:03:50.740> is<00:03:50.890> make<00:03:50.920> sure<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.340> realm

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
you want to do is make sure the realm

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.690 
you want to do is make sure the realm
the<00:03:52.180> roundest<00:03:52.930> side<00:03:53.160> decide<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.430> like

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
the roundest side decide that you like

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.450 
the roundest side decide that you like
the<00:03:54.880> best<00:03:54.910> of<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.960> petal<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.470> go<00:03:56.770> circle<00:03:57.190> rhythm

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
the best of the petal I go circle rhythm

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.730 
the best of the petal I go circle rhythm
is<00:03:57.820> up<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.810> you're<00:03:58.960> going<00:03:59.140> to<00:04:00.120> take<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.150> and

you know do it like that just over fold
it<00:04:09.340> over<00:04:09.490> kind<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.570> circle<00:04:11.020> like<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:12.580> you

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
it over kind of circle like that and you

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.960 
it over kind of circle like that and you
can<00:04:12.790> squish<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.300> bottom<00:04:13.660> if<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.990> want

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970

can squish the bottom if you want
together<00:04:16.920> and<00:04:17.920> this<00:04:18.040> is<00:04:18.220> going<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.460> be<00:04:18.609> like

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
together and this is going to be like

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.379 
together and this is going to be like

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.040 
roundest best side is up you know just
and<00:05:32.060> this<00:05:32.150> one<00:05:32.300> isn't<00:05:32.480> going<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.780> go<00:05:32.840> all<00:05:32.960> the

and this one isn't going to go all the
way<00:05:33.110> around<00:05:33.850> that's<00:05:34.850> okay<00:05:35.150> whatever<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:36.229> know

just<00:05:37.190> going<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.430> squish<00:05:37.729> it<00:05:39.580> again<00:05:41.560> so<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.650> can

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
just going to squish it again so you can

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.990 
just going to squish it again so you can
see<00:05:42.890> it's<00:05:43.370> starting<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.760> form<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.120> little<00:05:44.450> rose

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
see it's starting to form a little rose

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.780 
see it's starting to form a little rose
yeah<00:05:48.010> okay<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:51.560> once<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:51.979> get<00:05:52.160> more<00:05:52.370> more<00:05:52.580> out

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
yeah okay and once you get more more out

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.760 
yeah okay and once you get more more out
you<00:05:53.060> don't<00:05:53.210> have<00:05:53.510> to<00:05:53.690> exactly<00:05:53.990> do<00:05:54.169> it<00:05:54.320> where<00:05:54.500> it

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
you don't have to exactly do it where it

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.210 
you don't have to exactly do it where it
cracks<00:05:55.130> but<00:05:55.930> like<00:05:56.930> I<00:05:57.169> wouldn't<00:05:57.590> do<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:57.800> right

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
cracks but like I wouldn't do it right

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.340 
cracks but like I wouldn't do it right
here<00:05:58.250> again<00:05:59.060> because<00:05:59.360> then<00:05:59.540> we'll<00:05:59.630> be<00:05:59.780> exactly

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
here again because then we'll be exactly

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.920 
here again because then we'll be exactly
around<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:01.100> but<00:06:02.030> I<00:06:02.150> would<00:06:02.330> you<00:06:02.450> know<00:06:02.479> do<00:06:02.810> it

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
around it but I would you know do it

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.440 
around it but I would you know do it
maybe<00:06:03.080> it's<00:06:03.350> it<00:06:03.590> like<00:06:04.430> where<00:06:04.669> these<00:06:04.820> two<00:06:05.120> come

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
maybe it's it like where these two come

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:12.510 
maybe it's it like where these two come
together<00:06:07.390> like<00:06:09.700> right<00:06:10.700> there<00:06:10.850> and<00:06:11.180> you<00:06:11.360> know

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
together like right there and you know

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.590 
together like right there and you know
put<00:06:13.520> it<00:06:13.669> there<00:06:13.880> and<00:06:14.210> you<00:06:14.419> know<00:06:14.540> just<00:06:17.500> put<00:06:18.500> it<00:06:18.620> on

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
put it there and you know just put it on

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.730 
put it there and you know just put it on
and<00:06:20.600> just<00:06:20.840> keep<00:06:21.050> kind<00:06:21.229> of<00:06:21.290> squishing<00:06:21.620> at<00:06:21.680> the

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
and just keep kind of squishing at the

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.710 
and just keep kind of squishing at the
bottom<00:06:21.979> side<00:06:22.100> and<00:06:22.250> kind<00:06:22.400> of<00:06:22.490> get<00:06:23.030> stuck

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
bottom side and kind of get stuck

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.830 
bottom side and kind of get stuck
together<00:06:23.870> we'll<00:06:24.169> say<00:06:24.290> might<00:06:24.470> like<00:06:24.620> fall<00:06:24.890> apart

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
together we'll say might like fall apart

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.380 
together we'll say might like fall apart
kind<00:06:26.840> of<00:06:26.870> like<00:06:27.020> that<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:29.000> curve<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:29.479> out<00:06:31.390> it's

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
kind of like that and curve it out it's

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.820 
kind of like that and curve it out it's
so<00:06:32.600> easy<00:06:32.840> to<00:06:33.080> do<00:06:33.260> and<00:06:33.470> it<00:06:33.590> makes<00:06:33.620> a<00:06:33.800> really
