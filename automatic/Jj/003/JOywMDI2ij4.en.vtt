 hello guys and welcome back to the canal 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.450
 mais up by euro manager here on youtube 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.970
 today I wanted to show you several later 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.320
 failed attempts as mine product 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.670
 protein bars at home with 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.960
 machine and it is urgent that I was 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.040
 Christmas gift 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 let's see the ingredients for a moment 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.630
 I had some dried figs in the house 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 agave juice and cashew butter 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:30.720
 of the maple butter syrup descended 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.719
 changes into the almond butter of the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 organic and organic dates of the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.440
 dehydrated burr of drops of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 this lactose-free chocolate for the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 my girlfriend's fingers of the coconut 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.230
 grated in protein flakes 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.120
 of the cappuccino taste they give 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.690
 particular to roma and pumpkin seeds 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 then I also had some barris delle drops 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 roasted hazelnuts from the piedmont dop delle 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.589
 walnuts and then one of the basic ingredients 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.630
 for the bars therefore oat flakes and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.420
 then nesquik and we use instead of cocoa 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.290
 to give roma chocolate 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.610
 I asked my girlfriend about 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.490
 choose some of these ingredients and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 chose oatmeal then approx 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.880
 100 grams 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.580
 then we took nesquik search 2 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.130
 spoons chocolate chips without 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.520
 lactose also here two spoons 2 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 spoons of grated coconut and per 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.350
 finish two tablespoons of pumpkin seeds and 2 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.900
 spoons of goch barris has put everyone 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.659
 the ingredients inside this dish e 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.689
 I started to mix the dough 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.940
 of the bars using about half 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:51.010
 glass of soy milk to favor 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:54.430
 we say that then I will go to put on 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.020
 plate of fingers maker 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:02.270
 here we add another drop of 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.390
 soy milk to favor let's say a 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.000
 thing of this amalgam 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.220
 then all ingredients put together 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.340
 this is the mixture of bars then 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.400
 also used two tablespoons of juice 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.220
 of agave and that still works from 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 glue and all the ingredients in 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.520
 this fingers and is still a 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.790
 low-g sweetener that gives flavor 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.370
 without saying let's create insulin pc for 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.030
 each for each correct 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.340
 so here are the ingredients 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.720
 let's say they go well mixed together in 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.940
 so that a uniform dough is created which 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.310
 we also want the closest you see the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.590
 chocolate chips I read barris today 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.440
 reds you can see well from this recovery e 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.020
 then here's what needs to be done and goes 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.150
 prepared the plate of the machine 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.440
 it was heated also using a 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.820
 sheet of baking paper that comes 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.100
 used to prevent the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.110
 barrette the dough sticks to 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.020
 then he dropped the thing I learned later 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.510
 several failed and important attempts 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.340
 also use a little oil this 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.790
 in case of useful damage oil spray or 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.400
 however, the spreadable egg white 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.610
 on top of this baking paper to avoid 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.980
 that during cooking the bars 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.080
 just stick to the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.310
 cards later becomes practically brigo 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.900
 you have to wait a lot longer 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.880
 because precisely the sheet cools down 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.489
 before you can eat barletta 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.820
 while instead giving these between exploited 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.250
 of oil the bars come off a lot 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.040
 more easily then as you see I take 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:55.079
 the dough and began to put it in the various 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.930
 in the various forms that we say 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.819
 create these these bars I try to 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.680
 press the ingredients well 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.900
 I try to have more dough tested 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.650
 my clients possible 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:16.410
 here you see we do a lot of operation 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:20.489
 simple and let's say from the plate is already 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:24.300
 warm it had warmed up about 5 minutes 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.699
 however there is a led that we say signals 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.410
 when the square is ready to say 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.110
 insert the ingredients then when 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.780
 the square is ready to go off e 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.840
 so we are ready to tell 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.150
 all the ingredients on these molds 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.210
 well the ingredients as you see 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.229
 the return in some places where there are 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.400
 of the empty spaces make sure that the 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:52.440
 bar is even here it is 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.389
 all ingredients of course that I have 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.940
 chosen who chose the race and then 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.560
 we know very well what's in this 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.220
 bar difference of many bars 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.750
 that you buy in the various online stores 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:11.430
 here then I close and we say expects 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.620
 about 15 minutes for cooking 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.990
 I still have some dough bars e 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.960
 so it's not an idea to do the version 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.820
 frozen fingers suitable outlet 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.360
 in summer and I took a dough 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:29.039
 remaining a piece of tinfoil e 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.830
 then we say it is decided to use 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:35.940
 this dough to create another mini 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.349
 bar pressing the dough with the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.669
 foil as I am doing in 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:44.310
 this moment to create a kind of 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.610
 mini barreto mini log-shaped 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.060
 candy that I can then put on 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.159
 freezer we say to consume i 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:58.729
 ingredients in a different way also one 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:06:03.150
 let's say frozen version here it is 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:06.180
 so we removed the bars from the 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.130
 plate here is how we say they present themselves 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.469
 the dark areas are chocolate 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.570
 obviously loose are not burns e 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:15.450
 I must say that they were particularly 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.070
 enjoyed by my girlfriend these instead 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.830
 are the initial attempts 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.979
 as you see on most of the 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.330
 ballet is detached the paper was not there 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.590
 just a uniformity of the bars 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.430
 however, you learn by mistake 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.680
 I remind you to continue to register e 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.229
