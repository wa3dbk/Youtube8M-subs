in<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.729> he<00:01:14.880> walk<00:01:15.090> around<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> neighborhood

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
in as he walk around the neighborhood

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
in as he walk around the neighborhood
you<00:01:16.619> don't<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> feeling<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you don't you don't get the feeling that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
you don't you don't get the feeling that
there<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.509> very<00:01:19.049> large<00:01:19.470> building<00:01:20.189> in

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
there was this very large building in

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
there was this very large building in
here<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> scale<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.570> much<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.080> Chicago

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
here the scale is very much what Chicago

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.710 
here the scale is very much what Chicago
was<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:24.000> pleasant<00:01:24.299> scale

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
was and which is a very pleasant scale

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.050 
was and which is a very pleasant scale
very<00:01:25.020> nice<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.380> urban<00:01:25.619> scale<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
very nice and urban scale so we think it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
very nice and urban scale so we think it
was<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.360> an<00:01:27.479> opportunity<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.710> keep<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
was really an opportunity to to keep the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
was really an opportunity to to keep the
urban<00:01:29.430> fabric<00:01:29.729> intact<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> improve<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
urban fabric intact and improve it but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
urban fabric intact and improve it but
then<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.310> graft<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.360> landmark<00:01:33.689> building

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then also graft in a landmark building

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
then also graft in a landmark building
which<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.520> prominent<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:36.210> Lake
