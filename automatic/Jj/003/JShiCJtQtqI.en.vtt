00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.620 
I had to get him into six and a half
when<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.490> when<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:52.909> sitting<00:01:53.150> in<00:01:53.210> six<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.600> half

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
when I when I sitting in six and a half

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.060 
when I when I sitting in six and a half
I<00:01:53.899> just<00:01:54.049> wanted<00:01:54.380> them<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.649> really<00:01:54.860> like<00:01:54.950> the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
I just wanted them so I really like the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.130 
I just wanted them so I really like the
shoe<00:01:55.280> but<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.240> figured<00:01:56.570> I'd<00:01:56.659> be<00:01:56.750> little<00:01:56.899> bit<00:01:56.990> big

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
shoe but I figured I'd be little bit big

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.080 
shoe but I figured I'd be little bit big
on<00:01:57.229> me<00:01:57.409> this<00:01:57.680> actually<00:01:57.920> fits<00:01:58.310> me<00:01:58.490> perfect<00:01:58.970> even

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
on me this actually fits me perfect even

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.310 
on me this actually fits me perfect even
though<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.450> six<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.780> half<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.110> i<00:02:00.140> guess

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
though it's a six and a half so i guess

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.070 
though it's a six and a half so i guess
these<00:02:00.470> run<00:02:00.680> kind<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.040> small<00:02:01.310> but<00:02:01.840> these<00:02:02.840> are

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
these run kind of small but these are

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.679 
these run kind of small but these are
the<00:02:03.259> premium<00:02:03.740> tues<00:02:03.979> i<00:02:04.430> thought<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.299> grain<00:02:05.509> is

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
the premium tues i thought that grain is

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.510
