00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:13.640
 I'm more interested in 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.990
 licensed economy management here there so in 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.820
 did I came especially for this 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.019
 Licence 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.060
 apparently in fact it's the fusion 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.699
 between two licenses a more economical 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.250
 a question management chip so here 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.810
 c 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.119
 for my project maybe 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.250
 in fact I am in license 1 right to 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.340
 the rock on yon is actually I had not 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.320
 precise project and little by little I 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.579
 build my project and I realized 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.260
 that the right had not been 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.329
 not done for me and I got more 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.250
 interested in more towards 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.140
 economics management in fact what is it 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.019
 who surprised me that ben apparently 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.450
 this is one of the first times that for 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.230
 this license 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.160
 who for example in first year who 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 do a continuous check 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.640
 which changes the other ways with the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.290
 partial finally I know that for 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 to eat that plots it's not a 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.000
 continuous monitoring 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.550
 it's true it's something 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.949
 that changes and that allows to debit too much 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.700
 strong checks and that puts in confidence 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.080
 for the first year I am neither 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.180
 search a little more information 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.340
 sure about this faculty and then I had 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.940
 for project to do a tourism college 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.670
 After the baccalaureate 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.869
 so there on a terminal s embarrassing look 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.570
 even more information to do 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.369
 to do the best the penguin is here 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.290
 advises us not to stay in 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.240
 France to really move the faculty 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.820
 really lets us go really 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.100
 worldwide 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.560
 it seems really good to me for 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 young because for for the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 employers to have a contract where there is 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.170
 written on the internship CV of one year to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.180
 abroad to buy three months to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 abroad if it's really rewarding 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.619
 I came looking for information 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.530
 on medicine so to be able to leave 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.149
 in the curriculum of health what has me 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.429
 come to angers is that my baccalaureate 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.899
 it's a mac is it so technological 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.880
 laboratories that is more based on 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.479
 human biology and biochemistry 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.160
 of the human body so in Brittany it's 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.470
 more focused on maths and physics 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.880
 so I went to angers to have 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.330
 more affinity with materials 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.390
 proposed 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.920
 I will leave more on medicine after on 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.709
 chances to see her or not to see I 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.330
 will leave more on pediatrics and if 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.250
 I can not see my competition 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.480
 medicine i will leave on wise woman for 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.480
 stay in the children's environment 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.530
