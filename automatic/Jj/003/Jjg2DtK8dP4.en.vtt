00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
when I would open it and it was hard to

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.370 
when I would open it and it was hard to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
throwing the whole thing off and just

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.609 
throwing the whole thing off and just
having<00:02:07.070> let's<00:02:07.820> fly<00:02:08.060> out<00:02:08.239> at<00:02:08.390> me<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.019> got<00:02:09.470> this

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
having let's fly out at me so I got this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.410 
having let's fly out at me so I got this
basket<00:02:10.100> for<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.340> purpose<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.910> fits<00:02:11.269> really

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
basket for that purpose it fits really

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.120 
basket for that purpose it fits really
well<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:11.900> cabinet<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.650> really<00:02:12.890> like<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
well in my cabinet and I really like the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.890 
well in my cabinet and I really like the
way<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> looks<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.630> working

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
way that it looks and it's working

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.830 
way that it looks and it's working
really<00:02:15.049> well<00:02:15.200> as<00:02:15.680> an<00:02:15.799> organizational<00:02:16.489> tool<00:02:16.840> so

really well as an organizational tool so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.569 
really well as an organizational tool so
I<00:02:17.870> think<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.230> basket<00:02:18.890> might<00:02:19.070> be<00:02:19.250> one<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.400> my

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
I think this basket might be one of my

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.819 
I think this basket might be one of my
favorite<00:02:20.030> target<00:02:20.390> dollar<00:02:20.570> spot<00:02:20.840> produces<00:02:21.350> of

an end table or something so I'm excited

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.250 
an end table or something so I'm excited
about<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.460> it's<00:03:32.090> going<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.300> serve<00:03:32.540> different

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
about that it's going to serve different

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.530 
about that it's going to serve different
purposes<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:34.160> in<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.730> last<00:03:34.880> thing<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.300> picked

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
purposes and in the last thing I picked

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.750 
purposes and in the last thing I picked
up<00:03:35.750> was<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.380> sticky<00:03:36.740> dots<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.340> hundred

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
up was the sticky dots this is a hundred

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.340 
up was the sticky dots this is a hundred
and<00:03:37.880> fifty<00:03:38.180> count<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.020> first<00:03:39.230> time

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
and fifty count this is the first time

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.720 
and fifty count this is the first time
I've<00:03:39.470> ever<00:03:39.500> seen<00:03:39.920> them<00:03:40.070> in<00:03:40.190> my<00:03:40.280> target<00:03:40.550> dollar

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
I've ever seen them in my target dollar

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.000 
I've ever seen them in my target dollar
spot<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.330> know<00:03:42.020> that<00:03:42.260> they<00:03:42.380> had<00:03:42.560> them<00:03:42.740> at<00:03:42.890> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
spot I know that they had them at the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.190 
spot I know that they had them at the
dollar<00:03:43.250> tree<00:03:43.450> but<00:03:44.450> what<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.690> thought<00:03:44.960> I<00:03:45.020> would

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
dollar tree but what I thought I would

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.170 
dollar tree but what I thought I would
do<00:03:45.350> with<00:03:45.440> these<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.890> use<00:03:46.220> them<00:03:46.460> when<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:46.910> have

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
do with these is use them when I have

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.780 
do with these is use them when I have
another<00:03:47.720> garage<00:03:48.080> sale<00:03:48.500> normally<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:49.640> use

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
another garage sale normally I just use

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.730 
another garage sale normally I just use
tape<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.360> I'll<00:03:50.450> write<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.900> tape<00:03:51.140> but<00:03:51.500> I

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
tape and I'll write it on the tape but I

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.830 
tape and I'll write it on the tape but I
think<00:03:51.860> these<00:03:52.220> are<00:03:52.280> more<00:03:52.940> cost<00:03:53.270> efficient<00:03:53.720> than

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
think these are more cost efficient than

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.530 
think these are more cost efficient than
using<00:03:54.050> tape<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.340> got<00:03:55.910> these<00:03:56.090> i<00:03:56.420> would

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
using tape so I got these i would

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.940 
using tape so I got these i would
probably<00:03:56.870> i'm<00:03:57.200> thinking<00:03:57.680> about<00:03:57.860> having

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
probably i'm thinking about having

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.070 
probably i'm thinking about having
another<00:03:58.220> garage<00:03:58.490> sale<00:03:58.850> in<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.060> springtime<00:03:59.420> so

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
another garage sale in the springtime so

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.440 
another garage sale in the springtime so
these<00:04:00.590> will<00:04:00.770> come<00:04:00.950> in<00:04:01.100> handy<00:04:01.130> for<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.390> i

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
these will come in handy for that and i

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.790 
these will come in handy for that and i
figured<00:04:02.780> while<00:04:03.080> they<00:04:03.230> were<00:04:03.320> there<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.650> might

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
figured while they were there and might

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.990 
figured while they were there and might
as<00:04:03.860> well<00:04:03.950> pick<00:04:04.070> them<00:04:04.220> up<00:04:04.340> because<00:04:04.520> sometimes

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
as well pick them up because sometimes

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.700 
as well pick them up because sometimes
