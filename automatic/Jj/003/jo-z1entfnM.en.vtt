think<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.119> simple<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.159> where

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
think this is simple but this is where

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.630 
think this is simple but this is where
most<00:02:03.030> people<00:02:03.180> usually<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> wrong<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
most people usually get it wrong and

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.839 
most people usually get it wrong and
then<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> server<00:02:06.090> starts<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> crash<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
then the server starts to crash and

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.400 
then the server starts to crash and
that's<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.270> part<00:02:09.300> two<00:02:09.660> rate<00:02:10.229> and
