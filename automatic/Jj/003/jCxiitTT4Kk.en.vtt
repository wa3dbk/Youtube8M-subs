00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.519
 still 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.189

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.550
 kivot how it changed in three months 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:28.220

 roots generally looks beautiful 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.140

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.449
 we go up the stalk naturally yes 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.750

 anymore but nevertheless with this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.909
 watering as I showed you everything here 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.659
 These branches on which were flowers They not 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.460

 I went from here to water it like a year 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.610
 as I said every day , these are mine 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 not replaceable solvent and even shred 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:42.979
 with the same little water like this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.979
 I always watered them and then I water them 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.810
 true hare and during these three 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:56.299
 months this is a micro diffuser we for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.299
 these three months we were absent from home 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.119
 three weeks i want to say that that's when 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.939
 I was away for three weeks I very much 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.500
 abundantly watered but to the maximum yes 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.739
 splattered so it was all 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.700
 wet here and with a clear conscience 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.110
 left for three weeks 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 come through three 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.780
 we divide orchids absolutely live absolutely 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.940
 healthy these leaves were small 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.150
 when I left here and when I arrived here 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.800

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.450
 healthy they have such a wonderful 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.480
 very pleased indeed that here 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.530
 evidence that principle like me 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:47.790
 I water it he works he gives 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:51.540
 result result seems to me very 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.950
 even not bad and I initially bought me 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:00.239

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.200
 branches on which were inflorescences they 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.180
 not changed they are not dried up 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.620
 here they bloomed at me then flowers opal and 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.360
 without drying up any significant 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.530

 Here by the same principle I water but 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.530
 other flowers and in principle I think that 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.780
 flowers are very good spray 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.180

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.460
 brand watered big flowers that 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.590
 there are big cannes such as wood 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.420
 given the huge growth of them powerful 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.970
 root system they have another system 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.040
 watering and stuff like that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.830
 As for orchid, as for such 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.390
 narrow flowering houseplants then they 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.460
