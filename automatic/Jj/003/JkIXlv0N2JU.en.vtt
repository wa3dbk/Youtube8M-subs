00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
they felt very comfortable for first

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.150 
they felt very comfortable for first
time<00:00:27.539> wearing<00:00:27.779> them<00:00:27.900> they<00:00:28.109> felt<00:00:28.380> worn<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.919> like

you've been wearing them for a while
I<00:00:31.730> think<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.790> gloves<00:00:32.970> are<00:00:33.120> great<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.840> know

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
I think the gloves are great you know

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.319 
I think the gloves are great you know
very<00:00:34.170> light<00:00:34.379> very<00:00:34.890> snug<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:35.489> hand<00:00:35.699> great

very light very snug on your hand great
protection<00:00:36.949> for<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.040> event<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.460> can't

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
protection for the event if I can't

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
protection for the event if I can't
believe<00:00:38.820> anyway<00:00:39.030> hasn't<00:00:39.269> thought<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.420> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
believe anyway hasn't thought about it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
believe anyway hasn't thought about it
before<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.290> restrictive<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.980> what

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
before it's not restrictive at all what

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.009 
before it's not restrictive at all what
adds<00:00:41.370> extra<00:00:41.670> protection<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
adds extra protection and I think this

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.689 
adds extra protection and I think this
is<00:00:43.140> gonna<00:00:43.320> solve<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.980> few<00:00:44.159> of<00:00:44.250> those<00:00:44.339> risks

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
is gonna solve a few of those risks

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.310 
is gonna solve a few of those risks
flashing<00:00:45.120> issues<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.629> things<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
flashing issues and things like that so

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:59.340 
flashing issues and things like that so
I'm<00:00:46.440> excited<00:00:46.650> to<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.190> players

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
the rest of the stick felt pretty good

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.330

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the feel of the puck with the stick was

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.530 
the feel of the puck with the stick was
far<00:01:12.340> better<00:01:12.610> than<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.940> make<00:01:13.090> oh<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.420> I've

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
far better than the make oh that I've

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.230 
far better than the make oh that I've
been<00:01:13.659> using<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.490> flex<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.000> stick

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
time putting them on they were extremely

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
time putting them on they were extremely
comfortable<00:01:47.760> I<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.030> very<00:01:48.600> wide<00:01:48.840> feet

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170

quadruple a width feet and when I put
these<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.260> was<00:01:52.500> thinking<00:01:52.830> I'd<00:01:52.950> probably

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
these on I was thinking I'd probably

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
these on I was thinking I'd probably
only<00:01:53.370> last<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:53.850> 5<00:01:54.150> 10<00:01:54.360> minutes<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.870> them<00:01:55.020> but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
only last about 5 10 minutes in them but

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:07.380 
only last about 5 10 minutes in them but
they're<00:01:56.010> very<00:01:56.190> comfortable<00:01:56.490> skates
