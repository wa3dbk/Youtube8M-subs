incredibly funny it's supposed to be a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.240 
incredibly funny it's supposed to be a
good<00:00:32.460> tool<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.870> exercising<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.250> obviously

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
good tool for exercising and obviously

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
good tool for exercising and obviously
it's<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.820> strengthen<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.450> back<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's going to strengthen your back and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
it's going to strengthen your back and
your<00:00:37.489> abdominal<00:00:38.489> muscles<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.690> should<00:00:39.899> be

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
your abdominal muscles so it should be

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.450 
your abdominal muscles so it should be
good<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.379> toning<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.980> well

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

weight<00:00:41.640> loss<00:00:42.410> acupressure<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
weight loss acupressure because of the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
weight loss acupressure because of the
magnets<00:00:44.700> inside<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.410> know

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
magnets inside and the little you know

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.479 
magnets inside and the little you know
bumps<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.750> center<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> hoop<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.770> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
bumps in the center of the hoop and I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
bumps in the center of the hoop and I
think<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.510> fun<00:00:51.780> way<00:00:52.050> to

make<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.880> heavier<00:01:58.510> as<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.960> go<00:01:59.140> along<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.470> your

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
make it heavier as you go along and your

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.000 
make it heavier as you go along and your
muscles<00:02:00.520> get<00:02:00.700> stronger<00:02:01.060> they<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.080> advise<00:02:02.620> to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
muscles get stronger they do advise to

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.450 
muscles get stronger they do advise to
not<00:02:03.270> use<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.450> for<00:02:04.900> too<00:02:05.110> long<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.920> beginning

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
not use it for too long in the beginning

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.340 
not use it for too long in the beginning
so<00:02:06.610> no<00:02:07.119> more<00:02:07.360> than<00:02:07.510> five<00:02:07.780> minutes<00:02:08.200> because

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
there I thought they were going to be a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.500 
there I thought they were going to be a
little<00:04:41.260> bit<00:04:41.380> soft<00:04:41.800> you<00:04:42.220> know<00:04:42.430> they're<00:04:43.270> not

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
little bit soft you know they're not

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.180 
little bit soft you know they're not

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
they're really really hard

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.030 
they're really really hard

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
well I think it's going to get better as

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.020 
well I think it's going to get better as
you<00:04:53.230> get<00:04:53.530> used<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.950> it<00:04:54.010> you<00:04:54.250> know<00:04:54.430> it's<00:04:54.460> always

but anyway it always hurts the first

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.340 
but anyway it always hurts the first
side<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:06.970> think<00:05:07.240> you're<00:05:07.540> going<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:07.960> get<00:05:08.140> used

to<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:09.100> will<00:05:09.250> stop<00:05:09.520> hurting<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.270> it

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
to it and it will stop hurting and it

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.870 
to it and it will stop hurting and it
will<00:05:10.480> be<00:05:10.600> fine<00:05:10.960> but<00:05:11.800> it's<00:05:12.100> definitely<00:05:12.340> not

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
will be fine but it's definitely not

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.630 
will be fine but it's definitely not
something<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.540> can<00:05:13.780> start<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:14.890> know<00:05:15.010> doing<00:05:15.250> for

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
something I can start you know doing for

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.000 
something I can start you know doing for
ten<00:05:16.090> minutes<00:05:16.540> right<00:05:16.780> away<00:05:17.110> because<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.680> just

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
ten minutes right away because it just

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.970 
ten minutes right away because it just
just<00:05:18.460> hurts<00:05:18.760> too<00:05:19.030> much<00:05:19.240> so<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:19.960> do<00:05:20.110> think<00:05:20.620> that

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
just hurts too much so I do think that

definitely going to be bruising I can

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.370 
definitely going to be bruising I can
already<00:05:33.820> feel<00:05:33.940> it<00:05:34.150> I'm<00:05:34.419> going<00:05:34.690> to<00:05:34.810> be<00:05:34.960> improved

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
already feel it I'm going to be improved

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.050 
already feel it I'm going to be improved
tomorrow<00:05:37.380> despite<00:05:38.380> of<00:05:38.710> how<00:05:39.010> much<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.400> hurts<00:05:39.700> I

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
tomorrow despite of how much it hurts I

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.390 
tomorrow despite of how much it hurts I
do<00:05:40.540> think<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:41.110> will<00:05:41.350> get<00:05:41.560> better<00:05:41.830> really

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
do think it will get better really

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.150 
do think it will get better really
quickly<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.210> think<00:05:43.570> that<00:05:44.050> if<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:44.380> do<00:05:44.440> it<00:05:44.800> every

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
quickly I think that if I do it every

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.750 
quickly I think that if I do it every
week<00:05:45.400> every<00:05:46.390> week<00:05:46.570> everything<00:05:47.370> every<00:05:48.370> week<00:05:48.610> is

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
week every week everything every week is

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.659 
week every week everything every week is
not<00:05:49.030> going<00:05:49.419> to<00:05:49.570> help<00:05:49.690> much<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.919> I<00:05:51.100> do<00:05:51.160> it<00:05:51.400> every

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
not going to help much if I do it every

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.090 
not going to help much if I do it every
day<00:05:51.700> then<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:52.660> slowly<00:05:53.200> build<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.740> up<00:05:53.860> it

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
day then and slowly build it up it

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.610 
day then and slowly build it up it
should<00:05:54.280> be<00:05:54.340> okay<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:54.940> think<00:05:55.330> that<00:05:55.510> in<00:05:55.750> two<00:05:56.380> weeks

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
should be okay I think that in two weeks

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.490 
should be okay I think that in two weeks
time<00:05:56.979> it<00:05:57.430> will<00:05:57.850> not<00:05:58.030> hurt<00:05:58.390> at<00:05:58.570> all<00:05:58.720> anymore<00:05:59.110> or

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
time it will not hurt at all anymore or

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.920 
time it will not hurt at all anymore or
not<00:05:59.770> as<00:05:59.979> much<00:06:00.010> because<00:06:00.850> I'll<00:06:01.060> just<00:06:01.360> be<00:06:01.540> used<00:06:01.750> to

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
not as much because I'll just be used to

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.350 
not as much because I'll just be used to
it<00:06:02.140> and<00:06:02.470> I<00:06:02.890> can<00:06:03.130> definitely<00:06:03.340> see<00:06:03.970> how<00:06:04.300> you

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
it and I can definitely see how you

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.770 
it and I can definitely see how you
would<00:06:04.750> get<00:06:04.960> tones<00:06:05.320> using<00:06:06.010> this<00:06:06.220> so<00:06:07.090> I'm<00:06:07.570> not

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
would get tones using this so I'm not

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.300 
would get tones using this so I'm not
going<00:06:08.050> to<00:06:08.110> give<00:06:08.290> up<00:06:08.530> I'm<00:06:08.830> going<00:06:09.040> to<00:06:09.160> keep

going to give up I'm going to keep
trying<00:06:09.700> and<00:06:10.180> I'm<00:06:10.330> going<00:06:10.540> to
