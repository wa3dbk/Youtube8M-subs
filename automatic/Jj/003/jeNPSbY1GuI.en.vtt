the<00:01:40.220> weight<00:01:40.490> is<00:01:40.760> point<00:01:41.360> let<00:01:41.990> me<00:01:42.080> see<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.350> I

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
the weight is point let me see you I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.210 
the weight is point let me see you I
would<00:01:42.590> just<00:01:42.620> get<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.950> exactly<00:01:43.340> correct<00:01:43.730> here

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.950 

your<00:01:49.220> weight<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.490> point<00:01:50.120> one<00:01:50.210> eight<00:01:50.690> five

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
your weight is point one eight five

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.260 
your weight is point one eight five
ounces<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.770> your<00:01:51.890> thickness<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.520> 0<00:01:52.760> point<00:01:53.030> 1

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
ounces and your thickness is 0 point 1

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.510 
ounces and your thickness is 0 point 1
inches<00:01:53.660> so<00:01:53.840> super<00:01:54.410> lightweight<00:01:54.620> super<00:01:54.830> small

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
inches so super lightweight super small

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.520 
inches so super lightweight super small
and<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:56.630> know<00:01:56.720> something<00:01:56.750> obviously<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.440> can

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
and you know something obviously you can

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.720 
and you know something obviously you can
just<00:01:57.680> throw<00:01:57.710> into<00:01:58.010> your<00:01:58.100> keychain<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.610> could

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
just throw into your keychain you could

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.000 
just throw into your keychain you could
also<00:01:58.880> focus<00:01:59.330> on<00:01:59.360> a<00:01:59.420> key<00:01:59.660> barky<00:02:00.170> smart<00:02:00.470> it's

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
also focus on a key barky smart it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.980 
also focus on a key barky smart it's
that<00:02:01.220> size<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:02.090> size<00:02:02.300> key<00:02:02.510> which<00:02:02.720> i<00:02:02.840> really

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
that size that size key which i really

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.120 
that size that size key which i really
like<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:03.409> i<00:02:03.530> have<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.710> bunch<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:03.950> keys<00:02:04.100> that

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
like because i have a bunch of keys that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.940 
like because i have a bunch of keys that
i<00:02:04.310> can't<00:02:04.610> fit<00:02:04.850> onto<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.720> keyboard<00:02:06.380> key<00:02:06.680> smart

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
i can't fit onto a keyboard key smart

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.589 
i can't fit onto a keyboard key smart
but<00:02:07.460> let's<00:02:07.640> say<00:02:07.760> let's<00:02:08.000> zoom<00:02:08.209> out<00:02:08.330> here<00:02:08.569> a

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
but let's say let's zoom out here a

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.880 
but let's say let's zoom out here a
little<00:02:08.750> bit<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.110> then<00:02:09.170> talk<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> little<00:02:09.709> bit

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
little bit and then talk a little bit

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.680 
little bit and then talk a little bit
more<00:02:09.979> philosophically<00:02:10.849> about<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.300> mikey

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
more philosophically about the mikey

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.119 
more philosophically about the mikey
alright<00:02:12.379> so<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> first<00:02:12.620> thing<00:02:12.769> i<00:02:12.890> want<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.040> do

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
alright so the first thing i want to do

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.190 
alright so the first thing i want to do
is<00:02:13.159> just<00:02:13.400> compare<00:02:13.819> your<00:02:14.030> sizes<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.080> we

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
is just compare your sizes here so we

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.180 
is just compare your sizes here so we
already<00:02:15.410> talked<00:02:15.620> about

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.770 

first<00:02:19.790> thing<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> want<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.090> do<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.240> just<00:02:20.360> compare

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
first thing I want to do is just compare

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.280 
first thing I want to do is just compare
sizes<00:02:21.020> here<00:02:21.380> 2.2<00:02:21.980> inches<00:02:22.370> for<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.150> mikey<00:02:24.020> and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
sizes here 2.2 inches for the mikey and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.020 
sizes here 2.2 inches for the mikey and
we'll<00:02:24.410> look<00:02:24.530> end<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> end<00:02:25.100> for<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
we'll look end to end for the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.970 
we'll look end to end for the
persistence<00:02:27.700> we're<00:02:28.700> looking<00:02:29.030> at<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:30.740> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
persistence we're looking at just a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.680 
persistence we're looking at just a
little<00:02:31.250> bit<00:02:31.430> less<00:02:31.580> than<00:02:31.820> seven<00:02:32.240> when<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.510> comes

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
little bit less than seven when it comes

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.090 
little bit less than seven when it comes
from<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.960> tip<00:02:33.230> all<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.530> way<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.830> end<00:02:33.950> and

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
from the tip all the way to the end and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.610 
from the tip all the way to the end and
then<00:02:34.640> for<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> tenacious<00:02:35.300> we're<00:02:36.260> looking<00:02:36.500> at

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
then for the tenacious we're looking at

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.920 
then for the tenacious we're looking at
about<00:02:36.770> eight<00:02:37.160> inches<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.360> first<00:02:38.720> thing<00:02:38.900> is

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
about eight inches so first thing is

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.600 
about eight inches so first thing is
just<00:02:39.290> size-wise<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.920> know<00:02:40.250> obviously

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
just size-wise you know obviously

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.460 
just size-wise you know obviously
carrying<00:02:41.120> up<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.390> persistence<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.990> finishes

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
carrying up the persistence of finishes

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.030 
carrying up the persistence of finishes
a<00:02:42.650> lot<00:02:42.980> bigger<00:02:43.250> than<00:02:43.700> carrying<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.390> Mikey

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
a lot bigger than carrying the Mikey

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.440 
a lot bigger than carrying the Mikey
wait<00:02:46.040> let<00:02:46.460> me<00:02:46.490> look<00:02:46.730> at<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.850> weight<00:02:47.060> here<00:02:47.270> real

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
wait let me look at the weight here real

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.670 
wait let me look at the weight here real
quick<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.810> already<00:02:47.930> told<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.260> what<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.560> weight

quick I already told you what the weight
was<00:02:48.890> for<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> for<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.000> Mikey<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
was for the for the Mikey for the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.250 
was for the for the Mikey for the
persistence<00:02:51.380> it's<00:02:51.650> 3.3<00:02:52.640> ounces<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.270> for<00:02:54.110> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
persistence it's 3.3 ounces and for the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.190 
persistence it's 3.3 ounces and for the
tenacious<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:55.070> 4<00:02:55.430> ounces<00:02:55.850> as<00:02:56.060> opposed<00:02:56.900> to

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
tenacious it's 4 ounces as opposed to

think<00:03:11.120> about<00:03:11.300> on<00:03:11.660> this<00:03:12.260> philosophical<00:03:12.740> level

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
think about on this philosophical level

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.890 
think about on this philosophical level
is<00:03:14.260> do<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.380> use<00:03:15.710> your<00:03:16.250> knife<00:03:16.520> a<00:03:16.790> lot<00:03:17.090> for<00:03:17.450> me<00:03:17.660> I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
is do you use your knife a lot for me I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.900 
is do you use your knife a lot for me I
would<00:03:18.230> carry<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.710> mikey<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.370> I'd<00:03:19.550> carry<00:03:19.850> a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
would carry the mikey and I'd carry a

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.850 
would carry the mikey and I'd carry a
knife<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.600> maybe<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.900> person<00:03:21.320> who's<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:21.740> you

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
knife but maybe a person who's like you
