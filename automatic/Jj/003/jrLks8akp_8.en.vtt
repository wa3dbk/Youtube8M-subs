just the stylus and then on the inside
is<00:02:05.850> still<00:02:06.149> pretty<00:02:06.390> basic<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.310> they<00:02:08.310> added

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
is still pretty basic but they added

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.029 
is still pretty basic but they added
cameras<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> has<00:02:09.840> three<00:02:10.200> bars<00:02:10.410> instead<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
cameras and it has three bars instead of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.120 
cameras and it has three bars instead of
two<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.610> then<00:02:12.599> which<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.680> didn't<00:02:13.890> really

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
two and then which they didn't really

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.330 
two and then which they didn't really
to<00:02:14.340> add<00:02:14.630> one<00:02:15.630> more<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.380> then<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:16.860> add<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to add one more and then they add it and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.220 
to add one more and then they add it and
then<00:02:17.430> they<00:02:17.700> still<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.450> d-pad<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
then they still have the d-pad the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.080 
then they still have the d-pad the
buttons<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.620> select<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.700> start<00:02:23.970> buttons

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
buttons and the select and start buttons

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.880 
buttons and the select and start buttons
and<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> power<00:02:25.020> button<00:02:25.350> which<00:02:25.620> was

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and then the power button which was

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.280 
and then the power button which was
actually<00:02:26.430> pretty<00:02:26.640> nice<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:28.080> didn't

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
actually pretty nice because you didn't

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.840 
actually pretty nice because you didn't
have<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.650> find<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.100> button<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.640> sides

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
have to go find the button on the sides

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.790 
have to go find the button on the sides
it<00:02:30.060> was<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.330> right<00:02:30.480> there<00:02:30.740> but<00:02:32.480> again<00:02:33.800> when

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it was just right there but again when

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.370 
it was just right there but again when
the<00:02:34.980> 3d<00:02:35.310> s<00:02:35.430> came<00:02:35.700> out<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.900> kept<00:02:37.140> wanting

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
the 3d s came out I just kept wanting

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.320 
the 3d s came out I just kept wanting
the<00:02:37.650> 30s<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.520> kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.760> got<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.060> little

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
the 30s so it kind of got a little

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.960 
the 30s so it kind of got a little
boring<00:02:39.570> but<00:02:39.870> wild<00:02:40.800> world<00:02:41.160> never<00:02:41.460> got<00:02:41.670> boring

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
boring but wild world never got boring

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.600 
boring but wild world never got boring
and<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.720> got<00:02:43.080> animal<00:02:43.410> crossing<00:02:43.710> new<00:02:43.740> leaf<00:02:43.830> so

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and so I got animal crossing new leaf so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.950 
and so I got animal crossing new leaf so
I<00:02:44.640> don't<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.150> I'll<00:02:45.270> be<00:02:45.300> playing<00:02:45.630> wild

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
I don't know if I'll be playing wild

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.290 
I don't know if I'll be playing wild
world<00:02:46.140> anymore<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.590> might<00:02:46.800> sell<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.760> eBay<00:02:48.120> or

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
world anymore I might sell it on eBay or

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.880 
world anymore I might sell it on eBay or
something<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:48.900> sure<00:02:49.700> oops<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:52.260> to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
something I'm not sure oops and then to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.640 
something I'm not sure oops and then to
the<00:02:53.070> 3ds<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:54.210> this<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.840> kind<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> video

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
the 3ds so this is kind of like a video

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.190 
the 3ds so this is kind of like a video
on<00:02:56.010> what<00:02:56.820> my<00:02:57.330> thoughts<00:02:57.600> are<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.350> 3ds<00:02:58.740> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
on what my thoughts are on the 3ds and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.620 
on what my thoughts are on the 3ds and
what<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.230> really<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.630> compared

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
what I really like about it so compared

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.140 
what I really like about it so compared
to<00:03:03.660> all<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.900> others<00:03:04.170> 2<00:03:04.800> bars<00:03:05.100> 3<00:03:05.580> bars<00:03:05.820> they

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to all the others 2 bars 3 bars they

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.460 
to all the others 2 bars 3 bars they
just<00:03:06.540> put<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:07.080> bar<00:03:08.300> it<00:03:09.300> has<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.780> two<00:03:09.930> cameras

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
just put one bar it has the two cameras

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.020 
just put one bar it has the two cameras
which<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:11.010> actually<00:03:11.400> really<00:03:11.520> nice<00:03:11.760> because

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
which is actually really nice because

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.670 
which is actually really nice because
that's<00:03:12.180> what<00:03:12.360> gives<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.930> 3d<00:03:13.230> effect<00:03:13.530> of

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
that's what gives you the 3d effect of

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.110 
that's what gives you the 3d effect of
the<00:03:13.770> videos<00:03:14.100> or<00:03:15.320> pictures<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.640> really<00:03:17.880> like

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
the videos or pictures and I really like

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.150 
the videos or pictures and I really like
the<00:03:18.330> curve<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:18.960> have<00:03:19.110> put<00:03:19.380> down<00:03:19.620> here<00:03:19.890> it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
the curve they have put down here it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.530 
the curve they have put down here it
just<00:03:20.370> looks<00:03:20.580> really<00:03:20.670> nice<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.480> doesn't

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
just looks really nice and it doesn't

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.890 
just looks really nice and it doesn't
like<00:03:22.220> when<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.250> played<00:03:24.110> this<00:03:25.110> DSi<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:27.570> didn't

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
like when I played this DSi it didn't

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.050 
like when I played this DSi it didn't
have<00:03:28.020> a<00:03:28.170> round<00:03:28.440> finish<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
have a round finish like that on the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.160 
have a round finish like that on the
corners<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.380> whenever<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.950> played<00:03:32.250> my<00:03:33.090> DSi<00:03:33.600> for

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
corners so whenever I played my DSi for

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.860 
corners so whenever I played my DSi for
a<00:03:34.530> period<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.280> time<00:03:35.490> I<00:03:35.850> would<00:03:36.240> always<00:03:36.480> get<00:03:36.690> like

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
a period of time I would always get like

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.900 
a period of time I would always get like
a<00:03:36.900> red<00:03:37.560> dot<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.160> middle<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.430> my<00:03:38.520> hand<00:03:38.670> which

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
a red dot in the middle of my hand which

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.500 
a red dot in the middle of my hand which
hurt<00:03:39.330> which<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.260> didn't<00:03:40.500> like

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
hurt which I didn't like

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.580 
hurt which I didn't like
and<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> side<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.310> really<00:03:45.209> nice

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
and on the side is really nice

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.150 
and on the side is really nice
everywhere<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.709> pretty<00:03:47.010> much<00:03:47.220> nice<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:48.060> then

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
everywhere is pretty much nice and then

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.390 
everywhere is pretty much nice and then
inside<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.730> actually<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:52.680> main<00:03:52.860> difference

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
inside is actually the main difference

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.080 
inside is actually the main difference
in<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.150> DSi<00:03:54.630> s<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.200> well<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.340> 3d<00:03:56.610> s<00:03:56.730> excels

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
in the DSi s and well in the 3d s excels

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.190 
in the DSi s and well in the 3d s excels
is<00:03:57.360> if<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.959> open<00:03:57.990> this<00:03:58.470> up<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.900> tell<00:04:01.080> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
is if I open this up you can tell the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.260 
is if I open this up you can tell the
difference<00:04:01.500> between<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.890> screen<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.670> that

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
difference between that screen and that

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.310 
difference between that screen and that
screen<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.870> mean<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.490> huge<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.570> even

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
screen I mean that is just huge and even

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.449 
screen I mean that is just huge and even
then<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.950> original<00:04:08.370> 3ds<00:04:08.730> x<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.450> original<00:04:09.930> 3ds

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
then the original 3ds x the original 3ds

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.130 
then the original 3ds x the original 3ds
was<00:04:11.459> just<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.880> little<00:04:12.450> bit<00:04:12.570> bigger<00:04:12.780> than<00:04:13.020> these

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
was just a little bit bigger than these

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.099 
was just a little bit bigger than these
screens<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.740> wasn't<00:04:14.040> really<00:04:14.840> much<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:15.900> a

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
screens so it wasn't really much of a

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.380 
screens so it wasn't really much of a
difference<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.310> would<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:17.520> been<00:04:17.580> pretty

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
difference so it would have been pretty

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.260 
difference so it would have been pretty
boring<00:04:19.049> but<00:04:19.380> when<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> got<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.640> excel<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.150> was

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
boring but when I got the excel I was

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.210 
boring but when I got the excel I was
like<00:04:21.450> wow<00:04:21.810> if<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.260> compare<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.919> my<00:04:23.010> dia

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
like wow if I compare this to my dia

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.140 
like wow if I compare this to my dia
size<00:04:23.490> or<00:04:24.000> my<00:04:24.210> other<00:04:24.590> console<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.910> pretty

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
size or my other console this is pretty

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.950 
size or my other console this is pretty
much<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.660> way

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
much the way

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.659 
much the way
bigger<00:04:28.259> screens<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.860> I'll<00:04:29.160> be<00:04:29.280> playing<00:04:29.520> this

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
bigger screens and I'll be playing this

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.090 
bigger screens and I'll be playing this
away<00:04:29.970> more<00:04:30.180> often<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:31.410> what<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.590> really<00:04:31.919> like

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
away more often and what I really like

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.510 
away more often and what I really like
about<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.669> one<00:04:32.880> instead<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:34.520> original

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
about this one instead of the original

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.749 
about this one instead of the original
3d<00:04:35.699> s<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.090> which<00:04:36.960> I've<00:04:37.199> never<00:04:37.380> actually<00:04:37.740> had<00:04:38.220> my

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
3d s is which I've never actually had my

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.309 
3d s is which I've never actually had my
own<00:04:38.789> 30s<00:04:39.270> but<00:04:39.539> I've<00:04:40.080> played<00:04:40.440> on<00:04:40.470> my<00:04:41.150> friend's

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
own 30s but I've played on my friend's

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.140 
own 30s but I've played on my friend's
30s<00:04:43.319> before<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.919> was<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.190> original<00:04:44.580> what<00:04:45.120> I

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
30s before it was the original what I

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.360 
30s before it was the original what I
really<00:04:45.389> like<00:04:45.539> about<00:04:45.569> this<00:04:45.900> one<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.349> when<00:04:46.830> turn

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
really like about this one is when turn

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.909 
really like about this one is when turn
on<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.699> 3d<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.840> then<00:04:49.349> when<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.590> slide<00:04:49.800> it

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
on the 3d and then when you slide it

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.129 
on the 3d and then when you slide it
down<00:04:50.069> it<00:04:50.340> actually<00:04:50.699> locks<00:04:51.030> into<00:04:51.479> place<00:04:51.720> so

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
down it actually locks into place so

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.710 
down it actually locks into place so
like<00:04:52.860> when<00:04:53.250> you're<00:04:53.370> on<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.699> car<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.240> run

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
like when you're on the car and you run

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.469 
like when you're on the car and you run
and<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.020> play<00:04:55.410> on<00:04:55.680> your<00:04:55.710> original<00:04:56.370> 3d<00:04:56.699> s<00:04:56.759> the

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
and you play on your original 3d s the

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.300 
and you play on your original 3d s the
thing<00:04:57.750> would<00:04:57.900> just<00:04:58.080> go<00:04:58.199> up<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:58.560> down<00:04:58.680> if<00:04:59.130> you

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
thing would just go up and down if you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.499 
thing would just go up and down if you
hit<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.520> bump<00:04:59.759> or<00:04:59.970> something<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.419> would

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
hit a bump or something and you would

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.080 
hit a bump or something and you would
always<00:05:01.050> have<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.440> reset<00:05:01.800> your<00:05:01.889> 3d<00:05:02.250> but<00:05:02.970> with

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
always have to reset your 3d but with

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.490 
always have to reset your 3d but with
this<00:05:03.240> you<00:05:03.449> don't<00:05:03.539> have<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.080> just<00:05:04.110> stays<00:05:04.470> put

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
this you don't have to it just stays put

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.730 
this you don't have to it just stays put
and<00:05:05.330> then<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:06.570> bottom<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:07.080> actually<00:05:07.110> have

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
and then on the bottom you actually have

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.040 
and then on the bottom you actually have
actual<00:05:08.370> buttons<00:05:08.789> instead<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.389> touchscreens

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
actual buttons instead of touchscreens

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.040 
actual buttons instead of touchscreens
which<00:05:10.410> is<00:05:10.590> really<00:05:10.889> nice<00:05:11.570> because<00:05:12.570> on<00:05:12.960> the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
which is really nice because on the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.469 
which is really nice because on the
original<00:05:13.440> 3d<00:05:13.650> s<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:14.160> was<00:05:14.250> just<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:15.240> they

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
original 3d s it was just it they

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:16.820 
original 3d s it was just it they
weren't<00:05:15.750> really<00:05:15.870> buttons<00:05:16.380> they<00:05:16.530> were<00:05:16.620> just

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
weren't really buttons they were just

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.240 
weren't really buttons they were just
touchable<00:05:17.280> on<00:05:17.539> it<00:05:18.539> you<00:05:19.320> had<00:05:19.409> to<00:05:19.560> press<00:05:19.710> much

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
touchable on it you had to press much

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.830 
touchable on it you had to press much
harder<00:05:21.169> but<00:05:22.580> compared<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.669> those<00:05:23.909> they<00:05:24.300> added

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
harder but compared to those they added

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.230 
harder but compared to those they added
a<00:05:25.020> an<00:05:25.289> elastic<00:05:25.860> which<00:05:26.039> I<00:05:26.159> use<00:05:26.340> way<00:05:26.610> more<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.060> mean

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
a an elastic which I use way more I mean

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.730 
a an elastic which I use way more I mean
I<00:05:27.270> still<00:05:27.539> use<00:05:27.750> this<00:05:29.120> but<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.599> only<00:05:31.139> use<00:05:31.380> this<00:05:31.560> to

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
I still use this but I only use this to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.460 
I still use this but I only use this to
change<00:05:31.919> my<00:05:32.130> tools<00:05:32.370> really<00:05:32.759> and<00:05:33.479> then<00:05:34.259> the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
change my tools really and then the

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.439 
change my tools really and then the
power<00:05:34.710> button<00:05:35.099> and<00:05:35.400> obviously<00:05:35.759> the<00:05:35.940> charging

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
power button and obviously the charging

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.689 
power button and obviously the charging
light<00:05:37.229> is<00:05:37.440> on<00:05:37.590> because<00:05:37.949> it's<00:05:38.220> on<00:05:38.370> the<00:05:38.460> charger

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
light is on because it's on the charger

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.430 
light is on because it's on the charger
what's<00:05:41.699> really<00:05:41.909> nice<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.330> they've<00:05:42.840> many

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
what's really nice is they've many

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.680 
what's really nice is they've many
people<00:05:43.710> have<00:05:43.830> had<00:05:43.919> complaints<00:05:44.400> about<00:05:44.820> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
people have had complaints about the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.339 
people have had complaints about the
screens<00:05:46.650> getting<00:05:47.099> cracked<00:05:47.430> or<00:05:48.110> messed<00:05:49.110> up

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
screens getting cracked or messed up

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.409 
screens getting cracked or messed up
because<00:05:49.949> the<00:05:50.490> screens<00:05:50.820> were<00:05:50.969> touching<00:05:51.180> each

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
because the screens were touching each

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.230 
because the screens were touching each
other<00:05:51.630> on<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.960> other<00:05:51.990> 3ds<00:05:52.650> but<00:05:53.580> now<00:05:53.759> what<00:05:54.090> they

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
other on the other 3ds but now what they

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.649 
other on the other 3ds but now what they
added<00:05:54.659> is<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:55.349> two<00:05:55.889> dots<00:05:56.099> up<00:05:56.430> here<00:05:56.639> which<00:05:57.389> can

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
added is the two dots up here which can

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.279 
added is the two dots up here which can
when<00:05:57.960> you<00:05:58.080> close<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:59.630> touch<00:06:00.630> it<00:06:00.870> doesn't

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
when you close it it touch it doesn't

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.189 
when you close it it touch it doesn't
touch<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:02.280> screen<00:06:02.580> touches<00:06:03.389> the<00:06:03.659> buttons<00:06:03.960> so

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
touch the screen touches the buttons so

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.659 
touch the screen touches the buttons so
this<00:06:04.530> so<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.039> screens<00:06:05.280> don't<00:06:05.430> touch<00:06:05.639> each

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
this so the screens don't touch each

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.060 
this so the screens don't touch each
other<00:06:06.590> so<00:06:08.120> these<00:06:09.120> are<00:06:09.840> my<00:06:10.169> thoughts<00:06:10.500> on<00:06:10.919> these

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
other so these are my thoughts on these

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.350 
other so these are my thoughts on these
consoles<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:12.229> if<00:06:13.229> you<00:06:14.070> want<00:06:14.340> to<00:06:14.580> upgrade<00:06:14.759> I

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
consoles and if you want to upgrade I
