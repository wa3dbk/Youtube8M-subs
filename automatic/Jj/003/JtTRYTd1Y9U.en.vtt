00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
competition is probably going to be the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.710 
competition is probably going to be the
losi<00:00:29.730> SCT<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.070> even<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:33.150> truck<00:00:33.510> is

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
losi SCT and even then this truck is

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.560 
losi SCT and even then this truck is
going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.990> be<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.440> lighter<00:00:34.770> than<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:36.030> losi

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
going to be much lighter than the losi

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.010 
going to be much lighter than the losi
SCT<00:00:37.080> due<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:37.860> carbon<00:00:38.760> fiber<00:00:38.970> design<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
SCT due to the carbon fiber design of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.920 
SCT due to the carbon fiber design of
this<00:00:40.380> truck<00:00:40.880> overall<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.090> handling<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this truck overall the handling is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.610 
this truck overall the handling is
superior<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.840> really<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> only<00:00:46.140> thing<00:00:46.470> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
superior and really the only thing that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.490 
superior and really the only thing that
could<00:00:46.740> go<00:00:46.860> wrong<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.450> improper<00:00:49.140> choice

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
could go wrong is is a improper choice

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
could go wrong is is a improper choice
of<00:00:49.740> tires<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:52.190> impact<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.400> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.180> front<00:00:54.450> or

side impact and the a front impact dolls
are<00:01:20.100> only<00:01:20.310> two<00:01:20.960> weak<00:01:21.960> points<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:23.100> on

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
are only two weak points that I see on

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
are only two weak points that I see on
the<00:01:23.460> truck<00:01:24.560> overall<00:01:25.560> though<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.990> very

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the truck overall though it's a very

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.809 
the truck overall though it's a very
light<00:01:28.619> truck<00:01:28.979> you're<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
light truck you're going to have one the

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.969 
light truck you're going to have one the
lightest<00:01:30.389> short-course<00:01:31.350> trucks<00:01:31.740> out<00:01:31.950> there

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
lightest short-course trucks out there

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.919 
lightest short-course trucks out there
so<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.420> could<00:01:33.569> actually<00:01:33.889> place<00:01:34.889> like<00:01:35.249> weights

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
so you could actually place like weights

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.499 
so you could actually place like weights
I<00:01:36.929> would<00:01:37.590> say<00:01:37.889> I've<00:01:38.310> kind<00:01:38.609> of<00:01:38.670> favor<00:01:38.850> placing<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
I would say I've kind of favor placing a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.289 
I would say I've kind of favor placing a
weight<00:01:39.780> towards<00:01:40.139> the<00:01:40.439> front<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.270> also<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
favor placing another weight towards the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.050 
favor placing another weight towards the
middle<00:01:45.209> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.539> truck<00:01:46.850> overall<00:01:47.850> though
