00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
result to this so let's put in two let's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.170 
result to this so let's put in two let's
walk<00:01:51.299> let's<00:01:51.630> close<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> chest<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:53.850> open

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
chest once again and then walk away for

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.490 
chest once again and then walk away for
at<00:01:58.590> least<00:01:58.770> fifteen<00:01:59.729> seconds<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:01.290> sure<00:02:01.320> to

at least fifteen seconds so be sure to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.880 
at least fifteen seconds so be sure to
count<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:02.009> loud<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:03.020> count<00:02:04.020> slower<00:02:04.350> because

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
count out loud or count slower because

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.150 
count out loud or count slower because
you<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.469> exact<00:02:07.469> rate<00:02:07.770> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
you want to get it at a exact rate so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.580 
you want to get it at a exact rate so
let's<00:02:09.000> walk<00:02:09.149> around<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:09.929> least<00:02:10.110> fifteen

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
let's walk around for at least fifteen

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.690 
let's walk around for at least fifteen
seconds
