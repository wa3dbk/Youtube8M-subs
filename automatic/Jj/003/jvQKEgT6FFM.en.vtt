might well be massively toxic things to
give<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> way<00:01:54.400> out<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:54.910> still<00:01:55.150> fizzy<00:01:55.450> when

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
give it a way out is it still fizzy when

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.910 
give it a way out is it still fizzy when
you<00:01:55.630> take<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.900> top<00:01:56.080> off<00:01:56.230> you<00:01:56.560> know<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.770> should

be<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.040> little<00:01:57.370> bit<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.640> gas<00:01:57.820> escaping<00:01:58.270> sure

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
be a little bit of gas escaping sure

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.330

to<00:02:00.640> be<00:02:00.730> brutally<00:02:01.000> honest<00:02:01.240> but<00:02:01.420> there's<00:02:01.780> only

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
to be brutally honest but there's only

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.600 
to be brutally honest but there's only
one<00:02:02.200> way<00:02:02.410> we're<00:02:02.650> going<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.830> find<00:02:03.040> out<00:02:03.220> if<00:02:03.460> this

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610
