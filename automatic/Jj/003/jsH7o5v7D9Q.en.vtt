00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
the writing position you can see that's

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.479 
the writing position you can see that's
the<00:03:32.480> scoop<00:03:32.750> it's<00:03:33.260> going<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.440> draw<00:03:33.680> air<00:03:34.010> right

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
the scoop it's going to draw air right

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.000 
the scoop it's going to draw air right
into<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.150> jacket<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.720> tourmaster<00:03:36.470> uses<00:03:36.890> what

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
into the jacket and tourmaster uses what

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.039 
into the jacket and tourmaster uses what
they<00:03:37.100> call<00:03:37.280> their<00:03:37.430> pipeline<00:03:38.049> ventilation

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
they call their pipeline ventilation

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.300 
they call their pipeline ventilation
system<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.530> basically<00:03:39.799> we<00:03:39.950> talked<00:03:40.160> about

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
system and basically we talked about

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.890 
system and basically we talked about
that<00:03:40.610> rain<00:03:40.820> guard<00:03:41.090> barrier<00:03:41.420> which<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.750> an

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
that rain guard barrier which is an

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.380 
that rain guard barrier which is an
internal<00:03:42.590> waterproof<00:03:43.549> membrane<00:03:43.820> that's<00:03:44.209> not

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
internal waterproof membrane that's not

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.539 
internal waterproof membrane that's not
removable<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.769> pipeline<00:03:46.190> system

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
removable but with the pipeline system

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.410 
removable but with the pipeline system
what<00:03:46.670> they've<00:03:46.820> done<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.120> they've<00:03:47.239> actually

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
what they've done is they've actually

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.170 
what they've done is they've actually
created<00:03:47.660> air<00:03:48.350> passages<00:03:48.890> little<00:03:49.220> tunnels<00:03:49.640> for

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
created air passages little tunnels for

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.940 
created air passages little tunnels for
the<00:03:50.299> air<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.720> actually<00:03:51.080> flow<00:03:51.380> through<00:03:51.769> the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
the air to actually flow through the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.250 
the air to actually flow through the
rain<00:03:52.489> barrier<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.090> actually<00:03:53.900> reach<00:03:54.080> your

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
rain barrier and actually reach your

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.620 
rain barrier and actually reach your
skin<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.459> can<00:03:55.549> get<00:03:55.670> air<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:56.060> through<00:03:56.330> here

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
skin so you can get air in through here

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.550 
skin so you can get air in through here
at<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:57.110> tricep<00:03:57.950> area<00:03:58.190> there's<00:03:59.060> another

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
at the tricep area there's another

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.110 
at the tricep area there's another
zippered<00:04:00.560> vent<00:04:00.799> at<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.070> shoulders<00:04:01.489> here<00:04:01.519> same

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
zippered vent at the shoulders here same

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.180 
zippered vent at the shoulders here same
type<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.390> velcro<00:04:02.720> system<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.320> can<00:04:03.350> fold<00:04:04.040> this

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
type of velcro system I can fold this

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.220 
type of velcro system I can fold this
open<00:04:04.519> like<00:04:04.670> so<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.180> it's<00:04:05.630> going<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.780> create<00:04:06.049> a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
open like so and it's going to create a

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.650 
open like so and it's going to create a
nice<00:04:06.470> little<00:04:06.680> air<00:04:06.920> scoop<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.820> again<00:04:08.090> as<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.390> ride

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
nice little air scoop so again as I ride

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.449 
nice little air scoop so again as I ride
air<00:04:09.200> is<00:04:09.320> going<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.530> basically<00:04:09.799> be<00:04:10.070> forced

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
air is going to basically be forced

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.240 
air is going to basically be forced
right<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:10.850> there<00:04:11.060> there<00:04:11.720> are<00:04:11.930> also<00:04:12.170> some<00:04:12.890> very

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
right in there there are also some very

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.310 
right in there there are also some very
large<00:04:13.459> events<00:04:13.940> along<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.420> torso<00:04:14.840> here<00:04:15.019> so<00:04:15.230> if

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
large events along the torso here so if

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.930 
large events along the torso here so if
I<00:04:15.410> open<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.739> up<00:04:15.890> here<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.519> can<00:04:16.579> see<00:04:16.790> these

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
I open it up here you can see these

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.210 
I open it up here you can see these
large<00:04:17.239> rents<00:04:17.570> here<00:04:17.810> again<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:18.590> allowing<00:04:18.859> air

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
large rents here again just allowing air

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.880 
large rents here again just allowing air
to<00:04:19.250> flow<00:04:19.549> through<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.120> have<00:04:20.239> plenty<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.900> air

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
to flow through you have plenty of air

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.920 
to flow through you have plenty of air
flow<00:04:22.250> here<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:22.790> then<00:04:23.330> instead<00:04:23.660> of<00:04:23.720> spinning

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
flow here and then instead of spinning

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.450 
flow here and then instead of spinning
around<00:04:24.169> I'll<00:04:24.500> actually<00:04:24.650> show<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:25.010> on<00:04:25.310> the

there's<00:05:00.929> a<00:05:00.989> reflective<00:05:01.589> tourmaster<00:05:02.039> triangle

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
there's a reflective tourmaster triangle

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.579 
there's a reflective tourmaster triangle
it's<00:05:03.239> kind<00:05:03.389> of<00:05:03.479> their<00:05:03.629> signature<00:05:04.139> mark<00:05:04.379> and

then<00:05:04.799> you<00:05:04.919> have<00:05:05.129> reflective<00:05:06.029> boss

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
then you have reflective boss

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.139 
then you have reflective boss
light-piping<00:05:07.589> that<00:05:08.429> is<00:05:08.610> going<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:08.909> keep<00:05:08.999> you

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:11.489 
visible at night so you have reflective

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:12.649 
visible at night so you have reflective
piping<00:05:11.639> that<00:05:11.939> runs<00:05:12.119> all<00:05:12.269> the<00:05:12.299> way<00:05:12.360> down<00:05:12.539> the

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
piping that runs all the way down the

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:14.929 
piping that runs all the way down the
shoulder<00:05:13.019> and<00:05:13.169> down<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.159> arm<00:05:14.339> on<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.639> back<00:05:14.909> of

the<00:05:15.119> jacket<00:05:15.589> and<00:05:16.589> then<00:05:17.009> spinning<00:05:17.309> it<00:05:17.459> back

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:17.579 
the jacket and then spinning it back

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:19.100 
the jacket and then spinning it back
around<00:05:17.849> here<00:05:18.149> you<00:05:18.269> have<00:05:18.449> more<00:05:18.719> reflective

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
around here you have more reflective
