when<00:00:20.369> they<00:00:20.460> were<00:00:20.519> talking<00:00:20.759> about<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.359> are

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
when they were talking about what are

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.659 
when they were talking about what are
the<00:00:21.539> stances<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:23.369> they're<00:00:23.490> basically

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
the stances for and they're basically

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.950 
the stances for and they're basically
for<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.240> stances<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:24.990> transitional<00:00:25.650> points

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
for me stances are transitional points

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.569 
for me stances are transitional points
it's<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.289> gift<00:00:28.410> from<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.649> one<00:00:29.160> place<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
it's just a gift from one one place to

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.189 
it's just a gift from one one place to
get<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> next<00:00:30.270> and<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.869> had<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.989> good<00:00:31.169> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
get to the next and you had a good a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
get to the next and you had a good a
point<00:00:31.470> about<00:00:31.619> able<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> deliver<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:33.030> power

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
point about able to deliver your power

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720 
point about able to deliver your power
or<00:00:33.600> sink<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.199> your<00:00:34.320> energy<00:00:34.500> into<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
or sink or put your energy into the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
or sink or put your energy into the
movement<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:37.699> in<00:00:38.699> competent<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.420> combat

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
movement because in competent in combat

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.990 
movement because in competent in combat
you<00:00:40.589> should<00:00:40.769> never<00:00:40.949> be<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.220> one<00:00:41.460> place<00:00:41.640> for

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you should never be in one place for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.649 
you should never be in one place for
very<00:00:42.059> long<00:00:42.470> if<00:00:43.470> you<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:44.040> desk<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
very long if you are your desk we have a

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.689 
very long if you are your desk we have a
safe<00:00:45.989> stay<00:00:46.379> still<00:00:46.650> you<00:00:46.800> die<00:00:46.949> move<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.550> live

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
safe stay still you die move you live

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:48.889 
safe stay still you die move you live
it's<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.300> simple

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it's that simple

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.890 
it's that simple
so<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.909> I<00:00:51.000> always<00:00:51.299> talking<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.750> being

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
so you know I always talking about being

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.630 
so you know I always talking about being
ruining<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.530> stance<00:00:52.769> and<00:00:53.040> yes<00:00:53.189> that's<00:00:53.369> good

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
ruining your stance and yes that's good

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
ruining your stance and yes that's good
training<00:00:54.089> because<00:00:54.720> when<00:00:54.900> you<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.290> stance

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
training because when you in the stance

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.320 
training because when you in the stance
you<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.979> be<00:00:56.070> rooted<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:56.909> more<00:00:57.119> about

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
you want to be rooted it's more about

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.890 
you want to be rooted it's more about
learning<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.839> gather<00:00:58.710> energy<00:00:59.900> and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
learning how to gather energy and

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.289 
learning how to gather energy and
delivering<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.610> stance<00:01:02.909> is<00:01:03.150> a

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
delivering you so the stance is a

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.929 
delivering you so the stance is a
momentary<00:01:03.839> position<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:05.129> store<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> release

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
momentary position to store and release

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.140 
momentary position to store and release
energy<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.320> moving<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.830> changing

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
energy as you're moving and changing

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.350 
energy as you're moving and changing
okay<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.450> location<00:01:09.990> sue<00:01:10.530> me<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.090> stance

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
okay your location sue me so your stance

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.760 
okay your location sue me so your stance
is<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.720> footwork<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.470> you're<00:01:13.619> always

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
is your footwork because you're always

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.859 
is your footwork because you're always
if<00:01:14.070> yours<00:01:14.250> take<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> step<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.630> step

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
if yours take a step some of that step

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
if yours take a step some of that step
I'm<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.110> another<00:01:16.320> stance<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.890> ice<00:01:17.240> sort<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
I'm in another stance on ice sort of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.640 
I'm in another stance on ice sort of
means<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.750> always<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.200> motion<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
means so it's always in motion and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.069 
means so it's always in motion and
transition<00:01:20.390> little<00:01:21.390> thing<00:01:21.570> whenever<00:01:21.810> I've

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
transition little thing whenever I've

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.800 
transition little thing whenever I've
been<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> joint<00:01:23.120> be<00:01:24.120> particularly<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.780> now

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
been the joint be particularly right now

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
been the joint be particularly right now
I'm<00:01:25.380> bending<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> knees<00:01:26.010> ankle<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> hip

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
I'm bending the knees ankle in the hip

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
I'm bending the knees ankle in the hip
and<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:28.080> story<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:29.280> manifesting<00:01:30.090> enemy<00:01:31.700> okay

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and my story or manifesting enemy okay

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.560 
and my story or manifesting enemy okay
so<00:01:33.680> if<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.830> look<00:01:35.010> at<00:01:35.159> ligament<00:01:35.580> tendon<00:01:35.760> which

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
so if you look at ligament tendon which

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
so if you look at ligament tendon which
is<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> great<00:01:37.140> conductor<00:01:37.500> from<00:01:38.010> bio<00:01:38.190> internet

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is a great conductor from bio internet

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
is a great conductor from bio internet
okay<00:01:39.540> actually<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.930> best<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> body

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
okay actually the best in the body

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.060 
okay actually the best in the body
so<00:01:41.490> whenever<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.880> create<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.750> job<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.560> work<00:01:43.770> for

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
so whenever I create a job or work for

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.520 
so whenever I create a job or work for
the<00:01:44.130> joint<00:01:44.430> okay<00:01:45.300> I<00:01:45.630> create<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> potential

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the joint okay I create a potential

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.130 
the joint okay I create a potential
difference<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> buying<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> energy<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
difference and buying the energy in the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
difference and buying the energy in the
body<00:01:49.260> so<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.280> energy<00:01:50.520> tends<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.940> collect

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
body so the energy tends to collect

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
body so the energy tends to collect
there<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.750> there's<00:01:51.960> work<00:01:52.200> being<00:01:52.229> done

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
there because there's work being done

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.649 
there because there's work being done
it's<00:01:52.890> needed<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.540> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
it's needed right that's what this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.289 
it's needed right that's what this
coiling<00:01:55.140> Qigong<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.120> whenever

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
coiling Qigong is all about so whenever

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
coiling Qigong is all about so whenever
I've<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.900> joint<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.409> she<00:01:58.650> tends<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
I've been the joint that she tends to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.130 
I've been the joint that she tends to
what<00:01:59.430> collect<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.180> storing<00:02:00.600> energy<00:02:00.870> I'm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
what collect I'm storing energy I'm

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.060 
what collect I'm storing energy I'm
creating<00:02:01.500> potential<00:02:02.270> energy<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:04.710> understand

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
creating potential energy you understand

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910 
creating potential energy you understand
not<00:02:06.030> energy<00:02:06.360> yet<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.740> hasn't

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
not energy yet well it is but it hasn't

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.339 
not energy yet well it is but it hasn't
been<00:02:08.129> really<00:02:08.310> used<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> trick<00:02:10.049> about<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
been really used so the trick about a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.199 
been really used so the trick about a
lot<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.619> times<00:02:10.799> about<00:02:10.920> stances<00:02:11.519> when<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> sink<00:02:12.060> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
lot of times about stances when I sink I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.140 
lot of times about stances when I sink I
am<00:02:12.420> already<00:02:12.780> loading<00:02:13.549> energy<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:14.970> can

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
am already loading energy and then I can

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.679 
am already loading energy and then I can
what<00:02:15.360> release<00:02:16.140> her<00:02:16.489> same<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.970> all<00:02:18.540> of

what release her same in the in all of
the<00:02:18.780> joints<00:02:19.019> so<00:02:19.409> anytime<00:02:20.129> I'm<00:02:20.489> here<00:02:21.150> that's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the joints so anytime I'm here that's

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
why I'm in beginning to do lots of these

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.370 
why I'm in beginning to do lots of these
stance<00:02:26.030> potential

roots<00:02:28.380> because<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.550> bring<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> energy

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
roots because now I can bring the energy

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880

up<00:02:30.210> from<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> earth<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:30.960> I'm<00:02:31.110> storing<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.800> in

why do you preload pulling the arm back

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.110 
why do you preload pulling the arm back
see<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:36.600> bent<00:02:36.870> I've<00:02:37.050> loaded<00:02:37.530> energy<00:02:38.120> it's

this<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:48.000> when<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.180> did<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.540> all<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> did

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
this because when I did this all I did

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.860 
this because when I did this all I did
was<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.290> turn<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> wrist<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.850> hit<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.510> ligament

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
was I turn the wrist I hit the ligament

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
was I turn the wrist I hit the ligament
in<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.440> come<00:02:52.650> into<00:02:52.830> play<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.820> under<00:02:54.060> distress

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
in to come into play it's under distress

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.770 
in to come into play it's under distress
or<00:02:54.960> distress<00:02:55.770> or<00:02:55.980> whatever<00:02:56.250> from<00:02:56.430> coming<00:02:56.850> so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
or distress or whatever from coming so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.710 
or distress or whatever from coming so
it's<00:02:57.960> what<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:59.370> wound<00:02:59.640> up<00:02:59.910> creating

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's what it's wound up creating

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.400 
it's what it's wound up creating
potential<00:03:01.500> energy<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.490> now<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.290> be

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
potential energy so that now it can be

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.970 
potential energy so that now it can be
released

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
released

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.910 
released
tsunami<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.270> you'll<00:03:07.080> see<00:03:07.320> me<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> lot<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.680> times

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
tsunami so you'll see me a lot of times

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.700 
tsunami so you'll see me a lot of times
I've<00:03:08.040> talked<00:03:08.250> about<00:03:08.490> using<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.570> wrist<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
I've talked about using the wrist to

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.890 
I've talked about using the wrist to
create<00:03:10.980> power<00:03:11.220> soon<00:03:12.210> because<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> lot<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.660> times

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
create power soon because a lot of times

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.630 
create power soon because a lot of times
what<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.290> don't<00:03:13.470> see<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.220> movement

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
what you don't see is in the movement

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.920 
what you don't see is in the movement
when<00:03:14.730> I'm<00:03:14.880> here<00:03:15.120> I'm<00:03:15.270> already<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.660> loading

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
when I'm here I'm already the loading

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.140 
when I'm here I'm already the loading
energy<00:03:16.290> from<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.650> side<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.220> then<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.850> release

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
energy from one side and then I release

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.620 
energy from one side and then I release
it<00:03:18.350> does<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.440> make<00:03:19.620> sense<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:21.360> can<00:03:21.510> go

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
it does that make sense so we can go

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.500 
it does that make sense so we can go
from<00:03:21.870> very<00:03:21.990> general<00:03:22.560> very<00:03:22.820> large<00:03:23.820> muscles<00:03:24.360> to

very specific even in my fingertips when
I<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.320> can<00:03:28.560> explode<00:03:28.950> through<00:03:29.220> my<00:03:29.340> palm<00:03:29.640> because

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
I I can explode through my palm because

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.690 
I I can explode through my palm because
I'm<00:03:30.660> loading<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.440> then<00:03:31.770> releasing<00:03:32.220> energy<00:03:32.370> so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
I'm loading and then releasing energy so

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.760 
I'm loading and then releasing energy so
part<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.540> training<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:34.560> the

part of training it's the

how to release tsunami does that make

how to release tsunami does that make
sense

little more sense than is I'm gonna
start<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.480> use<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.810> whole<00:03:52.020> body<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.410> little<00:03:52.620> bit

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000

the weird attaches a cartilage right on
either<00:04:01.710> side<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:02.460> this<00:04:02.670> itself<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:03.540> another

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
either side so this itself is another

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.510 
either side so this itself is another
joint<00:04:04.020> so<00:04:04.710> I<00:04:04.740> can<00:04:05.040> use<00:04:05.250> my<00:04:05.280> chest<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:07.680> store<00:04:08.340> and

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
joint so I can use my chest to store and

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
joint so I can use my chest to store and
release<00:04:08.640> power<00:04:09.140> same<00:04:10.140> as<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.410> use<00:04:10.560> my<00:04:10.740> spine

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
release power same as I use my spine

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.410 
release power same as I use my spine
store<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:13.250> then<00:04:14.250> release<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.730> power<00:04:14.940> does

store and then release the power does

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.569 
store and then release the power does
that<00:04:15.570> make<00:04:15.720> sense

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
that make sense

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.430 
that make sense
so<00:04:17.239> we're<00:04:17.419> gonna<00:04:17.539> do<00:04:17.629> a<00:04:17.659> little<00:04:17.810> drill<00:04:18.169> here

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
so we're gonna do a little drill here

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.680 
so we're gonna do a little drill here
I'm<00:04:19.159> going<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.370> start<00:04:19.459> storing<00:04:20.060> energy<00:04:20.359> and

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
I'm going to start storing energy and

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.649 
I'm going to start storing energy and
then<00:04:20.780> we<00:04:20.930> start<00:04:21.169> releasing<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:23.030> first<00:04:23.509> I

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
then we start releasing it so first I

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.869 
then we start releasing it so first I
want<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:23.900> come<00:04:24.199> down<00:04:24.580> let<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.610> body

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:25.879 
want to just come down let the body

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.460 
want to just come down let the body
relax<00:04:26.289> bend<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.379> knees<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:28.159> sink<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.759> chest

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
relax bend the knees and sink the chest

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.589 
relax bend the knees and sink the chest
so<00:04:30.470> when<00:04:30.620> I'm<00:04:30.740> here<00:04:31.009> my<00:04:31.430> chest<00:04:31.789> sinks<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.479> I

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
so when I'm here my chest sinks and I

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.869 
so when I'm here my chest sinks and I
set<00:04:32.960> down<00:04:33.139> a<00:04:33.199> little<00:04:33.409> bit<00:04:33.590> now<00:04:34.520> I'm<00:04:34.669> going<00:04:34.819> to

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
set down a little bit now I'm going to

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.200 
set down a little bit now I'm going to
bend<00:04:35.569> the<00:04:35.690> arms<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:37.520> from<00:04:37.699> here<00:04:37.879> then<00:04:38.150> I

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
bend the arms and from here then I

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.529 
bend the arms and from here then I
explode<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.470> I'm<00:04:39.680> going<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.889> release<00:04:40.539> watch

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
explode and I'm going to release watch

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.969 
explode and I'm going to release watch
watch<00:04:41.870> my<00:04:42.080> hands<00:04:42.639> it's<00:04:43.639> not<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:44.740> crap<00:04:45.740> you

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
watch my hands it's not that crap you

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.540 
watch my hands it's not that crap you
know<00:04:46.069> why<00:04:46.280> did<00:04:46.879> you<00:04:46.909> stop<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.419> interview

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
know why did you stop the interview

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.899 
know why did you stop the interview
102<00:04:52.000> works<00:04:53.000> like<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.240> whip<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.919> whole<00:04:55.159> time

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
102 works like a whip the whole time

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.050 
102 works like a whip the whole time
I'm<00:04:56.060> scoring<00:04:56.629> and<00:04:57.560> then<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.770> can<00:04:57.919> release<00:04:58.219> and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
I'm scoring and then I can release and

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.219 
I'm scoring and then I can release and
then<00:04:59.150> watch<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.599> wrist<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.860> snaps<00:05:01.300> okay<00:05:02.300> this

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
then watch the wrist it snaps okay this

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.980 
then watch the wrist it snaps okay this
is<00:05:03.379> just<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.620> drill<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:04.159> start<00:05:04.219> to<00:05:04.520> develop<00:05:04.990> how

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
is just a drill to start to develop how

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.619 
is just a drill to start to develop how
to<00:05:06.050> release<00:05:06.440> your<00:05:06.650> power<00:05:07.449> okay

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
to release your power okay

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.170 
to release your power okay
they<00:05:09.530> said<00:05:09.710> these<00:05:09.919> are<00:05:10.129> fudging<00:05:10.580> patterns

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
they said these are fudging patterns

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.050 
they said these are fudging patterns
there's<00:05:11.449> many<00:05:11.659> patterns<00:05:12.490> that's<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.639> fudging

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
there's many patterns that's a fudging

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.230 
there's many patterns that's a fudging
pattern<00:05:15.099> that's<00:05:16.099> another<00:05:16.610> pattern<00:05:16.940> so

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
pattern that's another pattern so

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.390 
pattern that's another pattern so
there's<00:05:17.419> many<00:05:17.750> different<00:05:18.169> ways<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.770> create

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
there's many different ways to create

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.790 
there's many different ways to create
this<00:05:19.699> power<00:05:20.030> but<00:05:20.930> they're<00:05:21.080> all<00:05:21.259> based<00:05:21.500> on<00:05:21.680> the

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
this power but they're all based on the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.430 
this power but they're all based on the
same<00:05:22.039> thing<00:05:22.449> so<00:05:23.449> watch<00:05:23.659> my<00:05:23.870> body<00:05:24.080> one<00:05:24.319> more

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
same thing so watch my body one more

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.339 
same thing so watch my body one more
time<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.009> we'll<00:05:25.190> all<00:05:25.340> do<00:05:25.520> it<00:05:25.669> so<00:05:25.849> here<00:05:26.349> I've

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
time and we'll all do it so here I've

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.350 
time and we'll all do it so here I've
bend<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.830> joints<00:05:28.569> inhale<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:32.120> then<00:05:32.300> I

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
bend the joints inhale and then I

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.040 
bend the joints inhale and then I
release<00:05:32.599> and<00:05:33.560> notice<00:05:33.889> how<00:05:34.360> I'm<00:05:35.360> still<00:05:35.659> rooted

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
release and notice how I'm still rooted

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.689 
release and notice how I'm still rooted
I'm<00:05:36.169> not<00:05:36.289> coming<00:05:36.620> out<00:05:36.710> of<00:05:36.770> my<00:05:36.860> stance<00:05:37.310> but<00:05:37.550> my

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
I'm not coming out of my stance but my

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.589 
I'm not coming out of my stance but my
legs<00:05:38.529> somewhat<00:05:39.529> release<00:05:40.300> okay<00:05:41.300> I'm<00:05:41.419> turning

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
legs somewhat release okay I'm turning

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.149 
legs somewhat release okay I'm turning
that<00:05:41.810> potential<00:05:42.289> energy<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:43.009> I'm

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
that potential energy and I'm

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.249 
that potential energy and I'm
manifesting<00:05:43.819> and<00:05:43.940> I'm<00:05:44.000> moving<00:05:44.270> it<00:05:44.389> out<00:05:44.509> does

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
manifesting and I'm moving it out does

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.980 
manifesting and I'm moving it out does
that<00:05:45.289> make<00:05:45.560> sense<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:46.690> wanting<00:05:47.690> to<00:05:47.779> sink

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
that make sense so wanting to sink

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.210 
that make sense so wanting to sink
through<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.139> chest<00:05:48.469> and<00:05:49.210> explode
