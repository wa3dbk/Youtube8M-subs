00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
like you know on the beginning they'd be

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.810 
like you know on the beginning they'd be
speaking<00:03:26.239> English<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.870> I'd<00:03:26.959> be<00:03:27.049> like<00:03:27.820> what

mindset behind it and I think one thing

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.949 
mindset behind it and I think one thing
about<00:03:33.769> like<00:03:34.040> Korean<00:03:34.610> English<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.510> they<00:03:35.780> use

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
really hard words but like I have to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.210

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.890 
differently I don't know how to explain
it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.780 
it
maybe<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.709> don't<00:04:21.859> know<00:04:22.010> my<00:04:22.130> university<00:04:22.700> was

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
maybe I don't know my university was

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.370 
maybe I don't know my university was
really<00:04:23.030> small<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:23.840> like<00:04:24.410> back<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.800> Canada

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
really small so like back in Canada

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.740 
really small so like back in Canada
and<00:04:25.470> some<00:04:26.190> yuan<00:04:26.550> is<00:04:26.670> pretty<00:04:26.880> small<00:04:27.120> -<00:04:27.360> action

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
and some yuan is pretty small - action

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.900 
and some yuan is pretty small - action
now<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> think<00:04:28.200> about<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.800> yeah<00:04:29.490> it's<00:04:29.790> a

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
now that I think about it yeah it's a

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.450 
now that I think about it yeah it's a
beautiful<00:04:30.630> campus<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:31.440> gotta<00:04:31.620> go<00:04:31.800> there<00:04:31.950> yeah

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
beautiful campus you gotta go there yeah

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.550 
beautiful campus you gotta go there yeah

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
I think another thing about the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.370 
I think another thing about the
professors<00:04:35.520> though<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:36.120> like<00:04:36.810> they'll

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
professors though is like they'll

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.110 
professors though is like they'll
actually<00:04:37.620> take<00:04:38.040> really<00:04:38.400> good<00:04:38.670> care<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:38.970> you

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
actually take really good care of you

actually take really good care of you

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
and if you want to talk to them after

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.540 
and if you want to talk to them after
class

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
