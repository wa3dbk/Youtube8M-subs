looking for is ensuring that the washers

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.369 
looking for is ensuring that the washers
on<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.269> still<00:02:33.450> good<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.900> threads<00:02:34.200> are

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
on it are still good the threads are

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.420 
on it are still good the threads are
still<00:02:34.620> good<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.299> hasn't<00:02:36.950> been<00:02:37.950> damaged

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
still good that it hasn't been damaged

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.080 
still good that it hasn't been damaged
too<00:02:38.610> badly

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
too badly

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
too badly
and<00:02:39.569> once<00:02:39.989> this<00:02:40.230> stops<00:02:40.560> draining<00:02:41.069> we're<00:02:41.190> going

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
and once this stops draining we're going

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.869 
and once this stops draining we're going
to<00:02:41.370> wipe<00:02:41.549> up<00:02:41.760> around<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.230> hole<00:02:43.760> where<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
to wipe up around the hole where the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.830 
to wipe up around the hole where the
plug<00:02:45.090> goes<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.660> check<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> threads<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.349> there

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
plug goes and check the threads up there

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.240 
plug goes and check the threads up there
now<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.230> other<00:02:49.379> thing<00:02:49.590> you'll<00:02:49.739> note<00:02:49.980> when

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
now the other thing you'll note when

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.710 
now the other thing you'll note when
you're<00:02:50.340> down<00:02:50.549> here<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.540> oil

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
you're down here is that your oil

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.150 
you're down here is that your oil
filters<00:02:52.140> up<00:02:52.290> there<00:02:52.470> on<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.709> side<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
filters up there on the side of the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.729 
filters up there on the side of the
block<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.989> next<00:02:55.200> thing<00:02:55.409> we're<00:02:55.530> going<00:02:55.650> to

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
block so the next thing we're going to

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.770 
block so the next thing we're going to
do<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.190> get<00:02:56.400> our<00:02:56.519> oil<00:02:56.700> filter<00:02:57.090> wrench<00:02:57.120> get<00:02:57.659> up

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
do is get our oil filter wrench get up

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.860 
do is get our oil filter wrench get up
there<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.340> disconnect<00:02:59.340> that<00:03:02.659> okay<00:03:03.659> so<00:03:03.720> I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
there and disconnect that okay so I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.910 
there and disconnect that okay so I
wanted<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.140> show<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.349> things<00:03:04.620> from<00:03:04.739> my

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
wanted to show you things from my

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.250 
wanted to show you things from my
perspective<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> moment<00:03:05.849> so<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:06.870> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
perspective for a moment so there's the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.460 
perspective for a moment so there's the
oil<00:03:07.440> drain<00:03:08.299> there<00:03:09.299> is<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.780> oil<00:03:09.810> filter<00:03:10.440> and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
oil drain there is the oil filter and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.580 
oil drain there is the oil filter and
you<00:03:10.769> see<00:03:10.980> I've<00:03:11.220> got<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.700> socket<00:03:12.180> wrench<00:03:12.390> with<00:03:12.989> an

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you see I've got a socket wrench with an

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.970 
you see I've got a socket wrench with an
adjustable<00:03:14.250> oil<00:03:14.819> filter<00:03:15.560> adapter<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.739> end

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
adjustable oil filter adapter on the end

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.400 
adjustable oil filter adapter on the end
of<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:17.250> now<00:03:19.519> this<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.790> not<00:03:21.690> exactly<00:03:22.169> my

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
of it now this is a not exactly my

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.180 
of it now this is a not exactly my
favorite<00:03:22.489> setup<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.760> when<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:23.970> comes<00:03:24.120> to

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
favorite setup for when it comes to

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.830 
favorite setup for when it comes to
changing<00:03:26.190> oil<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.730> don't<00:03:27.120> really<00:03:27.299> like<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.690> way

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
changing oil I don't really like the way

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.690 
changing oil I don't really like the way
that<00:03:28.019> honda<00:03:28.440> has<00:03:28.560> set<00:03:28.829> up<00:03:28.950> their<00:03:29.129> oil<00:03:29.310> filters

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
that honda has set up their oil filters

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.119 
that honda has set up their oil filters
now<00:03:29.910> some<00:03:30.750> folks<00:03:31.049> will<00:03:31.319> take<00:03:31.500> off<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.889> tire

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
now some folks will take off the tire

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.490 
now some folks will take off the tire
and<00:03:32.459> come<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.359> from<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.660> side<00:03:33.840> makes<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.440> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
and come in from the side makes it a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.670 
and come in from the side makes it a
little<00:03:34.650> bit<00:03:34.799> easier<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.250> access<00:03:35.849> but<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:37.019> also

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
little bit easier to access but it also

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.449 
little bit easier to access but it also
adds<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.819> lot<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.000> time<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.449> job<00:03:39.949> so<00:03:40.949> you<00:03:41.340> get

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
adds a lot of time to the job so you get

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.430 
adds a lot of time to the job so you get
your<00:03:41.579> wrench<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.389> knock<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.230> oil

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.229 
your wrench on there and knock the oil
filter<00:03:43.650> loose<00:03:43.980> until<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:44.699> can<00:03:44.819> spin<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.090> by

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
filter loose until you can spin it by

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.460 
filter loose until you can spin it by

pretty quickly with this one because it

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.420 
pretty quickly with this one because it
will<00:03:52.730> make<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.790> mess<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:55.500> come<00:03:55.889> at<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.040> from<00:03:56.310> the

warm<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.580> then<00:04:15.580> when<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.120> gets<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:18.100> end<00:04:18.370> of

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
warm and then when it gets to the end of

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.630 
warm and then when it gets to the end of
the<00:04:18.730> threads<00:04:19.709> you're<00:04:20.709> going<00:04:20.920> to<00:04:21.010> want<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.280> tip

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
the threads you're going to want to tip

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.030 
the threads you're going to want to tip
it<00:04:21.820> down<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:26.020> oil<00:04:26.230> remaining<00:04:26.830> in<00:04:26.950> the

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
it down so that the oil remaining in the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.700 
it down so that the oil remaining in the
filter<00:04:27.430> doesn't<00:04:28.180> pour<00:04:28.540> out<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.050> then<00:04:29.350> once

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
filter doesn't pour out and then once

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.960 
filter doesn't pour out and then once
you've<00:04:29.830> got<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:29.950> over<00:04:30.160> your<00:04:30.280> bucket<00:04:30.550> obviously

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
you've got it over your bucket obviously

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.510 
you've got it over your bucket obviously
dump<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.080> out<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.880> at<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.750> stage<00:04:35.280> we<00:04:36.280> have

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
dump it out so at this stage we have

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.440 
dump it out so at this stage we have
drained<00:04:37.419> all<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:39.010> old<00:04:39.160> oil<00:04:40.200> so<00:04:42.270> while<00:04:43.270> you've

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
drained all the old oil so while you've

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.010 
drained all the old oil so while you've
got<00:04:43.600> everything<00:04:43.840> apart<00:04:45.030> clean<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.270> threads

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
got everything apart clean the threads

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.380 
got everything apart clean the threads
on<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.380> oil<00:04:47.560> filter<00:04:47.910> take<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:48.940> look<00:04:49.150> at<00:04:49.270> the

they<00:05:29.290> spin<00:05:29.650> on<00:05:29.800> pretty<00:05:30.100> easy<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.820> when<00:05:31.120> it

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
they spin on pretty easy and when it

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.210 
they spin on pretty easy and when it
gets<00:05:31.330> down<00:05:31.479> at<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.780> end<00:05:32.520> basically<00:05:33.960> get<00:05:34.960> it

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
gets down at the end basically get it

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.270 
gets down at the end basically get it
hand<00:05:36.220> tight<00:05:36.580> plus<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.940> little<00:05:37.210> bit<00:05:38.280> that'll

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
hand tight plus a little bit that'll

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.550 
hand tight plus a little bit that'll
seal<00:05:39.520> it<00:05:39.669> up<00:05:39.729> against<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.150> block<00:05:40.360> so<00:05:41.350> we're

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
seal it up against the block so we're

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.290 
seal it up against the block so we're
basically<00:05:41.979> done<00:05:42.310> underneath<00:05:42.640> the<00:05:42.850> car<00:05:43.060> right

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
basically done underneath the car right

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.130 
basically done underneath the car right
now<00:05:43.919> double<00:05:44.919> check<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.400> oil<00:05:45.430> filters<00:05:45.940> in

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
now double check the oil filters in

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.180 
now double check the oil filters in
double-check<00:05:47.140> that<00:05:47.169> your<00:05:47.320> oil<00:05:47.440> plug<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:48.010> back

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
double-check that your oil plug is back

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.610 
double-check that your oil plug is back
in<00:05:48.430> make<00:05:48.669> sure<00:05:48.820> you've<00:05:48.940> cleaned<00:05:49.210> up<00:05:49.330> any

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
in make sure you've cleaned up any

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.560 
in make sure you've cleaned up any
spilled<00:05:50.620> oil<00:05:50.919> and<00:05:51.190> next<00:05:52.180> we're<00:05:52.270> going<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.419> go

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
spilled oil and next we're going to go

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.370 
spilled oil and next we're going to go
up<00:05:52.720> top<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.229> we're<00:05:53.380> going<00:05:53.500> to<00:05:53.530> refill<00:05:53.919> it<00:05:55.380> so

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
up top and we're going to refill it so

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.800 
up top and we're going to refill it so
now<00:05:56.890> we're<00:05:57.130> done<00:05:57.190> underneath<00:05:57.640> we've<00:05:58.510> got<00:05:58.720> to

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
now we're done underneath we've got to

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.640 
now we're done underneath we've got to
put<00:05:58.930> new<00:05:59.080> oil<00:05:59.110> in<00:05:59.530> it<00:05:59.650> so<00:05:59.770> the<00:06:00.840> 95<00:06:01.840> VTEC<00:06:02.620> engine

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
put new oil in it so the 95 VTEC engine

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.020 
put new oil in it so the 95 VTEC engine
takes<00:06:03.340> four<00:06:04.120> and<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.270> half<00:06:04.330> quarts<00:06:04.750> of<00:06:04.810> oil

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
takes four and a half quarts of oil

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.190 
takes four and a half quarts of oil
either<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.270> 5w<00:06:07.960> 5w<00:06:08.830> 30<00:06:09.039> or<00:06:09.220> 10w30<00:06:10.110> are<00:06:11.110> the

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
either a 5w 5w 30 or 10w30 are the

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.890 
either a 5w 5w 30 or 10w30 are the
recommendations<00:06:12.010> so<00:06:12.610> put<00:06:13.150> a<00:06:13.180> funnel<00:06:13.419> in<00:06:13.690> the

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
recommendations so put a funnel in the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.460 
recommendations so put a funnel in the
oil<00:06:14.080> fill<00:06:14.350> at<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.560> top<00:06:14.789> and<00:06:16.140> simply<00:06:17.140> pour<00:06:17.349> the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
oil fill at the top and simply pour the

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.269 
oil fill at the top and simply pour the
oil<00:06:17.500> in

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
oil in

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.769 
oil in

it's<00:07:04.489> a<00:07:04.639> good<00:07:04.819> idea<00:07:04.969> to<00:07:05.479> at<00:07:05.779> least<00:07:06.019> check<00:07:06.199> it<00:07:06.619> if

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:06.799 
it's a good idea to at least check it if

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:08.409 
it's a good idea to at least check it if
not<00:07:06.979> replace<00:07:07.459> it<00:07:07.489> when<00:07:07.849> you<00:07:07.969> do<00:07:08.089> your<00:07:08.269> oil

not replace it when you do your oil

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.169 
not replace it when you do your oil
changes<00:07:09.159> the<00:07:10.159> other<00:07:10.309> thing<00:07:10.519> to<00:07:10.729> think<00:07:11.089> about

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:11.179 
changes the other thing to think about

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:13.899 
changes the other thing to think about
is<00:07:11.769> especially<00:07:12.769> on<00:07:12.979> some<00:07:13.129> older<00:07:13.399> cars<00:07:13.669> it

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:13.909 
is especially on some older cars it

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.789 
is especially on some older cars it
would<00:07:13.999> run<00:07:14.149> in<00:07:14.269> a<00:07:14.329> while<00:07:14.509> it's<00:07:15.169> not<00:07:15.349> a<00:07:15.379> bad<00:07:15.649> idea

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:15.799 
would run in a while it's not a bad idea

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:17.499 
would run in a while it's not a bad idea
to<00:07:15.979> put<00:07:16.099> some<00:07:16.219> fuel<00:07:16.369> injector<00:07:16.849> put<00:07:17.179> a<00:07:17.209> full
