I'm<00:00:01.290> gonna<00:00:01.439> explain<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.920> you<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.280> I<00:00:02.310> shoot<00:00:02.760> in

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
I'm gonna explain to you how I shoot in

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.059 
I'm gonna explain to you how I shoot in
shutter<00:00:03.270> priority<00:00:03.500> shutter<00:00:04.500> priority<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
shutter priority shutter priority is a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.849 
shutter priority shutter priority is a
very<00:00:05.339> easy<00:00:05.520> mode<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.060> shooting<00:00:06.750> your<00:00:07.529> camera

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
very easy mode to shooting your camera

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:08.780 
very easy mode to shooting your camera
is<00:00:07.950> going<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.340> charge<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.670> your

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
is going to be in charge of your

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.959 
is going to be in charge of your
aperture<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.650> let's<00:00:10.650> start<00:00:10.769> by<00:00:11.730> selecting

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
aperture for it let's start by selecting

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.650 
aperture for it let's start by selecting
s<00:00:12.420> or<00:00:12.960> T<00:00:13.230> V<00:00:13.549> you're<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.450> in

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
s or T V you're now going to be in

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.700 
s or T V you're now going to be in
shutter<00:00:16.020> priority

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
shutter priority

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.240 
shutter priority
that<00:00:16.830> means<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.310> shutter<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.880> your<00:00:18.600> priority

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
that means the shutter is your priority

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.349 
that means the shutter is your priority
so<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.340> I'm<00:00:20.490> shooting<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.060> shutter<00:00:21.300> priority

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
so as I'm shooting in shutter priority

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.019 
so as I'm shooting in shutter priority
it's<00:00:22.260> very<00:00:22.470> easy<00:00:22.650> I'm<00:00:22.949> gonna<00:00:23.160> select<00:00:23.460> slow

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it's very easy I'm gonna select slow

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.269 
it's very easy I'm gonna select slow
medium<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.869> fast<00:00:24.990> shutter<00:00:25.470> speeds<00:00:25.800> depending

also depending on the effect that I want

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.420 
also depending on the effect that I want
do<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.570> create<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.710> feeling<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
do I want to create that feeling of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180 
do I want to create that feeling of
movement<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> slow<00:00:36.600> shutter<00:00:37.110> speed<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.680> do

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
movement with a slow shutter speed or do

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.590 
movement with a slow shutter speed or do
I<00:00:38.219> want<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> make<00:00:38.550> sure<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.000> everything<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I want to make sure that everything is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630 
I want to make sure that everything is
crystal<00:00:40.020> clear<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> sharp<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.610> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
a fast shutter speed if I'm going to use

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.340 
a fast shutter speed if I'm going to use
a<00:00:44.430> slow<00:00:44.730> shutter<00:00:44.969> speed<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.570> instance<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.079> one

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
a slow shutter speed for instance of one

a slow shutter speed for instance of one
thirtieth<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.399> second<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:47.879> slower<00:00:48.469> I'll

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
thirtieth of a second or slower I'll

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.930 
thirtieth of a second or slower I'll
probably<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> put<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.489> camera<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
probably have to put my camera on a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
shutter speed is easy you still want to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
shutter speed is easy you still want to
compose<00:00:59.430> yourself<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.000> hold<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.270> camera

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
compose yourself and hold your camera

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
compose yourself and hold your camera
very<00:01:00.809> very<00:01:01.020> steady<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> use<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> a
