the<00:00:19.350> reason<00:00:19.710> I've<00:00:19.830> gone<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.460> felt<00:00:20.640> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the reason I've gone with this I felt it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490 
the reason I've gone with this I felt it
was<00:00:20.820> more<00:00:20.939> secure<00:00:21.330> since<00:00:22.109> we're<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> be

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
was more secure since we're going to be

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.620 
was more secure since we're going to be
dealing<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.800> zombies<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.490> video<00:00:23.789> I've

dealing with zombies in this video I've

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.839 
dealing with zombies in this video I've
seen<00:00:24.689> far<00:00:25.080> today<00:00:25.260> Romero<00:00:25.980> movies<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.580> didn't

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
seen far today Romero movies and didn't

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.730 
seen far today Romero movies and didn't
want<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> take<00:00:27.210> any<00:00:27.390> chances<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.080> they're

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
want to take any chances so they're

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
want to take any chances so they're
below<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.040> keep<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.250> room<00:00:32.579> freely<00:00:32.940> well

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
mob spawning inside of the kill zone

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.959 
mob spawning inside of the kill zone
over<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.739> channel<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.730> two

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
over here we have a channel which is two

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.040 
over here we have a channel which is two
blocks<00:00:42.120> height<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.730> feel<00:00:44.730> alone<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
blocks height and feel alone and this is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.360 
blocks height and feel alone and this is
the<00:00:46.170> area<00:00:46.320> where<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> zombies<00:00:46.980> will<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.219> but

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
the area where the zombies will be but

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.990 
the area where the zombies will be but
I'm<00:00:47.430> shooting<00:00:47.700> them<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.350> put<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.039> two<00:00:50.850> block

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
I'm shooting them now I put a two block

I'm shooting them now I put a two block
Wade<00:00:51.390> wall<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.789> reason<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
Wade wall here and the reason for that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.700 
Wade wall here and the reason for that
is<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.510> means<00:00:54.629> i<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> raid<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is it means i can get a raid up in the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
is it means i can get a raid up in the
zombies<00:00:56.039> faces<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.940> can't<00:00:57.149> meet

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
zombies faces and you just can't meet

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
zombies faces and you just can't meet
you<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:57.570> all<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:58.379> long<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:58.890> two<00:00:59.280> blocks

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you at all as long as that's two blocks

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.219 
you at all as long as that's two blocks
high<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.180> you're<00:01:00.390> safe<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.969> i<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.809> put<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
high then you're safe and i have put a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.440 
high then you're safe and i have put a
glass<00:01:04.589> wall<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.060> i<00:01:06.119> could<00:01:06.210> see

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
glass wall here it's just so i could see

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
glass wall here it's just so i could see
what's<00:01:06.659> coming<00:01:06.750> into<00:01:07.080> my<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.770> spawner

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
what's coming into my little spawner

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
what's coming into my little spawner
there<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.600> reason<00:01:09.750> i've<00:01:09.930> left<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.290> hole

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
there and the reason i've left this hole

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.640 
there and the reason i've left this hole
is<00:01:10.770> sometimes<00:01:11.700> behind<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.299> spawner<00:01:12.650> zombies

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
is sometimes behind the spawner zombies

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.820 
is sometimes behind the spawner zombies
will<00:01:13.860> appear<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> they<00:01:15.570> wouldn't<00:01:15.869> come<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
will appear and they wouldn't come to

will appear and they wouldn't come to
you<00:01:16.920> naturally<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> come<00:01:18.150> over

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
you naturally so you have to come over

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.850 
you naturally so you have to come over
here<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> I'd<00:01:18.869> rhythm<00:01:19.200> either<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.740> by

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
here and I'd rhythm either just by

standing here or sitting them and then
the<00:01:21.960> walk<00:01:22.110> towards<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.000> get

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
for zombies inside my mountain fortress

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
not to get the idea to destroy it you're

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
not to get the idea to destroy it you're
better<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.590> disable<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> couple<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
better to disable it with a couple of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
better to disable it with a couple of
lights<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.630> blow<00:01:39.780> torch<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.229> placed

lights like a blow torch is placed
around<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.670> reason<00:01:41.909> being<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.390> they're

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
around it the reason being is they're

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.819 
around it the reason being is they're
excellent<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.170> building<00:01:43.470> resource

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829

lava<00:04:23.940> dissipates<00:04:24.539> which<00:04:24.750> takes<00:04:24.990> me<00:04:25.169> well<00:04:25.350> the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
lava dissipates which takes me well the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.620 
lava dissipates which takes me well the
room<00:04:26.699> will<00:04:26.820> go<00:04:26.850> back<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.270> way<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.389> was<00:04:27.419> when

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
room will go back to the way it was when

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.340 
room will go back to the way it was when
I<00:04:27.690> first<00:04:27.840> enters<00:04:29.479> so<00:04:30.479> i<00:04:30.750> will<00:04:31.020> show<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.259> the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
I first enters so i will show you the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.710 
I first enters so i will show you the
control<00:04:31.620> there<00:04:32.000> so<00:04:33.000> these<00:04:33.120> are<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.389> two

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
control there so these are the two

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.420 
control there so these are the two
circuits<00:04:34.229> which<00:04:34.380> lead<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.710> controls<00:04:35.070> kept

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
circuits which lead to the controls kept

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.890 
circuits which lead to the controls kept
them<00:04:35.610> separate<00:04:35.940> by<00:04:36.090> having<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.360> little<00:04:36.539> channel

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
them separate by having a little channel

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.480 
them separate by having a little channel
on<00:04:36.990> between<00:04:37.139> them<00:04:37.320> need<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.070> be<00:04:38.130> careful<00:04:38.430> you

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
on between them need to be careful you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.550 
on between them need to be careful you
don't<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.699> it<00:04:38.850> crossed<00:04:39.030> wires<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:40.380> over<00:04:40.530> here

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
don't get it crossed wires so over here

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.310 
don't get it crossed wires so over here
is<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.860> light<00:04:41.009> switch<00:04:41.280> rig<00:04:41.870> which<00:04:42.870> is<00:04:42.900> just

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
series of pests ins and stone so here we

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.760

bull stone now originally the way I

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.460 
bull stone now originally the way I
designed<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:01.919> had<00:05:02.100> Pistons<00:05:02.580> up<00:05:03.389> above<00:05:03.870> which

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
designed it I had Pistons up above which

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.500 
designed it I had Pistons up above which
would<00:05:04.770> push<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.310> glowstone<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.270> negative

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
would push the glowstone in a negative

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.050 
would push the glowstone in a negative
view<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.830> thought<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.250> would<00:05:08.460> work<00:05:08.490> but

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
view and I thought this would work but

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.240 
view and I thought this would work but
it<00:05:09.229> doesn't<00:05:10.229> because<00:05:10.590> light<00:05:10.949> can<00:05:11.220> travel

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
it doesn't because light can travel

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.790 
it doesn't because light can travel

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
it on the room so I had to change it so

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.080 
it on the room so I had to change it so
the<00:05:16.080> closest<00:05:16.380> one<00:05:16.470> was<00:05:16.680> down<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:16.919> level<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.460> the

love<00:05:29.699> redstone<00:05:30.060> repeaters<00:05:30.419> if<00:05:30.770> anyone<00:05:31.770> has

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
love redstone repeaters if anyone has

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.290 
love redstone repeaters if anyone has
ever<00:05:31.979> done<00:05:32.099> anything<00:05:32.250> like<00:05:32.550> this<00:05:32.669> before<00:05:32.820> we

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
ever done anything like this before we

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.450 
ever done anything like this before we

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
the circuit had to come into here and

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.210 
the circuit had to come into here and

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.689 
redstone repeaters make the circuit much
smaller<00:05:43.349> that's<00:05:43.979> why<00:05:44.130> this<00:05:44.190> room<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:44.669> big

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
smaller that's why this room is so big

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.800 
smaller that's why this room is so big
it<00:05:45.030> used<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.419> be<00:05:45.510> much<00:05:45.659> bigger<00:05:45.870> than<00:05:45.990> it<00:05:46.169> is<00:05:46.289> now

it used to be much bigger than it is now
now<00:05:48.810> here<00:05:49.139> I've<00:05:49.440> had<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.710> be<00:05:49.800> careful<00:05:50.159> because

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
now here I've had to be careful because

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.950 
now here I've had to be careful because
I<00:05:50.430> was<00:05:50.610> sending<00:05:50.789> a<00:05:50.970> redstone<00:05:51.300> signal<00:05:51.570> upstairs

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
I was sending a redstone signal upstairs

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.140 
I was sending a redstone signal upstairs
to<00:05:52.530> disarm<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.039> room<00:05:53.220> and<00:05:53.400> when<00:05:53.970> I<00:05:54.000> was

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
to disarm the room and when I was

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.450 
to disarm the room and when I was
powering<00:05:54.389> on<00:05:54.630> it<00:05:55.169> was<00:05:55.260> occasionally<00:05:55.710> fighting

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
powering on it was occasionally fighting

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.629 
powering on it was occasionally fighting
off<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.699> piston<00:05:57.060> as<00:05:57.150> well<00:05:57.330> cuz<00:05:58.199> I'm<00:05:58.349> sure<00:05:58.680> you

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.649 

Jacqueline<00:06:02.639> probably<00:06:02.940> leave<00:06:03.090> that<00:06:03.270> block<00:06:03.479> out

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
Jacqueline probably leave that block out

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.950 
Jacqueline probably leave that block out
of<00:06:03.720> the<00:06:03.750> way<00:06:03.810> if<00:06:04.409> you<00:06:04.740> have<00:06:04.889> a<00:06:04.919> block<00:06:05.280> here<00:06:05.960> here

touching<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:11.010> piston<00:06:11.370> even<00:06:11.610> if<00:06:11.699> it's<00:06:11.820> just<00:06:11.849> a

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
touching a piston even if it's just a

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.480 
touching a piston even if it's just a
corner<00:06:12.389> this<00:06:12.659> box<00:06:12.960> enough<00:06:13.229> that<00:06:13.979> has<00:06:14.220> a

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
corner this box enough that has a

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.920 
corner this box enough that has a
redstone<00:06:14.789> signal<00:06:15.120> flowing<00:06:15.659> through<00:06:15.900> it

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
redstone signal flowing through it

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.390 
redstone signal flowing through it
they're<00:06:16.380> nice<00:06:16.530> enough<00:06:16.680> to<00:06:16.830> activate<00:06:17.159> the

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
they're nice enough to activate the

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.159 
they're nice enough to activate the
piston<00:06:17.729> so<00:06:18.330> let's<00:06:18.510> make<00:06:18.720> sure<00:06:18.750> that<00:06:18.900> this

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
piston so let's make sure that this

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.129 
piston so let's make sure that this
bridge<00:06:19.440> went<00:06:19.979> way<00:06:20.340> above<00:06:20.630> even<00:06:21.630> well<00:06:21.900> away

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
bridge went way above even well away

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.750 
bridge went way above even well away
from<00:06:22.169> the<00:06:22.380> Pistons

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
from the Pistons

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.420 
from the Pistons
so<00:06:24.760> just<00:06:25.480> replace<00:06:25.840> that<00:06:26.400> head<00:06:27.400> up<00:06:29.160> so<00:06:30.160> this<00:06:30.280> is

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
so just replace that head up so this is

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.000 
so just replace that head up so this is
my<00:06:30.640> lava<00:06:31.240> control<00:06:31.690> it's<00:06:31.900> very<00:06:32.080> simple<00:06:32.350> that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
my lava control it's very simple that

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.830 
my lava control it's very simple that
power<00:06:33.190> goes<00:06:33.430> into<00:06:33.670> the<00:06:33.730> piston<00:06:34.060> its<00:06:34.270> inducted

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
power goes into the piston its inducted

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.700 
power goes into the piston its inducted
there<00:06:35.020> and<00:06:36.600> when<00:06:37.600> the<00:06:37.630> piston<00:06:38.050> retracts<00:06:38.440> low

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
there and when the piston retracts low

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.020 
there and when the piston retracts low
average<00:06:38.860> at<00:06:39.070> least<00:06:39.100> with<00:06:39.400> the<00:06:39.460> best<00:06:39.640> extends

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
average at least with the best extends

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.630 
average at least with the best extends
the<00:06:40.360> lava<00:06:40.540> spot<00:06:40.810> so<00:06:41.410> that's<00:06:41.890> extremely<00:06:42.250> simple

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
the lava spot so that's extremely simple

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.120 
the lava spot so that's extremely simple
very<00:06:43.180> easy<00:06:43.270> to<00:06:43.480> make<00:06:43.890> nowhere<00:06:44.890> near<00:06:45.040> as

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
very easy to make nowhere near as

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.830 
very easy to make nowhere near as
complex<00:06:45.460> as<00:06:45.640> my<00:06:45.760> pumping<00:06:46.090> station<00:06:46.480> that<00:06:46.810> I

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
complex as my pumping station that I

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.840 
complex as my pumping station that I
should<00:06:47.110> in<00:06:47.890> one<00:06:48.010> of<00:06:48.040> my<00:06:48.160> previous<00:06:48.280> videos<00:06:50.850> so

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
should in one of my previous videos so

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.150 
should in one of my previous videos so
yeah<00:06:51.970> that's<00:06:52.180> my<00:06:52.390> firing<00:06:53.020> ridge<00:06:53.380> I<00:06:53.650> hope<00:06:54.040> you

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
yeah that's my firing ridge I hope you

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.300 
yeah that's my firing ridge I hope you
