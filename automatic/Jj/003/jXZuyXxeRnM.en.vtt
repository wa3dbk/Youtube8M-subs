 you the best in the items 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.609
 presented on sustainability 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.640
 look at this wonderful environment of 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.580
 landscaper luiz carlos orsíni and in 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.149
 homage to the useless fantastic and what is 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.670
 more incredible is that you can have a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.670
 logically appropriate to the dimensions 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.850
 necessary in their environments and their 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.710
 in their homes because not here 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.489
 in São Paulo in a small space of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.800
 garden 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.680
 make a lake you will be contributing 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 for the environment by reducing 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.670
 heat islands and not attacking the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.890
 treatment 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.140
 many question weapons will give both 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.699
 work to care does not 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 provided you do with the procedure 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.489
 correct nature teaches you not 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.950
 need to have big big pumps 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.080
 chemical products do nothing 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.890
 filtration the same as nature in the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.010
 taught 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.159
 here we have carp we have plants 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.770
 who come to the edge of the lake 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 environment we are close to a great 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 avenue that in são paulo how much 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.460
 pollutants we have here in the air that are 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.390
 depositing throughout the day 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.790
 in these waters these waters are 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 collected through pipe comes here 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.750
 there is the bottom of this beck pass 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.320
 by a biological physical filtration 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.110
 first we went through brushes that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.630
 so agitated in the water that part of the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.640
 bacteria and micro-organisms 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.770
 have and then they come to a 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.280
 colony of bacteria are the bacteria of the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.670
 well a good landscaper a biologist can 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.610
 help you can buy today in 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.799
 specialized landscaping stores and 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.459
 the colonies of bacteria that will filter 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.289
 the water and return it to the lake without 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.880
 environment without damage to nature and 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.460
 I'll ask here for our 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.890
 Dear that I can take a little 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.450
 for you to check the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.320
 water quality than I am 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.160
 telling you to see who incredible 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.710
 thank you very much

 see that is amazing is logical personal 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.690
 is not to drink is not a water with 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.230
 levels of potability but it is a water 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.730
 amazing for you to take in your lake 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.650
 contribute to helping the environment 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.540
 environment is getting better with 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.940
 wonderful and simple solutions like 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.370
 This now I want to take them to another one. 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.420
 environment where I found an item 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.100
 It is unbelievable that it breaks many 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.630
 paradigms so that you too 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.240
 enjoy 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.550
 we are in wonderful baby room 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.650
 project of mariana albuquerque and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.920
 Guilherme the world without breaking 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.540
 paradigms had the courage to put 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.790
 a green wall a green frame 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.810
 incredible with technology to show 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.480
 for all that is possible with technology 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.670
 you to provide this environment with a 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.220
 baby room with a green wall 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.030
 who is here doing the function of 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.130
 phytoremediation all plants make the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.950
 fito realm of action means phyto 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.800
 remedial plants cure healing through 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.410
 plants but what courage that amazing 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.560
 the idea of ​​setting up an environment that 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.140
 We heard of people coming ashore. 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.910
 plants do not put many flowers 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.690
 this is not true when you use 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.870
 Correctly 4 is alive 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.870
 developed a technology where you 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.720
 analyzes the plant and its function of 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.740
 air filtration 10 percent of this 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.250
 function occurs in the follicular part and 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.250
 another 90% in the root portion of the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.400
 technology has been developed a vessel 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.970
 itself confused with openings so that 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.700
 the oxygen between aerial arraes 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.010
 so the cycle gets all the holes 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.640
 present in this environment remind 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.070
 volatile organic compounds in this 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.690
 environment architects and bother 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.420
 the ink is known without the use of 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.860
 no cove with water base wood of 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.710
 demolition fabrics and ropes use of 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.890
 simple ideas like some 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.380
 clothesline with a bicycle pedal 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.380
 here I know I'm watching everyone can 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.810
 come here in the house color see that we do not have 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.660
 lots of copies but there are 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.240
 by air pollution which comes from 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.450
 other tissues of visitors to babies 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.600
 but in other environments that the zealous mother 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.640
 go out with that covered little bug 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.420
 new mobile phone will be that these 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.840
 taken 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.260
 so this is an amazing idea because the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.340
 plant feeds on all this brush 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.400
 those who are here 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.120
 evil bad oxygen is oxygen 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.180
 here in comes is absorbed by the system 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.910
 of the plants and through the 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.780
 substrate that has been treated by 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:33.670
 science technology this substrate 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.890
 filter this air and generous plant 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:40.670
 returns to the environment an oxygen 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.950
 clean filter free of bacteria 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.720
 studies have been done by NASA are 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.890
 there to prove 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.440
 and I congratulate the architecture of this 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.680
 environment for having had the courage to 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.920
 had the courage to give a 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.650
 wall an incredible live picture 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.420
 wonderful is the architecture and 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:08.180
 materials and the service by developing 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:12.020
 acquiring knowledge to help us 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.530
 in the constant struggle for a 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.700
 decor and ambiance but sustainable 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.640
 It's not over yet 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.640
 I would like to highlight the bar atmosphere 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.170
 stateroom of the architect maíra lopes where 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.210
 we have a wonderful artist panel 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:32.840
 henrique rodrigues who gave us 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.689
 cutouts and cheerful and colorful paper 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.149
 mainly help us in reducing 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.979
 solid as the papers are inevitable the 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:42.139
 what to do with your remains 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.279
 let's enjoy them come to the house color 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.159
 2013 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:48.949
 personally checked all of these 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:51.009
 highlights that we arc 10 brought 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:53.569
 For you guys, you will not regret it. 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.579
 Because the idea has come to an end, but I 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.439
 find any time there are no ideas 

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:59.799
 Until then 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.799
 Czech
