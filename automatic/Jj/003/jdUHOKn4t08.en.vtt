00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.580
 showed orders and fragment a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.970
 hard drive on windows 8 and windows and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.890
 2.1 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.030
 so as you can see in I am 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.420
 on windows 2.1 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.340
 so it's much simpler so this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.880
 what you need is the panel of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.190
 configuration 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.190
 so you go into a configuration 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.880
 it may be that you are 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.650
 category that you have this so you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.090
 must go in displayed by emit 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.250
 on big icons little icons 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 as you want once you are 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 in small icon 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.730
 What interests us are his tools 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.380
 you are looking for yourself 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.610
 same administration tools or so 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.800
 where you press on oh yes we went to 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.800
 top and we have all beautiful tools 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.870
 administration in the tool 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.829
 administration 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 so we have pretty good options officer 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.050
 not when icons here you will see better and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 what interests us is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 this one defragment and optimize the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:11.369
 readers you double-click to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 throw it then we can see you have 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.210
 all your hard drives that appears this 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.210
 so me there is a main hard drive 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.909
 and if a mobile player that you need 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.930
 do before defragment what I 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.470
 advise you in any case it's from the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.790
 analyze and then once they 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.409
 analyze and so you can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.700
 defragment you see it's going 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 relatively quickly so his addiction he 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.439
 to the size of your hard drive and if 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.400
 you have a hard drive or ssd 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:45.689
 then once he is he is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.829
 analyzed you can do optimized so 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.549
 we could see each time you have 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.549
 running 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.149
 and here we have the current state of the hard drive 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.329
 we can see here there is not one so there is 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.820
 the the percentage of defragment and 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.259
 exceed there are enough well the day he 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.299
 seems to me just arrived at a dozen 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.819
 passes so that I advise you if 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.520
 your computer turned to limit party 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.790
 have a drink or go for a walk in 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.489
 anyway it takes time 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.189
 and so here is so for example you 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.349
 do not have windows 8 points 1 3 where he 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.549
 too bad to go in the right 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.280
 configuration what I advise you 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.079
 so salty here in the corner makes you 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.310
 search and you put panel of 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:32.609
 configuration and so you'll have it here 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.609
 and so here
