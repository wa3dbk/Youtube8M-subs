00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
computer which supposedly was a big

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.479 
computer which supposedly was a big
no-no<00:00:58.100> because<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.850> were<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.949> compressor<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
supposed to be mounted vertically

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.240 
supposed to be mounted vertically
instead<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.780> horizontal<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.860> hadn't

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
instead of horizontal which I hadn't

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.660 
instead of horizontal which I hadn't
underneath<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.820> computer<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
underneath my computer and you need to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.719 
underneath my computer and you need to
get<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.330> lubricate<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.729> it

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
get to it so you can lubricate it and it

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.969 
get to it so you can lubricate it and it
didn't<00:01:18.360> last<00:01:18.570> very<00:01:18.720> long<00:01:18.930> probably<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.560> lasted

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
didn't last very long probably it lasted

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.609 
didn't last very long probably it lasted
about<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.520> good<00:01:20.850> 4<00:01:21.600> months<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.350> also

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
about a good 4 months but it also

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
about a good 4 months but it also
doesn't<00:01:22.890> play<00:01:23.100> very<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.430> either<00:01:23.700> but

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
doesn't play very well either but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
doesn't play very well either but
otherwise<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.439> you're<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> horn

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
otherwise if you're going to get a horn

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
otherwise if you're going to get a horn
low<00:01:26.490> low<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.970> basically<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> best<00:01:28.259> brand<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
low low is basically the best brand to

get now to start on with this Dixie horn
when<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> first<00:01:34.829> did<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.670> there's<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
when I first did is that there's a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.800 
when I first did is that there's a
bracket<00:01:36.509> right<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.090> did<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.210> made<00:01:39.479> or

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
bracket right here that I did I made or

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.130 
bracket right here that I did I made or
cut<00:01:40.229> off<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.060> what<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.090> did<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
cut off and what I did with that is that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.370 
cut off and what I did with that is that
down<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.970> there's<00:01:45.869> some<00:01:46.079> metal

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
down here there is there's some metal

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.440 
down here there is there's some metal
here<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> call<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
here or I don't what you want to call it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.340 
here or I don't what you want to call it
but<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> mount<00:01:49.619> where<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.250> put<00:01:50.579> your

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
but it's a mount where you put your

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
but it's a mount where you put your
computer<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> did<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.909> down<00:01:54.119> below

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
computer on and what I did is down below

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.999 
computer on and what I did is down below
I<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.659> drilled<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> hole<00:01:54.990> through<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.530> into

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I just drilled a hole through that into

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.819 
I just drilled a hole through that into
the<00:01:56.100> bracket<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.729> bolted<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> together<00:01:57.829> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the bracket and bolted that together and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
the bracket and bolted that together and
up<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> top<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> bowl<00:01:59.700> drilled<00:02:00.299> another

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
up on the top a bowl drilled another

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.350 
up on the top a bowl drilled another
hole<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.619> put<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.240> bolt<00:02:03.240> through

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
hole so then I can put the bolt through

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.089 
hole so then I can put the bolt through
to<00:02:04.110> secure<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> compressor<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:07.680> after<00:02:07.920> that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to secure the compressor then after that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.699 
to secure the compressor then after that
I<00:02:08.399> took<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.940> angle<00:02:09.360> iron<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.560> can

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I took this angle iron here if you can

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.920 
I took this angle iron here if you can
see<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
see it

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.190 
see it
and<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:13.099> heated<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.670> up<00:02:13.909> and<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.569> kind<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.959> bent

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
and I heated that up and I kind of bent

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.839 
and I heated that up and I kind of bent
it<00:02:15.319> out<00:02:15.439> a<00:02:15.470> little<00:02:15.709> bit<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:16.340> fit<00:02:16.760> the

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
it out a little bit so I can fit the

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.339 
it out a little bit so I can fit the
horns<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.299> there<00:02:17.420> /<00:02:17.599> better<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:21.200> already

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
horns in there / better so it already

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.380 
horns in there / better so it already
had<00:02:21.560> holes<00:02:21.799> in<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.099> so<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.400> pretty<00:02:22.579> easy<00:02:22.700> so

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
had holes in it so it was pretty easy so

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.000 
had holes in it so it was pretty easy so
I<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:25.329> mounted<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.620> horns<00:02:27.620> right<00:02:27.680> through

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
I just mounted the horns right through

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.789 
I just mounted the horns right through
the<00:02:28.099> holes<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.549> was<00:02:29.120> already<00:02:29.390> there<00:02:29.569> and

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
the holes that was already there and

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.839 
the holes that was already there and
what<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.829> did<00:02:31.040> from<00:02:31.129> there<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.489> that<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.700> just

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
what I did from there is that I just

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.330 
what I did from there is that I just
took<00:02:32.150> some<00:02:32.209> zip<00:02:32.599> zip<00:02:33.140> ties<00:02:33.349> or<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:34.010> my<00:02:34.129> dad

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
took some zip zip ties or what my dad

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.990 
took some zip zip ties or what my dad
says<00:02:34.760> or<00:02:35.299> calls<00:02:35.750> them<00:02:35.989> as<00:02:36.140> cable<00:02:36.530> ties<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:37.010> use

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
says or calls them as cable ties I use

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.330 
says or calls them as cable ties I use
those<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.510> secure<00:02:39.230> them<00:02:39.409> against<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.859> bundle

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
those to secure them against this bundle

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.920 
those to secure them against this bundle
of<00:02:40.730> wire<00:02:41.359> here<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.609> then<00:02:43.609> after<00:02:44.299> that<00:02:44.540> with

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
of wire here and then after that with

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.960 
of wire here and then after that with
all<00:02:45.079> the<00:02:45.170> wiring<00:02:48.069> well<00:02:49.069> let's<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.459> go<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.909> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
all the wiring well let's just go to the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.569 
all the wiring well let's just go to the
relay<00:02:50.299> here<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:51.319> is<00:02:51.470> where<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.680> had<00:02:52.069> my<00:02:52.099> have

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
relay here this is where I had my have

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.589 
relay here this is where I had my have
my<00:02:52.609> relay<00:02:53.030> mounted<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.940> pretty<00:02:55.940> easy<00:02:56.180> spot<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
my relay mounted so pretty easy spot to

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.699 
my relay mounted so pretty easy spot to
get<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:58.239> with<00:02:59.239> most<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.629> these<00:02:59.780> horns<00:03:00.439> or

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
get to with most of these horns or

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.899 
get to with most of these horns or
almost<00:03:01.370> all<00:03:01.579> horns<00:03:01.970> now<00:03:02.450> are<00:03:03.340> having<00:03:04.340> fuse

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
almost all horns now are having fuse

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.860 
almost all horns now are having fuse
with<00:03:05.299> them<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.750> with<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.230> fuse<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
with them and with the fuse it if the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.199 
with them and with the fuse it if the
fuse<00:03:09.139> is<00:03:09.290> blown<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.700> means<00:03:10.939> there<00:03:11.120> is

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
fuse is blown that means there is

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.809 
fuse is blown that means there is
probably<00:03:11.569> a<00:03:11.629> problem<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.200> then<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:13.549> really

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
probably a problem and then it really

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.939 
probably a problem and then it really
won't<00:03:14.450> damage<00:03:14.780> your<00:03:14.930> compressor<00:03:15.620> or<00:03:15.799> your

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
won't damage your compressor or your

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.039 
won't damage your compressor or your
horn<00:03:16.280> system<00:03:16.730> or<00:03:16.879> anything<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.660> it'll<00:03:17.870> just

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
horn system or anything so it'll just

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.650 
horn system or anything so it'll just
blow<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:18.230> fuse<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:18.859> I<00:03:19.099> got<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.030> built-in<00:03:20.359> fuse

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
blow the fuse so I got a built-in fuse

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.900 
blow the fuse so I got a built-in fuse
right<00:03:20.870> off<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.169> battery<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:24.849> connected<00:03:25.849> it

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
right off the battery and I connected it

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.909 
right off the battery and I connected it
to<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.239> wire<00:03:26.480> here<00:03:26.930> just<00:03:27.470> got<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.799> wrong

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
to this wire here just got it wrong

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.430 
to this wire here just got it wrong
along<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.430> front<00:03:28.669> here<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.199> got<00:03:30.199> it<00:03:30.319> down

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
along the front here and got it down

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.990 
along the front here and got it down
going<00:03:30.769> straight<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.099> relay<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.760> then

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
going straight to the relay and then

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.300 
going straight to the relay and then
they<00:03:32.090> got<00:03:32.299> it<00:03:32.449> breaking<00:03:32.810> off<00:03:32.959> from<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.949> spot

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
they got it breaking off from that spot

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.589 
they got it breaking off from that spot
and<00:03:34.519> going<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:34.849> to<00:03:34.970> another<00:03:35.150> spot<00:03:35.480> in<00:03:35.510> the

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
and going on to another spot in the

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.830 
and going on to another spot in the
relay<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.609> then<00:03:37.609> I<00:03:38.060> got<00:03:38.599> one<00:03:39.230> wire<00:03:39.530> from<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
relay and then I got one wire from the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.319 
relay and then I got one wire from the
compressor<00:03:42.799> going<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.519> relay<00:03:43.790> too<00:03:43.849> and

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
compressor going to the relay too and

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.170 
compressor going to the relay too and
then<00:03:44.629> here's<00:03:44.989> my<00:03:45.109> negative<00:03:45.349> wire<00:03:45.769> where<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.250> put

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
then here's my negative wire where I put

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.960 
then here's my negative wire where I put
that<00:03:47.209> from<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.840> compressor<00:03:48.440> also<00:03:48.699> and<00:03:49.699> then

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
that from the compressor also and then

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.449 
that from the compressor also and then
this<00:03:50.180> last<00:03:50.479> red<00:03:50.870> wire<00:03:51.319> from<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.620> relay<00:03:52.069> that's

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
this last red wire from the relay that's

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.649 
this last red wire from the relay that's
the<00:03:53.560> wire<00:03:54.560> for<00:03:55.340> my<00:03:55.549> button<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.269> have<00:03:56.449> in<00:03:56.569> my

whatever to this bundle of wire here and

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.819 
whatever to this bundle of wire here and
got<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.669> going<00:04:19.880> over<00:04:20.000> there<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.599> got<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.709> going

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
got it going over there I got it going

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.320 
got it going over there I got it going
through<00:04:21.979> my<00:04:22.250> fire<00:04:22.490> ball<00:04:22.789> where<00:04:23.029> I<00:04:23.060> have<00:04:23.210> my

steering column

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.159 
steering column
then<00:04:25.050> we<00:04:25.139> can<00:04:25.289> go<00:04:25.530> inside<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.919> truck<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:27.169> see

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
then we can go inside the truck and see

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.770 
then we can go inside the truck and see
where<00:04:28.379> I<00:04:28.409> have<00:04:28.470> my<00:04:28.650> button<00:04:32.150> here's<00:04:33.150> my<00:04:33.270> button
