more<00:01:57.780> battery<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.409> juice<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.130> always

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
more battery more juice you can always

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.969 
more battery more juice you can always
do<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.259> pretty<00:02:01.439> much<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.950> for

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
do that and that's pretty much it for

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.639 
do that and that's pretty much it for
hardware<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.689> record<00:02:03.990> up<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> 1080p

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
hardware it can record up to 1080p

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.369 
hardware it can record up to 1080p
resolution<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.190> Full<00:02:08.550> HD<00:02:08.629> at<00:02:09.629> 30<00:02:10.020> frames<00:02:10.289> per

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
resolution so Full HD at 30 frames per

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.320 
resolution so Full HD at 30 frames per

60<00:02:13.440> frames<00:02:13.680> per<00:02:13.800> second<00:02:14.310> let's<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.420> app

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
60 frames per second let's go to the app

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.410 
60 frames per second let's go to the app
so<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:17.010> we're<00:02:17.310> using<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
so what you have to do we're using the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.180 
so what you have to do we're using the
iPad<00:02:18.450> right<00:02:18.989> now<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> know<00:02:19.349> it's<00:02:19.830> an<00:02:19.950> Android

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
iPad right now I know it's an Android

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
iPad right now I know it's an Android
side<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.930> for<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.440> know

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
side but this is just for you know

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.830 
side but this is just for you know
better<00:02:22.830> viewing<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.459> stuff<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.360> if<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.630> turn

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
better viewing and stuff so if you turn

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.559 
better viewing and stuff so if you turn
it<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.880> little<00:02:27.180> blue<00:02:27.330> thing

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
it on you see the little blue thing

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.940 
it on you see the little blue thing
flashing<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.550> means<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.950> pretty

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
flashing and that means that it's pretty

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.130 
flashing and that means that it's pretty
much<00:02:32.040> searching<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.780> works<00:02:33.989> through

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
much searching and it works through

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.100 
much searching and it works through
Wi-Fi<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.069> searching<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.120> Wi-Fi<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
Wi-Fi so it's searching the Wi-Fi and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.870 
Wi-Fi so it's searching the Wi-Fi and
it's<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.830> there<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.370> connect

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
it's right there and you just connect

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.690 
it's right there and you just connect
and<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.019> what's<00:02:40.650> cool<00:02:40.890> about<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.459> it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and so what's cool about this is that it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.880 
and so what's cool about this is that it
actually<00:02:41.790> keeps<00:02:42.390> data<00:02:42.780> working<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
actually keeps data working on the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.860 
actually keeps data working on the
Android<00:02:44.220> at<00:02:44.340> least<00:02:44.580> an<00:02:44.730> iOS<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.299> wasn't<00:02:45.569> able<00:02:45.660> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
Android at least an iOS I wasn't able to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.729 
Android at least an iOS I wasn't able to
do<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.110> or<00:02:46.620> listen<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.069> iPad<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.600> know<00:02:48.780> so

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.080 

all<00:03:00.780> right<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> go<00:03:01.440> finally<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.580> in<00:03:02.880> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
all right there you go finally so in the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.880 
all right there you go finally so in the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
record it you can buffer since it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
record it you can buffer since it
connects<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.239> Wi-Fi<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.989> allows<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.530> data

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
connects to Wi-Fi and it allows the data

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.500 
connects to Wi-Fi and it allows the data
connection<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.459> keep<00:03:11.760> working<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.360> can

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
connection to keep working you can
