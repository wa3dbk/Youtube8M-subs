00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.050 

let's<00:00:02.040> look<00:00:02.190> an<00:00:02.340> example<00:00:02.790> where<00:00:02.939> we're

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
let's look an example where we're

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.349 
let's look an example where we're
converting<00:00:03.360> from<00:00:03.629> kilograms<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.470> milligrams

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
converting from kilograms to milligrams

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.810 
converting from kilograms to milligrams
the<00:00:06.359> mass<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.750> an<00:00:06.839> object<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.580> 0.24<00:00:08.580> to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the mass of an object is 0.24 to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.360 
the mass of an object is 0.24 to
kilograms<00:00:09.450> what<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> mass<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.889> units<00:00:11.219> of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
kilograms what is the mass in units of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030 
kilograms what is the mass in units of
milligram<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.870> what<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.170> need<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.530> first<00:00:13.799> is

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
milligram so what we need to do first is

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.550 
milligram so what we need to do first is
figure<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.490> what<00:00:15.360> units<00:00:15.870> were<00:00:16.020> starting<00:00:16.410> with

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
figure out what units were starting with

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.980 
figure out what units were starting with
so<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.730> can<00:00:17.910> figure<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.210> where<00:00:18.720> we're

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
so that we can figure out where we're

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
so that we can figure out where we're
going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> actually<00:00:19.320> start<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.039> problem<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
going to actually start this problem and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.000 
going to actually start this problem and
we<00:00:21.510> give<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.990> only<00:00:22.230> number<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:22.619> given<00:00:22.920> in

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
we give the only number that's given in

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.439 
we give the only number that's given in
the<00:00:23.039> problem<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.490> kilograms<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.330> know

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the problem is kilograms so we know

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.730 
the problem is kilograms so we know
we're<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> start<00:00:24.990> there<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.590> have

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
we're going to start there so we have

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.519 
we're going to start there so we have
kilograms<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.849> our<00:00:27.539> starting<00:00:28.109> unit<00:00:30.500> when<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
kilograms is our starting unit when I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.749 
kilograms is our starting unit when I
look<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> question<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.399> asking<00:00:32.489> me<00:00:32.700> what

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
look at the question it's asking me what

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
look at the question it's asking me what
is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> mass<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.270> units<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.750> milligrams<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
is the mass in units of milligrams so

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
is the mass in units of milligrams so
and<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> end<00:00:35.329> with<00:00:36.350> milligrams<00:00:38.210> now

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and I'm going to end with milligrams now

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.520 
and I'm going to end with milligrams now
I<00:00:39.239> need<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> look<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.899> any<00:00:40.020> conversion

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
I need to look for any conversion

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.990 
I need to look for any conversion
factors<00:00:40.890> or<00:00:41.010> relationships<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:41.910> going

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
factors or relationships that are going

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.430 
factors or relationships that are going
to<00:00:42.059> help<00:00:42.270> me<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.780> kilograms<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to help me get from kilograms to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.220 
to help me get from kilograms to
milligrams<00:00:44.180> now<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> may<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.660> offhand

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
milligrams now you may not know offhand

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
milligrams now you may not know offhand
the<00:00:46.860> direct<00:00:47.280> conversion<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.940> kilograms<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the direct conversion from kilograms to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.660 
the direct conversion from kilograms to
milligrams<00:00:48.870> however<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> couple<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
milligrams however there are a couple of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.819 
milligrams however there are a couple of
things<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> one

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
things we do know we know that one

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
things we do know we know that one
kilogram<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:55.730> equal<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.420> thousand<00:00:58.410> grams

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
kilogram is equal to one thousand grams

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.110 
kilogram is equal to one thousand grams
and<00:00:59.520> one<00:01:00.420> gram<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.350> equal<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.250> thousand

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and one gram is equal to one thousand

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.660 
and one gram is equal to one thousand
milligrams<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.949> still<00:01:05.159> solve<00:01:05.400> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
milligrams so we can still solve this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
milligrams so we can still solve this
problem<00:01:06.000> it'll<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.360> take<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.780> extra<00:01:07.140> step

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
problem it'll just take as an extra step

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
problem it'll just take as an extra step
so<00:01:07.650> we'll<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.460> back<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> problem<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.299> pull

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
so we'll go back to the problem and pull

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.030 
so we'll go back to the problem and pull
my<00:01:09.600> number<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.140> starting<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.590> zero

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
my number that I'm starting with zero

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
my number that I'm starting with zero
point<00:01:11.369> two<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:12.000> two<00:01:12.650> kilograms<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.180> know<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
point two for two kilograms I know that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
point two for two kilograms I know that
no<00:01:15.750> matter<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.200> units<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> kilograms<00:01:17.310> are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
no matter what my units of kilograms are

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.350 
no matter what my units of kilograms are
going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> need<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> bottom

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
going to need to be on the bottom

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.789 
going to need to be on the bottom
because<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.810> need<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> cancel<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.680> with

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
because I need them to cancel out with

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.340 
because I need them to cancel out with
the<00:01:19.920> kilograms<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> top<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.570> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the kilograms I have on the top here so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.760 
the kilograms I have on the top here so
I<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.860> kilogram<00:01:23.369> equals<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:25.020> thousand

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
I have one kilogram equals a thousand

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.749 
I have one kilogram equals a thousand
grams<00:01:26.900> now<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.619> units<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> kilograms<00:01:29.579> cancel

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
grams now my units of kilograms cancel

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
grams now my units of kilograms cancel
with<00:01:30.180> kilograms<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.470> still<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.890> my

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
with kilograms but I still have my

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
with kilograms but I still have my
number<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.400> grams<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.450> need<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:33.990> more

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
number in grams so I need to do one more

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.130 
number in grams so I need to do one more
step<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.130> grams<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.850> milligrams<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
step to get from grams to milligrams I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.109 
step to get from grams to milligrams I
know<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.950> grams<00:01:38.220> has<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> bottom

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
know that grams has to be on the bottom

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.969 
know that grams has to be on the bottom
of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> next<00:01:39.600> step<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.500> top<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
of the next step because it's on top and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.520 
of the next step because it's on top and
the<00:01:41.100> step<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.939> second<00:01:42.360> step<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.320> have

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the step in the second step so I have

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.690 
the step in the second step so I have
one<00:01:43.799> gram<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:46.159> thousand<00:01:47.570> milligrams<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
one gram is a thousand milligrams and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.480 
one gram is a thousand milligrams and
again<00:01:50.700> grams<00:01:51.270> cancels<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:51.960> grams<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.220> look

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
again grams cancels with grams if I look

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.280 
again grams cancels with grams if I look
at<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.090> units<00:01:54.420> notice<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.020> worrying

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
at just my units notice I'm not worrying

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.899 
at just my units notice I'm not worrying
about<00:01:55.350> numbers<00:01:55.860> yet<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.130> looking<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.700> my

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
about numbers yet I'm looking at just my

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.749 
about numbers yet I'm looking at just my
units<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.110> kilograms<00:01:58.829> cancels<00:01:59.700> with

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
units I see that kilograms cancels with

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.420 
units I see that kilograms cancels with
kilograms<00:02:00.420> grams<00:02:00.680> cancels<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.770> grams<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
kilograms grams cancels with grams and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.310 
kilograms grams cancels with grams and
the<00:02:02.759> unit's<00:02:03.060> I'm<00:02:03.210> left<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.689> at<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.020> point

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the unit's I'm left with at this point

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
the unit's I'm left with at this point
are<00:02:04.820> milligrams<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> problem

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
are milligrams which is what the problem

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
are milligrams which is what the problem
is<00:02:06.990> asking<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> know<00:02:08.489> I've<00:02:08.700> set<00:02:08.910> up
