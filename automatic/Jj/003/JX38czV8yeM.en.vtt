win four has to run second the next

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.119 
win four has to run second the next
progression<00:00:32.449> from<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:33.199> is<00:00:33.470> to<00:00:33.830> do<00:00:33.920> what's

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
progression from that is to do what's

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.400 
progression from that is to do what's
called<00:00:34.309> boxing<00:00:34.910> them<00:00:35.120> where<00:00:35.750> you<00:00:35.900> go<00:00:36.080> up<00:00:36.260> and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
called boxing them where you go up and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.310 
called boxing them where you go up and
you<00:00:36.589> get<00:00:36.710> ten<00:00:36.949> four<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.549> you<00:00:37.879> get<00:00:38.030> four<00:00:38.269> ten<00:00:38.510> so

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
you get ten four and you get four ten so

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.170 
you get ten four and you get four ten so
now<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:39.500> have<00:00:39.650> wiggle<00:00:39.860> room<00:00:39.979> but<00:00:40.610> still<00:00:40.909> you

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
now you have wiggle room but still you

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.350 
now you have wiggle room but still you
have<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.600> get<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:42.500> exact<00:00:42.920> two<00:00:43.190> horses<00:00:43.729> that

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
have to get the exact two horses that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.329 
have to get the exact two horses that
are<00:00:44.479> going<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.629> run<00:00:44.780> first<00:00:45.049> second<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:45.710> right

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
are going to run first second so right

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.399 
are going to run first second so right
now<00:00:46.519> your<00:00:46.790> ten<00:00:47.059> is<00:00:47.239> 14<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.839> one<00:00:47.960> on<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.170> board

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
now your ten is 14 to one on the board

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.160 
now your ten is 14 to one on the board
if<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:49.220> ten<00:00:49.460> wins<00:00:49.729> the<00:00:49.970> race<00:00:50.119> and<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:50.960> four

right let's make you be less right and
get<00:01:22.280> paid<00:01:22.460> more<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:22.730> it<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.900> 10<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.200> 4<00:01:24.440> are

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
get paid more for it so the 10 and 4 are

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.040 
get paid more for it so the 10 and 4 are
your<00:01:24.920> top<00:01:25.130> two<00:01:25.340> picks<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.330> let's<00:01:26.510> put<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.780> 10

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
your top two picks so let's put the 10

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.820 
your top two picks so let's put the 10
and<00:01:27.350> 4<00:01:27.740> in<00:01:28.100> first<00:01:28.490> place<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.110> then<00:01:30.110> we'll<00:01:30.290> draw

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
and 4 in first place and then we'll draw

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.920 
and 4 in first place and then we'll draw
a<00:01:30.860> slash<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.760> that's<00:01:32.300> called<00:01:32.630> that's<00:01:32.780> a

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
a slash and that's called that's a

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.930 
a slash and that's called that's a
terrible<00:01:33.260> arrow<00:01:33.500> but<00:01:34.130> that's<00:01:34.340> called<00:01:34.640> width

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
terrible arrow but that's called width

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.970 
terrible arrow but that's called width
and<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.870> think<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.200> 10<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.500> 4<00:01:36.710> are<00:01:36.830> good

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
and if you think the 10 and 4 are good

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.280 
and if you think the 10 and 4 are good
enough<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.340> win<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:38.390> think<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.750> 10<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.050> 4<00:01:39.230> are

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
enough to win you think the 10 and 4 are

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.470 
enough to win you think the 10 and 4 are
good<00:01:39.409> enough<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.710> run<00:01:39.830> second<00:01:40.340> right<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:41.300> let's

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
good enough to run second right so let's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.200 
good enough to run second right so let's
put<00:01:41.690> them<00:01:41.840> down<00:01:42.110> here<00:01:42.380> too<00:01:42.620> I<00:01:43.030> think<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.090> had

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
put them down here too I think you had

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.590 
put them down here too I think you had

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
seven and one so if we put those there

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.920 
seven and one so if we put those there
this<00:01:50.060> bat<00:01:50.420> costs<00:01:51.050> six<00:01:51.860> dollars<00:01:52.340> total

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
this bat costs six dollars total

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.510 
this bat costs six dollars total

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
basically what you do is you buy six

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.790 
basically what you do is you buy six
different<00:01:55.729> combinations<00:01:56.630> where<00:01:57.350> either<00:01:57.560> of

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
different combinations where either of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.520 
different combinations where either of
these<00:01:57.920> horses<00:01:58.220> has<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.790> win<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.270> then<00:02:00.080> any<00:02:00.290> of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
these can run second so as long as your

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.590 
these can run second so as long as your
strongest<00:02:03.890> opinion<00:02:04.430> as<00:02:04.610> long<00:02:04.670> as<00:02:05.030> one<00:02:05.299> of<00:02:05.330> your

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
all of this wiggle room here this is a

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.949 
all of this wiggle room here this is a

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.910 
have 33% of the rest of the field left
to<00:02:16.910> run<00:02:17.060> second

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
to run second

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.720 
to run second
if<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.520> get<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.819> 10<00:02:19.090> over<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.200> 1<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:21.430> what

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
if you get the 10 over the 1 there what

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.090 
if you get the 10 over the 1 there what
13<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.450> 1<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.720> 16<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.230> 1<00:02:23.350> right<00:02:23.530> now<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.860> 1

dollar<00:02:24.310> ticket<00:02:24.700> would<00:02:24.790> probably<00:02:25.060> pay<00:02:25.230> $250

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.400 
dollar ticket would probably pay $250
unlikely<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.090> happen<00:02:28.270> in<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.690> order<00:02:28.750> maybe

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
unlikely to happen in that order maybe

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.800 
unlikely to happen in that order maybe
which<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.069> why<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> would<00:02:30.400> pay<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.610> much<00:02:30.970> but

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
which is why I would pay so much but

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.080 
which is why I would pay so much but
it's<00:02:31.930> ok<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> 10<00:02:32.740> comes<00:02:33.010> home<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.550> then

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
it's ok if the 10 comes home and then

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.910 
it's ok if the 10 comes home and then
the<00:02:34.209> 4<00:02:34.450> runs<00:02:34.660> second<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.290> he's<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.410> bit<00:02:35.650> more<00:02:35.800> of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the 4 runs second and he's a bit more of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.970 
the 4 runs second and he's a bit more of
a<00:02:35.980> favorite<00:02:36.459> thing<00:02:37.030> will<00:02:37.150> still<00:02:37.330> pay<00:02:37.570> $40<00:02:38.290> $50

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
a favorite thing will still pay $40 $50

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.340 
a favorite thing will still pay $40 $50
$60<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.240> make<00:02:40.390> good<00:02:40.600> money<00:02:40.810> doing<00:02:41.050> this

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
$60 you can make good money doing this

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.590 
$60 you can make good money doing this
and<00:02:41.650> you're<00:02:42.070> basically<00:02:42.340> investing<00:02:42.970> your<00:02:43.030> $6

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
and you're basically investing your $6

in<00:02:43.750> such<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.020> way<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:45.160> don't<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.610> be

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
in such a way that you don't have to be

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.090 
in such a way that you don't have to be
exactly<00:02:46.239> right<00:02:46.380> whereas<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:47.500> let's<00:02:47.830> look<00:02:47.950> at

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
exactly right whereas like let's look at

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.240 
exactly right whereas like let's look at
your<00:02:48.220> superfecta<00:02:48.730> ticket<00:02:49.739> right<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.040> have

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
your superfecta ticket right so you have

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
your superfecta ticket right so you have
to<00:02:51.340> be<00:02:51.459> exactly<00:02:52.090> right<00:02:52.480> or<00:02:53.640> basically<00:02:54.640> yeah<00:02:55.030> so

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
to be exactly right or basically yeah so

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.640 
to be exactly right or basically yeah so
you<00:02:55.330> know<00:02:55.570> what<00:02:55.750> if<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.959> comes<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.410> 10<00:02:57.340> 7<00:02:57.820> 4<00:02:58.090> 1

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
you know what if it comes in 10 7 4 1

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.630 
you know what if it comes in 10 7 4 1
you're<00:02:59.650> going<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.800> have<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> sad<00:03:00.160> face<00:03:00.400> on

you're going to have a sad face on

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.190 
you're going to have a sad face on
because<00:03:01.000> that's<00:03:01.180> going<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.540> thousands<00:03:02.140> of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
because that's going to be thousands of

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.910 
because that's going to be thousands of
dollars<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:03.010> missed<00:03:03.190> out<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:04.590> there<00:03:05.590> was<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.739> 10

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
dollars you missed out on there was a 10

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.710 
dollars you missed out on there was a 10
cent<00:03:06.220> bet<00:03:06.400> yes<00:03:06.670> that's<00:03:06.940> that's<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.600> other

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
cent bet yes that's that's the other

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.460 
cent bet yes that's that's the other
plus<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:09.690> those<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.840> can<00:03:10.959> definitely<00:03:11.110> build

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
plus is those you can definitely build

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.800 
plus is those you can definitely build
for<00:03:11.769> cheaper<00:03:12.160> but<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.000> know<00:03:13.090> obviously<00:03:13.360> then

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
for cheaper but you know obviously then

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.509 
for cheaper but you know obviously then
when<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:13.989> start<00:03:14.230> getting<00:03:14.320> into<00:03:14.560> 4<00:03:14.860> spots<00:03:15.280> it's

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
when you start getting into 4 spots it's

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.460 
when you start getting into 4 spots it's
much<00:03:15.700> tougher<00:03:15.970> than<00:03:16.269> 3<00:03:16.630> spots<00:03:16.989> which<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.320> much

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
much tougher than 3 spots which is much

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.540 
much tougher than 3 spots which is much
tougher<00:03:17.709> than<00:03:17.860> 2<00:03:18.160> spots<00:03:18.600> but

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.430 

well<00:03:24.550> basically<00:03:25.450> what<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.140> it's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
well basically what this it's

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.120 
well basically what this it's
technically<00:03:26.920> called<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.370> part<00:03:27.730> wheel<00:03:29.099> like<00:03:30.099> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
technically called a part wheel like a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.089 
technically called a part wheel like a
partial<00:03:30.670> wheel<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.170> it's<00:03:32.170> just<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.470> fancy<00:03:32.920> way

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
partial wheel and it's just a fancy way

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.100 
partial wheel and it's just a fancy way
of<00:03:33.130> combining<00:03:33.760> six<00:03:34.209> beds<00:03:34.480> because<00:03:34.870> basically

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
of combining six beds because basically

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.660 
of combining six beds because basically
all<00:03:35.410> you've<00:03:35.739> done<00:03:35.950> here<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.220> you've<00:03:36.430> bought<00:03:36.640> a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
all you've done here is you've bought a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.580

just an easier way and you can't go up

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.870 
just an easier way and you can't go up
to<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> window<00:03:53.739> basically<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.459> punch<00:03:54.670> one

dollar<00:03:55.120> exact<00:03:55.510> as<00:03:55.690> individually<00:03:56.380> because

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
dollar exact as individually because

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.610 
dollar exact as individually because
they<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.010> total<00:03:57.340> two<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.260> this<00:03:59.410> way

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
they have to total two so this way

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.130
