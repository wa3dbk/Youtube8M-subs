00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
of the fabricators and I thought it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.040 
of the fabricators and I thought it
would<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.190> very<00:01:59.820> interesting<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.720> as<00:02:00.870> many

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
would be very interesting to get as many

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.630 
would be very interesting to get as many

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.430 
people together who worked on the very
first<00:02:03.000> ones<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.660> do<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> recreation<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:06.440> so

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
first ones and do a recreation and so

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.469 
first ones and do a recreation and so
that's<00:02:07.650> what<00:02:07.830> we're<00:02:07.980> doing<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:08.820> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that's what we're doing right here and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.200 
that's what we're doing right here and
then<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.590> little<00:02:10.770> bit<00:02:10.920> later<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.460> I<00:02:11.640> found<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
then a little bit later on I found a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.260 
then a little bit later on I found a
gentleman<00:02:12.450> doing<00:02:13.320> Carling<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.070> had<00:02:14.280> some<00:02:15.150> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
gentleman doing Carling that had some of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.050 
gentleman doing Carling that had some of
the<00:02:15.420> original<00:02:15.930> independent<00:02:16.230> rear<00:02:16.620> suspension

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
the original independent rear suspension

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.650 
the original independent rear suspension
parts<00:02:18.060> from<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.380> GT<00:02:20.310> 350<00:02:20.910> prototype

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
parts from the GT 350 prototype

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.510 
parts from the GT 350 prototype
independent<00:02:22.380> rear<00:02:22.500> suspension<00:02:22.530> car<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.400> was

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
independent rear suspension car that was

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.020 
independent rear suspension car that was
being<00:02:23.700> developed<00:02:24.290> at<00:02:25.290> Shelby's<00:02:25.800> which<00:02:26.580> took

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
being developed at Shelby's which took

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.800 
being developed at Shelby's which took
place<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:29.510> at<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.690> airport<00:02:31.080> Susilo

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
place in the at the airport Susilo

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.470 
place in the at the airport Susilo
program<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.959> course<00:02:34.230> was<00:02:34.410> later<00:02:34.650> killed<00:02:34.920> but

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
program of course was later killed but

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.570 
program of course was later killed but
anyhow<00:02:36.480> he<00:02:36.810> scared<00:02:37.770> up<00:02:37.920> some<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.280> parts

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
anyhow he scared up some of the parts

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.340 
anyhow he scared up some of the parts
and<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.060> decided<00:02:39.420> because<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.170> really

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
and so we decided because it's a really

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.250 
and so we decided because it's a really
unique<00:02:40.620> situation<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.820> unique<00:02:42.260> suspension

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
unique situation and a unique suspension

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.009 
unique situation and a unique suspension
on<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.160> 1965<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.360> we're<00:02:45.540> installing<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
on the 1965 that we're installing the

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.170 
on the 1965 that we're installing the
some<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.320> few<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.310> original<00:02:50.550> parts

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
some of the few of the original parts

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000 
some of the few of the original parts
and<00:02:51.420> some<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.380> other<00:02:52.530> parts<00:02:52.920> are

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and some of the other parts are

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.910 
and some of the other parts are
fabricated<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.880> he<00:02:54.150> was<00:02:54.300> able<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.890> talk<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
fabricated and he was able to talk to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
fabricated and he was able to talk to
the<00:02:56.370> original<00:02:56.910> engineered<00:02:57.420> clause<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.930> Ernie

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
the original engineered clause on Ernie

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
the original engineered clause on Ernie
who<00:02:58.830> got<00:02:59.040> him<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.310> original<00:02:59.580> prints<00:03:00.269> from<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
who got him the original prints from the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.990 
who got him the original prints from the
Ford<00:03:00.959> archives<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.160> everything<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.730> built

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
Ford archives and so everything is built

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.300 
Ford archives and so everything is built
to<00:03:03.150> print<00:03:03.390> with<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.410> circuit<00:03:04.830> if<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:04.980> look<00:03:05.160> at

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
to print with a circuit if you look at

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.110 
to print with a circuit if you look at
the<00:03:05.750> legend<00:03:06.750> block<00:03:06.959> there<00:03:07.260> it'll<00:03:07.650> say<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.670> think

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the legend block there it'll say I think

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.870 
the legend block there it'll say I think
it's<00:03:09.360> late<00:03:09.570> 63<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.530> sometime<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.040> 64<00:03:11.610> that

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it's late 63 and sometime in 64 that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.850 
it's late 63 and sometime in 64 that
this<00:03:12.060> was<00:03:12.239> designed<00:03:12.450> up<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.080> that's<00:03:13.590> what's

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
this was designed up so that's what's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.190 
this was designed up so that's what's
gonna<00:03:14.040> go<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.430> car<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.630> ultimate

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
gonna go in the car and the ultimate

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.070 
gonna go in the car and the ultimate
then<00:03:16.700> at<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> end<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.450> we're<00:03:18.570> gonna<00:03:18.690> have

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
then at the end is that we're gonna have

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.990 
then at the end is that we're gonna have
the<00:03:19.260> car<00:03:19.769> at<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.430> February<00:03:20.940> 14th<00:03:22.280> 2015<00:03:23.280> which

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the car at in February 14th 2015 which

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.090 
the car at in February 14th 2015 which
is<00:03:24.209> exactly<00:03:24.630> 50<00:03:25.080> years<00:03:25.260> from<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> day<00:03:25.769> that

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
is exactly 50 years from the day that

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.100 
is exactly 50 years from the day that

Ken miles driving

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.050 
Ken miles driving
it's<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.200> program<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.800> really<00:03:35.520> appreciate

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
it's the program I really appreciate

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.180 
it's the program I really appreciate
being<00:03:36.360> lucky<00:03:36.780> enough<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.230> hear<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.680> history

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
being lucky enough to hear the history

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.880 
being lucky enough to hear the history
and<00:03:38.420> experiences<00:03:39.420> these<00:03:39.630> guys<00:03:39.960> had<00:03:40.350> back<00:03:40.710> in

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
and experiences these guys had back in

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.770 
and experiences these guys had back in
what<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.070> consider<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.880> Golden<00:03:42.390> Age<00:03:42.510> of

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
what I consider the Golden Age of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.530 
what I consider the Golden Age of
American<00:03:42.930> road<00:03:43.500> racing<00:03:43.950> Peter<00:03:44.880> said<00:03:45.180> look<00:03:45.330> you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
American road racing Peter said look you

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.320 
American road racing Peter said look you
know<00:03:45.660> when<00:03:46.050> we<00:03:46.260> did<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.790> when<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.820> car<00:03:48.150> came

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
know when we did the when that car came

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.210 
know when we did the when that car came
out<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.720> was<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.020> Europe<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.680> came<00:03:49.860> up<00:03:50.010> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
out I was in Europe and it came up and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.680 
out I was in Europe and it came up and
the<00:03:50.340> window<00:03:50.580> came<00:03:50.790> up<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.210> hint<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.450> little

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
the window came up and a hint of little

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.230 
the window came up and a hint of little
break<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.110> that's<00:03:52.830> not<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.220> way<00:03:53.340> he<00:03:53.820> wants<00:03:54.150> to

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
break and that's not the way he wants to

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.780 
break and that's not the way he wants to
evacuate<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.900> cabin<00:03:55.350> air<00:03:55.500> out<00:03:55.710> of<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.920> cabin

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
evacuate the cabin air out of the cabin

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.870 
evacuate the cabin air out of the cabin
air<00:03:56.940> oh<00:03:56.970> right<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:57.960> I<00:03:57.990> could<00:03:58.230> usually<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.070> not

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
air oh right so I could usually and not

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.420 
air oh right so I could usually and not
will<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.720> wake<00:04:01.050> up<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.320> laminar<00:04:01.680> flow<00:04:01.860> yes

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
will that wake up that laminar flow yes

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.360 
will that wake up that laminar flow yes
yeah<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.600> so<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.080> he's<00:04:04.260> gonna<00:04:04.440> redesign<00:04:04.830> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
yeah and so so he's gonna redesign the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.110 
yeah and so so he's gonna redesign the
debris<00:04:06.300> glass<00:04:06.570> for<00:04:06.900> us<00:04:07.020> and<00:04:07.459> then<00:04:08.459> he's<00:04:08.730> going

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
debris glass for us and then he's going

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.560 
debris glass for us and then he's going
in<00:04:09.420> then<00:04:09.660> also<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.470> area<00:04:10.800> here<00:04:11.040> he<00:04:11.520> said<00:04:11.730> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
in then also this area here he said the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.120 
in then also this area here he said the
brake<00:04:12.810> cooling<00:04:13.110> duct<00:04:13.440> was<00:04:13.650> supposed<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:13.950> come

used<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.700> Clint<00:04:24.260> mock<00:04:25.260> rivet<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:26.010> stuff

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
used to Clint mock rivet this stuff

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.770 
used to Clint mock rivet this stuff
underneath<00:04:26.550> right<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.270> course<00:04:27.510> when<00:04:27.690> you

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
underneath right and of course when you
