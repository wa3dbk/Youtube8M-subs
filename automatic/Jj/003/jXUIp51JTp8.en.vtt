00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
about the urban armor gear case for the

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.709 
about the urban armor gear case for the
galaxy<00:00:06.779> note<00:00:06.930> 4<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> case<00:00:09.540> this

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
galaxy note 4 so this is a case this

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.180 
galaxy note 4 so this is a case this
particular<00:00:09.870> cases<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.559> maverick<00:00:10.860> model

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
particular cases to maverick model

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.919 
particular cases to maverick model
basically<00:00:11.730> former<00:00:12.269> looks<00:00:12.480> like<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.750> sticks

features of this case or michelle
impact-resistant<00:00:47.010> softcore<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> see

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
impact-resistant softcore so you can see

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.490 
impact-resistant softcore so you can see
where<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.420> get<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:48.750> michelle<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.260> just

where we get the or michelle from just
going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> design<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> look<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.489> case

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
going to design a look at this case

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.479 
going to design a look at this case
fellow<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.870> composite<00:00:52.500> construction<00:00:52.860> which

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
fellow like composite construction which

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
fellow like composite construction which
I<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> agree<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.539> fairly<00:00:54.840> light<00:00:55.140> HD

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I can agree with it is fairly light HD

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.150 
I can agree with it is fairly light HD
screen<00:00:56.370> protector<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:58.160> but

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
screen protector which I do not have but

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
screen protector which I do not have but
there<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.430> come<00:00:59.460> three<00:00:59.940> tell<00:01:00.120> packaging

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
there will come three tell packaging

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.900 
there will come three tell packaging
non-slip<00:01:00.989> honeycomb<00:01:01.440> grille<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.789> see

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
non-slip honeycomb grille so you can see

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.440 
non-slip honeycomb grille so you can see
the<00:01:03.030> grips<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> side<00:01:05.060> easy<00:01:06.060> access

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the grips here on the side easy access

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710 
the grips here on the side easy access
to<00:01:06.750> ports<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.460> clearly<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.510> got

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to ports so you can clearly see you got

sometimes<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> usually<00:01:22.020> want

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
sometimes you can have that usually want

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.929 
sometimes you can have that usually want
you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> clear

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you know that you do not have the clear

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.899 
you know that you do not have the clear
with<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.960> case<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:26.250> meets<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
with this case and also meets the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.640 
with this case and also meets the
military<00:01:27.330> drop<00:01:27.600> test<00:01:27.960> standards<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
military drop test standards so I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
military drop test standards so I
believe<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:30.180> order<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> meet<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
believe that is in order to meet that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.319 
believe that is in order to meet that
you<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.500> least<00:01:31.680> six<00:01:32.009> feet

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
you have to be like at least six feet

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.569 
you have to be like at least six feet
when<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.390> comes<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> drop<00:01:33.990> test<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:35.400> let's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
when it comes to the drop test so let's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.440 
when it comes to the drop test so let's
go<00:01:35.700> ahead<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:37.100> throw<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:39.180> phone<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:41.450> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
go ahead and throw the phone on there so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
go ahead and throw the phone on there so
I'll<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.869> keep<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> nice<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.560> simple<00:01:44.189> i

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I'll just keep it nice and simple i

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.149 
I'll just keep it nice and simple i
usually<00:01:45.200> go<00:01:46.200> valium<00:01:46.649> bins<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.159> first<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> pull

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
usually go valium bins in first so pull

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.539 
usually go valium bins in first so pull
one<00:01:50.340> sign<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.820> push<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.780> firmly<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:53.399> there

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
one sign in push down firmly and there

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.160 
one sign in push down firmly and there
you<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:53.700> already<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.420> screen<00:01:54.720> protector<00:01:55.110> on
