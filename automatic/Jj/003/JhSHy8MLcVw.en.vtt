00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
 Corinthians became the target of justice 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.570
 Do you know 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.079
 were ordered the preventive prisons and kia joorabchian 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:13.299
 although it waits its turn that among other members of the msi and they were denounced to the 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.930
 disturbed the Libya that in this curi between other powerful of the rudder the club 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.189
 I hurt even more fans' interest is a supposed scheme 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.449
 to favor the corinthians in the field 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.160
 the superior court of justice ordered the recordings 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.649
 made by the federal public ministry 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.309
 I know that this may mean the existence of signs of buying results 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.549
 to avoid a possible relegation of Corinthians in the Brazilian championship of 

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:42.980
 2006 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.280
 by the wiretapping there is the possibility of manipulation of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.990
 results in second round matches 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.039
 the paulinho's blog 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.230
 did a game-by-game survey 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.480
 and we reproduce for you 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.520
 of the 19 games seven were whistled by rio de janeiro referees the gauchos 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.240
 four times paulistas and paranaenses whistled three games each 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.520
 in one of pernambuco 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.330
 and another one from the thick mato 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.410
 carlos eugenio símon bolívar food perry were the referees who 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.370
 more whistled the Corinthians games three times each 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.570
 the curiosity raised by the journalist paulinho's blog is here of these six 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.740
 matches the team of the park are George and did not lose any 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.840
 were three wins and three draws but controversial pole where there could be 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.710
 favor to Corinthians is just one 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.329
 corinthians 1 black bridge 0 opted by sálvio espínola 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.990
 The referee has signaled the penalty here over dodgy over rubens junior 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.850
 this penalty is there, that question was or was not 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.020
 on that occasion the team commanded by emerson lion dench avaí finally the zone 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.160
 of relegation 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.290
 but Corinthians also suffered with the Thousand 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.950
 in the goalless draw against são paulo the paranaense lost roberto lópez 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.440
 expelled two Corinthians still in the first half 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.109
 and the team started a heroic draw 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:12.069
 and the victory over the paraná emerson lion team had a bumpy goal 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.230
 nullified 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.109
 an overturned goal that generated a lot of discussion 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.590
 this is just one and vote or tour made by paulinho's blog let's say so 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:26.309
 a clear journalistic curiosity this proves nothing at all because 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.980
 exist 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.629
 other ways of manipulating the result of a football match 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.049
 how we came with edilson pereira 'de carvalho 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.750
 but what is curious 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.719
 which is timely so it is 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.290
 because it looks only the Corinthians finished the first round of the Brazilian of the year 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.009
 spent in a very bad eighth place with only 20 points won 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.780
 were six wins 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.000
 were therefore draws and were 11 defeats in the second round the campaign was well 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.769
 best 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.359
 fifth place 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.729
 33 points were nine wins six draws and only four losses 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.340
 adding the two turns 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.279
 Corinthians finished the competition in ninth place 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:13.259
 Now wait for the STJD investigation I think the face mind proven 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.969
 worse and talk 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.429
 if corruption and bribery were attempted 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:20.319
 already in the national championship 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.139
 the class will be paid through the attorney's office will be due process 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.809
 be against whoever other accusations are happening far from the lawns to escort 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.530
 also raised indications 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.430
 that a state deputy from são paulo would be working for the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.270
 political asylum operation after hopefuls in addition to illegal remittances 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.320
 of money from abroad frauds in compensation and attempt to deceive 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.989
 Brazilian authorities 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.399
 about the real owner of ims
