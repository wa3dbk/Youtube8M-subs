00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.129
 that's where everybody removes what is said and who knows to study in 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.039
 the Swiss media useful and today show you how can we have full 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.359
 flint 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.210
 that is to say, when you have recovered all the gravel from your 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.970
 choice 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 according to his trainer 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.029
 see the project paw recover no flint 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.989
 you do not know how to do that with Switzerland is very famous when 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.890
 you lay down a block of granite you recovered 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 and that wanted to break you can always have the chance to recover 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.530
 movies 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.090
 m either you make outlines like that 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.040
 and then 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.100
 cb 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430
 I wanted to break and I do what I do 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.150
 these big columns an elevator actually 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
 so that can be dangerous 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.530
 solo and do not have any significant problems with 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.210
 poutine spiders 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.210
 the museums in celebration plan 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 percent once they will be two years old to stop in february in lima 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.620
 to be dug from the edge 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.830
 and I fell on it 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.140
 if you have to you are not touching the directional keys do not 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.330
 does that lift why are we all happy here 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.140
 something else 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.420
 so this request a lot of benchmarks 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.970
 I think it's pretty random to recover the leaky oil with 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.140
 it 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.050
 so more personality if you want to have plenty of flexnet the day with 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.720
 three trains it was in 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.910
 you can report columns to the sad performance that I had done 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.800
 often in the first run the prefect him 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 vertical descent of people to the bay of hawke concretely to rally 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.680
 with down a chest filled with gravel to be able to go back to the case where 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 here I recovered 9 6% in the shot 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.520
 and here I can already I have no head to spit a beautiful 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 I wanted 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 I want to get depressed 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.019
 here I am happy 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.450
 So now you know how we do to have lots of 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.610
 girls to rest you the gravity blocks you have recovered you 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.539
 still can not pay for chips in it 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.719
 these theses take place only in institutional circles that unfortunately no more
