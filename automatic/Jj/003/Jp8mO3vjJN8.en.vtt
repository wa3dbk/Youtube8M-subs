00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:12.940
 a skinny dog 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.230
 everything is fleas says the Spanish proverb 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.230
 but fat dogs do not have much better 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.239
 some simple checks will give us an idea of â€‹â€‹their physical condition 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.530
 if you can feel your ribs in difficulty 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.250
 appreciate your waist looking at the dog from above and your abdomen appears 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.420
 retracted seen from profile your dog is at his ideal weight 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 if instead it is difficult to write down the ribs 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.850
 It has fat deposits in the lumbar area and the base of the cabbage is barely 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.530
 he appreciates his painting the act - he retracts without doubt your dog has a problem 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.580
 obesity 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.250
 obese dogs tend to be lazy spend more hours a day 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.190
 sleeping and reduce their physical activity 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.540
 a sedentary life propitiated by lack of space in the house 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.190
 thus the frequent and the absence of game predispose to overweight 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.370
 However, there are other factors that induce obesity such as 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 genetic predisposition and some races and some diseases 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.860
 at a glance we could all think 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.610
 good a cookie to a little cheese can not hurt 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 but we must take into account the characteristics of our friends 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.470
 To give you an idea 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.830
 for a dog of 10 kilos a cookie is equivalent in the case of a human being 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.590
 adult to the calories of a hamburger 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.750
 but if what we offer you is 25 grams of cheese 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.240
 it will be as if a person ate two chocolate bars 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.290
 to control the weight of your dog the ideal is prevention 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.760
 Ali when feeding and exercising the animal at his age and race 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.530
 All overweight treatment includes at least three aspects 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.750
 eliminate tutorials and leftovers from our food 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.150
 and provide a healthy and adequate food to a slimming diet 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.320
 It is the first step 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 exercise with long walks and the game is the most recommended 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.280
 and finally the veterinarian can design a specific plan for 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.460
 our pet identifying their particular problems and suggesting 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.969
 solutions 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.790
 A kissing dog requires eight to 12 months to recover the lost form 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.200
 so be patient
