steady<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.340> do<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.210> can<00:01:28.390> get<00:01:28.539> much

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
steady to do it and I can get much

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.230 
steady to do it and I can get much
thinner<00:01:29.140> lines<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.920> way<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.550> can<00:01:30.670> if<00:01:31.179> I

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
thinner lines this way that I can if I

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.700 
thinner lines this way that I can if I
just<00:01:31.659> paint<00:01:31.960> them<00:01:32.110> on<00:01:32.319> with<00:01:32.470> a<00:01:32.500> brush

afterwards<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:37.920> thought<00:01:38.920> some<00:01:39.159> silver<00:01:39.640> glitter

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
afterwards I thought some silver glitter

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.880 
afterwards I thought some silver glitter
would<00:01:40.210> look<00:01:40.360> good<00:01:40.569> for<00:01:40.780> his<00:01:40.869> antlers<00:01:41.289> so<00:01:41.770> I'm
