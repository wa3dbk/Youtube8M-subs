00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.599
 a greeting from the paparelle but found on 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.409
 youtube channel of mobile magazine 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.080
 today we talk about motorola 360 360 lo 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:21.850
 we try it at home on the motorola smartwatch 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.050
 with android version 5.0.2 and let's go 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.490
 a little to see more than anything else like 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.070
 it works because we actually already had it 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.030
 reviewed a few months ago with 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.439
 updating the operating system 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.339
 the features are those 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.640
 known with a box rather 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.219
 thick we are over 11 mm 49 grams 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.979
 the weight of the case alone but above all 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.010
 this aesthetic feature to have 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.929
 brought to design a design 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.499
 rounded also for smartphones 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.449
 so with a lot more personality 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:58.569
 marked a feeling of having on the wrist 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.249
 a real watch or rose that 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.079
 can of course be customized 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.110
 thanks to the potential of android ue 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.720
 for example with the workspaces I decided 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.950
 to use that in these days 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.960
 that you are seeing because I like it 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.200
 particularly but there are many 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.230
 preinstalled, and many more you can do the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.670
 you can download android wear that 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.980
 we find updated to version 5.0.2 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.020
 the operation of which is substantially 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.940
 what we have seen that we know 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.990
 on all the smartphones they use 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.770
 this platform with the menu yes 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.510
 can manage at aa the link with the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.670
 possibility of having a multitude of 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.400
 operations that can also be managed through the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.780
 item there are also two own microphones 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.660
 to to communicate with with him 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.880
 smartwatch but also and above all the 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.640
 pre-installed series of programs there 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.340
 are some own of motorola goods 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.380
 I do indeed see a lot of body for the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.890
 calories for cardiac activity for 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.679
 heart rate and for the pedometer 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.420
 then the programs that are added to 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.690
 those 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.340
 already available to keep below 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.920
 control our daily activity 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.900
 but of course it does not end here because 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.260
 we have the google availability 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.470
 then to command some 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.170
 smartphone features and of course 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.290
 the main function of these smat 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.780
 flies to make a kind 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.380
 long hand of our smartphone for 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.940
 regarding the communication of 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.280
 some notifications the possibility of 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.040
 respond for example in real time to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.810
 some to some messages therefore a 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.940
 how we are learning now 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.870
 to know a little about everyone 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.600
 smartphones I wanted to show you in 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.060
 settings the distribution of 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.610
 system obviously from here you can 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.640
 adjust brightness connect 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.160
 bluetooth devices yours with 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.019
 smart decide whether to leave always on 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.630
 or to have the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.350
 display thing that also goes to change 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.730
 in an important way the yield of the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.829
 autonomy from here you can restart 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.690
 you can completely restore the 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.150
 device also from which you can change 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.590
 the square but I wanted to get to the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.010
 information item must draw 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:32.100
 the presence of a few of Andrea 5.0.2 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.329
 let's get out of here and tell you more about it 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.239
 features 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.790
 motion between 60 is also available with 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.030
 the leather bracelet in addition to that of 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.070
 metal we are seeing in exchange for a 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.060
 even the weight changes a bit 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:53.069
 the price 249 or 279 euros based on the type 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.930
 of finish that you decide to buy 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.420
 as far as autonomy was concerned 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.799
 making mention a few summer ago to 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.870
 display management here with a 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.579
 usage is quite normal and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.900
 preparing a shutdown of the 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.209
 display when we ran out of 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.310
 our operations have succeeded in approx 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.459
 in a week of use a 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.740
 realize even the 24 consecutive hours 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.060
 naturally preserving even the hours 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.780
 wherein the smartwatch is naturally 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.730
 subjected to a lot of stress 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.400
 lower you actually can't get to 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.110
 cover two full days of di 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.250
 autonomy is therefore one of those 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.360
 devices that asks to be 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.610
 recharged every day I do 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.950
 see the induction base again 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.240
 we have to fix our 360 motion 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.610
 this position 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.090
 you see it connecting the base to a 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.890
 micro usb cable to recharge it 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.770
 the hardware features smartphone 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.790
 it seems to us to say spends at 1.56 inches 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.370
 with 320 x 240 pixel resolution we have 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.320
 4 GB of memory integrated half a gig of 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.410
 ram memory and a texas processor 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.160
 sorry instruments income I have many a 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.170
 move everything the system in 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.960
 definitive a smart work that has me 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.640
 particularly amused to use 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.830
 I find it like watches 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.210
 quite important the tickets in 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.220
 this way this 360 way manages to a 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.570
 don't go unnoticed to be heard 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.030
 On the wrist 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.420
 I have chosen since the first ignition 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.400
 this quadrant that really reminds of the 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.530
 functions of a chronograph and that to me 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.820
 particularly liked in the part 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.060
 lower we naturally also 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.440
 all the various sensors and as I told you 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.730
 you can also choose one 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.190
 different configuration as far as 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.590
 concerns the very important bracelet 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.630
 the mont blanc is also the sorry box 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.300
 bloom a little back 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.250
 here is what it contains besides the clock 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.490
 naturally also the charger with 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.140
 the relative base for good indication mi 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.240
 stop here for this chat 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:02.070
 concerning a motorola moto 360 and mi 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.070
 post next videos a greeting from ivan
