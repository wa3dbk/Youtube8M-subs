00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.939
 hello my name is alexey hands and 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.190
 today i want to talk to you about 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.519
 installing windows on g5 hard disk 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.849
 sections 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.099
 So we put our disk drive 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.349
 operating system successfully loaded 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.070
 it came to choosing a section for 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.500
 installation and see below the error 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.230
 impossible to stop windows when 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.029
 viewing the details we see that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.360
 selected disk has partition style 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.539
 same 5 so what do we do in this 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.680
 situations are all very simple we will 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.579
 use our operating disc 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.370
 system 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.040
 utilities available on it to get started 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.540
 run the console using the combination 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 shift of 10 keys 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.990
 after clicking them we get this 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.140
 here 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.830
 console window we now need 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:03.370
 run the utility diskpart type it 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:05.420
 name and press enter at this time 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.630
 loading 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.810
 these are utilities from our disk right now we 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.250
 see that the utility is loaded 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.700
 with the help and we will work with 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.740
 by our 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.310
 hard drive and produce 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.920
 certain transformations start us 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.979
 need to understand what to work need to withdraw 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.240

 here and we see our list of drives in 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.649
 In this case, we have only one 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.530
 the disk number is zero its size 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.420
 in order to continue working with him 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.039
 as it is , you always need to first 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.569

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.010
 Before we continue with the installation 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.520
 windows we can create a disk of this 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.180
 use the command 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.180
 kreed 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.470
 partisan 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.410
 primary 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.460

 it turns out 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.090
 disk name label 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.760
 and such a parameter is passed as wik this 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.200
 mean formatting will be fast 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.200
 so as not to take a lot of time 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.700
 all disk is successfully formatted now 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.700
 if we go to our installation and 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.700
 update 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.410
