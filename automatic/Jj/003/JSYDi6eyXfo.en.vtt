00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the bat see the little thing that says

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.310 
the bat see the little thing that says
shutter<00:01:47.850> speed<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.720> raise<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.259> number

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
shutter speed if you raise that number

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.410 
shutter speed if you raise that number
to<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.009> longer<00:01:50.159> whenever<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.210> take<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to make it longer whenever you take a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.810 
to make it longer whenever you take a
picture<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.439> camera<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.399> for

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
picture now your camera will be on for

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.450 
picture now your camera will be on for
several<00:01:54.119> seconds<00:01:54.720> taking<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.649> picture<00:01:56.040> for

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
several seconds taking a picture for

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
several seconds taking a picture for
that<00:01:56.670> amount<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.270> time<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.049> really

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that amount of time now this is really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.929 
that amount of time now this is really
cool<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
cool because what you can do is take a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.850 
cool because what you can do is take a
light<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.899> move<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> around<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.619> frame

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
light and then move it around the frame

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.160 
light and then move it around the frame
and<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:02.729> record<00:02:03.270> light<00:02:03.869> trails

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and you can actually record light trails

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
and you can actually record light trails
with<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> people<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:06.000> you've<00:02:06.240> heard<00:02:06.509> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.999 
with that and people if you've heard of
this<00:02:06.689> technique<00:02:07.110> before<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.590> called<00:02:07.799> like

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
this technique before it's called like

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.800 
this technique before it's called like
painting<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.580> most<00:02:08.819> people<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.539> oh<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
painting but most people think that oh I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.890 
painting but most people think that oh I
just<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.700> wave<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> flashlight<00:02:12.060> around<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
just I just wave a flashlight around and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.190 
just I just wave a flashlight around and
then

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
then

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.290 
then
done<00:02:13.440> well<00:02:13.800> actually<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.550> whole<00:02:14.760> art<00:02:15.030> form

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
done well actually it's a whole art form

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.119 
done well actually it's a whole art form
in<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.629> of<00:02:15.720> itself<00:02:15.870> because<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.890> are

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
in and of itself because there are

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.759 
in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.940> different<00:02:18.540> types<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.260> lights<00:02:19.590> that
