this is the what its gonna be like so
basically<00:01:03.120> guys<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.690> computer<00:01:04.110> i<00:01:04.140> got<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.710> an

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
basically guys the computer i got is an

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.600 
basically guys the computer i got is an
alienware<00:01:06.060> x51<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.380> i7<00:01:07.590> processor<00:01:08.430> 8

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
alienware x51 with an i7 processor 8

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.420 
alienware x51 with an i7 processor 8
gigabytes<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> ram<00:01:09.530> two<00:01:10.530> terabyte<00:01:10.950> hard<00:01:11.130> drive

gigabytes of ram two terabyte hard drive

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.690 
gigabytes of ram two terabyte hard drive
and<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.720> kinds<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.380> crazy<00:01:13.920> specs<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and just all kinds of crazy specs you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.390 
and just all kinds of crazy specs you
know<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> was<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:16.320> kind<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.650> expensive<00:01:17.009> not

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
know it was I was kind of expensive not

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.609 
know it was I was kind of expensive not
too<00:01:18.180> expensive<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> most<00:01:19.200> expensive

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
too expensive not the most expensive

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
too expensive not the most expensive
computer<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> could<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.700> gotten<00:01:20.880> from

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
computer that I could have gotten from

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.600 
computer that I could have gotten from
alienware<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.950> i'm<00:01:23.040> sure<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
alienware and you know i'm sure some of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
alienware and you know i'm sure some of
you<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.939> probably<00:01:24.560> disagree<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.680> my

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you will probably disagree with my

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
you will probably disagree with my
decision<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> alienware<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> i<00:01:27.420> am

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
decision to get it alienware and i am

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.929 
decision to get it alienware and i am
clearly<00:01:28.439> aware<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.700> i

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
clearly aware of that i know that i

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.810 
clearly aware of that i know that i
could<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.509> probably<00:01:30.750> made<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.920> much<00:01:32.610> faster

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
could have probably made a much faster

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.960 
could have probably made a much faster
computer<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.110> cheaper<00:01:34.820> through<00:01:35.820> like

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
computer for a lot cheaper through like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.940 
computer for a lot cheaper through like
custom<00:01:36.360> pci<00:01:36.720> x<00:01:37.079> power<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.500> something<00:01:37.829> like

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
custom pci x power or something like

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
custom pci x power or something like
that<00:01:38.119> but<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.840> did<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that but I do not do I did not want to

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
that but I do not do I did not want to
do<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.009> wanted<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.820> get

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
do that I wanted to you know get

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.690 
do that I wanted to you know get

laptop<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:31.640> took<00:02:31.819> some<00:02:32.030> clips<00:02:32.299> out

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
laptop and I just took some clips out

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.990 
laptop and I just took some clips out
from<00:02:33.500> recording<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.519> know<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.849> probably

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
from recording and you know it probably

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.670 
from recording and you know it probably
clips<00:02:35.659> it<00:02:35.810> probably<00:02:36.079> would<00:02:36.170> have<00:02:36.230> taken<00:02:36.409> me

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
clips it probably would have taken me

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.319 
clips it probably would have taken me
around<00:02:36.799> two<00:02:37.159> to<00:02:37.280> three<00:02:37.459> hours<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.909> render<00:02:38.090> in

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
around two to three hours to render in

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.530 
around two to three hours to render in
vegas<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.930> my<00:02:39.349> laptop<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.849> test<00:02:41.060> out<00:02:41.299> and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
vegas on my laptop just to test out and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.440 
vegas on my laptop just to test out and
it<00:02:42.079> took<00:02:42.349> probably<00:02:42.739> around<00:02:43.250> 10-15<00:02:44.000> minutes<00:02:44.329> to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it took probably around 10-15 minutes to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.270 
it took probably around 10-15 minutes to
render<00:02:44.720> these<00:02:44.900> videos<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.950> would<00:02:46.190> have

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
render these videos that would have

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.099 
render these videos that would have
taken<00:02:46.430> me<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.940> at<00:02:47.090> least<00:02:47.209> two<00:02:47.450> hours<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.930> render

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
taken me to at least two hours to render

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.770 
taken me to at least two hours to render
on<00:02:48.470> my<00:02:48.620> laptop<00:02:48.829> so<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:50.480> crazy

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780
