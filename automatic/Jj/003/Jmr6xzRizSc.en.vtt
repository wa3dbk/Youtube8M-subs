problem with your cables that it rips

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.030 
problem with your cables that it rips
always<00:00:08.580> from<00:00:09.150> right<00:00:09.330> here<00:00:09.630> like<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.679> splits

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
always from right here like it splits

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.629 
always from right here like it splits
the<00:00:11.809> reason<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.900> happens<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.559> because<00:00:13.769> when

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the reason that happens is because when

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.820 
the reason that happens is because when
you<00:00:14.759> unplug<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.299> from<00:00:15.480> your<00:00:15.690> when<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.470> detach

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
you unplug it from your when you detach

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
you unplug it from your when you detach
it<00:00:17.039> detach<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.640> from<00:00:17.670> your<00:00:18.000> iPad<00:00:18.449> or<00:00:18.480> iPhone

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it detach it from your iPad or iPhone

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.460 
it detach it from your iPad or iPhone
you<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:21.210> tend<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> pull<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.930> always<00:00:22.199> from<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
you you tend to pull it always from the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.259 
you you tend to pull it always from the
cable<00:00:22.830> instead<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.279> grabbing<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.000> from<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
cable instead of grabbing it from the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.830 
cable instead of grabbing it from the
head<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.890> pulling<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.180> that's<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
head and pulling it out that's that that

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200 
head and pulling it out that's that that
is<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.170> causes<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> braid<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.099> rip<00:00:29.310> now

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
is what causes the braid to rip now

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.669 
is what causes the braid to rip now
going<00:00:30.449> back<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.900> troubleshooting<00:00:31.470> part

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
going back to the troubleshooting part

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.630 
going back to the troubleshooting part
is<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.940> back<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> repair<00:00:33.989> part<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
is I'm going back to the repair part the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
is I'm going back to the repair part the
reason<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.360> doesn't<00:00:36.510> charge<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.110> because

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
reason is it doesn't charge is because

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.799 
reason is it doesn't charge is because
that<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:38.010> grounded<00:00:38.430> no<00:00:38.579> more<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.540> soon<00:00:39.690> as

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that is not grounded no more as soon as

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.990 
that is not grounded no more as soon as
that<00:00:39.899> cable<00:00:40.260> splits<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.430> ground<00:00:41.730> eventually

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that cable splits the ground eventually

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.330 
that cable splits the ground eventually
rips<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.290> ground<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.680> right<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.160> one

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
rips the ground is right here this one

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.869 
rips the ground is right here this one
is<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> silver<00:00:45.829> wire<00:00:46.829> around<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.610> covers

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
is a silver wire around it that covers

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.930 
is a silver wire around it that covers
up<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.210> these<00:00:48.360> wires<00:00:49.520> that's<00:00:50.520> why<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.760> doesn't

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
up all these wires that's why it doesn't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
up all these wires that's why it doesn't
charge<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.539> when<00:00:52.260> I'm<00:00:52.379> gonna<00:00:52.649> cable

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
charge because when I'm gonna cable

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.610 
charge because when I'm gonna cable
disco<00:00:53.250> next<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:55.140> um<00:00:55.320> ripped

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
disco next or it's a it's um ripped

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400 
disco next or it's a it's um ripped
those<00:00:56.489> cables<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.000> test<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.930> start<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
those cables just test to start to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.340 
those cables just test to start to
prolong<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.190> then<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.059> break<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.570> then

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
prolong and then then break and then

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
prolong and then then break and then
eventually<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.949> end<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.809> just<00:01:03.809> with

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
eventually you end up with a just with

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.570 
eventually you end up with a just with
the<00:01:04.979> cables<00:01:05.400> exposed<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:05.970> themselves<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the cables exposed by themselves so you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.770 
the cables exposed by themselves so you
know<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> need<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
know what you need to do then is you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230 
know what you need to do then is you
need<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.220> if<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.400> still<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> little<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
need to if you still get a little bit of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960 
need to if you still get a little bit of
that<00:01:12.560> wiring<00:01:13.560> minor<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.670> several

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that wiring minor that that out several

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
that wiring minor that that out several
wiring<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.689> surround<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> cables<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
wiring there surround the cables and you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.710 
wiring there surround the cables and you
don't<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> did<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.570> here

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
don't need to do what I did right here

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.030 
don't need to do what I did right here
what<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> did<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.680> actually<00:01:21.560> had<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> cut<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
what I did is a I actually had to cut a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
what I did is a I actually had to cut a
little<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:25.170> expose<00:01:26.509> top<00:01:27.509> ground

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
little bit more in to expose top ground

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.740 
little bit more in to expose top ground
wire<00:01:28.220> for<00:01:29.220> me<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.610> able<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.360> our<00:01:30.509> wires

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
wire for me to be able to get our wires

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
wire for me to be able to get our wires
around<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.560> wrap<00:01:31.799> them<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.070> around<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
around it to wrap them up around it and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
around it to wrap them up around it and
then<00:01:33.290> swirling<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.920> copper

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
then swirling down you see the copper

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
then swirling down you see the copper
wire<00:01:35.610> how<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> did<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:39.119> attach<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:40.320> touch<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
wire how I did it to attach to touch to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.700 
wire how I did it to attach to touch to
make<00:01:41.189> contact<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> ground<00:01:41.939> wire<00:01:42.710> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
make contact with the ground wire so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
make contact with the ground wire so
that's<00:01:43.860> pretty<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that's pretty much it and if you have a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
that's pretty much it and if you have a
cable<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.560> much<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
cable that's pretty much really if you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.550 
cable that's pretty much really if you
have<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> pet<00:01:48.420> or<00:01:48.600> rats<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.170> house<00:01:49.350> or

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
have like a pet or rats in your house or

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
have like a pet or rats in your house or
something<00:01:49.590> whatever<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.280> been<00:01:50.520> biting<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
something whatever that's been biting it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
something whatever that's been biting it
on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> cable<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.320> rip<00:01:53.840> but<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
on the cable and this rip but it is the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.109 
on the cable and this rip but it is the
same<00:01:55.829> exact<00:01:56.189> procedure<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.850> you're<00:01:57.000> going

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
same exact procedure that you're going

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.030 
same exact procedure that you're going
to<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.299> pretty<00:01:57.479> much<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.590> case<00:01:58.829> what

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
to do pretty much but in this case what

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.660 
to do pretty much but in this case what
you're<00:01:59.100> gonna<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.490> you're<00:01:59.579> gonna

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.910 
you're gonna do is you're gonna
eliminate<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.479> wire<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.200> part<00:02:04.439> where<00:02:04.590> where

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
eliminate the wire the part where where

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340 
eliminate the wire the part where where
you<00:02:05.040> spring<00:02:05.280> chewed<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.659> bad<00:02:06.840> it's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you spring chewed on or it's bad it's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.029 
you spring chewed on or it's bad it's
going<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.560> cut<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.829> off

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
going to cut that off

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.699 
going to cut that off
and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.940> pretty<00:02:09.209> much<00:02:09.300> you're<00:02:09.539> gonna

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
and then pretty much you're gonna

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.900 
and then pretty much you're gonna
reattach<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.220> by<00:02:11.310> matching<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
reattach it just by matching up the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.610 
reattach it just by matching up the
colors<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.360> you

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
colors as you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.220 
colors as you
here<00:02:13.239> everything<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.450> color-coded<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.170> all

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
here everything is color-coded so all

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.479 
here everything is color-coded so all
you<00:02:15.349> do<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.500> match<00:02:15.890> up<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.159> colors<00:02:16.370> you

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
you do just match up the colors you

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.280 
you do just match up the colors you
could<00:02:16.580> reconnect<00:02:16.970> them<00:02:17.330> all<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.140> wires

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
could reconnect them all the wires

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.860 
could reconnect them all the wires
together<00:02:18.560> how<00:02:18.830> they<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.269> blue<00:02:20.269> with<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.690> mean

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
together how they go blue with I mean

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.729 
together how they go blue with I mean
green<00:02:21.260> with<00:02:21.470> green

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
green with green

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.920 
green with green
I<00:02:21.920> think<00:02:22.819> that's<00:02:23.000> brown<00:02:23.269> with<00:02:23.450> brown<00:02:23.629> white

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
I think that's brown with brown white

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.839 
I think that's brown with brown white
with<00:02:24.140> white<00:02:24.290> whatever<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.459> also<00:02:25.610> gotta

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
with white whatever and you also gotta

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.210 
with white whatever and you also gotta
connect<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.330> ground<00:02:26.750> wire<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:27.920> that's

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
connect this ground wire to but that's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.339 
connect this ground wire to but that's
how<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.400> attack<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:29.659> that's<00:02:30.140> how<00:02:30.290> you

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
how you attack that but that's how you

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.130 
how you attack that but that's how you
repay<00:02:30.680> your<00:02:30.829> iPhone<00:02:31.159> data<00:02:31.400> cable<00:02:31.900> let<00:02:32.900> me<00:02:32.989> show
