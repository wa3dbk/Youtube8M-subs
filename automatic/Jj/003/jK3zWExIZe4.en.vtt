this<00:02:33.890> laser<00:02:34.280> beam<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.700> death<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.060> shoots<00:02:35.330> up

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
this laser beam of death that shoots up

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.350 
this laser beam of death that shoots up
in<00:02:35.630> front<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.870> your<00:02:35.959> chopper<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.880> just

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
in front of your chopper and it just

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.680 
in front of your chopper and it just
annihilates<00:02:38.840> everything<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.260> touches<00:02:40.690> it's

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
annihilates everything it touches it's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.110 
annihilates everything it touches it's
unstoppable

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
unstoppable

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.640 
unstoppable
and<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.870> didn't<00:02:45.110> realize<00:02:45.379> how<00:02:45.530> about<00:02:45.739> here<00:02:46.099> that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
and I didn't realize how about here that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.580 
and I didn't realize how about here that
you<00:02:48.650> can<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:48.890> hold<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:49.340> trailer<00:02:49.610> down<00:02:50.590> and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
you can just hold the trailer down and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.170 
you can just hold the trailer down and
that<00:02:51.830> instead<00:02:52.129> of<00:02:52.250> hitting<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.580> for<00:02:53.090> each

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
that instead of hitting it for each

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.270 
that instead of hitting it for each
individual<00:02:53.690> shot<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.349> it<00:02:54.440> requires<00:02:54.830> this

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
individual shot and it requires this

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.900 
individual shot and it requires this
constant<00:02:55.909> barrage<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.920> laser<00:02:58.549> def<00:02:58.879> beams<00:03:00.310> and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
constant barrage the laser def beams and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
constant barrage the laser def beams and
at<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.630> point<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.900> realized<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.380> game

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
at this point I realized this game

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.490 
at this point I realized this game
totally<00:03:05.160> kicks<00:03:05.400> ass<00:03:05.990> lose<00:03:06.990> everything<00:03:07.440> I

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
totally kicks ass lose everything I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.670 
totally kicks ass lose everything I
remember<00:03:07.560> with<00:03:07.980> my<00:03:08.100> youth<00:03:09.620> piloting<00:03:10.620> a

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
remember with my youth piloting a

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.210 
remember with my youth piloting a
chopper<00:03:11.130> commanding<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.180> chopper<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> will

chopper commanding a chopper if you will

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.070 
chopper commanding a chopper if you will

protect this convoy you're their sole

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.070 
protect this convoy you're their sole
protector<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.860> there's<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:17.820> like<00:03:18.080> unending

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
protector and there's just like unending

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.950

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
you ask me airplane they could just turn

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.340 
you ask me airplane they could just turn
on<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.340> dime<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.940> these<00:03:27.900> helicopters

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
on a dime like that these helicopters

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.560 
on a dime like that these helicopters
are<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.770> kind<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.100> alyssa's<00:03:29.580> as<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.390> progress

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
are the kind of alyssa's as you progress

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.990 
are the kind of alyssa's as you progress
in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.930> game<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.260> clear<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> boards<00:03:32.000> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
in the game and clear the boards the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.690 
in the game and clear the boards the
helicopters<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:33.990> airplanes<00:03:34.520> increase<00:03:35.520> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
helicopters and airplanes increase the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.250 
helicopters and airplanes increase the
speed<00:03:35.880> as<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.300> see<00:03:36.510> become<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.020> little

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
speed as you can see become a little

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.990 
speed as you can see become a little
more<00:03:37.290> erratic

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.220 

I<00:03:43.060> don't<00:03:43.480> know<00:03:43.570> where<00:03:43.780> this<00:03:43.870> takes<00:03:44.080> place

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
I don't know where this takes place

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.260 
I don't know where this takes place
looks<00:03:44.770> like<00:03:44.980> maybe<00:03:45.190> Nevada<00:03:46.350> Colorado<00:03:47.350> perhaps

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
looks like maybe Nevada Colorado perhaps

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
maybe Iraq he knows this could have been

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.240 
maybe Iraq he knows this could have been
the<00:03:58.420> start<00:03:58.690> of<00:03:58.780> everything

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
chopper command I found the game quite

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.280 
chopper command I found the game quite
enjoyable<00:04:35.570> at<00:04:36.570> first<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.050> was<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.199> little

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
enjoyable at first I was a little

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.980 
enjoyable at first I was a little
disappointed

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990

if<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.530> haven't<00:04:40.740> played<00:04:40.890> this<00:04:41.010> game<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.250> a

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
if you haven't played this game in a

if you haven't played this game in a
couple<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:42.780> decades<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.520> urge<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.760> bear

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.360 
couple of decades I urge you to bear
with<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.420> until<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.530> get<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.680> feel<00:04:46.950> for<00:04:47.160> how<00:04:47.340> the

with it until you get a feel for how the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.920 
with it until you get a feel for how the

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
helicopter moves because that's the most

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.650 
helicopter moves because that's the most
difficult<00:04:49.140> part<00:04:49.910> once<00:04:50.910> you<00:04:51.000> get<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> feel<00:04:51.420> for

difficult part once you get a feel for
the<00:04:51.720> helicopter

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240
