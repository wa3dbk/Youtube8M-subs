00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230

it's<00:02:13.810> also<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.350> they<00:02:14.500> were<00:02:14.560> quite

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
it's also that they were quite

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.890 
it's also that they were quite
resourceful<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:16.030> they<00:02:16.150> were<00:02:16.209> striving<00:02:16.570> for

resourceful and they were striving for

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.810

the<00:02:16.959> mastery<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.610> self-sufficiency<00:02:18.610> in

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the mastery and self-sufficiency in

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.640 
the mastery and self-sufficiency in

making weapons of mass destruction and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.740 
making weapons of mass destruction and
you<00:02:21.100> see<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> same<00:02:21.580> kind<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.940> philosophy<00:02:22.150> in

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
you see the same kind of philosophy in

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.420 
you see the same kind of philosophy in

their efforts to make biological and
chemical<00:02:24.580> weapons<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.769> think<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.920> if<00:02:27.040> if

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
chemical weapons I think that if if

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.110 
chemical weapons I think that if if
al-qaeda<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:28.480> still<00:02:28.840> interested<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.350> these

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120

weapons and I believe they are we do

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.710 
weapons and I believe they are we do
have<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.489> worry<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.730> great<00:02:33.760> deal<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:34.600> are

have to worry a great deal that they are

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.650 
have to worry a great deal that they are
