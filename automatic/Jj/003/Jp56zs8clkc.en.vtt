00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.870
 knitting crossed tunisian 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.599
 with one double crochet in order to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.719
 demonstrate this knitting technique 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.779
 I knit 1 row just something low 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.609
 columns and now knit 2 air 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 loops for lifting because the posts with 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.880
 one nakida 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.710
 above and now proceed to knit given 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.670
 we make an element on the hook 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:44.480
 miss the Tunisian front leg 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.480
 column next in turn and to the left 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.460
 we follow the hook 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.460
 from right to left we pull out the loop through 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.980
 tunisian front leg and 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.379
 why do we knit 2 loops together and here 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.070
 first tunisian column is connected with 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.270
 nakidom 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.770
 skipping one loop then do a cape 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.580
 hook on the hook is inserted into the leg 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.950
 which we missed here over here 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.189
 we introduce this leg from right to left 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:32.130
 hook 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 then take out the loop and after that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.509
 provyazyvaem place two loops, and so we 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 knit two intertwined 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.700
 single crochet I can show 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.579
 once again quickly do a cape 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 skip one leg into the next knit 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:02.450
 double block then do again 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.710
 cover in the previous 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.590
 tunisian front leg 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.260
 We introduce a hook and another provyazyvaem 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.440
 double crochet and now we have 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.370
 connected two such crossed 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.860
 double crochet and in the back row 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.890
 close the loop as usual first 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.290
 extreme knit by air loop and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.290
 then close 2 loops 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.730
 but it will look like a sample if everything 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:53.860
 double crochet 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:59.260
 and the symbol of this element 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.340
 it will be like this where the wavy lines are 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.379
 loops 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.459
