today just want to go over some of the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.690 
today just want to go over some of the
issues<00:00:09.599> related<00:00:10.350> to<00:00:10.500> multiple<00:00:11.129> organ

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700

generally<00:00:17.480> about<00:00:17.750> that<00:00:18.310> basically<00:00:19.310> the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
generally about that basically the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.720 
generally about that basically the
primary<00:00:20.119> case<00:00:20.600> of<00:00:20.930> Maude's<00:00:21.860> is<00:00:22.160> due<00:00:22.369> to<00:00:22.550> trauma

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
primary case of Maude's is due to trauma

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.150 
primary case of Maude's is due to trauma
but<00:00:23.180> there<00:00:23.360> are<00:00:23.480> a<00:00:23.540> lot<00:00:23.750> of<00:00:23.800> secondary<00:00:24.800> things

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
but there are a lot of secondary things

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.950 
but there are a lot of secondary things
that<00:00:25.369> can<00:00:25.520> lead<00:00:25.700> to<00:00:25.730> multiple<00:00:26.630> organ

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
that can lead to multiple organ

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.929 
that can lead to multiple organ
dysfunction<00:00:27.050> syndrome<00:00:27.619> among<00:00:28.160> those<00:00:28.310> are<00:00:28.640> a

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
dysfunction syndrome among those are a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.839 
dysfunction syndrome among those are a
response<00:00:29.540> to<00:00:29.779> septic<00:00:30.200> shock<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:31.279> systemic

elderly it can be due to chronic illness
it<00:00:36.800> can<00:00:37.010> be<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.310> response<00:00:37.700> to<00:00:37.910> surgery<00:00:38.390> to

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
it can be the response to surgery to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.410 
it can be the response to surgery to
malnutrition<00:00:39.020> or<00:00:39.680> immunosuppression<00:00:40.610> so

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
malnutrition or immunosuppression so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.479 
malnutrition or immunosuppression so
there<00:00:41.600> are<00:00:41.720> many<00:00:41.870> different<00:00:42.530> avenues<00:00:42.680> that

always remembering of course is the
primary<00:00:48.260> reason<00:00:48.649> for<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.129> is<00:00:49.190> some<00:00:49.399> sort<00:00:49.640> of

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
primary reason for it is some sort of

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.829 
primary reason for it is some sort of
trauma<00:00:50.510> directly<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.980> organ<00:00:52.399> but<00:00:52.640> or<00:00:53.600> that

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
trauma directly to the organ but or that

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.389 
trauma directly to the organ but or that
region<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.440> organs<00:00:54.739> in<00:00:54.829> that<00:00:54.949> region

however<00:00:56.149> secondarily<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:57.170> can<00:00:57.410> be<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.649> result

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
however secondarily it can be the result

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.549 
however secondarily it can be the result
of<00:00:58.160> all<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.399> these<00:00:58.609> other<00:00:58.670> issues<00:00:59.559> related

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
of all of these other issues related

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.849 
of all of these other issues related
systemically<00:01:01.339> to<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.760> body<00:01:02.260> now<00:01:03.260> some<00:01:03.710> of<00:01:03.800> the

systemically to the body now some of the

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.890 
systemically to the body now some of the
symptoms<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.670> show<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:05.059> this<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.449> actually

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
symptoms that show that this is actually

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.830 
symptoms that show that this is actually
taking<00:01:06.230> place<00:01:06.260> our<00:01:06.710> first<00:01:07.430> lung<00:01:08.120> dysfunction

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
taking place our first lung dysfunction

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.250 
taking place our first lung dysfunction
leading<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.740> respiratory<00:01:09.980> issues<00:01:10.790> a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
leading to respiratory issues a

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.140 
leading to respiratory issues a
metabolic<00:01:12.260> increase<00:01:13.010> slight<00:01:13.550> fever<00:01:13.820> and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
metabolic increase slight fever and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.600 
metabolic increase slight fever and
mental<00:01:14.420> changes<00:01:14.810> are<00:01:14.990> some<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.290> the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
mental changes are some of the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.170 
mental changes are some of the
preliminary<00:01:16.630> precursors<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.990> indicate<00:01:18.920> that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
preliminary precursors to indicate that

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.109 
preliminary precursors to indicate that
Maude's<00:01:20.180> is<00:01:20.479> happening<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.939> basically<00:01:22.939> what's

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
Maude's is happening so basically what's

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.520 
Maude's is happening so basically what's
called<00:01:23.210> for<00:01:23.600> once<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.840> start<00:01:24.079> seeing<00:01:24.320> these

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
called for once you start seeing these

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.139 
called for once you start seeing these
symptoms<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.189> one<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.640> these<00:01:25.700> other<00:01:25.939> things

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
symptoms and one of these other things

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.960 
symptoms and one of these other things
is<00:01:26.360> in<00:01:26.509> play<00:01:27.070> what<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.100> do<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.640> address

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
is in play what you do is you address

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.580 
is in play what you do is you address
the<00:01:29.210> primary<00:01:29.420> cause<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.259> need<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.469> know

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the primary cause and you need to know

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.230 
the primary cause and you need to know
what<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.829> primary<00:01:31.009> cause<00:01:31.399> is<00:01:31.640> as<00:01:31.850> near<00:01:32.030> as<00:01:32.060> you

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
what the primary cause is as near as you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.670 
what the primary cause is as near as you
can<00:01:32.360> tell<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:32.899> that<00:01:33.079> is<00:01:33.229> being<00:01:33.469> dealt

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
can tell so that that is being dealt

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.130 
can tell so that that is being dealt
with<00:01:34.119> often<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.210> can<00:01:35.329> get<00:01:35.420> sidetrack<00:01:35.930> of<00:01:36.079> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
with often you can get sidetrack of the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.340 
with often you can get sidetrack of the
secondary<00:01:36.560> thing<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:36.979> dealing<00:01:37.250> with<00:01:37.430> the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
secondary thing and dealing with the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.679 
secondary thing and dealing with the
organs<00:01:39.350> themselves<00:01:40.219> their<00:01:40.909> dysfunction<00:01:41.540> when

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
organs themselves their dysfunction when

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.300 
organs themselves their dysfunction when
basically<00:01:41.930> there's<00:01:42.380> actually<00:01:42.740> caused<00:01:43.009> prior

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
basically there's actually caused prior

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.740 
basically there's actually caused prior
to<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.579> that<00:01:43.610> needs<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:43.939> be<00:01:44.000> dealt<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.450> so

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
to that that needs to be dealt with so

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.100 
to that that needs to be dealt with so
find<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.409> primary<00:01:45.680> cause<00:01:46.039> deal<00:01:46.310> with<00:01:46.490> that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
find the primary cause deal with that

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.990 
find the primary cause deal with that
maintain<00:01:48.110> nutrition<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.310> tissue<00:01:49.700> perfusion

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
maintain nutrition and tissue perfusion

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.380 
maintain nutrition and tissue perfusion
and<00:01:50.479> recovery<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.590> then<00:01:51.740> possible<00:01:52.310> as<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
and recovery is then possible as the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.620 
and recovery is then possible as the
body<00:01:53.570> works<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.829> organs<00:01:55.579> take<00:01:56.299> up<00:01:56.479> their

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
body works and the organs take up their

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.569 
body works and the organs take up their
normal<00:01:57.049> functions<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:58.130> you've<00:01:58.310> got<00:01:58.460> to

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
normal functions but you've got to

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.459 
normal functions but you've got to
address<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.969> primary<00:01:59.420> issue<00:01:59.630> maintain

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
address the primary issue maintain

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.109 
address the primary issue maintain
nutrition<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.100> tissue<00:02:01.280> perfusion<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.939> that

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
nutrition and tissue perfusion and that

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.749 
nutrition and tissue perfusion and that
becomes<00:02:02.359> possible<00:02:02.630> however<00:02:03.469> in<00:02:03.979> most<00:02:04.399> cases

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
becomes possible however in most cases
