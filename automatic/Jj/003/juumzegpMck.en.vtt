00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
different bits and pieces we think it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
different bits and pieces we think it's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
probably a Harley bodying frame it's got

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.910 
probably a Harley bodying frame it's got
a<00:01:52.409> Golding<00:01:52.920> wheel<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.500> pretty

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
a Golding wheel but all in all pretty

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
a Golding wheel but all in all pretty
cool<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.149> we're<00:01:57.299> trying<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> figure<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
cool you know we're trying to figure it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.649 
cool you know we're trying to figure it
out<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:59.040> exhaust<00:01:59.340> obviously<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.119> not<00:02:00.270> correct

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
out the exhaust obviously is not correct

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.929 
out the exhaust obviously is not correct
it<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:00.869> add<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> four<00:02:01.350> pipe<00:02:01.530> exhaust<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.820> on

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it would add a four pipe exhaust to on

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.350 
it would add a four pipe exhaust to on
the<00:02:03.030> left<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:05.700> pretty<00:02:06.090> neat

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the left to on the right but pretty neat

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
the left to on the right but pretty neat
all<00:02:06.570> together<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.439> think<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> make

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
all together we think it's going to make

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.580 
all together we think it's going to make
a<00:02:08.459> great<00:02:08.729> story<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.360> again<00:02:09.959> we're<00:02:10.170> using<00:02:10.200> this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
a great story and again we're using this

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.640
