00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 before we go back to that 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.250
 want to enter friborg game 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.870
 Yesterday we got our facebook and twitter 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.250
 asked community and there were a few 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.740
 Thank you very much 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.860
 this is lukas zimmermann 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 he asked how was the movie on 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.750
 sunday and which one do you have 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.640
 watched 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 He seems to have seen himself in the cinema 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.970
 yes that was right in the moderate 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.369
 spiderman 2 sunday evening im waren were very 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 interesting movie 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 Continuation of part one was complete 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.640
 Well done especially by the 3d 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.130
 effects very interesting and worthwhile 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.809
 to have a look 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.719
 then we have a twitter question 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 get from the little karine like 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.149
 are you satisfied with this season and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.760
 what do you expect from the next one? 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.989
 already mentioned success was seasonal 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.059
 a strange but we had heights 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.410
 and deep started very well 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 Well come in the season has yes 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.809
 slightly weaker phase just before the short 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.059
 before the winter break then with the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.680
 coach dismissal of mirko slomka with 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.640
 the new with the trainer change to part 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.210
 a whole new game from the basket 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.580
 training camp then very intense 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.890
 in turkey on the turn very much 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.110
 good start then again 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.790
 slightly weaker phase but now behind 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 we have got out together again 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.090
 have scored very good results 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.470
 scored and of course hope with one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.750
 won a positive on saturday 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.189
 to find a conclusion then also this 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.960
 positive vibrations from the last 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.990
 play with the new season 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.909
 and then a little calmer season 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 to play next year but so far 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.939
 I do not want to bring any ahead 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.790
 now it is still this first 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.500
 year to complete positive and then the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.140
 recharge battery and next year 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 France the next facebook question 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.700
 Targeted like a bit in the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.240
 Future of Kevin Riga asks one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 scolding 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.540
 because the phone in Copenhagen is a while 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 not mind re fun aside is 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.009
 these were incredible experiences 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.290
 were incredible evenings with the again 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.759
 The fans have experienced the whole thing together 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.619
 team still raves about today 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.240
 this great of this great 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.280
 atmosphere of these insane 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.160
 play that it's worth it on everyone 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.039
 if you look in the europe 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.409
 league 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.030
 Of course, for us this is the moment 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.609
 a little bit far away 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.900
 Nonetheless we want there 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.120
 At some point we want to go there again 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.560
 in the next few years yes and try 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 are the right way to go 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 evolve around these places again 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.840
 aim at sometime and try 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.189
 someday again on such a 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.549
 European competition 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.140
 can 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.970
 the last question it a bit 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.799
 away from the football and 2 de rossi 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.769
 pfeiffer has our stadium center he has 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.540
 also sent a question and 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.769
 although you still play guitar I knew 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.629
 that this question will come if he / she 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.540
 has sent in a bit at the moment 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.159
 So it's difficult to break though 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.510
 if the new round begins, a 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.129
 like to stop by and play the game 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.840
 hour and he can teach me 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.840
 I think he takes his foul
