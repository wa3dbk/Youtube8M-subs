back for the IPL have I was it over with
with<00:00:04.830> Pune<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.310> IPL

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
with Pune in the IPL

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.720 
with Pune in the IPL
yeah<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.410> was<00:00:07.529> okay<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.069> was<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.340> was<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> good

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
yeah it was okay it was it was a good

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.209 
yeah it was okay it was it was a good
experience<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.330> sure<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:10.130> obviously<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
experience for sure but obviously a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.820 
experience for sure but obviously a
little<00:00:11.400> bit<00:00:11.490> disappointing<00:00:12.710> results<00:00:13.710> with

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
little bit disappointing results with

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.530 
little bit disappointing results with
Pune<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.190> think<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.490> lost<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:14.849> 11<00:00:15.269> straight

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
Pune I think we lost about 11 straight

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.900 
Pune I think we lost about 11 straight
at<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> end<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.310> disappointing

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
at the end so a little bit disappointing

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.519 
at the end so a little bit disappointing
but<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.330> definitely<00:00:18.630> had<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> good<00:00:18.930> time<00:00:19.140> and

few things trying to get a few things
right<00:01:54.030> my<00:01:54.360> arms<00:01:54.390> open<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.320> lower

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
right my arms open a little bit lower

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160 
right my arms open a little bit lower
but<00:01:56.030> look<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.300> that<00:01:57.570> week<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:57.990> pretty

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
but look at that that week it was pretty

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.749 
but look at that that week it was pretty
conducive<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.920> day<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.550> when<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> got

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
conducive that day out and when I got

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.090 
conducive that day out and when I got
seventh<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:00.330> sixth<00:02:00.600> year<00:02:00.660> was<00:02:00.990> an<00:02:01.200> plenty<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
seventh or sixth year was an plenty of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.480 
seventh or sixth year was an plenty of
rough<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.520> turning<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> bit<00:02:03.660> so<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.350> guess<00:02:05.070> I've

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
rough and turning a bit so I guess I've

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
rough and turning a bit so I guess I've
just<00:02:05.910> got<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> work<00:02:06.300> on<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> little<00:02:06.600> bit<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:07.020> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just got to work on a little bit kind of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.870 
just got to work on a little bit kind of
consistency<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.399> wickets<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
consistency on the the wickets that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.199 
consistency on the the wickets that
aren't<00:02:09.119> offering<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.720> much<00:02:09.869> turns<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:11.209> yeah

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
aren't offering so much turns so yeah

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.729 
aren't offering so much turns so yeah
look<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:12.630> it's<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.350> just<00:02:13.440> about

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
look it's it's I think it's just about

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.170 
look it's it's I think it's just about
volume<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.310> trying<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> numbers<00:02:15.030> II

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
