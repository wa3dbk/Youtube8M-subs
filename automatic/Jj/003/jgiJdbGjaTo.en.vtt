00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 dear friends of cinema 4d love psd 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.940
 tutorials user welcome to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.840
 this training on the topic of idea finding 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.759
 cinema 4d and I modeling tell us times 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.770
 Immediately beforehand that there is no training for 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.270
 people who started pulling us 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.390
 we just for the couple days ago 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.760
 but you should already have a few 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 have modeling techniques on it 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.289
 this modeling will be the finished 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.730
 not exactly explained so now 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 yes, something does not happen in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.200
 I would like to thank you for this training 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.329
 Let's see what happens here and that is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.920
 I have to tell you honestly 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 knock yourself on the shoulder if you can 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.570
 that honestly does not do that is what something 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.489
 I myself have long missed one 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.489
 training where it comes to how to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.010
 Actually ideas are being implemented 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.469
 special cinema 4d where you everything 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 you have to think for yourself 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.520
 come on forms 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.109
 you have to think yourselves how 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.219
 these then form together into one another 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.199
 should connect like 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.840
 functionality is presented 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.339
 all these relatively abstract concepts 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.409
 I always want to be as vivid as 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 explain possible to show you then 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.030
 how to move from a first time to a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.939
 such skripal comes and from this 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.070
 then scribble to this model as well as 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.369
 Do you build something like how do you get on such 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.420
 Things like how to get these shapes and where 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.600
 you get them 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.119
 these are all the things what it is so 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.759
 But now start where you are 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.310
 maybe even relatively common 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.560
 that is something like that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.479
 Saturday afternoon you sit down 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.030
 little bit of computer because you have one 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.220
 idea exactly that's what happened to me 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.240
 optionally with a few months already 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.020
 here 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.939
 the idea was i got on a big one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 Vienna Airport was the airport 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.850
 I think one of the sun is such a one 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.030
 snow blower seen such a thing seen 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 what a great device 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.229
 incredible shape and you already saw it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.329
 that it is incredibly powerful 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.640
 and a runway probably in the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.500
 half an hour can clear such a thing 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.580
 I really wanted to build that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.290
 Of course not as you really do 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.330
 what it really looks like but it 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.739
 should be mixed with mine 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.450
 own fantasy that you know 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.220
 certainly there are these two 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.489
 possibilities basically in c for the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.860
 you either build a device an object 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.629
 exactly for references to her 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.180
 Do photos researched on the net and 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.269
 as far as it looks exactly like there 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.370
 or you let your fantasy take on forest 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.360
 So just your imagination and build 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.430
 point to an object and then there 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.780
 Of course it's still the mixed form that one 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.489
 says i want some references 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.470
 but also have a bit of fantasy 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.230
 bring in and there we are about 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.920
 Now in this model what you here 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.319
 on the other hand, of course, just looks 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.900
 that this one is really one 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.879
 you can do it first prototype 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.870
 I believe in that is something similar 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:06.010
 like the cockpit of a racing car 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.629
 formula 1 dare then you can see this here 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.280
 shovels you see wheels the same way 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.810
 good from any custom vehicle 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.790
 could and the thing fits behind and 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.769
 forward not quite together if 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.410
 it's time the second design to after 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.730
 which was then thought I must be there 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.769
 Do a little bit more 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.959
 ding is so not the needs 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.530
 More from demmin truck so now always at 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.810
 truck 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.340
 we have this futuristic glass dome 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.180
 and you can see four already 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.790
 Swing truck wheels already seen 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.790
 What could be more of a road vehicle? 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.260
 i will only be road car in the snow 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.579
 do not know which is probably 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.099
 not be so I have continued to build 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.019
 will we come back here on mine 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.060
 measure vehicle but this time will be so wide 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.190
 set up that one also with it 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.829
 to actually cultivate such terrain 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.389
 could and you see that she was as 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.319
 a form has come in here 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.769
 maybe already seen somewhere 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.629
 have that is the form of actually 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.549
 a combine now always at 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.319
 the first reference comes as normal 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.180
 here you can see the metric shape 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.190
 I can see quite well already and I am 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.829
 finally come to that one 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.980
 Crawler probably the ideal one 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.379
 means of transport for such in the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.599
 year I would say rather wild 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.510
 arctic landscape is on it goes 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.230
 to these ever elaborated 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.060
 model 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.770
 I would like to talk about that as well 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.330
 on such hydraulic things why 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.480
 you just build them here 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.190
 we will come to this one for this 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.780
 sight here you see but there is 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.300
 already a bit light set that 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.130
 we finally at the here 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.570
 First there is a big land 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.490
 light already set second, white 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.400
 the model has been completely worked out 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.640
 third is also still a coat is 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.690
 it has been painted with body paint 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.280
 parts 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.860
 So it's a lot with the thing 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.940
 happens and that's why this is supposed to be 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.930
 training how to go 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.510
 basically from there to there 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.640
 let's all start listening to most of them 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.500
 then one would say here about open 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.960
 say is great but I want to 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.480
 go all the way to the end and all 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.280
 produce something here about it 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.280
 to go this training
