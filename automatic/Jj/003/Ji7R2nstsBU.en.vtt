00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
right now my guess is we're gonna fight

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.480 
right now my guess is we're gonna fight
a<00:02:25.959> walker<00:02:26.230> at<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> end<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.950> strike<00:02:27.250> I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
a walker at the end of the strike I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.550 
a walker at the end of the strike I
personally<00:02:28.270> take<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.630> Walker's<00:02:29.020> is<00:02:29.290> one<00:02:29.470> of

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
personally take that Walker's is one of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.470 
personally take that Walker's is one of
the<00:02:29.680> better<00:02:29.860> bosses<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.520> game<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:31.209> reason

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
the better bosses in the game the reason

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.120 
the better bosses in the game the reason
for<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.740> bit<00:02:32.890> more

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
for that is because it's a bit more

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.770 
for that is because it's a bit more
zelda<00:02:33.550> like<00:02:33.819> where<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.600> shoot<00:02:34.720> him
