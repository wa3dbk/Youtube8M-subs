00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.050 
surprisingly enough a couple people here
on<00:03:27.989> YouTube<00:03:28.319> actually<00:03:28.709> played<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.069> game<00:03:29.250> they

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
on YouTube actually played the game they

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.430 
on YouTube actually played the game they
said<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.269> was<00:03:30.299> pretty<00:03:30.540> buggy<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.319> was

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
said it was pretty buggy but this was

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.890 
said it was pretty buggy but this was
just<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.620> demo<00:03:31.889> now<00:03:32.400> apparently<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.329> game<00:03:33.599> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
just the demo now apparently the game is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.920 
just the demo now apparently the game is
really<00:03:34.739> not<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.160> buggy<00:03:35.489> at<00:03:35.609> all<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.180> I'm

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
really not that buggy at all so I'm

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.300 
really not that buggy at all so I'm
gonna<00:03:37.049> have<00:03:37.169> to<00:03:37.260> see<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.530> for<00:03:37.620> myself<00:03:37.739> I'll

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
gonna have to see that for myself I'll

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.890 
gonna have to see that for myself I'll
probably<00:03:38.639> be<00:03:38.849> doing<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.120> review<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.630> not

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
probably be doing a review for this not

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.500 
probably be doing a review for this not
gameplay<00:03:40.440> because<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:40.919> going<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.069> be

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
gameplay because it's just going to be

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.670 
gameplay because it's just going to be
we're<00:03:42.510> not<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> walkthrough<00:03:43.200> sorry<00:03:43.440> because

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
we're not a walkthrough sorry because

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.979 
we're not a walkthrough sorry because
it's<00:03:43.980> gonna<00:03:44.069> be<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.669> hard<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:45.299> do<00:03:45.660> such<00:03:45.870> a

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
it's gonna be really hard to do such a

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.440 
it's gonna be really hard to do such a
huge<00:03:46.950> walkthrough<00:03:47.430> for<00:03:47.579> such<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> huge<00:03:48.180> game

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
huge walkthrough for such a huge game

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.110 
huge walkthrough for such a huge game
but<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.319> will<00:03:49.769> probably<00:03:50.340> do<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.519> walk-through

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
but I will probably do a walk-through

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.330 
but I will probably do a walk-through
for<00:03:51.150> jak<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.660> daxter<00:03:51.930> HD<00:03:52.260> collection<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:53.280> you
