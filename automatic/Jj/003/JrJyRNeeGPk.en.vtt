00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can see that then the case attaches

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
you can see that then the case attaches
to<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> shell<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.490> back<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630

lot<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> flex<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:14.130> case<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
lot of flex in this case and a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.390 
lot of flex in this case and a
manipulation<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:16.470> we're<00:01:16.590> gonna<00:01:16.710> bring<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.009> z2

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
manipulation now we're gonna bring a z2

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.760 
manipulation now we're gonna bring a z2
tablet<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.619> could

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
tablet in here and you can see we could

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.560 
tablet in here and you can see we could
just<00:01:19.890> pop<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> clips<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.799> place

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
just pop this in and it clips in place

into those four little corner grips and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
into those four little corner grips and
then<00:01:29.310> there<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> case<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.540> let's<00:01:30.720> actually

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
then there is the case so let's actually

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.640 
then there is the case so let's actually
close<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.020> tablet<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
close it up so with the tablet in the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
close it up so with the tablet in the
case<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.360> got<00:01:36.479> access<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:38.659> most

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
case you can see you got access to most

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.969 
case you can see you got access to most
sides<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> device<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> power

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
sides of the device so you got the power

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
sides of the device so you got the power
and<00:01:44.040> volume<00:01:44.340> case<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.390> things<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and volume case but things like the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.719 
and volume case but things like the
magnetic<00:01:46.470> charging<00:01:46.860> pins<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.280> covered<00:01:47.610> by

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
magnetic charging pins are covered by

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.819 
magnetic charging pins are covered by
the<00:01:47.790> spine<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> case<00:01:48.630> turn<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> over

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the spine of the case turn it over

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
the spine of the case turn it over
you've<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.579> cutout<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> camera<00:01:51.299> there

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you've got a cutout for the camera there

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.280 
you've got a cutout for the camera there
and<00:01:52.490> here<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> where<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.420> case<00:01:54.689> sort<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.990> joins

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and here is where the case sort of joins

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.319 
and here is where the case sort of joins
that<00:01:55.590> plastic<00:01:56.189> inner<00:01:56.790> shell<00:01:57.290> now<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.500> undo

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
that plastic inner shell now if we undo

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.510 
that plastic inner shell now if we undo
the<00:02:00.329> magnetic<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> top<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.590> open<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the magnetic way at the top and open the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.240 
the magnetic way at the top and open the
case<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:03.030> you'll<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> device

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
case up you'll see the device

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.800 
case up you'll see the device
automatically<00:02:05.250> powers<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> screen<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
automatically powers the screen on and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
out sort of three main positions one two

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.699 
out sort of three main positions one two
and<00:02:35.280> three<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.420> get<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.810> at<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.989> ideal<00:02:37.290> viewing
