00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
wasn't very good forward so I found my

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
wasn't very good forward so I found my
place<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.310> team<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> net<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
place like on the team and the net and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
and then it kind of just run from when

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.960 
and then it kind of just run from when
from<00:00:41.399> their<00:00:45.980> very<00:00:46.980> first<00:00:47.190> start<00:00:47.460> playing<00:00:47.550> the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.870 
but that's the foundation for everything
is<00:01:59.590> your<00:01:59.830> footwork<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.490> your<00:02:00.610> skating

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
is your footwork and your skating

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.830 
is your footwork and your skating
ability<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:02.530> know<00:02:02.650> it's<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.479> big<00:02:04.479> part<00:02:04.780> of

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
ability and you know it's a big part of

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.480 
ability and you know it's a big part of
the<00:02:04.930> game<00:02:05.140> especially<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:06.070> don't<00:02:06.220> forgot

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the game especially you don't forgot

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.490 
the game especially you don't forgot
like<00:02:06.640> me<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.970> also<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:07.900> woke<00:02:08.080> up<00:02:08.170> one<00:02:08.320> day<00:02:08.380> I

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
like me you also and I woke up one day I

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.200 
like me you also and I woke up one day I
was<00:02:08.740> six<00:02:08.950> foot<00:02:09.100> six<00:02:09.340> like<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.790> had<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.060> work

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
was six foot six like I had to work

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.690 
was six foot six like I had to work
really<00:02:10.240> hard<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.770> get<00:02:11.770> my<00:02:11.950> coordination<00:02:12.370> my

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
really hard to get my coordination my

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.090 
really hard to get my coordination my
skating<00:02:13.000> back<00:02:13.270> together<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> think

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
skating back together and so I think

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.880 
skating back together and so I think
that's<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.690> pretty<00:02:16.690> massive<00:02:16.959> part<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
that's a pretty massive part that I

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.770 
that's a pretty massive part that I
wouldn't<00:02:18.459> say<00:02:18.520> gets<00:02:18.730> overlooked<00:02:19.270> but<00:02:19.630> it's

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
wouldn't say gets overlooked but it's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.350 
wouldn't say gets overlooked but it's
not<00:02:19.990> as<00:02:20.260> much<00:02:20.620> fun<00:02:20.920> I'd<00:02:21.340> say<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:22.150> got<00:02:22.270> to
