00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi all guys i'm francesco di 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.009
 world apple welcome to this new 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.919
 video 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.210
 today I will show you I will present the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.519
 video review of the goals for 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.519
 the iphone fish eye macro e 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:28.180
 sorry god wide angle I had forgotten 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:33.820
 ok first i wanted to tell you what they were 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:35.320
 the costs more or less co2 fish eye one 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.930
 white and one black 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:44.620
 I took this from the min in the site 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 box and I paid about 11 euros while 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:54.070
 the white fish eye and the lean and the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.000
 I took them with a wide-angle kit on and 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.309
 bay paying them only 6 euros 80 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.620
 obviously however between the white one and 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:09.940
 the black one there is a noticeable difference 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:13.800
 quality then black from the site 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:18.270
 meaning box which is a Chinese site is 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.270
 the only problem is that the stuff 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.530
 the goods arrive after a month but have 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.720
 put a month two or three days more or less 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.340
 while these these two are me 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:34.750
 arrived after about five six days 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.170
 ok i apologize first for the quality 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.659
 of the video but unfortunately I usually use it 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.159
 the iphone to make videos in hd only that 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.420
 right now I'm using it for 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.390
 show you how to use these 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.659
 all three objectives have arrived to me 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.890
 home with this bus this sachet 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.270
 within which there were 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.700
 obviously the objectives and then 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.100
 this other bag with instructions 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.430
 and these little rings because 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.150
 le to attach the targets to the back 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.370
 iPhone's 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.620
 these must be attached first to the cleats 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.970
 which will then act as a magnet between 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.880
 the goal is the iphone in fact you see me 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.750
 I've already attacked it isn't too much 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.600
 ugly, however, it can also be 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.730
 putting a soprano mask does not create 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.000
 so much really very thin thickness 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.560
 ok so we can take them away 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.020
 I will first see the fish eye 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.560
 white innanzitut 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.250
 first all the objectives are 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.890
 equipped with protective cover and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:03.150
 this magnetized string that will come later 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.360
 attached to the lens ok so 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:14.520
 we raise the fish eye cover 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:19.440
 let's go and place it here, we don't 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:26.240
 ok well you see also very nice me 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:32.660
 really like let's take a picture 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:36.780
 and as you can see there is this effect 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.700
 round, let's say in Italian 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.150
 fish eye 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.470
 now I will take a picture of this for example 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.260
 more but the first thing I found 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.829
 here it is 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:59.799
 you see that the effect is very different 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.500
 from the normal camera 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.420
 I can then go to raise him and try 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.420
 the black fish eye 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.930
 and even better for the black iPhone 5 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:21.440
 anyway because it matches me better 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.680
 like more then let's go for a 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.680
 photography 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.370
 you see that the photo is much larger 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.760
 the fish eye circle is larger than the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:45.220
 quality is even better 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.220
 ok now we can move on to 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:53.330
 wide angle that is this here 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.760
 in practice this objective is formed by 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.940
 two components that are wide angle 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.740
 the skinny to be used on 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.320
 wide angle must be entrusted to 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:11.810
 macro while the skinny to use it 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.790
 we must unscrew and see that we have 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.050
 this other goal which I will then make you 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.850
 see later how it works for 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.980
 show you the real features of the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:29.450
 I will then take a wide-angle picture first 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:36.320
 at first a photo without the without 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:42.680
 the goal is more or less the distance 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:48.820
 now one with the goal we go to 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:53.980
 review you see that here the wide angle 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:57.040
 generates a sort of zoom ie generates a 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.280
 higher angle of view you see 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.900
 compared to the previous photo as more 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:09.250
 the angle and more is greater 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.340
 now we'll try the skinny excuse every 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:15.430
 so a little flawed this here because 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.680
 the calamity comes off 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.640
 I'll have to lock it later with some 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.920
 the thin one sincerely is what 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.920
 I prefer more it is the more the more beautiful 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:38.020
 you see that nothing is seen here yes 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.760
 sees everything vented with the skinny and that the 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.040
 thin, it serves precisely to take photos 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.070
 from a close distance approached 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.440
 without however compromising the 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.530
 image resolution you see ad 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:56.440
 example work but now I put it 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:58.920
 by and watch a moment made their 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.920
 very well 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.600
 ok so you can see that we can do some 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.600
 photo from a distance really 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.140
 close while we take off 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:23.940
 the goal and we are going to do it from 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:28.340
 same distance I've done two see 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.340
 that the resolution is really bad 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.570
 ok guys then let me see 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:43.560
 all three goals for what 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:45.660
 they are still very good and to me 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.690
 therefore they like very much how they are made 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.370
 even put them behind the phone a lot 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.740
 beautiful 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:55.670
 so for today it's all I hope the 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.900
 video you enjoyed I recommend
