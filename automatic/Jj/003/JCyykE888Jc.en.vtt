00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.400
 no no 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
 you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.690
 hi how about youtube people in this 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.690
 I will show you how to do 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.220
 maintenance or cleaning to a laptop or 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.380
 notebook as you want to say you 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.779
 to improve its performance since 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.900
 when they are dirty they do not work 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.109
 better let's say good first of all 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.499
 they need to have the laptop on this side 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.499
 Of course 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.770
 as you can see and a brush so that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.890
 can clean them in addition to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.880
 screwdrivers to get to the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.250
 fan that is here 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.910
 before starting to disarm the pce 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.580
 they need small screwdrivers 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.440
 but a relationship does not have to have 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.600
 magnets on their tips because they can burn 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.790
 the components of our pc in addition 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.100
 they should get rid of all the static that 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.600
 have besides the woolen clothes touching 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.610
 irons simply get rid of the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.580
 static woolen clothes are removed because 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.430
 if you can not burn the motherboard of the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.410
 laptop then there would not work anymore 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.570
 more now we will start taking out the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.990
 screws to get towards what 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.820
 we want to see 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.090
 once they have removed all the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.000
 screws here and they can remove the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 cover in this case of this laptop we have 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.780
 here the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.420
 heat sink where goes the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.060
 processor here the ram and the disk ends 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.260
 hard which we do not need to take out 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 we just need to take a 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.590
 cleaning what is the fan of the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.049
 heatsink 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.329
 and a little to the motherboard with all its 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.090
 parts so it does not get hot so 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.070
 easily and change a little bit the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.450
 thermal paste of the processor to not 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.750
 have temperature problems 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.020
 well I will return when I have the heatsink 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.490
 taken out good here as you can see I've already 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.079
 removed the fan 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.950
 and you can see that it is very dirty and here in 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.500
 the slit of the heatsink has many 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.700
 lint is very dirty well here I want 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.849
 that you look at these screws that are 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.180
 where does the processor go? 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.880
 numbers with in order of screws per 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.519
 example this is the 1 2 3 and 4 have to 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.890
 Take it out in that order because if you can not 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.170
 go crooked or do not know what problem can 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.600
 have good I'll be back when I have this 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.430
 taken out to show you how you are once 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.319
 removed the heatsink can see that here 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.959
 we have the crack that is quite 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.560
 dirty is not even seen for the other 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.510
 side 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.480
 is quite dirty hero puch has 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.180
 several years of use and had not been done 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.130
 a maintenance never before good we leave 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.470
 this here and we can see that here 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.569
 we have the processor with the card 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.019
 graphic good now we just take 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.459
 our brush and we start to clean 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.190
 I'll come back when I'll have when I have 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.810
 all ready and show the differences 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.610
 well here you can see we have the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.580
 clean slit can be seen for the other 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.040
 side without any fluff because we have 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.230
 everything clean here we can also see 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.200
 we have passed the brush and a 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.790
 heap of land as well see ya 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.730
 we have 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.950
 extract or the clean fan came out 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.719
 a lot of dust from here what they should always 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.780
 remember is that they must clean very well 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:34.370
 this artifact with a clarification if 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.379
 they have an air compressor where with the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.490
 that can with which they can throw air 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.520
 to this way 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.250
 you can do it but there is a condition if 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.440
 they have all this connected since there is no 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.550
 need to take out all the parts to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.340
 clean with the compressor since 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.810
 only the force of the air removes them 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.380
 I recommend that when you have the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.110
 put fan put something for 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.600
 lock it and then you throw the air with 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.880
 the compressor because this when moving 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.160
 generates an electric current which 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.310
 goes to the motherboard and can burn it 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.730
 for now we will put together the pce and 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.190
 that we have everything clean because we have 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.890
 pulled a lot of dirt and that's it 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.130
 well with these simple steps can 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.880
 get to have your computer like new 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.210
 and start occupying it more quickly 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.030
 good and its performances and would be improving 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.560
 as it were to say so good that has been 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.090
 I hope everything has served you this 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.400
 information 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.400
 See you in other video tutorials
