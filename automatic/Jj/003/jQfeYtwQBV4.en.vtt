00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.719
 Hi, I'm Sunday and from your workshop 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.369
 DIY a while ago I made 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.080
 a donkey trestle regular height in 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.240
 what we are seeing and in image now 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.310
 same as starting from this base we are going 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.349
 to also make the same donkey and 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.029
 regular in height or easel but 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.260
 adding a roller there we can 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.910
 observe a roller that has taken advantage 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.710
 a treadmill of running that 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.570
 recycling 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.010
 in this way making a stay 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.320
 donkey or trestle height good with 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.120
 roller we can easily manipulate and 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.120
 Comfortable boards slats 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.470
 square wood of aluminum iron 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.269
 etcetera of any material that 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.390
 let's go to work with him as per 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.820
 example for cutting drilling sanding 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.700
 etcetera and to fasten roller to 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.050
 the donkey will use two pieces of plate 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.450
 worth the length of the plates will be 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.000
 about 9 centimeters and has taken this 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.610
 measured according to the diameter of the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.920
 roller that is 6 centimeters for and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.900
 I'm marking two centimeters of one of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.640
 the sides to make the hole for 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.060
 keep the scion or the past of the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.060
 roller 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.840
 we begin to take the mark made 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.490
 previously and that was 2 centimeters 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 from the side and in the center of the waistband 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.620
 with a drill we start from lowest to highest 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.990
 until you reach a bit is two and 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.729
 half 13 millimeters 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.890
 since in this case on the rod that 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.110
 I'm going to use the rod or the rod has 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.259
 12 with which is to give them a bit of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.470
 clearance below and using 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.240
 grinder or radio there is a review disc 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.030
 we will eliminate the sales generated by 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.570
 both the cut and the drill 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.050
 accomplished 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.420
 we present the plate on the side of 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.970
 the stand of the donkey regular trestle 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.380
 in height and we let it go with a year in 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.060
 this case held him with one another 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.729
 cuadradillo had nothing else what 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.300
 we put square and how are we with the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.850
 process of letting go will come out 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.370
 well this is not a professional letting go 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.410
 moves the welding is not very good I have 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.270
 with the concepts of how to weld 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.510
 in order because my father was a soldier 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.670
 professional and I helped him many times and I know 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.770
 how they are released what I lack is the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.209
 practical practice and that is achieved 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.420
 releasing soldering soldering and in it 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.420
 we're 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 before continuing to solder for case that 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.879
 I was wrong 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.720
 with powder as presented by the other stage 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.560
 on the side 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.910
 and I see if I go well or not to weld 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.010
 another piece of waistband 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.620
 whenever it finished 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.690
 we finish soldering we remove the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.020
 slag generated by welding with a 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.780
 small hammer and wire is asked 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.190
 and already afterwards once we have 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.040
 removed the scum would already place the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.110
 roller in the support that we have welded 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.930
 recently but we can see 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.620
 to see how the subject goes 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.569
 and it seems that it is not bad 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.569
 it works that what interests 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.739
 it's worth par and finishing we apply funds 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.079
 for iron and then 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.180
 We wait for the indicated drying time 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.950
 by the manufacturer and then I paint 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.319
 I think that the color we want 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.840
 In my case, I usually paint it in the background and 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.519
 I'm left with that color for lack of 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.280
 time as a work tool 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.170
 Well, I do not care that it looks nice, it's not 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.439
 really work with which with the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.280
 color that brings the background the painting of 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.280
 background I stay 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.890
 We wait for the time indicated by the 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.170
 manufacturer for total drying and a 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.650
 Once it is dry we are ready 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.219
 to ride it and start enjoying it to 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.219
 use it 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.870
 the construction is not complicated but 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.090
 obviously we should have 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.400
 welding knowledge that is 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.910
 minimum as 1000 and cuts 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.830
 materials left in order 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.600
 if you find interesting what I do 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.890
 like to like and share the 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.670
 video for other people that can me 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.130
 enjoy it and subscribe to the channel to 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.160
 so you can receive any other 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.320
 new video that makes you know and 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.870
 you can see them and as long as you want 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.370
 Of course it's also worth it if you have any 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.710
 comment that do so feel free to 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.340
 comment a greeting and until the next 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.340
 draft
