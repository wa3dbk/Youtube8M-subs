to make up one yourself

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:26.670 
to make up one yourself
is<00:02:21.189> quite<00:02:22.030> easy<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.390> do<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.810> also<00:02:26.109> when<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
is quite easy to do and also when the

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
toss new hold on the end of it and that

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.289 
toss new hold on the end of it and that
should<00:03:20.500> be<00:03:20.590> pretty<00:03:20.829> accurate<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.519> but

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
should be pretty accurate you know but

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.360 
should be pretty accurate you know but
if<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.870> want<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.109> get<00:03:23.229> any<00:03:23.530> real<00:03:23.739> distance<00:03:24.250> on

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
and you almost want to loop that in and

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.740 
and you almost want to loop that in and
give<00:03:26.290> them<00:03:26.379> a<00:03:26.439> good<00:03:26.590> swing<00:03:26.919> you<00:03:27.099> know<00:03:27.220> but

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
give them a good swing you know but

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.149 
give them a good swing you know but
anyway<00:03:28.750> done<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.959> real<00:03:29.139> nice<00:03:29.319> job<00:03:29.590> button<00:03:29.859> and

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
anyway done a real nice job button and

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.210 
anyway done a real nice job button and
he<00:03:30.280> got<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.599> little<00:03:31.599> spiral<00:03:32.349> burn<00:03:32.829> in<00:03:33.069> and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
he got a little spiral burn in and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.000 
he got a little spiral burn in and
they're<00:03:33.489> going<00:03:34.060> around<00:03:34.239> Reed<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.829> looks

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
they're going around Reed so it looks

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.969 
they're going around Reed so it looks
really<00:03:36.280> nice<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.939> that<00:03:37.359> hopefully<00:03:37.750> Ola<00:03:38.109> did

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
really nice and that hopefully Ola did

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:43.740 
really nice and that hopefully Ola did
use<00:03:39.189> this<00:03:39.400> one<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.729> file<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:42.629> something<00:03:43.629> else

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
use this one the file and something else

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.390 
use this one the file and something else
that<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.989> won<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.259> show<00:03:44.470> for<00:03:44.709> quite<00:03:44.799> some<00:03:45.099> time

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
that I won the show for quite some time

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.839 
that I won the show for quite some time
is<00:03:45.639> I<00:03:45.819> had<00:03:46.079> these<00:03:47.079> fish<00:03:47.650> stringers<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.579> lucky

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
is I had these fish stringers the lucky

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.339 
is I had these fish stringers the lucky
seven<00:03:49.209> from<00:03:49.500> Jim<00:03:50.500> River<00:03:50.739> gear<00:03:51.159> and<00:03:52.049> he<00:03:53.049> sent<00:03:53.319> me

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
seven from Jim River gear and he sent me

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.770 
seven from Jim River gear and he sent me
to<00:03:53.439> there<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:54.129> I<00:03:54.489> think<00:03:55.060> each<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.209> these<00:03:55.449> is<00:03:55.750> a

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
to there and I think each of these is a

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.860 
to there and I think each of these is a
whole<00:03:56.349> seven<00:03:56.709> fish<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.759> think<00:03:58.599> the<00:03:58.659> clip

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
whole seven fish and I think the clip

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.860 
whole seven fish and I think the clip
sound<00:03:59.079> was<00:03:59.319> really<00:03:59.439> strong<00:03:59.949> I<00:03:59.979> made<00:04:00.569> very<00:04:01.569> well

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
sound was really strong I made very well
