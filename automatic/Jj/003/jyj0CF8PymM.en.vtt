00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.210
 after the last seasons on the left 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.850
 or right outside position convinced 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.560
 Thank you Marcus in the center for 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.870
 many not surprisingly for markus 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.730
 long myself yes what you maybe 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.590
 the public that he always has 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.900
 on the button in the middle only the one 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.000
 other trainer has me on the side 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.680
 seen and the modern accepted 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.570
 tomorrow and there will be the page 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.550
 to play in but here was at 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.960
 peter stÃ¶ger already with him on discussions 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.540
 led and it was from both sides 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.620
 Similarly, we have to close the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.380
 opinion that in the middle best 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.310
 Thank God I am looking forward to the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.320
 pc as well as in the middle between 86 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.730
 68 we saw that andi positions were us 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.190
 absolutely most comfortable feels like one 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.559
 You always have to put players where they are 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.220
 Feels good and I have with marco 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.440
 spoken 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.070
 he probably feels a central 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.630
 midfield due to the failure of it 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.850
 we do not have many alternatives 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.300
 marco works for these positions 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.109
 perfect whole preparation would have been 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.880
 deserves to play from the beginning 

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.069
 hit against everton twice now 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.229
 has hit in the cup and 20 minutes 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:14.749
 Today neither has much stability today 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.340
 brought to play is a player of 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:18.170
 in all four positions midfield 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.219
 Can be used and valuable for mesh 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.590
 The microphone then striker then prefer 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.299
 but it is so that they storm in as 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.049
 hanging lace come afterwards 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.829
 Central plays off and on the side 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.719
 Although it is comparatively very much of 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.549
 Substance proved that he now of it 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.749
 because of the logic of the bastian 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.060
 schweinsteiger but no one left 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.369
 the side and now plays with behind 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.749
 that perfect too that every one of mine 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.399
 view synonymous with the quality that is 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.840
 of course you have to be so realistic 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.779
 its just because the parallel from the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.909
 from werdegang of which he his victory 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.219
 more on the next few years for sure 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.810
 between 68 and see a player like that 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.189
 everyone will train and work 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.020
 from the first day until today 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.429
 that is excellent and i hope that 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.259
 he will still be my team in the future 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.880
 Of course, the form can help a lot 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.740
 well, if that is always the case, you can 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.150
 Not to say anyway but I am the one 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.990
 opinion that you yourself but also that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.180
 is also that I am on the position 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.480
 ensure best help the team 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.480
 can
